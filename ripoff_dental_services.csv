 Smiles on Broadway ,"  Smiles on Broadway  116 Broadway 
Malverne, Select State/Province USA ",http://www.smilesonbroadway.com, 516) 599-0883 ,""," To anyone thinking to get cosmetic dental work done, specifically veneers, please do yourself a favor and stay away from Dr. Steven Katz of Smiles on Broadway, Malverne, NY.    I went to him thinking that I will receive a beautiful smile, instead, I received work that is substandard. Veneers that look bulky, fake and uncomfortable. He is a very smooth talker, he is a motivational speaker, that's what he does in addition to his dental practice but he certainly is the worst cosmetic dentist.    I am finding myself smiling less in order to cover the teeth as they look very fake and esthetically it is not the outcome that I wanted. He made a bridge which is very bulky, uncomfortable, and it certainly looks fake. The veneers are misaligned, one bulkier than the other and the gum between the two front veneers is not growing back and this is due to an error by him for not placing the contact in the right place. If I smile and in pictures, it looks as if there is a cavity in the front. After a few months of getting the veneers, I am still having difficulties pronouncing the f sounds. I went to him with the complaints, and he told me that it is all in my head, that he has presented the case to a few dentists and they think the work he performed was beautiful and he failed to do anything to improve my smile or do anything to make the veneers more comfortable. For the f sounds, he stated that it is all in my head.    He never took any pictures from different angles of the original teeth, mouth, face, which is what a truly qualified Cosmetic Dentist does. And the temporaries that he made, not only looked bulky and uncomfortable, but he placed three different colors, because he did not have the right colors in his office lab. He never informed that he could not match the color of the rest of my teeth and I was forced to stay with these temporary, multi colored teeth for three weeks. That should have been a red flag to me.    I informed him that I will go for a second opinion because I cannot live with these veneers, they are comfortable and very fake. My family and friends have all told me that they look like dentures.   He pointed me to go to a dentist that he is close friends with, which I said no.    I went to a consultation for a second opinion with a an accredited member of the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, which requires extensive experience, examinations and presentations of five cosmetic cases to the board in order to be certified, as opposed to a general member, where you only pay fees to participate.This dentist has excellent credentials in Cosmetic dentistry. From his visit with him, I gathered that he has seen worst cosmetic cases than mine, but he has seen a lot better and esthetically, my case is a failure and the work is substandard. Substandard work, esthetically and functionally, is a constant reminder every time I attempt to smile and talk and is something that I am not willing to live with when it affects my emotional well-being and my professional career.    I went to him presenting myself as someone who is looking to get a natural beautiful smile. I stressed many times that I do not want my smile to look fake and he promised to deliver a natural, beautiful smile. However, the opposite holds true. I am extremely unhappy and once I save the money needed to go to another dentist who is qualifed, I will undergo the necessary cosmetic work required to receive a truly natural, beautiful smile that is above substandard and that would make me happy to smile again.   Dr. Katz, not only did not offer to redo the work (which I will never trust him again to do) but he refused to pay back anything. I paid over $8,000 to him to get myself an ugly, fake, denture-like smile. As a matter of fact, he called the dentist that I went to (who agreed to take my case and redo the work and gave me an estimate, an appointment to get x-rays, pictures and also see a periodontist) and complained about me. When Dr. Katz called me, he stated that he had called the dentist and he will not do any work on me. When I confronted him to get on a three-way conference call with the dentist, he refused. That is the type of Dentist Dr. Katz is, a mediocre, a liar and unqualified to live up to his promises.    If you never want to smile again, than Dr. Katz is the best for you. If you want to have a beautiful smile, please, please stay away from him and find another qualified dentist.  ",  Dental Services

At long last (almost a year)  I ended up at the local Family Health Center since I was now out of money to pay for dental services.  They removed the TOOTH that was errupting through my gum.  This tooth although shaved down to 1/3 of its size still had a nerve attatched!! Imagine my surprise when my neighbor and I were talking and it was discovered that she had been through the very same thing with the same dentist!!  I went through quite a bit of unnecessary pain thanks to this Dr. Gaball and his practice of leaving something in my gums in order to assure I would come there to get my dentures made.  Because my neighbor had the same thing happen it worries me that many folks will be sucked into his money making machine and endure more sufferering than they need to endure.  ",  Dental Services

When I called them about this, they said yes, that is true, if she had not said anything about her tooth hurting, the appointment would have been free and that during the appointment she could have told them her tooth hurt and it still would not have cost her anything unless they had proceeded with the filling that day. Before she left, they told her she had to pay for the appointments regardless of the fact that she had 2 insurances.  BCBS and a separate dental insurance.  When I called them, they said they would bill the BCBS but not the other insurance.  If I had a secondary insurance it would be my responsibility to get reimbursed from them. I ended up having to pay 153.00 of my money because my daughter was working part-time and could not pay her regular bills.  They did bill BCBS and I also sent the bill to my secondary insurance.  Based on my insurance statement, I was not supposed to have paid anything.  Between the two insurances, my statement said that my daughter owed nothing.  I called the 1st Choice and told them this.  They argued about the amount of the overpayment and said that once they had reviewed it, they would send the overpayment back to me.  I called the insurance company and they told me, that yes, the EOB was correct and that I should not have had to make any payment to them.   Funny, while they should be sending me a check for $153,00, I have yet to receive one penny from them.

At first I read all these glowing reviews online how nice and wonderful he is. Well I saw him, and every time I even wanted a cavity filled he wanted to upsell me a crown. Just about anything I wanted done, his solution was an expensive crown. He would always come up with good reasons why he couldn't just do it with filling...it was always his professional opinion that I need to spend thousands of dollars on a tooth. I also found his billing, even with dental insurance to be through the roof. I don't ever recall having a dentist as expensive or upsell as this guy. I am suspicious a lot of his reviews are from within his own office or people that just started attending his office. Go see for yourself if you don't believe me. I am seeing a new dentist in Nanaimo...if a tooth just needs filling, he will do it and costs me so much less. Look at all those pictures in his office too of all the trips his staff and him go on, who do you think is paying for them to have that nice lifestyle? You are! I am suspicious after personally dealing with this Dentist and having him take my hard earned money from me, that he is lying to patients, and he is negligent if providing a fair level of care to all patients, across the board. I understand he considers himself and expert in implants, but for crying out loud, does every patient, even the poor ones have to pay through the nose for something that could have been fixed for less. Dr. Wolanski, read this very clear....I am suspicious you are a con artist, karma will catch up. I pray that one day you get nailed on a hidden camera investigation. His staff also try to continue to upsell you, after you pay for his services they are already trying to book an appointment for a cleaning. You ask why when you just paid all this money, they say that Wolanski recommended it. Well I did his cleanings, I am suspicious the staff are using hard bits or something on their drills because every time I had it done, new cavities appeared where none were before....what I am suspicious of is if someone tooth is already loosing its layers, with age, is it helping drilling the hell out of it over and over, twice a year or more as he recommends. I am suspicious this is all more part of his scam. Hold onto your wallet...go get a second opnion.  Even though he is acting as an expert, at the end of the day he wants your money.

The dentist first told my wife that her co-pay with deep cleaning was $1900. She told them she didn't want the deep cleaning, and just to do the crowns. They told her she has to have the deep cleaning, since that was the dentists orders. She told them she isn't doing it at all, and how much is it for just two crowns. They told her $800.

We cannot find one single dentist who will stick to the HMO plan, and keep getting the runaround with every dentist, telling us that they don't do that work listed on the co-pay sheet, and we need to get special work done, or some other BS unethical crap.  How is it that EVERY SINGLE DENTIST on the list is a crooked, money-grubbing ripoff? TOTALLY UNETHICAL.  We would just have them do the work and take them to small claims, but they won't do the work approved by our nsurance. Yes, our problem is with both the dentists themselves, but the insurance will not stop their relationship with the crooked dentists. The insurance is making money because the dentists won't do the big work, and the dentists are making money because they get paid very well for preventative care, like cleanings, x-rays, fillings, etc. It's totally worth it to the dentists to have these HMO patients, because most of them will just pay cash to get the major work done.  I'm so sick of insurance companies promising something that they don't give.

Jericho, New York USA ",www.briteexpress.com, 877.817.3200,""," Brite Express seems to be a modest-size dental supply company on Long Island that sells various equipment to the dental trade, and also, strangely enough, college textbooks!   I had a terrible experience with the company in the first week of September 2014 with a textbook purchase that I made from them, based on their eBay listing for a linguistics book in ""Like New"" condition.  Inasmuch as the dental supply business is one that requires a very high adherence to standards of cleanliness and technical accuracy, I fear that anyone who buys dental equipment from Brite Express could well end up with an issue as bad as the issue that I had with the book that they sold me--but, worse yet, that a future issue might compromise someone's health!When the book arrived (terribly packed, by the way) it was obvious that the book was not ""Like New"" according to eBay's published standards, which states, """"A book that looks new but has been read. [continued below]....
									
										..... Cover has no visible wear, and the dust jacket (if applicable) is included for hard covers. No missing or damaged pages, no creases or tears, and no underlining/highlighting of text or writing in the margins. May have very minimal identifying marks on the inside cover. Very minimal wear and tear...""  Indeed, the book has ink writing on more than one page, plus ink blotches on the back cover, plus a damaged back cover (which maybe was damaged in transit by the poor packing). I emailed the company to express my concerns (especially in light of their ""no return"" policy); they asked me to send photos, which I did; they then denied receiving the photos; so I sent the photos  again (three emails, each with one photo)-- and at that point they cut off communication, not answering any more of my emails.  I got lucky (I suppose) that when I then called the company I got to speak (WHAT A TREAT!) with the very same person, Ms. Christine Rice, the CEO of the company (according to NYState records in Albany), with whom I had all previous email communication.  The phone call started off poorly and ended up even worse.  Clearly Ms. Rice was exasperated that her ignoring my last emails had not made me disappear from her life, and she proceeded to insinuate that I must have been pretty stupid to have bought a book used when the price of the same book, new, was not that much more.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, however, she refused to take any moral responsibility for her posting on eBay the misleading description of the book.  Our phone call ended (no big surprise) with standard unpleasantries....  The good news is that even if Ms. Rice (who also goes by the business names ""c.j.rice associates,"" ""reoncologyjobs.com,"" and ""recruitingexecs.com) never makes good on this transaction with me (and to me making good means that she pays shipping for the return + full refund), eBay itself is a very good company when it comes to protecting buyers who were treated shabbily.Given the totality of the circumstances, my considered recommendation is simply to STAY AWAY from Christine Rice, Brite Express and any other company whose portals she darkens!UPDATE--  as of 1030 am on Sept 5, Ms. Rice has written to eBay as follows: ""Unfortunately, I did not notice the markings that this buyer has indicated, however, do not have the time to debate the circumstance...Moreover, I haven't even had the time to look at his pictures either.""What arrogance!  She has now agreed to allow a return, AND she admits that the book had ink markings, AND she admits that she hasn't bothered looking at the photos that she insisted that I send her...BUT then she refuses to pay the return postage for an order that would never have occurred absent her irresponsibility and/or dishonesty. Again, do yourself a big favor and STAY AWAY from Christine Rice.

She paid the $89 first time visit which included x-rays, checkup and cleaning. Dr. tells my daughter she needs 3 root canals and that they would run her credit in regards to payment options. They run it and tell her that her credit came back a '0'. Huh? She has(had) excellent credit. They proceeded to tell her they needed $1,800 down to start treatment and then monthly payments of $100. She declined the root canals and they told her they will close the estimate since she did not want more services. She checks her credit one month ago and finds out that in fact, western dental reported her to all three credit bureaus for non-payment and late.She then disputes it and western dental reported again to the 3 credit bureaus, this time with a '0' balance. The problem is, because they erroneously reported her last yr. and 3 weeks ago, those 2 dings are still on her credit for 7 yrs. Due to the fact that it was their screw up from the beginning, those 2 false dings should be removed because as is, it looks like she owed the money and paid it off, which was not the case. We have constantly called their corporate office to seek answers and resolution but to no avail. Everytime we called, they would either hang up on us or send us to a 'supervisor' whose voice boxes were always full. We keep getting rude people and the run around. I, myself, went into the Claremont, Ca. office just to see if I received the same treatment. Sure enough I did. I paid the $89 for the first time visit and was escorted to the back. The whole time there were two ladies from finance following me around, including during my treatment, discussing my credit and payment options for a bridge or implant that they 'strongly' recommended I have after I have a tooth removed. They also told me my credit came back '0'. Their exact words were,""It doesn't mean your credit is good or bad, it just comes up as a 0"". Hmmm, Very suspicious. Needless to say, I declined further treatment and made sure they closed any possible records that would make me responsible for any future payments. Legal advice did not help. Basically there is not enough money for attorney to go after and take the case on a contingency basis. Sure he could probably have those dings removed altogether, but it would cost me $4,000 that I don't have. As a result, my daughters' credit has suffered greatly.

I picked up one tool and it was sealed in a plastic bag by someone there at the office and in a bag that was clear on one side. The label said DISINFECTED and the date and someone's initials. The tool was severely corroded. I was surprised that we have to trust someone there at the office to clean the tools. How much do you want to bet THAT is sometimes not done right? I suspect they have people in-house clean their things so they save money from having a professional company do it. A regular dental tool company would rotate the stock and not give back corroded tools. I will bet you they are also cutting corners elsewhere too like using only water to clean tools etc. Since they are so ghetto and cheap that they use corroded tools, it makes me wonder where else they are cutting corners on just to save a buck. I'm not done... The story gets even BETTER! I did not write this review that day. All I did was post the pictures of that corroded tool on Yelp. I guess Western Dental is a Sponsor of Yelp and they found out I posted that picture. They launched an investigation to find out who I was. Why? Who knows. Retribution? Maybe.

I called Dr. Lipp again for an explanation and he said ""he did what he felt needed to be done"". At this point, the crown does not fit properly and food is getting compacted around and under the crown due to the ""trough"" he created and the sanding at the base, sides and top of the other 3 teeth.  The ""bite"" is off and is affecting the #2 molar.All of this work was done lacking informed consent and is considered ""battery"".I am in the process of having another dentist repair all the damage he has created.Aside from the poor outcome of my dental treatment and the unethical practice of performing procedures without consent, I feel that Dr. Lipp's personal manner is unprofessional.As a new patient and not a personal friend, I found it unusual that he would engage me in ""political rhetoric"" as well as other non dental related discussions during the treatment.This is truly the worst dental experience this 52 year old male has ever had and I suggest anyone that reads this heed the warning.*** Update  8./30/14  The 4 molars that Dr. Lipp ground at the base without my permission have now opened up to root erosion.

Brooklyn, New York USA ",http://envysmile.com/, 9172546595,""," I came to Dr. Weiner around 2002. I left Dr. Weiner roughly around 2008 after recieving ""treatment"" for crooked teeth and underbite. The treatment included wearing braces and what the Dr. refferred to as a dental appliance for correcting the underbite. I started off with the appliance, wearing it for approximatley 1 year. After that, I wore the braces for about 5 years or so. Because the top teeth were moving slower than my bottom, I got the bottom braces taken off about a year before my top teeth. When the Dr. removed my bottom braces, she told me to wear a retainer for 6 months all day and all night. After 6 months, she told me to wear the retainer only at night every night. During the course of the next year, I was still seeing the doctor for my top braces every month. My bottom teeth started to relapse dramatically during that time, even though I was wearing the retainer. Eventually, it had looked as though I never even wore braces to correct my bottom teeth. Meanwhile, the Dr. was seeing me routinely and saw what was happening. She did not suggest anything or tell me how to improve the situation, in fact she did not even comment on what was happening. One visit, I finally brought up the fact that my teeth are crooked again and that I wasted my time and money for no reason. Her suggestion was for me to now do an Invisalign treatment which required me to shave off a substantial amount of my teeth or she would do VENEERS on a 16 year old. It was completely ubsurd. She brought in some other dentist who I have never seen in my life to give me a ""second opinion"" of what I should do. The doctor was clearly informed of the situation by her and was defintly told by her to agree with her suggstion. I lost all confidence in her as a health provider and she broke the trust between patient and doctor. Further, it seemed she was just trying to scam more money out of me as if over $7,000 on treatment was not enough. Six years later, I had to consult with a different dentist and spend $4,500 on an Invisalign treatment to get the smile I initially paid for but never got.  ",  Dental Services

cape coral, Florida USA ","", ,""," I was new to the Cape Coral, FL city and the dentist in this clinic on W Cape Coral Pkwy (part of a national chain) was listed by Humana as being in my network. Set up appointment and went for a semi-annual exam and cleaning. I had a good dental exam and X-rays just 6 months prior and so refused to take any additional X-rays in this visit. After consulting the front office, the hygienist came back and clearly assured me that I would not have to pay for the X-rays if I allowed her to take them. The statement after the visit also showed a zero patient charge for the X-rays. A month later, the clinic sent a bill to me for the X-rays. They actually submitted a claim to Humana which they obviously knew or should have known would be rejectred. The front office had examined my dental card and called Humana about my coverage before I was even admitted into the exam room. Even worse, the amount for the X-rays in my statement (which they should have absorbed based on their assurance to me before the procedure) was much smaller than the amount they tried to bill Humana. These numbers are all on record. To top it off, the dentist then used the X-rays to ""justify"" her recommendation of perio scaling and root planning. These procedures would cost several thousand dollars. And of course, she refused to clean the teeth ! I said ""justify"" because i have a nephew and sister in law who are dentists (out of state) who saw the same X-rays and told me that the scaling and root planning procedures were not needed. You can now in retrospect figure out how this dentist and clinic are operating their business. I protested to the corporate office to no avail. What we do not know is whether this business model is being promoted by the corporation or it is being done by just this clinic. But we know that being a national chain, whatever extra profits, justified or not, a branch clinic gets, profits the corporation as well.

She has done numerous of services on my mouth since then. 10/31/2013 - I spoke with Dr. Tabassian about making sure that the tooth (#9) was done by the same lab that did my other 10 crowns that were purchased. She stated no problem. I had my teeth cleaned and paid for the services for tooth #9 (crown-porcelain/ceramic, cast post & core, gingivectomy). She stated I needed a root canal on #8 and a crown lengthening on #9. I had to save the money so I can get the services done.  5/8/2014 - I was scheduled to get my crown on tooth #9. I went to the office and was told that the dentist will not provide services since I had a balance of $ $184.00. I explained to her staff that she (Dr. Tabassian) had been taking $200.00 a month out of my account (payment arrangement/agreement). I never missed a payment. And that the crown was paid for 9/30/2013. I requested the crown to be given to me so I can have another dentist to place it in.  I requested to speak with doctor Tabassian. I heard her yelling at her staff to get me out of here so I proceeded to her office to have a discussion with her about getting my crown. I called Atlanta Police Dept. since she refused to give me my crown and services that was paid for in 9/2013. She told the officer that I threatened her and would not leave. This was not true. I showed the officer where I paid for the crown and need the services I paid for or arrest her for taking my money. He stated that Dr. Tabassian will do the services 5/13/2014. 5/13/2014– I went for my services. She stated that I needed laser surgery in order for her to complete the crown. She stated that would be over $300. I told her that I could not afford another $300 and why was it not included in the initial cost back 9/2013. She didn’t answer. I also to her that Dr. Brunner had done laser surgery on the same tooth on 4/14/2014 and if I needed some done he could do it for no additional cost just let him know what she needs done.. She made the tooth in her office and glued it in my mouth. I ask her why was the tooth was not sent to be made in the lab as I requested since the other 10 were. She replied that she can make them in her office. I requested my money back. She told me to take the crown I have and I can leave.     I am not satisfied with the texture, length, color, shape or how the tooth is not fitting on the gum to give it a natural look. I can gladly return the tooth back to her. My dental insurance has paid a portion (50%) of the first crown on 6/20/2012 of $375 I paid the other $375. I am the still awaiting the explanation on why crown #9 was not sent off to the lab like the other 10 crowns that I paid ($750) for. On 10/31/2013 I spoke with Dr. Tabassian about make sure that the tooth (#9) was done by the same lab those 10 crown were purchased from. Dr. Tabassian stated that it would be no problem. I’m requesting my money back for this crown (#9) that was made in her office. The crown came off and she stated she could not use that crown over again and I had to purchase another crown (#9) for $790 which was over the contractual fee for a MetLife customer. The crown that was made in her office does not constant of the same material and is not sturdy, polished, and smooth or has the same shine or texture as the other 9 crowns that were made by the lab back in 6/2012. My insurance company would not cover another crown since they paid for ½ on 6/20/2012 on tooth #9. They stated the dentist should have made sure a root canal did not need to be done before placing a crown on the tooth. So I’ve paid $375 and $790 ($1165) for 1 crown.  6/10/2014/ or 6/11/2014 – My crown #9 came out. No even 4 months from the time she placed it in. I called her office to let them know and she refused my services. She stated it was not an emergency. I found another dentist and was schedule to be seen on 6/16/2014. I did a request for records form on 6/12/2014. I also called and asked that my x-rays be emailed to the other dentist. 6/23/2014 – I received a certified letter from Dr. Tabassian. The letter was dated 6/12/2014 but was sent 6/23/2014 stating she will forward my records and I had 30 days for any emergency treatment ONLY. She knew the tooth came out but I guess that wasn’t “emergency” enough for her. I called her office again and speak with her office manager Gayle. She was very rude and continued to cut me off as I was speaking trying to explain the situation to her. She stated Dr. Tabassian will not give me my money and that I need to get services with someone else.

When my credit card statement arrived I was dumbfounded to see : ActionPro -- 13 May $1.25 ; 16 May $3.87; 22 May $9.41 ; a total of $14.53.  SmileProDirect --- 13 May $1.25;  15May $3.87; 26 May $94.31; 24 June $105.22; a total of $204.65.  Together these crooks have taken $219.18 from me ---  and I had to pay currency conversion fees . I ensured that I had cancelled any account they had set up for me and emailed CustomerService @SmileProDirect.com explaining that I hadn't asked for anything other than the free trial, which I couldn't use anyway as I am elderly and have advanced gum disease. The small print on the back of the product advises anyone with gum disease not to use the product. They emailed back saying that I could return the products unopened for a refund and gave me an RMA number which had to be written on the outside of the package. Assuming that they are the same company, I returned ActionPro and SmileProDirect products ( including the free trials ) in the same package, at some cost. Today,2 July, a further package arrived from the same address as the previous one. I haven't even opened the box but plan to return it tomorrow, at further cost.

It is true, they don't advertise it on their site, but they did have internet ads offering free samples. That's how I found them. The ad said I would get a whitening sample with trays to apply it, so I did it. Here's how they hook you, shipping. You have to pay for shipping and they rely on you not reading the fine print, because the ""catch"" is not in the main portion of the order information (it is not obvious). I received the ""sample"" with no trays, so I couldn't apply it. I figured, no problem, I was only out the shipping. The next month I received another shipment (still no trays), that's when I started to invesitigate. I finally found that they were charging my card for what they call ""retail"" price becasue the ""trial period"" was up. They did not use there name on the charge. There was a WT and some numbers, but there was a phone number and I called it. Turns out, they claim that they offer no free samples, and she went into their trail offer. I'm sure they've done this multiple times. I did ask for a refund (I couldn't use the product), they told me I could not get a refund. I asked them to at least send me the trays, and they said I didn't need the trays, they sent me a whitening pen (that was the trial), and claimed they didn't offer free samples. The term ""buyer beware"" should be flashing on their web site. There is no excuse. They advertise in bold letters, but they refuse to put the most obvious information every consumer needs to know. I accept some blame because I should've known better. This is the downside to the internet. If this was a brick and motar store, they would not be so covert. My recommendation to everyone that shops on the internet, stay with the proven sellers, like Amazon, even ebay, if you use PayPal (insures your purchase) and ebay screens it's sellers much more closely than it used to. www.firstclasswhitening.com could choose to be upfront with customers; they could choose to offer refunds for unopened,unused product, but they would rather rip you off.

In fact I brushed it really good while the crown was out and purchased a temporary kit to glue it back in temporarily which it had been in for almost 2 weeks with no problem(and now is 4 weeks) but they figured the cost of a ""New Crown"". So they tried to get me to schedule an appointment to have a total of $2,425 Dollars worth of work done.  The good news is if the fee is over $1,000 you can apply for financing and if you qualify have 12 months interest free to pay it back.  ALL this when all I wanted was a cleaning which usually runs between $150-$250 including x-rays and re-cementing my gold crown back in, which usually costs between $75-200.  Instead of a total of under $500, probably more like $300, they tried to scam me into OVER $2,400.  Give ME A BREAK.  You are better off going ANYWHERE ELSE and paying for your x-rays and exam.  I just thought it would be a good start to a long term relationship but instead this practice LOST a LONG TERM patient who would have sent them MANY other people.

Dental Hygienist will sometimes take x-rays BEFORE cleaning, which can show particulate matter that Assaf says is a 'cavity' - everything is a cavity or a root canal.  Marna - the dental hygienist -  is good but will lie if Assaf tells her to for a drilling - no one to speak to if you are having a proble with Assaf.  They don't explain what they are going to do, and give an estimate of cost for you to think about it.  And you try and try to say it - but after awhile the joking becomes hard to take. They are not willing to wait to make sure that an area of concern is a cavity, and without the digital x-rays they can't repeat films in 6 months.  Assaf does not get customer service ie too arrogant - and you pay higher than most local offices for dental care at Faculty Practice.     There is no list of the dentists in the practice for you to choose from - if you go for dental cleaning you are just attacked by one of them to be your dentist.  If you have a Quality Assurance question - like you don't want the residents to be in your room - there is no pamphlet in the waiting room, and they just walk in joking in street attire - some Muslim veils, Indian saris, etc. - they should be in scrubs.  It's all a diversity clinic - no rules.  He has SECURITY discuss problem issues - which is wrong.   The Ohio Dental Board does not agree that there should be drilling on any x-ray older than 6 months.  Dr. Assaf does not follow that and thinks that Case Security will let him force drillings - which becomes almost terroristic in that he doesn't have the ability to conduct a high level conversation with a professional woman, and neither does SECURITY.  Assaf does not build value.     Does NOT see the problem until you make an analogy to Osama - drilling normal teeth a problem in ethics historically (Hitler, concentration camps had huge collections).  It's not a money thing, you go to CWRU Dental for education, options, discussion - and there is little of that.  It's a forced thing and he doesn't see the problem in your face - he's joking around. Most of the CWRU grads who consider working in the Faculty Practice refuse because of the x-ray problem - they can't get malpractice insurance but CWRU can? ASSAF doesn't understand if you want to follow an x-ray change or you want a digital x-ray to confirm, he just wants to drill.  Which gets irritating, and abusive - he's derogatory towards - maybe better with men. Faculty Practice staff are not American dental grads, as the new grads want the Faculty Practice to put in digital x-rays.  To be a little more serious about their job.  It's all one big foreign joke that you have cavities in US - if you are not Muslim you are unclean, 'vulgar,' and don't brush and floss.   The cavities will go away on a repeat x-ray, and he will still try to drill on even 3-year old films - for money.  Assaf will not review films.  He wants to do root canals, so every drilling he wants to convert to a root canal except if it is his cavity.  He's not particularly gentle, and if you have a small mouth - you need to find someone who also does peds - which is not the CWRU Faculty Practice. Faculty Practice does not have digital x-rays or dental ultrasound - most outdated equipment in town - the PR is great, the practice less so.  And unlike most practice web pages, they don't say digital x-rays.  But it's the joking around, the saying 'cavities' when 2 repeat x-rays are 'normal,' and the lack of explanations, options, or any kind of ability to carry on a meaningful conversation that is the problem and upsetting.   DR. ASSAF jokes and plays games, but has limited English conversation - if you have a medical issue that might affect the dental x-rays - he has no interest or clue - just wants to drill.     Then he doesn't know how to discuss when you have an allergic reaction - he just laughs - files court harassment that you bothered him.  Does not 'get' that patient does not understand him drilling on a 3 year old x-ray with 2 negative repeat films.  He treats you like a clinic patient.   Faculty practice does not use another local dentist to do the digital x-rays on a patient with a questionable area of cavity.  Does not get that you don't like gender being made fun of as a woman - unclean, you don't brush, you are not worth my going over the x-rays if you ask him 'why are you doing this?'   Does NOT get that he behaves in a very Muslim fashion towards women - lies to them or refuses to answer questions.  Drilling on 3 year old x-rays is however just abuse or Baghdad dentistry.

By the time he got new sets delivered was well after 6pm. All and all, it took another couple hours for him to complete putting my entire clown in. It was hard for me to tell how it went due to blood and swelling.

I called them and got the run around. Nobody could figure out what was wrong with my account and the Person who made my account was not available. I contacted them for 3 weeks, even went there personally and nobody could answer me. Finally after many messages i got in contact with the person who made my contract. Her response was that my Insurance had not covered some dental work i had done. Why would it take you 8 Months to notify a Customer? Also why would you tell me my Insurance had covered it? Why would you do the Work? This company is a rip off. They will make a contract look good, like it is in your best interest and then totally burn you. They had never told me that there might be even a possibility that my Insurance may not cover the work i was getting done. Isnt that their job? To make sure that the Insurance the Customer has will cover the work the Customer is getting done. I had no idea i had to wait a year in order to get certain work done before my Insurance would cover that. But Western Dental knew that. That is why they had me agree to it. So they could come back and expect me to pay. I am sorry but that is not my error. I did pay off what i agreed to pay. That is what i signed for. But i will not be responsible for their Laziness.

First off, they thought I needed a root canal. They looked up my insurance benefits, said I had to pay $97 prior to the service, so I did. I get there and the Endodontist said my tooth was cracked below the gum line and needed to be extracted, so no root canal, but I had to pay for his consult. I sat with the ""office manager"" to determine a ""treatment plan"" (of which, by the way they put the dollar amount on your account BEFORE you ever even get the service and make you SIGN it!). The treatment plan was to have a mold taken for a partial, get the tooth extracted, and then have the temporary denture while I decided on an implant. At the time of setting up the ""treatment plan"", the office manager told me my out of pocket would be $165. When I came in for the services, I was told $338 needed to be paid based on my insurance benefits. I was irritated that it was DOUBLE what I was initially told, but I was already there and needed the service anyway so I paid it. Low and behold, a month later I received a bill for over $900 no evidence of my payment, declined EOB's from my insurance indicating services not covered, evidence services were not billed, etc. etc. First off, they set me up on a treatment plan that wasn't covered by my insurance, so I have NO idea what insurance company they were looking at when they were reviewing my benefits, hmmmm, interesting. I may have chosen a different option if I had known it was going to cost so much more out of my pocket and that they weren't looking at my insurance coverage accurately. Yes, I know, my insurance coverage is my responsibility, but WHY would I doubt them when they're sitting there right in front of me with a copy of my insurance card in hand apparently checking my insurance coverage while we were putting together the treatment plan? Why would I think I'd have to go home and pull up my benefits AGAIN and check? So now I have this bill for over $900 saying I'm past due, I call and supposedly talk to the ""office manager"" who dismisses my concern in a kind manner by saying, ""let me pull your file, see what's going on, get a hold of corporate, and call you back"". Nice, and of course, no phone call back. I get another bill a few weeks later, adjusted down to just under $800 and still no evidence of my $338 payment. So I call AGAIN, get the same run around of ""let me get a hold of corporate"". I asked if I could call corporate myself, nope, no can do, only THEY can get a hold of corporate and only through EMAIL! I'm so tired of this place, they have horrible billing practices, their employees don't know how to accurately review insurance coverage, effectively setting you up to pay more than what you were expecting (almost like bait and switch!).  The employees can’t  review anything on their system with regards to billing, my guess is it is because this mysterious ""corporate"" has the billing/services so jacked up that their employees can't even make heads or tails out of what is going on with their patient accounts. AND, not to mention they set you up on treatment plans with services and charges BEFORE the services are EVER rendered, they tell you how much your insurance will cover and how much you will need  to pay out of pocket and it's all WRONG.

I'm getting ready to move from Florida to Tennessee so, on May 9th, I started the process to have my credit refunded to me.

I only recall having the original one done before every even having anything pulled.   I accepted the 636. After waiting a month for the check to be mailed I called back and was told that corporate reduced the refund to a hundred and some dollars.

I began the process in August 2013, my estimate for everything start to finish came to $3000. I spoke with Shannon, then office manager, because SOB matches competitor coupons. She agreed to apply my 25% off coupon to the entire treatment plan, and made a copy of it.Every visit between August 2013 and May 2014 I asked if it was time to apply my coupon, and multiple staff members kept telling me to hang on to it and wait. Long story short, I am finally getting my Procera crown put on and paying the final bill, and Shannon no longer works there and the office is refusing to honor my coupon. The office staff argued with me, and made every excuse not to accept it - Shannon doesn't work there anymore, they won't make any money if they apply it, I should've known they wouldn't apply it because they kept putting it off, they're already the cheapest in town, Dr. Unger's office (nextdoor surgeon) should've applied it and not them, they can't retroactively apply it to past visits, etc.This office staff try to appear very nice, but they're very pushy and looking back I can kind of see how they are a bit shady. They basically cornered me and left me with no other option. They're pushy about treatments I didn't need (they wanted to fill a bunch of ""cavities"" and I got second opinions stating that it wasn't necessary). Their ""white for life"" program is only if you get every single filling and procedure they recommend, meaning they could suggest completely unnecessary procedures and if you don't agree you lose your white for life guarantee. They really don't respect my wishes to avoid regular x-rays and flouride. I overheard as they informed another patient who didn't want x-rays that the ADA REQUIRES them to perform x-rays every year and won't see or treat a patient without them, and that there is no radiation involved. This couldn't be more incorrect or dishonest!Dr. Fuller and Dr. Unger are very nice and personable, but I don't think they realize what is going on with the office end of the practice (which has paid off other patients who left bad reviews to remove them).

One on May 5th for $94.31 USD from Spark Whitening and another on May 7th for $94.31 USD from Dental Pro at Home. Dental Pro at Home must be a sister company or sell their customer lists to this other company, Spark Whitening, as I did not have any association with them. I then called my bank and was informed that I have new charges for the month of June from them. And have not even received the next months product. This is how they SCAM you: You fill in a form for the free trial. It takes them several weeks to send you the product, but you only have 8 days to cancel from the date you fill in the form (""sign up""), even though you didn't receive the kit yet. Once the monthly charges begin (without your knowledge), they tell you that you can only get a refund if you return the product with 15 days of the date you cancel. Now here's the catch... In my situation, I signed up on April 27th. I asked them when they shipped the product, and was told it was sent on April 28th. I was charged twice (May 5th & May 7th). But didn't receive anything until June 6th!!! And by now, my June charges began. As credit card bills come in a month later, I only noticed the May charges today. I called Dental Pro at Home to complain and cancel the monthly service I didn't know I had been scammed into. Many of their employees had hung up the phone on me as they knew it was a complaint. I finally talked to the supervisor named ""Jason"" who would not give me his lastname, only employee# 1377402. He said that he had the ""highest authority"" there.  He gave me 2 options: The 1st months charges were out of their hands. But I could get a full refund if I returned the product within 15 days of TODAY. Only problem is, they haven't shipped the product yet and last time it took over a month to receive. I told him that he knew very well he was part of a scam, as it was impossible to return a product with 15 days, that would not get to my door until 30-45 days. Which meant that the monthly charges would continue. So my steps so far have been to cancel my credit card, to prevent any further charges. Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!

I did give them a second chance and rescheduled for the next available 5 pm time slot. It turns out that would be 4 days later, the following Tuesday.  Apparently, it's okay to make you wait a total of 8 days before they take care of you.  Worse, my wife and I have to take MORE time off and lose MORE money to make this happen. Of all the insults, they called me on a Saturday afternoon to CONFIRM THE APPOINTMENT!  I asked, ""Who is going to confirm that you will actually KEEP the appointment you set?"" ... no answer except for ""Sorry.""

Slidell, Louisiana USA ",dn4smiles.com, (985) 641-1115,""," I left their practice more than a year ago after 5 months of suffering and I'm still dealing with consequences of their negligence.  I understand that there are quacks in each profession, but what can be worse than a charlatan with medical license, who doesn't care about his patients and feel no shame or guilt of hurting people? Here are just a few episodes of their negligence: 1. I had a deep bite and needed some sort of a glue to be added to some of my upper teeth to keep them safe from chipping (upper teeth were hittng directly on the lower teeth brackets). Devereux put the brackets on very quickly (of course!), but I could barely close my mouth. I told him about it. He said: ""Do you want me to remove you lower braces?"" No comments. I didn't know what to say and I didn't know yet that the ""glue"" was needed and just left in shock (was discharged, actually). I could NOT eat anything because I couldn't chew - upper teeth were hitting directly on the lower brackets) However, I was hungry and tried to find a way to chew. Got on of my teeth chipped... Next day I had to take a day off and drive 80 miles back to ther clinic and begged them to do something. This time they put some glue on my teeth and I was able to eat.. 2. Next time they put a wire in 2 times thicker than I was ready for. Plus, there was something wrong with how one of the brackets was placed. (That I know from comments made by the doctor, which I recorded, by the way). Plus, the orthodontic assistant was absolutely incompetent, dangerous for human beings and, I assume, mentally retarded. It felt like she was working with hammer on my teeth. Can't forgive myself that I let her touch (and damage) me and didn't stop her. After she was done, I felt immediate, very strong pain and I asked the ""doctor"" to check. Devereux said that the wire were way to thick and removed it. Of course, it was almost 5 pm and he was probably in a hurry, so he forgot to put a power chain piece everywhere it was needed. I left in pain and in tears. (By the way, I was almost the last one to leave the clinic, only a cleaning lady with the key was still there, all personnel were gone) But the biggest surprise were still ahead:   3. As I said, Devereux were trying to fix the mistakes of his incompetent assistant, but being in a hurry, forgot about the power chain piece. As a result, my # 8 shifted to the right very fast (2-3 hours) and I got a 2 mm (!) gap between my #8 and #9 (those are the two front upper teeth) And I never had a gap there before. Because of direct force it happened so fast and the pain was unbearable. I had to drive back again and they put more power chains and it shifted back very quickly again (took 2-3 hours).  Everybody who has brain, understands that it's very dangerous for the teeth and that's why it take 2-3 years of treatment, because there should be about 1 mm of movement per month (!), otherwise there is a possibility to damage the roots permanently.   4. They knew 100% that they were neglective and that they damaged my teeth, but when I started asking questions and show that I was not happy, they became very cynical.

He offered me a full refund in case I didn't want to continue treatment with them. However, when I left their clinic for good, he sent me a letter that he ""reconsidered and there won't be any refund"". When I started the treatment, they even didn't take my x-ray! When I was in pain (which they caused!) and I asked them to take an x-ray to check if my roots were okay, they just ignored my request and told me that it was not my place to decide and ask. In addition to this - I was getting automated calls 2-3 times per week that my payment was past due for about 6 months after I left their clinic (was not their patient anymore).    Some other details about their practice: -Outdated facilities - you have to make a trip to the sink if you need to rinse. Even third-world countries' dental clinics have better equipment nowadays.  -They still write everything (patient history, appointments history) by hand - no computers! LOL -They have 7-9 small offices (not sure how many exactly) around the state. In some of them they come once a month! Can you imagine how many patients they have to see and how does it affect the quality of their services?    I know that the charlatan and crew will still operate and keep hurting people.

 Great Expressions ,"  Great Expressions  11701 Belcher Rd S, Ste 103 
Largo, Florida USA ","", 7275317676,"","   April 2014 I scheduled an appt with Great Expressions for May 1st for a consult and xrays. I did request an additional cleaning, but because I do have those receding gums, they refused. I did indeed have them cleaned though...later on that same day, just a few hrs later; I went by my dentist from my guardian plan. I do have two plans and unfortunately the Dentist that I've been using for the last couple of years only takes one of these plans. Great Expressions takes both of them; which is what led me to them in the first place.  So off I go to my appt of May 1, first thing in the a.m. They pretty much had me waiting around for a bit but I was okay with it since I didn't have to be at work until 9:15. X-rays and Dentist Consult completed...he sends me off to schedule an appt with their Periodontist and states that we'll go from there. The only problem is that this franchise has five offices with only one periodontist to serve all of these patients from all of the five offices. The earliest date that they could schedule the specialist was almost a month and a half away...I'm in pain, taking amoxicillin for one tooth that's already infected and causing my surrounding teeth to hurt as well. Most definitely, I'm in need of immediate attention.   Call after call, I begged this Largo branch to take care of my cavities...afterall they are general dentistry. And since I walked into their office with records from two other perio's stating that the scaling is a must, lets get this going with your hygienist as well. Well Dr Halttunen demanded that I see their Perio first and once I did that and we see what a third perio has to say, they we'll go from there. I explained to them that I will still keep my appt with the Perio for June but again, lets get this going asap so my mouth can get healthy. I just don't want to waste any time and my mouth is in extreme trouble. After about my third call, the receptionist expressed that I can go see any perio...doesn't have to be within Great Expressions.  Headed to my insurance website and looked up other perio's with in my plan, chose one and scheduled an appt. Attended my appt for this Perio to write down the same consult as the other two perio's ...scaling of all 4 quadrants. But this time, this consult costs me $86 although I thought this was free and was so very thankful that I even had that much money on a credit card to be able to pay them. That was this past Tuesday. That evening, I emailed the Largo Great Expressions to let them know all has been taken care of and I would like to schedule an appt for Friday to get the scaling done. I provided the Perio's name and phone number.  (Please understand that I've been going to the perio for years...And ALWAYS...I see the perio for a consult, his hygienist always does the root scaling. The dr lends a hand by providing the novocain and that's it.) On Wed, I confirmed the cancellation of my appt with Great Expressions in Pinellas Park (I had left two voice mails with no response). I did get through to the receptionist and we took care of the cancellation. That same day, I called Great Expressions in Largo to express that all has been taken care of...That I've seen my third perio as requested, his office will be mailing all of his notes and they should receive them no later than Thur. I wanted to schedule an appt as for sure, I was so thrilled to finally have all taken care of.  Well when I spoke to the receptionist; Jenny... she stated that she can't schedule an appt for me because the office manager. Anastasia would need to speak with me first. I asked the receptionist why that was...why can't I just schedule an appt? She reiterated that I needed to speak to Anastasia and when I asked to speak with her...She stated that she wasn't available. I called their office again, spoke with Anastasia and she said that their Dr will not see me and that I just need to go to the perio and have the work done there. I couldn't believe what I was hearing and expressed to them that there is no way that I can go to them...They will charge me $100 per quadrant even though I hold two insurances...That's $400!! There is no way I can have the work done by them.  I desperately call their Pinellas Park location first thing this morning (Thur)...they have already given my previously scheduled appt to another patient. I would now have to wait until July if I wanted to see their Perio. Again, let me mention that this isn't routine and that the longer we wait, the more I'm endanger of loosing my teeth. I pleaded with their receptionist, he became rude and short with me. He explained that July would be his first available. And that was that. Drove to the Largo location and figured that I would speak with them face to face to get this resolved. They made it clear to me that their hygienist isn't skilled enough to do the root scaling and the dentist can't fill my cavities. Are you kidding me...Really??? This is crazy!!! Stay away from this office!!  With in the year, I could've been pretty much taken care of between both of my insurances and the fact that they will both rollover come January 2015. Just trying to get healthy here...This has been such an impossible task.   Please also note that I called this office twice in the very beginning to schedule an appt.  I left two detailed messages and after several days, didn't receive a call back. I left work early one afternoon and physically went to their office to schedule an appt. Although, I had the records of my calls to them in my phone...they had no record of my calling them. I spoke with another patient who shared with me that he called them five times before Great Expressions Largo returned his call. Ugh.  ",  Dental Services

I realized this was a mistake nearly as soon as the initial appointment began; When he came in he was extremely rude and rattled off a slew of intrusive questions that he didn’t even wait for me to interrupting me. At my last dental appointment, probably 4 or 5 months prior at the most (my husband and I had relocated here for his job) there were 2 molars that were “questionable” that my dentist had said would probably need to be addressed fairly soon. Like I expected, they’d started to give me some trouble. Dr. Boyd claimed I “waited so long” that both teeth would need crowns and one possibly a root canal. I said I found that hard to believe when the xrays were nearly identical to the ones I’d had a few months ago and that the teeth had been asymptomatic until a week ago (MILD off and on ache….this moron acted as though I had some sort of raging infection about to kill me.) Long story short….and there was all sorts of other nonsense, courtesy of him, I got up and went to the front and paid and let the secretary know that I would need my files transferred, while he glowered at me from around the corner--oh and when I transferred to the new practice, the office assistant there laughingly let me know that he had put some kind of notation about how *I* was the one who had been rude and showed up late ""multiple times"" (yeah right--I was 10 minutes early to the appointmenT--singular, that I had.) apparently he has retaliated against other patients who left as well, according to her. As I expected, my new (sane) dentist filled the two cavities and I have had no issues. One of the assistants there knew of Dr. Boyd and had said she had heard many people say the same things about him. Keep in mind that IF I had needed more work on my teeth then I would have happily gotten it done, that was NEVER the issue. I am nearly 40 years old and I have taken excellent care of my teeth and will continue to do so.

He claimed that he was the best in the business (which was a complete lie) but guaranteed me in writing on several occasions that his procedure would fix my problem, and just to sign on the dotted line and pay him in full at the point of the consultation. After giving Dr. Son my entire savings of $15,000 that I acquired over time to get this procedure done, he started to perform the cosmetic procedure without my consent, and just started drilling down my teeth on my first consultaion replacing them with new crowns.

I was frustrated and very concerned that even though he acknowledged the fact that his services were a bit pricey not to worry because he was the best in the business supposedly and he could not only take care the problem completely but the pain I was having everyday as well. He performed the procedure but didn't perform what was promised. After returning immediately after, not to mention the numerous times over the past year to attempt to fix the horrible work he did on my teeth, I was tired of getting put off appointment after appointment, just to be told to try a retainer or mouth guard at night?? I told him I was not able to take any more time off work and either needed the problem fixed or be given a full refund so I could go to a dentist that knew what he was doing. Dr. Son became very defensive and irate, even his office assistants made the meanest, demeaning comments to me, bringing me home in tears after every visit, leaving me frustrated and feeling compeletly helpless knowing that I had just got scammed by someone that I thought I could trust. I can’t believe that I paid Dr. Son $15,000 in full at the time of the procedure and now he can’t even return my phone calls or hear my concerns once he sucked all of the money that he possibly could from me and still be able to sleep at night!. I did everything that I could have done to possibly rectify this bad situation by following up with him immediately after the procedure with my concerns, letting him know that the problem was not fixed. After hearing excuse after excuse from this fraud of a dentist unfortunately I am still having to live with this constant pain and headaches everyday while he is working in his dental office everyday just waiting to get his claws into the next poor victim that he can steal money from. I would never wish this experince on anyone that is need of a dental procedure and a dentist they need to trust to deliver what they say they will. He has absolutely no remorse or even an alternative option for me at this point leaving me with no possibly alternate way or money for that matter to get this painful issue resolved. He just told me that He tried and that was the best he could do and made it clear that a refund wasn't going to happen and to just live with the results of his poor services and deal with the pain. Not only do I have to live with this constant pain but now living with regret that I gave him not only my trust but my entire savings to get this fixed and now left unable to pay another dentist to get the problem take care of once and for all. I was mis-lead, scammed and fat out taken advantage of by Dr. David Son.

My new dentist was worried that something hadn't been done earlier and that it had been left so long.  I had a bad infection up in the gums that needed three rounds of antibiotics to get rid of and the tooth was pulled.  He then sent me to the surgeon to prepare me for a dental inplant.

Rockwall, Texas USA ",http://www.kenyonhilldds.com, (972) 771-9196,""," BAIT & SWITCH BEWARE of Dr. Kenyon Hill D.D.S. it is a SCAM dental office that lures patients with offering high end cosmetic products but delivers a cheaper product without the patient knowing while under anethisia.  I had always had beautiful teeth, but after an accident I needed a tooth repaired. I was referred to Dr. Kenyon Hill by a vendor for a surgeon I worked for. I went in for a consultation expecting her to repair the damaged tooth. I was talked into replacing 8 of my top teeth in order to match the one that was damaged; I understood that concept. I expressed to Dr. Kenyon Hill that I loved my current teeth and wanted to maintain my original smile and my white teeth, which I was always getting compliments for. I expressed to Dr. Kenyon Hill and staff that I wanted to have my teeth whiter than what I currently had (which were very white). I asked Dr. Kenyon Hill to order the Lava brand, by 3M, and she said she would order that brand. [continued below]....
									
										..... After a couple of weeks of pain and misery, my teeth were finally ready to be put in. I was numbed up and the new teeth were placed after several hours. I wasn't allowed to see them until they were bonded & cemented in my mouth. I was disappointed with the color from the beginning, which I verbalized from that day forward. I was told to ""get used to them"" and to ""give them some time"" and that they were the whitest shade. THEY WERE NOT AND THEY ARE UGLY. I called numerous times & visited with her several times over the past year to discuss my unhappiness with the color of the teeth. I have been embarrased by the color of the teeth ever since the beginning. I have always smiled a lot in photos and now I avoid cameras or smiling while showing my teeth; they are a yellow-grayish color. This has completely destroyed my self esteem and caused scores of emotional damage. Everyday I look in the mirror, I want, and sometimes do, cry.  At one of the last visits with Dr. Kenyon Hill, I, again, cried in her office and explained that the color wasn't what I wanted. I asked for whiter teeth. She then brought out a shade guide and pointed to the shade in which she ordered for me. I was WAY off of the whitest shades.  I finally gained the courage to confront her and demanded my money back so that I could get my smile back. She refused and said that she would fix them - for a price. I had lost all faith in her since she didn't listen to my concerns earlier. I did visit with other dentists who said the teeth's shape was nice, but the color was way off of what they would've chosen for my smile. They all agreed that I should've been able to see the teeth temporarily and approved them BEFORE they were permanently cemented in.  I received a call at my job from a confidential informant that used to work in her practice. The informant stated that they remembered how unhappy and miserable I was and gave me some interesting advice. I was told that the Lava brand in which I ordered, was not the brand that Dr. Kenyon Hill ordered. She, instead, ordered a cheaper, uglier brand and charged me for the expensive Lava brand. When we requested my records, all I was allowed to receive were my x-rays. I needed the records, not only for medical reasons, but for the warranty information on the current teeth. I still have not been able to obtain my full records - not even my current dentist has been able to get them. Beware of their office; they are hurting for money and actually had the audacity to continue calling me even after they knew I was unhappy, to schedule an appointment for a cleaning. I've heard a lot of really bad things about this office. I should've listened to my husband's advice - he went in for a cleaning once and said he would never go back. Their equipment is way out dated and old.  Word to the wise - do your research! Visit with several offices before settling on one, even if you have a recommendation. I should've trusted my gut. I feel I was ""played"" so that she could get more money. When I found about her scheme, it's funny how my records vanished... The pain and suffering I've had to go through has been horrible. I was once an outgoing, bubbly, smiling person, now I sit in silence because I'm embarrassed by the horrible discolored teeth this dentist chose to order.  Beware of this scam. Kenyon B. Hill does classic Bait & Switch on patients. Go look at her Healthgrades on Healthgrades.com. 2 1/2 stars reviewed by 24 people. Kenyon B. Hill screwed my family over with a bait and switch. She is a total ripoff and not a nice person. My wife Jennifer wanted a pretty white smile. She had saved her hard earned money up before we met working in the medical industry as a nurse for a well known doctor in Dallas, TX. She was a single mom with two beautiful children. Her teeth were already pretty but she wanted that movie star smile. She chose Dr. Kenyon B. Hill DDS in Rockwall, TX to do the cosmetics. My wife even talked me into going there to get my teeth cleaned. I had had $20,000 of cosmetic work done on my own teeth from another local dentist. My wife insisted Kenyo Hill was a good dentist. I went to get the teeth cleaned. The office was dirty, old & out dated equipment, staff was very rude especially the fat girl working behind the front desk. There was only one that worked there that was nice, can't remember her name. When I met Kenyon Hill I could tell imediately she was fake. She had a personality of a know it all. I wasn't impressed. I left. I told my wife I wasn't impressed with Kenyon B. Hill DDS in Rockwall, TX. My wife had already put a huge deposit to begin her cosmetics. After it was completed her teeth did not look the same. They were yellow compared to her original teeth. Definitely not white. Of course I could tell this troubled her. I did not say what I saw for respect for her feelings. I wanted her to come to me about it. She did. She cried many nights not happy with the $10,000 she spent to get yellow teeth. She went back several times to voice her concern but Dr. Kenyon B. Hill DDS in Rockwall, TX ignored her concern. After a year I had enough of watching her pain.  We were contacted by a previous employee that quit Dr. Kenyon B. Hill DDS in Rockwall, TX because of the unethical practice she was doing on patients. She said Kenyon B. Hill DDS in Rockwall, TX was mentally unstable. She said Kenyon B.

Then when ordering Dr. Kenyon Hill DDS in Rockwall, TX ordered a lower end brand and while Jennifer was under anethisia Dr. Kenyon Hill in Rockwall, TX put the cheaper brand on Jennifer's teeth. Totally unethical!!! Kenyon B. Hill is a crook. I contacted Kenyon B. Hill DDS in Rockwall, TX and demanded Jennifer's money $10,000 to be returned or we would pursue legal action.

 Affordable Dentures ,"  Affordable Dentures  7120 S 82nd Street 
Lincoln, Nebraska USA ",http://www.affordabledentures.com/, (402) 512-1329,""," I took my Wife to Affordable Dentures in Lincoln, NE as she needed a new set of dentures. During the first visit for the fitting, she was snapped at by Mandy the recptionist for telling her the restroom was out of toilet paper. That should have been a clue as to what lay ahead.   My Wife ended up purchasing the best set they had to the tune of $1475.00.  After giving them 3 days to feel right, she found that they were rubbing a sore spot in her mouth due to a bad fit.  New dentures seldom fit perfect on the first try.  That's when you count on good service after the sale.  That is where Affordable Dentures failed miserably. The dentist said ""come back anytime for an adjustment"" so I called and talked to Mandy the receptionist to say we were coming up for one.  I was told we would have to wait 8 days for an appointment.  That is a long time when your mouth hurts so bad you can't eat.  So then my Wife called and was treated very rudely by Mandy the recptionist who just kept saying how she couldn't fit her in (for a 5 minute procedure).  She didn't care at all that my Wife was in pain and couldn't eat. My Wife has had several sets of dentures in her life and always been able to get in the same day for an adjustment at every other place.  My Wife told Mandy she would just have to get them adjusted somewhere else when Mandy told her that would ""void the warranty"".  I called the next day for one last try and was told by Mandy that if we could get there by 10 AM, that was when they took walk-in customers.  Why didn't she say that when we first asked to come in the day before??  That makes it personal.   We got there at 10:01 AM and had to wait 90 minutes for everyone else to get done and leave.  Yes, we were the last ones in the building before she got helped.  The adjustment took 5 minutes.  On the way out, my Wife asked Mandy why we were not told of the walk-in option when we first called.  She did not have a good answer and was once again rude and unsympathetic to a customer in pain. One of her co-workers pulled me aside and asked if I would like to go ahead and make another appointment in case further adjustment was needed.  I said yes.  She said she would call me asap with the soonest time available.  That call never happened.  A few days later (today), my Wife realized that the dentures needed further adjustment so I called.  7 days waiting for an appointment.  When I asked Mandy about a walk-in, she said ""we can't guarantee we'll get you in"".  Since it cost $30 to drive there, possibly for nothing since Mandy is a vindictive B****, I decided to not even make an appointment.  Very frustrating.  My Wife then tried to call and found Mandy would not answer her call.  She finally left a message that we were coming up for a refund tomorrow.  No respone.  Later I called back to make sure they got her message by using *67 prefix so they could not see my number.  I was told by Mandy our money would be refunded.  we'll se how that goes. This complaint is not about a bad product.  It is about bad service and rude, uncompassionate people. Hopefully, she won't have the dentures long enough to know how good they are, we will get our money back and call it a lesson learned. After searching online, I found a lot of people have had similar experiences at Affordable Dentures.  I also found a blog (http://affordable-dentures.pissedconsumer.com/bad-dentures-20110223223246.html) where some employees vent about the working conditions, unfair treatment and company policy.  They are all about mass production and turn around.  They make a lot of money and that's all they really care about.  Don't go there if you expect friendly personal service in a prompt manner.

Mar Vista, California USA ",Www.westerndental.com, 310-482-0026,""," I was very excited to work with Western Dental Hawthorn location. There was a need to fix 6 teeth. I had new insurance and was sure that I would be getting most of it covered. Nothing could be further from the truth. They sedated me with nitros at both locations, put a series of contracts under my nose and gave me a pen. I trusted them, but ended up with a huge bill and monthly payments the size of a car payment. Every step of the way they tried to frustrate me and get me to leave so they didn't have to do any more work. They'd make appointments and when I would show up they'd say they don't need me today and try to get rid of me. This happened repeatedly. I refused to leave and told them to get to work on me. I'd say four appointments or more went like this. Their mission is to not finish contracts and they'll have you sit in the waiting room for 3 or more hours before calling you, if you complain. I complained... The work they did at both locations was careless and sub standard. I was forced to depend on them after they started implant  surgery. The temporaries they made either did not fit or fell out altogether leaving nerves exposed, cut gums and improperly fitting permenant teeth. The permenant work they did was incredibly slow and wasted months of my time and money. I got infected, was in terrible  pain and went in to request pain meds and the doctor even argued with me in the waiting room in front of every patient in the waiting room treating me like some drug seeking addict. Then I changed locations and went to Mar Vista Western Dental. The dentist there wasn't really as bad as the other two I had experienced previously, but the managers and front desk staff tried to play all kinds of games to get rid of me because they felt that my case being transferred there was not a deal they wanted as far as the money was concerned and hoped to push me to the edge of all sanity and eventually leave. The dentist I saw for the implant was disrespectful and tried everything she could to get out of treating me, seeing that the screw was not put in incorrectly for my implant. they kept telling me to go back to the prior location. I waited a half a day past my appointment time, just to be told during my 10 minute eval that my implant was done incorrectly. The cap that was supposed to be left in was taken out ""because the gums had already filled in since the screw was loose, so my gums will have to be now cut through again all over in order to finish the implant, now that the cap has been removed, which was supposed to hold back my gums until the implant was installed. I just have no idea what is going to happen next. The manager Jasmine stood over me during the entire appointment, (I though I had a rite to privacy) intending to ask me to leave afterward, because I complained About being asked to wait half a day for my appointment I showed up on time for. Excuses, lies, manipulation, intimidation, negligence, blame shifting, privacy violation and the list goes on and on and on.

I went home crying, no teeth in my mouth and it is now a nighmare for me!  I called him very upset, Dr. Conte said, ""I don't blame you for being upset, please let me make it right! 6. I went back to him and a 3rd partial was done!  This one I could wear, but was extremely incomfortable! Again, I asked for a treatment plan and his wife Holy gave me a Patient Progress note that was confusing!  She said to me' Don't pay too much attention to the numbers, that will change depending on your insurance."" 7. I waited 3 months to heal before the implants! 8. July 2013 I was scheduled for implants and I asked again, ""What is this going to cost?  Dr. Conte said, $8,000.00. I said that was too much money and I asked for my xrays for another opinion.  I received dark and unreadable xrays!  I told him I was going to report him to the dental board, he offered me $3,000.00.  I said I wanted $6588.00 the cost to replace my teeth!  He refused! 9. I contacted several attornies and they all denied me because malpractice cases require an extraordinary amount of time and expense and would not justify the ultimate outcome financially!  10. I did a quiet protest on the private sidewalk in front of his business and Dr. Conte put the sprinkler on me! 10.  I know I have 2 years to prusue this, I feel violated and I don't know where else to turn! 11.  I am seeking $6588.00, the amount it cost me for implants!  Are you able to help me?  Thank you in advance for anything you can do!     ",  Dental Services

I had an upper denture designed for me previously by the Gainesville office and was more than satisfied with the customer service and the results. Two weeks ago, however, one of the anchor teeth that secured the positioning of my upper denture broke in half. I had been informed by the doctors in Gainesville that a tooth can be added to my denture at any time so I went to the Fort Myers office to have just that accomplished. When I got there I was asked if I wanted to have my problem taken care of today or just get an evaluation. I requested to have it done today. I was immediately directed to have a full x-ray of my teeth ( mind you I had asked to just replace the broken tooth ). After taking the x-ray I was seen by an apprentice ... Not DR RUMBOLO and was told to go to a surgeon who's advertisement states that he will work on issues that this affordable dentures office can't handle at a ""minimum"" fee of $2800. After being dismissed by the apprentice doctor, a nurse hurriedly informed me that after I get the work done by their requested surgeon, the amount I would have to pay for my upper full and lower partial would be twice the $750 stated on the paperwork and I was immediately ushered out. I literally sat in my car for 8 minutes feeling like I was herded like cattle. It was the most unprofessionally cold customer service I can remember in my time.

I had an upper denture designed for me previously by the Gainesville office and was more than satisfied with the customer service and the results. Two weeks ago, however, one of the anchor teeth that secured the positioning of my upper denture broke in half. I had been informed by the doctors in Gainesville that a tooth can be added to my denture at any time so I went to the Fort Myers office to have just that accomplished. When I got there I was asked if I wanted to have my problem taken care of today or just get an evaluation. I requested to have it done today. I was immediately directed to have a full x-ray of my teeth ( mind you I had asked to just replace the broken tooth ). After taking the x-ray I was seen by an apprentice ... Not DR RUMBOLO and was told to go to a surgeon who's advertisement states that he will work on issues that this affordable dentures office can't handle at a ""minimum"" fee of $2800. After being dismissed by the apprentice doctor, a nurse hurriedly informed me that after I get the work done by their requested surgeon, the amount I would have to pay for my upper full and lower partial would be twice the $750 stated on the paperwork and I was immediately ushered out.

I had an upper denture designed for me previously by the Gainesville office and was more than satisfied with the customer service and the results. Two weeks ago, however, one of the anchor teeth that secured the positioning of my upper denture broke in half. I had been informed by the doctors in Gainesville that a tooth can be added to my denture at any time so I went to the Fort Myers office to have just that accomplished. When I got there I was asked if I wanted to have my problem taken care of today or just get an evaluation. I requested to have it done today. I was immediately directed to have a full x-ray of my teeth ( mind you I had asked to just replace the broken tooth ). After taking the x-ray I was seen by an apprentice ... Not DR RUMBOLO and was told to go to a surgeon who's advertisement states that he will work on issues that this affordable dentures office can't handle at a ""minimum"" fee of $2800. After being dismissed by the apprentice doctor, a nurse hurriedly informed me that after I get the work done by their requested surgeon, the amount I would have to pay for my upper full and lower partial would be twice the $750 stated on the paperwork and I was immediately ushered out. I literally sat in my car for 8 minutes feeling like I was herded like cattle. It was the most unprofessionally cold customer service I can remember in my time. I think you need to take a fresh look at how you do business, Fort Myers Afffordable. . . either that or add the word ""unprofessional"" to your name. Fort Myers Affordable, Unprofessional Dentures is how you should adequately tout yourselves,. Trully disgusting.  ",  Dental Services

I had an upper denture designed for me previously by the Gainesville office and was more than satisfied with the customer service and the results. Two weeks ago, however, one of the anchor teeth that secured the positioning of my upper denture broke in half. I had been informed by the doctors in Gainesville that a tooth can be added to my denture at any time so I went to the Fort Myers office to have just that accomplished. When I got there I was asked if I wanted to have my problem taken care of today or just get an evaluation. I requested to have it done today. I was immediately directed to have a full x-ray of my teeth ( mind you I had asked to just replace the broken tooth ). After taking the x-ray I was seen by an apprentice ... Not DR RUMBOLO and was told to go to a surgeon who's advertisement states that he will work on issues that this affordable dentures office can't handle at a ""minimum"" fee of $2800. After being dismissed by the apprentice doctor, a nurse hurriedly informed me that after I get the work done by their requested surgeon, the amount I would have to pay for my upper full and lower partial would be twice the $750 stated on the paperwork and I was immediately ushered out.

Sometimes, as everyone knows; bills have a habit of piling up some months; and as most people will do, I try to budget my monthly billing money to cover everything by jugguling figures to make my financial ability available to all my creditors....this happened to be one of those months.... Rather than try to ask them to remove the 25 dollar late fee charge when the next billing cycle reached me; I simply paid the balance of 132 dollars outright which includes the late charge.....and if they send me an additional charge there will be hell to pay because then I will report them to the Better Business Bureau. I recommend staying away from Care Credit if you can pay with some other method. I certainly will not deal with them or Aspen Dental ever again for the shady billing practice they employ; since Aspen Dental recommended Care Credit in the first place.

Internet USA ",http://www.artelldental.com/, 956-369-2910,""," I write this for the benefit of anyone considering travel to Mexico for dental work and hope you will read of my nightmare and not try to save money you will later likely spend upon return to the states.  From my home in Houston, Nuevo Progreso is a six hour drive and I thought it worth it to save thousands of dollars on sixteen zirconia crowns that would have been totally unaffordable here.  In July 2013 I decided to go for it and went down for nine days to get the work done.  The dentist at Artell Dental Center, Dr. Jose Gonzalez that I researched and initially began work with disappeared after the second day and left me to another doctor who damaged my teeth so badly I required five root canals over the next six months.  One of the crowns installed by the new doctor failed within 30 days disintegrating in my mouth so I had to return to Progreso to get it fixed. Suspicious that I did not get the indestructible zirconia crowns I paid for, I went to three dentists here in Houston all of whom told me I had terrible work and needed at least half of the crowns removed and replaced.  Xrays revealed that I did not even get zirconisa like I requested and had some inferior substance that fell out of a second crown that fell off a few months later.  The Xrays clearly showed that the crowns were not zirconia and Artell argued with me that they were as ordered and it was not until a Houston dentist wrote directly to Artell that they agreed to replace the crowns with what I paid for. I made the third trip to Progreso to begin the replacement of the crowns incurring all travel expense.  I stayed five days while the uppers were ground off by the endodontist because Dr. Jose was incapable of doing it himself.  There is a process where they shove strings under your gums to make impressions and this is quite painful and they could not get it right and had to repeat the process.  A temporary set of teeth was installed on my uppers and I wassent home. I returned for the fourth trip 10 days later to have the uppers installed and noted they were glaring white and not coated in porcelain as is standard to make them look natural.  I was exhausted and let them install them anyway.  I returned to Houston and found gaps between four of the uppers and the teeth I could stick my fingernail in they were so ill fitted.  They had to send the uppers back to the lab five times to have porcelain built up to try and get them right but clearly did not do. Dr. Jose attempted to fill the gaps with bonding compound but was slopy and now the compoune is covering my gums making it impossible to clean them.  This was done on my fifth trip to get my lower four remaining crowns installed. After all this H$LL clearly the four lower crowns do not fit either as Dr. Jose immediately began applying bonding compound after seating the lower crowns and again covered the gumline.  It is imperative that a crown go inside the gum for hygiene and eight of mine do not.  Dr. Jose also failed to clean up the compound so I have a very rough surface on the inside of my lower molars that is making my tongue sensitive.   Returning to the Houston dentist is as I expected and again eight of the replacement crowns need to be replaced again.  Now that I finally have the super hard zirconia I wanted it is almost impossible to remove them or clean up the bonding patchwork that will definitely cause periodontal disease so my mouth is so screwed up I never should have touched it.   It turns out Dr. Jose only has two years of experience and clearly my case was out of his league.  The standard of acceptable care would never pass American Dental Association standards.  Beware of Mexican Dentists.  A friend of mine went to Torreon for an implant and it broke off into her sinus shortly after treatment.  She does not have the option or desire to seek further treatment from her dentist.  BEWARE OF DENTISTS                   ",  Dental Services

The crown was ill-fitting and was uncomfortable and caused much pain over a 2 year period. The crown always hit other teeth and was miss-aligned with my bite. The crown appeared to be oversized in my mouth and the mechanics appeared to be very ill-fitting like a clown’s tooth. I had several adjustments done by Dr Emmons and Dr. Nguyen that were lengthy sessions of grinding down on the crown. When Dr Emmons and Dr Nguyen did this grinding procedure, which was not just a slight adjustment, but hard and lengthy grinding of the crown. Both Dr Emmons and Dr Nguyen would just then send me on my way with a large rough spot on the crown where the grinding was done and which felt uncomfortable in my mouth. Never did they mention that the crown could be improper and be replaced with a new crown. My last session of grinding was when I was again experiencing severe pain from the tooth with the crown. Dr Nguyen’s solution was to grind the crown again. This resulted in grinding through the crowns porcelain down to the base metal of the crown which was exposed in my mouth? I could not believe that a professional would do this? This procedure again did not correct the problem and I was still in severe pain and my mouth/tooth was infected. I than returned to City Square Dental, at this time they diagnosed another tooth a being the source of the pain (not the tooth with the crown) and recommended extraction of another tooth by an oral surgeon. When I went to the oral surgeon, he diagnosed that the infection was the tooth with the City Square Dental crown. I had a severe infection in my mouth and which was the tooth with the ill-fitting crown, not the tooth that Dr. Nguyen recommended for extraction. It took me several weeks to recover from the infection and now I am missing a tooth which I believe was caused by City Square Dentals procedures. I than proceeded to speak with Both Dr’s Emmons and Nguyen. Dr Emmons blew me off and I did speak with Dr Nguyen about a refund of the poor dental work.

West Melbourne, Florida USA ","", ,"","  I made the HUGE mistake of taking my dental business to Aspen Dental, West Melbourne Fl, last year 06/2013. The dentist was completely incompetent, in my opinion, and I have had many, dental procedures in my life. in June of 2013, I went to Aspen Dental in West Melbourne Fl, I needed to have 6 teeth pulled and a partial denture made and installed. I went to multiple appointments, for impressions, and finally when the time came to have the extractions, the dentist was only able to pull 1 tooth and informed me I would have to go to a oral surgeon to have the extractions completed. This I could understand, I returned approx. 2 weeks later to have a TEMPORARY partial denture installed, that according to the dentist I would have to wear for 6 months, then they would make me a permanent partial denture. I never returned to Aspen dental to have the permanent partial done, I was completely turned off by their practices and lack of planning for my procedures. I went to a new dentist this year to have my permanent denture constructed, when the new dentist tried to file a claim with my insurance, it was denied, based on the fact that they had paid Aspen Dental for a permanent partial denture, the year before. I NEVER received a permanent denture from Aspen Dental.  I went to Aspen Dental in person to address this issue, per instructions from my insurance company. This office no longer employs the dentist, or office manager that were there when I had my work done. I spoke with the new office manager, she informed me that she would be happy to speak with the district manager about my situation on the following Tuesday, and get back with me. I waited until Tuesday afternoon and contacted her again, she inquired as to whether the partial I had received from them had any metal in it, I explained that it did NOT and that there is absolutely no doubt that this piece is a TEMPORARY partial denture. The office manager attempted to tell me that when billed to the insurance company, the same codes for a temporary and permanent partial are used, and that the billing was accurate.  I had to enlist the help of my insurance company to fight the battle for me, the agent from my dental insurance called the office manager and finally corrected her on the codes for temporary vs. permanent. The office manager finally agreed that they had billed incorrectly and agreed to send a retraction (on the ins. company recorded line). After a week of no action from the office manager at Aspen, I called corporate headquarters to address the issue, I have waited over a week since I called the HQ of Aspen Dental, for ANY sort of response, and I have heard NOTHING. My insurance company has had to refer the matter to the fraud department of the company to try to resolve the issue, when informed that this was happening, the office manager of Aspen Dental, West Melbourne Fl, agreed to have a retraction in their office the same day, a week later, they still have not complied. I had one of the worst dental experiences of my life at Aspen Dental West Melbourne Fl, and I thought it was over when I stopped going to this company, but a year later, I am still paying for the mistake of giving Aspen Dental my business.

I was young and just started my new job. I felt I was taken advantage of. This was an in network dentist and I was suppose to be just getting a standard cleaning.  I was charged $50 for some oral exam they I did not know I had to pay until after it was done. Also, they had to do this ""special cleaning"" that 80% of their patients needed. This cost over $300. They told me this was necessary and had to get this done. This was supposed to be a standard cleaning and checkup that my Dental Insurance pays 100% of it. Based on my poor experience I would not recommend this office because I ended up paying over $350 for a standard cleaning. Please note I had no cavities. Also, I have been to other dentists and did not pay anything for my standard cleaning and checkups. This includes an out of network dentist! Yes. I did not pay anything for an out of network dentist my insurance covered all of it!!! Please feel free to file a report if you have had a similar experience.

 Royal Philips  ,"  Royal Philips   3000 Minuteman Rd. 
Andover, Massachusetts USA ","", (978) 659-3000,""," If you are a potential customer of Philips Sonicare toothbrush products, or a dentist who recommends them, read on .....    The corporate culture at the Philips Healthcare division at all levels, is a total disregard for the customer and for the company's legal obligations to honor product warranties.  As you'll see from my experience, this is not an isolated incident; it shows a deliberate and consistent pattern reflective of the corporate culture at the company. I bought the Philips Sonicare toothbrush (Model HX5610/01) on 12/19/2012.   The product consists of a cordless toothbrush and a charger base.  Recently, the charger base stopped working and I can no longer charge the toothbrush.  I had registered the product, and it is still under warranty.  I have been trying to get a replacement charger base through their customer support organization, with no success.  I have also escalated the issue to the head of Consumer ifestyle, and all levels in between.  Instead, I have experienced a pattern of deception and excuses.  I am therefore writing this report - Buyer Beware!! - as it may help some other potential customer or a dentist recommending the product.    Honoring a product warranty is a legal obligation of the company’s.  However, their customer support organization does not see it that way.  Here's a detailed account of the deception and excuses that I have received from this organization.  At this point, I am not that concerned about getting the warranty replacement, as I will be seeking legal measures, but it's the hassle and time consumed to get this company to honor their legal obligations, is what's at the heart of the issue.  First, I contacted customer support via the “chat line” on 2/13/2014.  I have saved a record of this chat conversation.  I was first told that the charger base is an “accessory” and is not covered by the warranty.  After explaining to the representative that the charger base is an integral part of the product, is needed for the product to operate, and not an accessory that is optional, he agreed to send me a replacement charger base. I was informed that it would take 10 days to receive the replacement.  Not having a Sonicare for 10 days was an inconvenience, but I could live with that.  My dentist had told me that I needed to brush with a Sonicare for gum health reasons, so I couldn’t wait much longer than 10 days. 3 weeks later, I had not yet received the replacement charger.   I called to follow up on the warranty replacement.  I was told that it was not shipped, because they needed a serial number.  Of course, it would have been too much to expect that their customer support organization would contact me to let me know this.  I have registered the product, so they have my contact details.  Instead, they chose to ignore the warranty replacement, in the hope that the problem would just go away! On 3/5/2014 I called customer support.  I have a recording of this conversation.  This conversation was so ridiculous, it was almost funny.  Please look out for my posting of this recording on Facebook and Youtube; you'll find it hilarious!! They even lack common courtesy. I was first told that they had no record of any warranty replacement request from me, and she could do nothing without a “conversation reference number” from my previous chat conversation.  I informed her that it was 3 weeks ago, and obviously the item was not shipped. Then, miraculously, she was able to access “notes” regarding my previous chat conversation.  In the notes, apparently, it was stated that they were awaiting a serial number from me. Without the number, there was nothing she could do.  There is no serial number on the brush.   Then, she informed me that she may be able to use a copy of my purchase receipt.  A copy of my purchase receipt is attached to my product registration on their website, and I informed her that it was.  But, she stated that she could not access my product registration.  Really??  So, there was nothing she could do.  “Nothing she could do” was the way every sentence was completed, and a central theme of her conversation. So, I asked to talk to her supervisor.  “No, my supervisor does not take customer calls”.  Really??  A supervisor of a customer support organization does not talk to customers?? So, I asked to talk to the manager of the department, just anyone who was higher up in the organization.  “No, you can’t”.  Really?? So, I wrote/email to the head of their Consumer Lifestyle division and the head of PR, Reputation and Internal Communications, thinking that they might care for a customer.  I promptly received a reply that stated that he has ""escalated this to my colleague in the US who will come back to you.""  Now, 2 weeks later, I am still waiting for someone ""to come back to me"".  So, I wrote/email back a reminder.  This time, complete silence. I am not just venting here; I’m describing my experience in detail so that you can consider it if you are in the market for a Philips Sonicare product.  As you can see, it was not an isolated incident, it happened with me multiple times, and is reflective of their corporate culture.  Reneging on a warranty is not something that is acceptable!  So, Buyer Beware!! My next step is to pursue legal action, and I will get my warranty replacement.  Please look out for my Facebook post and Youtube post of the conversations with their staff.  They are ridiculously funny, as they try to renege on their warranty.   ",  Dental Services

Houston, Texas USA ","", ,""," My name is Peter H - and this is my story....  This lady is THE WORST dentist I've ever had.  For starters, she doesn't even do her own dental work - it is done by her underlings, i.e. her hygeinists.  One of them must have just gotten out of dental school, he was so young.  I have fillings older than him!Speaking of which, I have perfect teeth - no joke.  The only fillings I have were when I was 12 years old and an unscrupulous dentist (who had his license later revoked) conned my parents into filling two ""tiny"" cavities prior to my getting braces.  Turned out I didn't have cavities, and he pocketed the money.Same thing with this lady. She shows up and tells me that I have ""the making of"" a cavity on the left molar, and it would cost $$$ to fill and repair.  Only five minutes of her examination, and she tells me I have a cavity?? WTF???However - six months earlier when I was with my previous dentist (who had retired), he never indicated any problems.  In fact, for the 20 years I'd been going to my other dentist, I'd NEVER had a cavity!Needless to say, I'm having ""incompetent doctor"" flashbacks from 20 years ago.  I calmly told her that I'd get a second opinion before committing an indecent sum of money to a procedure that I (probably) wouldn't need.  She got huffy and said something like, ""Well, it's your mouth"" and walked off!Second opinion with different dentist - NO CAVITY.  Unreal.She also got pissy about being paid. Uh, I'm sorry, Miss Thang, but malpractice doesn't get paid on your timetable, and I also alerted the Texas Dental Association about her questionable diagnosis.On top of that, she apparently hired her husband to be her ""secretary"" and from what I heard from the old staff there, he was a pain in the...tooth.  He rarely got things right, bad attitude etc.  Shows what happens when you force your husband on an office where he really doesn't belong.All in all, avoid this lady and her incompetent boob of a husband if you need a qualified dentist.  She's the pits.UPDATE: Went to my new dentist last month after Christmas.  He took X-rays and told me flat-out that I had no cavities - AFTER Savita Brenner said that I had ""the makings of one.""  She's either incompetent or money-hungry. Probably both.  She should have her license revoked. ",  Dental Services

The dentist made new impressions and ordered another set. He assured us there would be no charge for the replacement. The replacement dentures did fit. That dentist left the company. On 06/29/12 the company filed a claim for the replacement dentures and it was denied. The company refiled on 07/22/13 and the claim was again denied. This was over a year after my wife received the dentures. At no time did Great Expressions contact us about the claim until they started billing us for the dentures. When we finally received a bill for the dentures we contacted the company and explained the replacement dentures were made as a courtesy writeoff by the dentist and we should not have been charged. The company denied the dentures were a writeoff and began billing us again. I located the dentist that did the replacement dentures and he stated the dentures should not have been charged to us.

Boyd, a dentist in Columbia, Missouri at The Colonies Dental Center. Eric R. Boyd  openly sexually harasses female employees, has threatened that he would like to ""teach a lesson"" to a woman after he took over what is now his practice after she quit due to his behavior, telling her that ""he knew where she lived and had firearm(s)"",and makes veiled threats to other staff members such as saying he could understand why Adam Lanza  murdered his mother and several other women (and obviously the children) because ""feminists"" wouldn't let him ""be a man"". He would openly state that he wasn't going to comply with federal laws regarding equal employment practices. He would direct his manager to find any reason she could so that he could terminate employees who got pregnant or were injured so that he would not have to provide maternity or sick leave. Eric R. Boyd is a misogynistic sociopath--don't be fooled by the act he manages to put on for patients. He couldn't care less about 99% of them. His rage towards real doctors (MDs) was palpable and if one came in for hygiene or anything else he'd make the rest of the day hell for staff. He is a typical fat loser with little man syndrome who unfortunately managed to obtain a degree which grants him greater ability to engage in predatory behavior. He has violated HIPAA laws NUMEROUS times by sharing personal photos and health information about patients; He mocked one woman who was a cosmetic veneer consult by posting her photos around the break room and calling her a ""dumb cunt"" among other things. He has stated (see attached proof) that he feels he should be able to leer at and/or grope any woman that is in his office, so if you allow your daughter/wife/whomever in this place then you are a fool.

Total cost was $3.87 for Blizzard White and $3.87 for Bella at Home products. The product was shipped to me 2/18/14 and received 2/20/14. On 2/21/14 they took a $94.31 draw from my checking account. The products came with 2 of each so they waited just enough days so that in 24 hours I had to go in and cancel my account when they already have the draw going on. I called and ended up getting an RMA number to send the unopened product back to them but in the mean time, they have my $94.31 for the next 10 days. Christy, Minnesota ",  Dental Services

So they took an x-ray. $70 and said , sorry that is a complex  extraction you need to go to an oral surgeon..that will be $100 total and go see this doctor. I said ok you told me on the phone you do complex extractions and you have a sign printed posted in the lobby AND ON THE WALL in the exam room and on the website,  saying the cost of a simple extraction $65 and the cost of a complex extraction. Their response was that they were a franchise and they dont go by that .. they don't do complex extractions $115. I was suckered.. there is no complex extraction at this place!!!~!it is a way for him to generate money in referrals to his friends practice..

Madison, Virginia USA ",http://www.kleinedental.com/, ,""," This is really a case of be weary of what you sign.  So I'm looking for a Dentist and I walk into their practice.  I received the basic medical questionnaire forms to fill out in addition to the ""Patient Financial Responsibility Agreement"".  Some of the literature state's, ""billing my insurance company is a courtesy and not an obligation of this office"".  Okay, fair enough.  I continue to read.  Upon reading it I find some questionable practices.  It goes on to say: 1)  ""I acknowledge that any insurance claims pending beyond sixty (60) days are my responsibility...I agree to pay interest on the total unpaid monthly balance at the rate of 18% APR, such interest to begin if the account is sixty (60) days past due, and calculated from the date of service"". Meaning, if there is a simple human error with your insurance company, a backlog, or the insurance company does not process your claim within the dental office's time limit, then come the 61 day the customer will be paying the full amount plus 18% interest. 2)  ""I hereby waive the benefit of my homestead exemption, and all other exceptions"".  I asked what this meant, and they could not or would not tell me.  Later, I did some research and found that the Homestead Exemption provides a variety of protection for the consumer/homeowner.  One specifically, prevents ""the forced sale of a home to meet the demands of creditors."" It also prevents creditors from kicking your family out of your house should you die before paying off your bill.   I have never seen such actions placed in the financial agreement of a medical office.  Your home could be sold to pay off a $1,000 bill.  This should be between you and the collection agency, not the dental office. 3)  ""I authorize this office or representative to pull my credit report for the purposes of collection activities"".  Why would they need to pull your credit report?  Isn't that the job of the debt collector agency?  So, now you're getting multiple hits on your credit report which brings down your credit score. There were other discrepancies with their ""Financial Responsibility Agreement"", such as including communication authorization release in their financial release document.  That should be a separate document, or rename the document.  I was completely confused about what their objective was.  Were they a dentist office, debt collection agency, or a debt collection agency providing dental services?   I told them I could not sign an agreement which I did not understand.  The result was them not wanting to provide dental service unless I paid up front, even though I had dental insurance and was willing to pay what the insurance didn't cover.  I walked out of there without dental service, but my rights intact.  Maybe this is an extreme example, but after understanding what this document is, and if I had signed it, I would be allowing this dental office to exponentially charge me (for errors beyond of my control), take my home (should life obstacles happen, and they weren't willing to work with me), and ruin my credit score.

I ordered a kit, thankfully paid with a card that's insured against fraud, so they will go after him for me - but this is my story: I went to the site, got to the online chat, someone, who seemed to be very very busy answered my questions reasonably well, so I ordered a kit. Because I read a couple of negative reviews, I decided to do the 2 payment rather than one. I filled everything, read ALL terms and conditions (which by the way are sent to you in the email confirmation after your payment) - and made sure my billing and mailing addresses were correct, since they are different - and during the process of ordering you are asked a FEW times to make sure the addresses are correct. They charge you 46.00 for shipping with SIGNATURE DELIVERY. hum hum. Days passed, we had a snow storm, delivery was delayed... no problem. yesterday, while iI am troubleshooting my son's computer, i get a message the kit had been delivered - to my BILLING address. !??!?!?!I go check my email to make sure I hadn't made a mistake and no, shipping and billing addresses are correct. So absolutely incredibly frustrating! Anyway, I am in my gmail account at this point, and I sent a reply using my purchase receipt telling them they had sent the kit to the wrong address and to check the email above that had BOTH addresses clearly.Now, the kick - my son's computer, the one I am troubleshooting, has the SHIFT key stuck, so everything is in CAPS LOCK. Knowing that, to give it even more emphasis, I type ""shipped to the wrong address"" in red.  I have a company of my own - I receive a LOT of emails all day and I know it's nice to be able to skim the messages and identify if there are any problems to address them. Nest day - today - Sunday morning. I get a call and can't get to the phone in time - I listen to the voicemail: it's this man saying ""this is from brighter labs, I received tne email from you this morning, call me back or I will cancel your order."" Hmmm. who? no name, just ""brighter labs"". who is that?? so i google it - THEN i discover this pressonveneers.net has another 31 sites and names. sigh. I am more annoyed - you know, when you identify this tone on the phone and the feeling you have been scammed?? So I call back - and this is the hilarious part - This man, Bill Watson, says ""I got your email on a Sunday morning and I don't like your tone"" and ""I don't think I want to work with you"".LOL Hmmm WHAT?I am staring at my screen going ""what? did I call someone for a job interview I don't need by mistake?"" He goes on saying that if I red the shipping terms and conditions (which I am sure he forgot came with my confirmation email and he cannot change on his site today as I read has happened before) they only ship to billing addresses. NOT TRUE AT ALL. this is what it says, verbatum: ************************************************************************* Shipping Policy   Please review and verify your shipping address on all orders.

We never had any dental work done except cavities filled before that.  We understand that teeth age, just like people.  In the time with Festival, I was advised to get two caps and my husband was diagnosed with peridontal disease, which requires expensive scaling and follow up for life. I got one cap done when it was recommended.  A year or so later during a routine cleaning it was recommended that I get another.  I didn't do it then because the estimate was for $920.00.  I'm a retired teacher and not readily able to spend that.  However, two months later I received an email that all services were $200 off for a limited time.  So I went to have the tooth worked on and the cap done.  I need to explain that this is a very ""tech"" office.  They ask you to sign a little black box for every permission and every treatment.  I try to be an informed consumer and asked to see what I was signing every time.  I asked for all of the treatment options to be explained.  No one was verbally rude, but it was obvious that the office staff resented the slow down that all of that required.  I actualy asked them to turn the screen toward me before signing the little black box. When asked to sign the little black box for the treatment amount, I asked why the amount was the same as the estimate given in May.  I once again, (had mentioned it when making the appointment) asked about my $200 discount which they had advertised.  Then it was listed on the little screen but the total was the same.  I asked why?  In the vaguest of language, I was told to mention it when it was time to actually pay. After hours in the chair with my mouth open I was exhausted.  I only have so much energy for the day.  I finally went out to pay and once again asked about the discount.  With a smiling face, the clerk said it had been taken off.  I was so tired and disgusted I paid the $920.00, no discount. Today was the first time I have been back. I had a filling come out and a tooth started to splinter.  They gave me an appointment for the next day, which I appreciated.  The charges came out to about $135 or 153, I don't remember exactly because I didn't get a paper. I'll explain. I asked to talk to the office manager about that $200 discount.  He looked up my records and said that they didn't say anything about a $200 discount.  I explained that it bothered me then and still bothers me.  He asked if I had a copy of the email that the discount offer came from.  I said no, not an email from July.  I asked if he had a copy of their email.  No, of course not.  He offered to meet me halfway and give me $100 credit.  He said here it was January and I hadn't done anything about it. I said I wanted my $200.  I wouldn't have had the work done except for that $200 off offer.  He said again that he'd meet me halfway and pretty much said that unless I could prove that I was one of the patients who received the offer he didn't believe me.  I aksed how much I owed for today and that my husband and I wouldn't be back.  He said he'd write off today and I wouldn't owe anything.  The phone on the desk rang, and he held up a hand indicating I should wait and he would get back to me.  There were two other people in the office who could have answered the phone.  I walked out.

Go look at her Healthgrades on Healthgrades.com. 2 1/2 stars reviewed by 24 people. Kenyon B. Hill screwed my family over with a bait and switch. She is a total ripoff and not a nice person. My wife Jennifer wanted a pretty white smile. She had saved her hard earned money up before we met working in the medical industry as a nurse for a well known doctor in Dallas, TX. She was a single mom with two beautiful children. Her teeth were already pretty but she wanted that movie star smile. She chose Dr. Kenyon B. Hill DDS in Rockwall, TX to do the cosmetics. My wife even talked me into going there to get my teeth cleaned. I had had $20,000 of cosmetic work done on my own teeth from another local dentist. My wife insisted Kenyo Hill was a good dentist. I went to get the teeth cleaned. The office was dirty, old & out dated equipment, staff was very rude especially the fat girl working behind the front desk. [continued below]....
									
										..... There was only one that worked there that was nice, can't remember her name. When I met Kenyon Hill I could tell imediately she was fake. She had a personality of a know it all. I wasn't impressed. I left. I told my wife I wasn't impressed with Kenyon B. Hill DDS in Rockwall, TX. My wife had already put a huge deposit to begin her cosmetics. After it was completed her teeth did not look the same. They were yellow compared to her original teeth. Definitely not white. Of course I could tell this troubled her. I did not say what I saw for respect for her feelings. I wanted her to come to me about it. She did. She cried many nights not happy with the $10,000 she spent to get yellow teeth. She went back several times to voice her concern but Dr. Kenyon B. Hill DDS in Rockwall, TX ignored her concern. After a year I had enough of watching her pain.  We were contacted by a previous employee that quit Dr. Kenyon B. Hill DDS in Rockwall, TX because of the unethical practice she was doing on patients. She said Kenyon B. Hill DDS in Rockwall, TX was mentally unstable. She said Kenyon B. Hill DDS in Rockwall, TX showed Jennifer the top of the line teeth named LAVA made 3M and Jennifer picked out the whitest color. Then when ordering Dr. Kenyon Hill DDS in Rockwall, TX ordered a lower end brand and while Jennifer was under anethisia Dr. Kenyon Hill in Rockwall, TX put the cheaper brand on Jennifer's teeth. Totally unethical!!! Kenyon B. Hill is a crook. I contacted Kenyon B. Hill DDS in Rockwall, TX and demanded Jennifer's money $10,000 to be returned or we would pursue legal action. Kenyon Hill sent Jennifer text messages finally with concern when we told her we were contacting an attorney. Kenyon Hill is a liar, crook, thief, bait & switch specialist. For Gos sake do your research before choosing this dentist. Jennifer is going to another dentist to fix the mess Dr. Kenyon Hill D.D.S. in Rockwall, TX caused. It is costing $15,000 to remove & replace the cheap teeth with the LAVA top of the line 3M product she originally wanted.  SHAME ON YOU DR. KENYON B. HILL DDS by the way you aren't a DOCTOR you're a cheap soory of an excuse DENTIST!!! FYI: The picture on the website www.kenyonhilldds.com is not her true picture. It was taken 20 years ago.

Rockwall, Texas USA ",www.kenyonhilldds.com, (972) 771-9196,""," BAIT & SWITCH BEWARE of Dr. Kenyon Hill D.D.S. it is a SCAM dental office that lures patients with offering high end cosmetic products but delivers a cheaper product without the patient knowing while under anethisia.  I had always had beautiful teeth, but after an accident I needed a tooth repaired. I was referred to Dr. Kenyon Hill by a vendor for a surgeon I worked for. I went in for a consultation expecting her to repair the damaged tooth. I was talked into replacing 8 of my top teeth in order to match the one that was damaged; I understood that concept. I expressed to Dr. Kenyon Hill that I loved my current teeth and wanted to maintain my original smile and my white teeth, which I was always getting compliments for. I expressed to Dr. Kenyon Hill and staff that I wanted to have my teeth whiter than what I currently had (which were very white). I asked Dr. Kenyon Hill to order the Lava brand, by 3M, and she said she would order that brand. [continued below]....
									
										..... After a couple of weeks of pain and misery, my teeth were finally ready to be put in. I was numbed up and the new teeth were placed after several hours. I wasn't allowed to see them until they were bonded & cemented in my mouth. I was disappointed with the color from the beginning, which I verbalized from that day forward. I was told to ""get used to them"" and to ""give them some time"" and that they were the whitest shade. THEY WERE NOT AND THEY ARE UGLY. I called numerous times & visited with her several times over the past year to discuss my unhappiness with the color of the teeth. I have been embarrased by the color of the teeth ever since the beginning. I have always smiled a lot in photos and now I avoid cameras or smiling while showing my teeth; they are a yellow-grayish color. This has completely destroyed my self esteem and caused scores of emotional damage. Everyday I look in the mirror, I want, and sometimes do, cry.  At one of the last visits with Dr. Kenyon Hill, I, again, cried in her office and explained that the color wasn't what I wanted. I asked for whiter teeth. She then brought out a shade guide and pointed to the shade in which she ordered for me. I was WAY off of the whitest shades.  I finally gained the courage to confront her and demanded my money back so that I could get my smile back. She refused and said that she would fix them - for a price. I had lost all faith in her since she didn't listen to my concerns earlier. I did visit with other dentists who said the teeth's shape was nice, but the color was way off of what they would've chosen for my smile. They all agreed that I should've been able to see the teeth temporarily and approved them BEFORE they were permanently cemented in.  I received a call at my job from a confidential informant that used to work in her practice. The informant stated that they remembered how unhappy and miserable I was and gave me some interesting advice. I was told that the Lava brand in which I ordered, was not the brand that Dr. Kenyon Hill ordered. She, instead, ordered a cheaper, uglier brand and charged me for the expensive Lava brand. When we requested my records, all I was allowed to receive were my x-rays. I needed the records, not only for medical reasons, but for the warranty information on the current teeth. I still have not been able to obtain my full records - not even my current dentist has been able to get them. Beware of their office; they are hurting for money and actually had the audacity to continue calling me even after they knew I was unhappy, to schedule an appointment for a cleaning. I've heard a lot of really bad things about this office. I should've listened to my husband's advice - he went in for a cleaning once and said he would never go back. Their equipment is way out dated and old.  Word to the wise - do your research! Visit with several offices before settling on one, even if you have a recommendation. I should've trusted my gut. I feel I was ""played"" so that she could get more money. When I found about her scheme, it's funny how my records vanished... The pain and suffering I've had to go through has been horrible. I was once an outgoing, bubbly, smiling person, now I sit in silence because I'm embarrassed by the horrible discolored teeth this dentist chose to order.  ",  Dental Services

When I first received the DIAL A SMILE KIT... I followed the directions exactly, but when it came time to apply the ""GEL"" to my teeth, the ""GEL"" would not stick to my teeth. I wasted over a half hour trying to get this slimey and slippery gel to stick to my teeth, but it would always slide down between my lower lip and gums. I called WHITENING LIGHTNING Customer Support who blamed the problem on me. Eventually I spoke to a supervisor who agreed to send me a new 5Ml syringe of the DIAL A SMILE GEL. After a few weeks I recieved not the 5ML GEL for the LIGHT ACTIVATED DIAL A SMILE KIT, but a 3ML syringe that is not for use with the light activaied DIAL A SMILE KIT, but is used with the dental tray system. I called WHITENING LIGHTNING Customer Support again, and a customer support agent argued with me that the 3ML syringe they sent me was the same as the 5ML GEL for the LIGHT ACTIVATED DIAL A SMILE KIT. I again called back and again spoke with a supervisor who admited the 3ML syringe that was sent to me was not the correct gel to be used with the LIGHT ACTIVATED DIAL A SMILE KIT and the supervisor apologized and promised to send me the correct 5ML gel that is used with the LIGHT ACTIVATED DIAL A SMILE KIT.  After a few more weeks... again I recieved not the 5ML GEL for the LIGHT ACTIVATED DIAL A SMILE KIT, but again I was sent another 3ML syringe that is not for use with the light activaied DIAL A SMILE KIT, but is used with the dental tray system.

great neck, New York USA ",http://www.sedation-cosmeticdentistry.com, ,""," Do not use Dr. Barry Jason, he's a scam artist!  He stole from me!  The Backstory: So I didn't have dental insurance a few years ago, so I used to do what a lot of people do, which is to buy Groupon type coupons for dental services.  Did this a few times until I got myself some decent dental insurance.  I bought a Groupon for the Smile Authority that sent me to Dr. Barry Jason in Great Neck, NY and never used it.  Even though I had gotten insurance insurance, i figured ""hey, i have this coupon might as well use it."" The coupon was $39 for $300 worth of cleaning services (which is an obviously inflated number, no great neck dentist charges that much).  I head over to his office for a routine cleaning. [continued below]....
									
										.....  the office was ugly, old and dingy.  But whatever who cares right?    The Visit with Dr. Barry Jason, DDS:   The visit started off well enough. We started talking about my teeth and I mentioned that my two front teeth were broken and temporarily fixed, which means i need permanent crowns on the two fronts, and probably the next two also. Thats worth about $10,000 of work.  Its here that the interaction went completely south.  He smelled the money and spent the next THIRTY MINUTES trying to sell me on doing the cosmetic work with him.  IMPORTANT MOMENT: I mentioned that I was insured.  He insisted on me giving him my insurance card and signing a document authorizing him on it (he claimied he needed the document to check to see what benefits they'd pay for).  I was promised that there would be no charges...sure... I swear to God he spent no more than 5 minutes on my cleaning after wasting a HALF HOUR talking about cosmetic work.  But of course thats not so bad.  Annoying yes, scam...no.    Over the edge: The next two weeks were peppered with calls from Dr. Barry Jason's office asking when I wanted to come in for the cosmetic work. I told the office lady (who's name i forget) that I wasn't saying no, but i would like to at least speak to another destist to get a second quote.  She responds with, ""oh, okay."" and immediately hangs up.  No goodbye, no nothing. A week later my insurance notifies me that Dr barry has charged FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS on my insurance!!!  FOUR HUNDRED!  THATS MORE THAN THE ADVERTISED PRICE!  Now you might think ""so what, its your insuarance"".  Well i have an annual cap, and that money was needed for the oral work i was going to be getting.  Now i'm out $400 on my cap. I call Dr. Barry Jason's office in great neck, obviously very upset.  I tell the office lady i want that money refunded.  She gives me some lip about looking into it and hangs up.  The next day I call again, no answer. I leave a message threatening to go to the ADA and BBB. The next day I call again, this time Dr. Jason takes the phone...and I swear i couldn't belive it...starts SCREAMING AT ME.  LOUD!  I have never been yelled at by a doctor this way.  He screams ""I HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHARGE WHATEVER I WANT! YOU SIGNED THE DOCUMENT!"" and he hung up. They haven't returned a single call of mine since.    Stay away from this scumbag!! ",  Dental Services

 Dr. Bass Oral Surgery ,"  Dr. Bass Oral Surgery  6940 Parkwood Drive, Suite 300  
Frisco, Texas USA ",www.txoralsurgery.com, ,""," The Dr.'s office failed to file the insurance portion of the claim in a timely manner. A mistake they admitted. Around 2010 I had a procedure performed by Dr. Bass that cost around $8,000 in round numbers. I paid my portion right up front in full - $6,600 There was a remaining $1,114 to be covered by my insurance. Dr. Bass check the insurance and recieved assurance of payment for the $1,114. The procedure took more than 7 months to complete - so they had plenty of time to make sure of things were proper. They even sent me a final statement marked ""PAID IN FULL"". About a year after the completion of the procedure, I received a bill from Dr. Bass' office for the $1,114 with a written note stating on it that they had failed to make the insurance filing at the proper time but were now in the process of attempting to collect those funds now. The not went on to assure me that no action was due on my part. Over the next year I received about 10 of these letters from Dr. Bass. I then started getting calls from a collection agency making threats of non-payment. They escalated very quickly in tone. When I asked Dr. Bass' office about them they said it was a mistake and the calls would stop. I remind them that I had paid my obligation and they were the ones that made the mistake - they agreed. When the creditor calls continued I called the office and stated that they needed to stop ASAP. It was then that Dr. Bass' office asked if I would call the insurance, Met, and tell them to pay the claim and provide some additional information. When I called Met Life, they told me that Dr. Bass had made a mistake not filing in a timely manner which had resulted in them filing outside the window.That it was his offices' fault and I shouldn't concern myself with Dr. Bass' administrative mistake. Again, I had paid my agreed upon portion 100% up front. The calls and letters continued until Dr. Bass turned it over to yet another collection agency. Dr. Bass' office said that I was liable because I wouldn't spend the time they deemed necessary to gel them in researching where and when the original procedure, a root canal, had been performed, so that the claim would be valid. Turns out Dr. Bass lied to Met telling them that the delay was actually due to my not being willing to provide needed information and that it was not their administrative miscue. Keep in mind that the first letter I received from Dr. Bass about this whole thing was more than a year after the procedure and that letter was the first of many that had a hand written note on it stating I didn't need to do anything. What Dr. Bass is doing is fraud. They are telling the insurance company that they need reimbursement because it wasn't that they filed late, but rather because they didn't have all the information they needed. Keep in mind that almost every bill Dr. Bass send to me regarding this either said ""paid in full on your portion"" and "" don't worry - we made a mistake"". Now they are going to game the system and need to show that I must have somehow withheld information that allowed them to file. Again - fraud. I have made more than 25 phone calls concerning this trying to help them resolve the issue. I have answered more than 60 calls from creditors and have had to pay for call blocking just to stop the calls. Dr. Bass is working the system because he can bully insurance companies into paying when they make mistakes. When that doesn't work the office manager doesn't want to risk losing her job so she goes full court threat. I have paid 100% of my portion and didn't sign on as an administrative assistant to the office. They need to work it out with Met - not me. They also need to stop the lies and admit they failed to file. Take what comes with that..... ",  Dental Services

, Select State/Province USA ","", ,"", I went to Paces Dentistry for a consultation for a tooth about 3-4 years ago. That was my first and only visit to that practice. I didn’t like the way they treated me. And instead of taking an X-ray of only one tooth I cared about they took X-rays of all teeth in my mouth (so they can charge for it I presume). Also I didn’t like what they told me for my tooth so after they wrote down my insurance I left. I went to another place to take care of my problem. 4 (FOUR) YEARS LATER I receive a call from a collection agency that I had a debt with Paces Dentistry and I had to pay $569 for my visit from 4 years ago including the collection fee. I called the Paces Dentistry then and when I asked them why they didn’t send a claim to my insurance then they didn’t know. The office manager was not friendly at all but she insisted I had to pay what I awed them now otherwise I get sent to collection. I had to silently pay the full amount to avoid a bigger evil. I'm not debating their charges here. They are crazily overpriced and if I had known then I wouldn't have set foot in their practice. But if they had sent the claim to my insurance then I didn’t have to pay for everything out of pocket. That's the whole reason people have insurance.

 Western Dental ,"  Western Dental  320 Cherokee Ln 
Lodi, California USA ",www.westerndental.com, 209-371-0709,""," We are a military family who recently relocated from out-of-state. I cracked a temporary cap over the holiday and simply needed the temporary repaired until I can find a new regular dentist and have impressions taken and a permanent cap ordered. I found Western Dental through the Army health insurance website, as they are a preferred network provider. I made an appointment for the same day and arrived early; despite the former, I still waited for over one hour before being seen. They called my name and brought me into what looked like the makeshift examining room of a hospital in a third-world country. I had my records and x-rays in hand from my regular family dentist (of 11 years) ; they refused them and instead, took full x-rays (billing my insurance $200). Why they needed xrays at this time to simply repair a temporary tooth was beyond my reasoning at the time, but I assumed I would be continuing care with them in the future, so I cooperated. Following xrays, they formulated an extensive treatment plan for basically every single thing you could possibly think of (including replacing a set of costly partials which are less than 3 years old); then worked up an equally extensive bill and payment plan. Additionally, to my chagrin, they checked my credit without my knowledge or consent (in all fairness, it is likely that consent may have been hidden away somewhere in minute writing in the volumes of redundant paperwork I had to fill out before I was seen...so that might be an oversight on my part for not reading every single thing thoroughly). Finally, after much frustration and delay, I expressed to them that I could not enter into any financial contract or obligation without first speaking with my husband. I also asked if they were going to fix my temporary cap today, so that I could leave with my tooth repaired: the issue I originally came in to have resolved!! They said no, that I would need dental surgery to resolve it and they scheduled an appointment for 3 days later. They told me I could, at that time, work out a plan based on accomplishing the dental work incrementally; and therefore, enabling a more affordable solution. They flat out refused to make a cap for me (in the future) if I intended to keep the partials I currently have. In order to get my cap I would have to agree to having them make me a knew set of partials. I told them that I had already spent over $10,000 on my teeth in the last 3 years and was not expecting to have such an expense so soon. I reluctantly returned to have the recommended procedure (crown lengthening and temporary cap). However, after agreeing to have the procedure and pay for it in full that day, they still insisted I sign a contract for the remaining work (which could not be performed until the site healed in 6 weeks). I declined and questioned why I would pay for services that far into the future that would not be performed for over 6 weeks. She went to ask the dentist....THE DENTIST...about the contract and he said no, he would not do the procedure unless I contracted for the future work, as it is a packaged deal. I said, so he will not fix my tooth today? Even if I pay for it right now? She said, ""no."" I thanked her for her time and left the office. This place has Dentists wheeling and dealing with patients over monetary contracts. Any time you have a doctor or dentist discussing money or the cost of procedures with you....you should run the other way. A true professional will have the personnel to deal with billing and other such concerns. Doctors should not be selling and haggling- it's not a car dealership! They should be focused on doing their job, providing quality patient care. Additionally, I noticed the volume of people they were servicing; the majority relied on Medi-Cal, so probably have few options with where they can go for care. This place just adds on as many procedures as they can to unsuspecting people who trust these scam artists; they then bill insurance for as much as they can and pressure people into signing contracts for payment plans. I have never heard of a dentist refusing to provide service, especially to a patient willing to pay in full, with the caveat of the patient forced to commit to future procedures AND pay for them that far in advance. Western Dental's practices are highly unethical and predatory. Additionally, their customer service and patient care are non-existent. If you have the option to do so, go somewhere else. They have a terrible reputation for the quality of their dental work in addition to all that I have noted. They are scam artists; highly manipulative and not interested in patient care; patients are merely cattle with dollar signs to these people.  ",  Dental Services

Las Vegas, Nevada USA ","", ,""," Hello,  I am writing to you in reguards to an incidint at your Craig location in Las Vegas. Im not one to complain but I feel I should let you know what happened to me. I had called and made an appointment for this past Monday the 6th. For both myself and my son Zachary A. When I was on the phone, I asked the lady if they had time to do an extraction because she made our appt for so late in the day. It was for 6:00 pm. She told me yes. We talked a little about the reason for my visit and I told her I had an abccess and I also wanted to dicuss my insurance and what exactly they covered. I had an unfortunte event in my life that has made me eligible for medicade and my goal is to get off medicade. Until I am able to do so, my case worker had told me I might be able to get approved for partials.  I  have needed to have my teeth fixed for a long time so this was something I was looking forward to. Well when I went to my appointment, I had exrays taken for the one tooth that was infected. The dentist agreed that it was abcessed but told me it could be saved by having a root canal and cap put on. That he would send me to a specialtist. Well not only could I not afford that, I had been in so much pain for the past five days I wanted it pulled. I had been taken antibiotics and that is the only reason I could even funtion. Anyway, they told me they could not pull my tooth that visit and that I would need to make another appt and come back and have a complete exam which of course my insurance did not cover. So knowing my tooth was getting worse by the minute, I had no choice but to make another appt.  It was made for Thursday the 9th. I only had two antibiotics left and had asked Rosie if she would ask the dentist if he would write me a prescription for a few antibiotis to get me through till Thursday. She flat told me no and told me I would become amune to them. So I left and came back on Thursday in a lot of pain thinking this was the day all this pain would end. Wrong.... They took exrays of my whole mouth and proceded to tell me how many root canals I needed and how many caps I needed to have replaced. Never once mentioning pulling my tooth. My appt was at three. They had plenty of time to pull my tooth. But after the exam, they wanted to know how I was going to pay and when was a good time to start everything that needed to be done. I told her I needed my tooth pulled before ANYTHING..  So she made me a third appt for today, Friday the 10th. Well , im in so much pain and my face is so swollen that I cant get out of bed. What is wrong with the people in this office? I really cant believe it. Im trying to get in to see another dentist to get antibiotics and have my tooth pulled. The one dental asst was very nice but everyone one else had no interest in you as a patient what so ever..  And one more thing. After my first appt was made, I must of had over 20 calls conforming my appt by a recording saying if I was to schedual and keep and complete my appt, that I would be given a $30.00 gift card to Target. My son had a full exam, cleaning, and 5 cavities filled. I think I kept my end of the bargin but they never once mentioned the gift card. They didnt even give my son a toothbrush. Which I can buy my sons toothbrush and whatever I may need from Target, its just the pricable. And last but not least, you waiting room was very dirty. Thank you for hearing me out, and thank you for your time. I wish I had of had a better experience. Donna E H ",  Dental Services

, Select State/Province USA ",http://www.tanyardspringsfamilydentistry.com/, ,"", I Transfered my twin 8 yr olds to Tanyard Springs Dentist from Snodgrass ( About 15 minutes away from eachother) because Tanyard possed to be an easier commute.  My girls have had FULL dental insurance through Delta Dental . When I got to Tanyard they asked for my insurance card ( which they made a copy) . My girls had 3 fillings all together ( keeping in mind they are 8 ) .  After this was all done my girls and I temporarily moved BACK to seattle ( where the insurance is linked to) for 7 months. This past week I received a letter from a collection company stating that I owed near 700.00 for 3 fillings on a child. NEVER during this time Have i received a phone call to let me know that they did not accept my insurance ( my girls were fully covered at the previous dentist in the next town over) to add to this they over charged for fillings at the MAX rate accepted by an insurance carrier. ( again NEVER was I given an EOB or a phone call to discuss this topic). Because I have made a huge effort to pay ALL my bills as a single mom struggling as it is this was a HUGE shock that I was being put in collections and at an astronomical cost. I wanted to take care of this and get to the bottom of this so I politely called tanyard springs and they put me through to the Manager ( billing ) Rhonda I think is her name) and she got on the phone. When I asked why they didnt follow procedure before our scheduled appt and call me to let me know that they did NOT infact accept my insurance. She snapped at me and told me that I am in collections and she does not have to speak with me. She proceeded to get nasty with me and tell me that It was my responsibility and that I should know WHAT and WHERE my insurance is accepted. I then told her that she was being so hurtful and demeaning to me and all I wanted was to see why all this has happened . SHe told me she has been working in dentistry for MANY years as she chuckled .  I asked her to provide me with an explanation as to WHERE the high bill came from ans she told me that she does not need to explain and that it was a filling and they are able to bill the insurance companies at max rates. I am 32 years old and have had fillings throughout my life/... NEVER have i had to pay 377.00 for a filling . She refused to give me anymore info and continued to make a joke out of the issue.  I have had crowns that have costed me 700.00 . A childs cavity doesnt fall in that category as I have been advised by two other dentists in my area. All I ask is clarification and communication with me regarding the astronomical charge along with never informing me of not accepting the girls insurance. Why would I have transfered from a dentist that was fully covering my children under insurance to a dentist 15 min closer to me that over charged and did NOT accept my insurance>?? I am a single mom and have been for 9 yrs now.  I dont have the luxery to be able to pay 700.00 for a filling when my girls are fully covered. ,  Dental Services

Irving, Texas USA ",www.drainsworthdds.com/, 972-255-0544,"","  Dr. Joseph Ainsworth is really too old to still be practicing in my opinion and I would not recommend Dr. Joseph Ainsworth of Irving, Texas for orthodontic treatment. I went to him for orthodontic treatment years ago and his hands were shaking so badly, his assistant had to take over for him and finish the work. I am amazed to see that he is still in practice. Orthodontist Joseph Ainsworth is probably in his mid 70's back then and his hands shaked so badly due what I assumed was due to his old age that he was not able to change the arch wires on my braces. His assistants had to change the wires as he simply could not hold his hands steady enough to do the job. He then checked the assistants work and that was it. And I was paying all this money for a dental assistant to treat me? How he is able to still practice orthodontics, which requires manual dexterity, is beyond me. I ended up transferring to another orthodontist and sent Mr. Ainsworth a letter asking for a partial refund for the money I had paid him up front for work he had not yet done. Josiph Ainsworth refused to refund these funds and I filed a complaint against him with the Texas State Dental Board. They refused to take any action and the reason was they said it was a business matter, not a matter of him being incompetent, which was another issue. I would advise anyone seeking orthodontic treatment to steer clear of this guy that refuses to retire and choose another orthodontist for your treatment – one that actually does the work you are paying him for.

I received a postcard in the mail from Dr. Weisel of Family Dentistry of Largo. The ""New Patient"" special promised Cleaning, Exam & Xrays for $59. Let me specify that there were no disclaimers or small print stating that there were exceptions to the offer. On or about 12/27/13 I called their office and explained that I had received the card in the mail with the $59 special but it was to expire at the end of 2013. She said it would not be a problem and they would honor the offer so I made an appointment and showed up a few minutes early on Jan. 6 with all the paperwork already filled out that I had downloaded from their Website. It was almost 45 minutes before they finally brought me into the exam room. The assistant took Xrays and left the room. About 30 minutes later the doctor finally came in and introduced himself, then proceeded to examine my teeth. [continued below]....
									
										..... He then advised me what he felt was necessary to correct any dental problems I had. He also suggested I let him refer me to a specialist to look at one tooth to get another opinion before proceeding to do work on that tooth. He said he would draw up an estimate of costs. He spent about 15-20 minutes with me and then left. After another 10 minutes the assistant came in and told me that I would have to make another appointment for my cleaning. I told her that I was supposed to get the Xrays, cleaning, and exam in one visit. She apologized and said there was no one available to do the cleaning and I would have to come back. I told her I was not going to come back and they needed to do the cleaning today. She said she would be right back and left for about ten minutes. She returned and said that the doctor would do the cleaning but he would have to do an advanced cleaning plus a laser treatment. I asked what the cost was and she said she would have to check. She left again and it was another ten minutes before she returned saying she was still trying to get a price. Finally she came in with a form she wanted me to sign saying it was an estimate of the costs... somewhere around $250 (can't remember the exact price). I told her to just do the minimum cleaning, I didn't want the advanced cleaning or the laser treatment. She said the doctor would not do the minimum cleaning,.. it would have to be the whole deal. I told her I was very dissatisfied and planned on leaving. She asked me to wait while they figured out what they could do. After another ten minutes of waiting, I got up and went to the front desk. The assistant and the receptionist were working at the computer putting a revised estimate together and presented it to me showing that they were going to take $19 off the price because I would not be getting the minimum cleaning but was to get the advanced cleaning instead. I told her I had been in the office as a new patient for over two hours and I had nothing to show for it. I did not get the cleaning, I had a brief conversation and exam by the dentist, and I had Xrays that were of no value to me because I had no plans to return because of the fraudulent experience. Again, let me clearly state the the offer was for exam, cleaning and Xrays... no exceptions to that offer. She finally told me I did not have to pay anything, knowing fully well I had no intention of paying for this waste of over two hours of my time plus travel back and forth.

go and get it, i clearly ask her is the $4200 includes everything. so i went ahead and ask her to pull my partners credit first, but unfortunately she said that my partners credit was not approved, so

She said she wouldn't be able to complete my root canal because it was about $1,200 and there was an issue with my insurance, I applied for CareCredit during my visit which I was denied. Despite me explaining to Dr. Kakaris I couldn't afford it and I would have to return when I resolve my insurance problem, she went ahead and proceeded with the root canal and filling anyway. I assumed she was still examining my teeth when I asked her what was going on now. She said ""Oh, I'm doing the root canal, you wouldn't have even known if I didn't tell ya, huh? LOL!"" Although I had effective insurance I still had to pay out of pocket the amount of $330.00 on November 1st 2013. After the procedure was 50% complete she said you'll have to come back so you can get it finished. [continued below]....
									
										..... I did so on Nov 22nd. Then she said I needed another root canal and she started the 2nd one and stated she completed the 1st one which she didn't according to my current dentist. I had a severe infection with 2 unfinished root canals. My insurance explained to my I'd be reimbursed the full amount or at least 80%. Dr. Kakaris's office didn't submit the claim until I called them after about 3-4 attempts. On 3-way with my insurance and their office, I discovered they billed my insurance and myself and they didn't submit the accurate services I received. Dr. Kakaris called me and explained I needed a 3rd root canal and a crown after she was looking over my x-rays. My current dentist verified that wasn't necessary and either was any of the root canals, I just needed my wisdom teeth pulled. I find that this doctor and her employees were very deceptive. Unfortunately, I researched online reviews after the fact only to discover I wasn't their first victim. Dr. Kakaris comes off as a very sweet, sincere, genuine honest doctor who cares about her patients.

But we needed to perform a quick regular cleaning and checkup before we left for a overseas assignment and the Woodfield location suggested using the East Dundee location, since the Woodfield Mall location was over booked.  This was the worst suggestion to date by Dental Works.  The dentist Loretta C. Davis DDS not only sold us floride sealing that we did not ask for, but then told me that I had a cavity that needed repair.  When I ask if I can see the x-ray; she was quiet and walked away.  So told the dental assistant that I was not interested in getting the cavity filled unless there is proof that there is an issue.  For the last 17 years I have not had one problem with cavities on my teeth.  At first the dentist wanted me to pay a ""Prep fee"" since I refused the service.  When I explained that they could not prove that I had a cavity on x-ray so why would I be expected to pay a ""prep fee""; the front desk told me they would take care of it and remove the charges.  We did pay approx. $60 for two adult floride seals; that was performed without our approval.  I thought everything was A-okay.  How wrong was I.  We wanted a simple- and rountine checkup, x-ray and cleaning but instead we got extra charges and dental procedures that were not approved my myself and wife. According the Aetna dental the insurance payments has been paid to Dental Works for charges submitted.  Dental works seems to be unable to pickup the phone and simply call Aetna and resolve this billing issue with Aetna directly.  Our balance with dental works should be Zero.  We paid for the flouride seal for two adults and all the rest was covered by Aetna dental.  This was verified by Aetna as well. Even thou Aetna tells us that the checkup and cleaning were paid by them and the sealing paid for using my credit card I still get a $66.00 payment request from Dental works billing department but when I repeatedly contact Dental Works Accounting to resolve the issue they would always tell me that they understand where the miss applied insurance payments went and will fix the account so that I would not get collection payment letters.  I've been getting pass-due letter from Dental Works regularly every 6 months since Jun 2011 which mean this will be the 4th time that I will need to call and waste another 2-3 hours explaining everything to someone new at the Dental Works accounts payable department.

Their web site quoted $75 a year for an individual and this is exactly what I wanted. Several times during the order processed I veerified that I only wanted the Carington 500 plan as they also offered a carington POS plan which reuired higher out of pocket fees. Once I finished my order they were supose to e-mail me a temprorary ID within 24 hours and it never showed until I complained. When i rceievd it I di not notice it was for the POS plan not the 500 plan I had repeatidly requested. I found out when I went to a dentist and they handed me their estimate of service I required which didn't macth what I had seen on the web site when I ordered the plan. I then  noticed that the plan they signed me up for was the POS plan. I called and complained and then said it would cost me $155 anually not the $75 that was on the web site which they had conviently removed by then. I asked to cancel my plan and they obliged but refused to refund the $25 additional processing fee they charged me on top of the $71 they cahrged for the plan. Yes the plan on-line was listed at $75 but they charged my $71 I have no idea why but when they quoted that price I again verified it was in fact for the 500 plan. Her is where it gets ironic as I went back on their site and discovered that they had three payment options you could click on a follows Annual: the paymentplan I originlly signed up for and t now showed a price of $155 Monthly:  which I didn't want for like 15 a month and Quarterly: Whcih i decided to see if I could get and it listed it for get this $19.95 a quarter. I called them asked to convert o their quarterly plan and she sad it would be $59.95 a quarter and when I told her it has it at $19.95 on their web site and that is the price I want she put me n hold and then came back and said she couldn't and it would be $59.95. When i pointed out that that was false adveetising and by law your required to sell it to me at the advertised price she refused. Within minutes of me hanging up they removed the $19.95 and replaced it with the $59.95 price but I had already printed out the web page with the lower price and wish i had for the originalrice advertised of $75. Anyway they refuse to refund the processing fee even though I argued that they caused the situation and that I acted in good faith. Bottom line I went on the Carington 500 webs site directly and got my plan for the $75 which they have on their web site but was charged another $20 processing fee.

After making the impression with the goopy stuff that hardens in your mouth, he asked me to put in my broken partial which I felt was odd as it literally sits lopsided because whole right side was missing. All of a sudden he puts another mouthful of mold stuff in my mouth with no warning which again I thought was odd. Came back, he puts the new partial in, I almost hit the roof with the pain of it all just being wrong! Look in the mirror and one fake tooth is over my real tooth, the bottom of it was so long it was cutting into under my tongue and the area where the top of the acrylic partial meets the bottom of the teeth was like a quarter of an inch so there were open valleys lining each side. They cut down the bottom which was better feeling, but not much. This was done on a friday prior to a 3 day holiday weekend, so for 3 days I felt like I had glass under my tongue, and when I ate, it either came out with the food and it always trapped a side of beef in the valleys. He insisted that my mouth was a weird shape! Came back again, had more shaved off bottom, left, still no improvement, came back again, shaved more off, came back again and told them this is beyond repair and I want a refund. I asked the dentist why he did 2 impressions, the second being over my broken crooked partial, he denied that he did that! then immediately got on the defense and was acted insulted when he realized I was not happy. I overheard him tell a staff member that I didnt mention it not fitting right or pain when he put it in, really!!?? I was there for over an hour trying to make it comfortable at the least. So when I insisted on a refund, they gave me a letter that stated I could get refund 1. after I had new partial made elsewhere 2. but must be in Sevier county 3. and with return of partial they made 4. within 90 days After unsuccessfully finding any dentist to do it close to the price of $354, I chose to go to another branch of Daily Denture in Knox county, not even thinking or knowing the cosequences of having it done in another county, nor were these consequences stated in the refund letter. Obvously they know that no one will have close to that price in the same county, that is where they get you. One week from the deadline after I finally got the money together to get another made, I returned the bad partial to them. After waitng for 30 minutes, silly me thinking I could run in and out and make it to work on time, I was placed in an exam chair. I said what is happening, I am here for refund, he says I need to look at it, I say why, I have the one you made and am returning it and got out of the chair. Then they ask me if I got it done in Sevier county knowing I did not because the other dentist was a friend of his and they discussed my case! So I say no, I did not, well, then you only get 80% back! Funny how that wasn't stated in the letter! From that point on, they were as rude as can be! My payment to them for the first work was done in 3 ways, part cash, part my debit card and part a friends credit card. They insist they have to call her to get her cc# to issue refund, clock is ticking, I am going to be late for work, after no answer w her, they call main office to see if they have cc#, no they don't. So I say well can we do the other 2 and then you can do hers after I leave I need to get to work? They say no! I can come back to get it which is a really long drive from where I live. I insist that they credit my card then refund the cash and do hers when they get the info. FINALLY after much insistence about the stupid logic of the ""order"" of the refund, they do it. $70 some dollars was not refunded to me. I HIGHLY recommend saving some money for a good dental partial in the case you may need one, it was NOT a fun time with the immense pain, aggravation and money that I suffered with for 3 months!

Westlake, Ohio USA ",www.tmjdoctor.net, (440) 892-7773,""," I was diagnosed with TMJ syndrome and I had to find a doctor.When I googled TMJ Specialists in Cleveland,this place ""TMJ and Headache Center"" was the first result.I later found out they paid to be in the first spot.I go to there office and the staff and Dr.Wahib seemed nice enough but he kept insisting I needed a $700 mouthpiece to wear at night because I was clenching.The consultation cost me $130 and the X-ray another $100.I decided to get the splint a few weeks after and that is when my troubles began and my pain GOT WORSE! It costs $700 and is hard to get use to. Dr.Wahib refused to make it or adjust it himself,saying his ditzy assistants were ""just as trained as he was"".After wearing it for a few weeks my pain was getting worse and worse,Dr.wahib insisted I needed a different mouthpiece to wear during the day,one that would cost $1400! I was in so much pain I agreed.All the while his assistants are doing all his work and even though I'm paying to see him,he is not even in his office.He is always out to lunch or on a trip.After so many adjustments to the night splint/mouthpiece,it was not even staying in place.Instead of making me a new one because his assitants ruined the orignal,he told me to wear Denture Grip on it! My symptoms were getting worse and I developed a horrible ringing in my ears that I have to this day.On my last trip to the office,I complained to his idiot assitant who pretended to be looking at my charts,she comes back and tells me i was given the wrong night appliance! After almost a year of wearing it,I am told this.I got up and left.I made an appointment with a different doctor for a FREE consultation and I was told that the night splint I had from Dr.Wahib was actually making me WORSE and forcing my jaw backwards,the opposite of what needs to be done for TMJ syndrome.I call the office and ask to speak to Dr.Wahib,I am told I am not able to.I email his secretary and she does not respond back even after a month.I finally find Dr.wahib's email online and message him.It takes him a week to respond and he tells me in his email to never contact him again and he does not want to treat me !All this after taking my money and making me worse. I later found out that Dr.Wahib practices an un-recognized form of dentistry known as ""neuro-muscular dentistry.It is basically a TMJ treatment that aims to shift your entire jaw into a new position and afterwards the new position must be held in place with braces and expensive dental implants,this is how he makes his real money.I implore you all.please research this place and Dr.Wahib and also research neuro-muscular dentistry before spending your money and ending up in more pain like me.Unfortunately,it is too late for me.I now have horrible TMJ on BOTH sides thanks to Dr.Wahib and his goofy and uncaring assistants(Laury and Lisette).I almost developed sleep apnea due to him pushing my jaw back and have to now wear a CPAP machine.These peope basically ruined my life.PLEASE,PLEASE do your homework before going to Dr.Wahib.

Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program -- a program that benefits the consumer, which helps to increase consumer satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business Verified By Ripoff Report. When a company or individual joins the Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Program, they must make a commitment to us – in writing – to 'doing whatever it takes to make things right with their customers.' What does that mean? It means that Ripoff Report expects that members of our Corporate Advocacy Program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. [continued below]....
									
										..... It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected, the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. It means that if a customer requests a refund and if there is any reasonable basis for that request, we expect the customer will be given a prompt refund (some refund requests may not be reasonable, so this does not mean a refund is guaranteed in every case). “Making things right” can mean lots of different things to different people, but our point is this - by working closely with the company or individual to resolve any disputes, Ripoff Report can track the footprints of customer service to ensure that our Corporate Advocacy Program members are doing everything they can to treat customers fairly and to increase their customer satisfaction.

""We build long-lasting dental relationships one smile at a time!” ~ Dr. Kevin Sands Testimonials ""I just wanted to thank you and your entire staff for the excellent treatment and pampering I received at your office. Being in the dental profession, I know how important teeth are. I never realized the impact a perfect smile would have on my lift. Growing up, I never liked my smile. My front teeth were discolored and had spaces between them. I was so unhappy, that I would use my hand to cover my teeth when I would smile. Ever since I had veneers put on, my life has improved dramatically. I have so much more self-confidence, that I can't stop smiling. It's amazing how two short visits to your office changed my life.” ~ M.D.K. ""I remember the day I was fitted for the first time with contact lenses. The doctor put them in, and told me to walk outside. It was exhilaration beyond belief! The miracle of the moment happened again, this time in your office. Sixteen veneers changed my life in yet another way. I've alwasy liked to smile. Now i do it with so much confidence - confidence i didn't know I was missing. You can't put a price on that. I want to thank you, Dr. Sands, for the positive changes you have made in my life with your artistic talent, and your vision. And I want to say a special thank you to my long time friend, Dr. Abeloff, for the day he introduced us. You both hve made my world a better place. Thank You.” ~ G.R. ""Words cannot express how thankful I am to all of you. I feel like you have given me my smile back! It came out exactly how I wanted it to. After many, many years, I feel lie it is finally safe to smile again. Thanks for your kindness and your patience - I know I wasnt an easy patient! I just wish I had found you sooner, it would have saved me from a lot of pain and frustration. Coming to your office was the best thing I could have done for myself. You have more than surpassed my expectations.” ~ M.G. ""I just wanted to drop you a line and thank you for the wonderful job you and your office did whitening my teeth. As I'm sure you know by now, I am no longer casting 10 Years Younger , but I always talk you up when discussing the show. Everyone is still so amazed at the job you did on Frank! (who apparently is doing quite well with his pizza business.) So thanks again, and know that when I'm able to, I will get in for some more great work.” ~ J.F.

What a difference it has made. The story we did on you hasn't aired yet but we will be sure to let you know when it does and we can send you a copy of the segment. Yhanks agai, Kevin!” ~ J.N.

Scottsdale, Arizona USA ",www.sparkwhitening.com, 866 711 2831,"", I requested the advertised free whitening sample offered and used my credit card to cover shipping costs.  I was promised that if the product was not satisfactory I could send in a request to cancel any further orderes. When the sample arrived it also included a complete set that was not ordered in addition to the Trial Sample ordered. I cancelled on line and was given a cancellation number and a message saying I was responsible for items I had ordered because it was not cancelled prior to the 14 day trial period.  No mention of what that total cost was to be. I had cancelled within 2-3 days of receipt of the order and assumed that all I would be liable for was shipping and handling costs of the Trial Sample. Upon phoning them I found that they had billed my Visa for $94 USD. I told them I was returning the treatment package not ordered and was advised that if I did that I would be refunded $65 when they received it or if I choose to keep it they would refund $55 within 4-5 business days which is the option I chose. That was on November 27th and as of today no credit refund has been issued to my Visa account. Visa was notified back on the 27th of November and they are watching the account for fraudulent charges This operation is truly a scam and persons are charged for items not ordered or wanted.  Costs for the extra set not ordered are charged immediately and they have no intention of providing a refund if the product is returned. Lesson learned and my Visa account is covering my stupidity in providing a credit card to cover shipping of a free sample.     ,  Dental Services

When she got to the counter she informed the lady behind the counter that she would need to email or fax her mom (me) at work and she would fill everything out immediately and send it back. We have done this before and there have never been any questions or issues with other doctors. The woman was rude and loud enough for others in the waiting room and counter staff to hear her tell my daughter ""you are old enough to fill out your own paperwork"" and then pushed the papers back at my daughter. My daughter was humiliated and was at that point forced to tell the woman that she has a learning disability that prevents her from being able to fill the paperwork out thus she needed to be able to have me fill everything out from work and email or fax it back like we have done with other doctors. The woman behind the counter said with a very curt attitude ""just have your mom send over the card information then"" with no further apology or change of demeanor. My daughter said ""this is humiliating, nevermind"" and walked out of the office never having even met the doctor. My daughter called me and explained everything that happened and so I contacted that office. I asked for the office manager and was asked what the nature of my call was and when I explained that I was the mother of the young lady that was just there she said that there was no office manager. That she is the one that handles the business dealings in the office for the doctor. I explained to her that whomever it was that dealt with my daughter should be ashamed of themselves and no one should be treated with such disrespect. The fact that she was loud and rude was what made everything 100 times worse but telling my daughter that she is old enough to do something is not her place to say. In fact I happen to know that all doctor/dentist offices fax and email all day long as it is part of the nature of that business so there is no reason for this to have happened. I was given no apologies, just an ""I understand okay thanks"" from the woman on the phone. I stated that I would be contacting Aetna to file a complaint and would also be filing complaints on Yahoo and Ripoff Report.  I feel angry about the fact that when I look back at the reviews that I had read previously they were all from Yelp. When I read them again I noticed there were updates on the Yelp reviews stating that Yelp allows business owners to pay to have negative reports removed which was a little disturbing to me since I use it so much to read reports about businesses local to me. Needless to say I will not use Yelp again. The one thing that I can say that I own in this situation is that I need to obviously do far more research than just Yelp before picking a doctor or dentist. I will be filing a complaint with my hometown community board as well.   ",  Dental Services

Why is that?   I don't believe they are an insurance company however when they called the doctors on my behalf to see if they took the ""insurance"" the doctors told me they asked if the doctors ""TAKE CIGNA PPO.""  (That's what the doctor staff told me?!) All the doctors were confused because many of them take cigna and ppo but NOT dentalplans.com discount plan.  Also,  they give the appearance of being an insurance but apparently are not!

There is certainly enough Alumni Money for drinking parties at Case Western Reserve.   Digital dental x-rays allow 3-D views of teeth, are less radiation, and how can you consult/confer as a practicing dentist when Case Dental School is about the only practice in the Cleveland area that is still relying solely on the old x-ray films & technology?  The old x-ray films don't copy well as records, can't be e-mailed, and no other dental office in the Cleveland area is doing dental care with the old technology anymore - and no one drills on 3-year old films either.  Which is another problem at Case Faculty Practice - the 'cavity' goes away, but the Case Faculty Practice dentist walks around 'screaming' about that old x-ray because he thinks he missed money($).  It's like a carnival, circus, or Baghdad Bazaar - the nonsense.  It's all about money, not quality of care.   Dental students trained this way can't compete for jobs even locally - where most of the dentists are graduates of Case Western Reserve Dental School and would hire a grad if they could.  Women DDS trained at Case Dental School won't work there on the Faculty, or in the Dental Faculty Practice - because of the problems.  The biggest one being the outdated x-ray technology - that still was in place in the FACULTY Practice areas as of January 2013.      University President Barbara Snyder, and the Dean of the Dental School (Dean Goldberg), have looked the other way while collecting huge salaries - saying nothing about obvious problems.  The x-ray exposure is also not good for the staff.  The Ohio Dental Association is also 'bought off' apparently.  Dental Dean Jerold S. Goldberg just receive an Ohio Dental Association (ODA) Achievement Award for supporting innovative teaching in the Dental School & for his contributions - one of the contributions being that he's left outdated x-ray technology in all the clinics of the Dental School including the Faculty Practice Clinic run by Dr. Faddoul.   It's one thing to do that to the indigent - which is wrong - but it's also wrong to do that to paying patients just because you can.  All x-rays & charts of patients seen at the Dental Clinics in the last 3 years at least need to be reviewed for wrong care.  Cavities that would not have been cavities digitally.  And you can ultrasound a cavity - where is that technology?  Storing odontoblasts from extractions, or root canals?  The composite used at Case for fillings is problematic - causes platelet sensitization.      The Dental Faculty Practice is a pay-for-service dental practice at Case Western Reserve School of Dentistry, takes Delta Dental, and the fees are higher than most dentists in practice in the Cleveland area - definitely not even that competitive at times.  One would think that the first contribution to a Dental School would be to keep the Dental Practice x-ray technology up-to-date with every other office practice in the Cleveland area - the dental x-ray technology up-to-date with Ohio State Dental School.  The dental radiology textbook is from Ohio State.  So Case should have the same technology as Ohio State Dental School, but they don't - another useless overpriced textbook at Case Western Reserve boostore. The Dental Faculty practice is also all foreign dentists on the roster, not one American by birth, or local Cleveland Dental School grad, is on the roster - all dentists were trained intially in other countries (Israel, France, Armenia, and then Ohio State - the conduit for dentists to the US).  It's too much diversity, too many foreign languages and cultures.  The Muslim students want to wear street attire veils in patient clinical areas - because they can in Iraq, Egypt, Iran, or Armenia, and the Jewish Yarmulkes are instead of surgical caps - every special interest group for themselves when a patient wouldn't dare to walk in for an office visit this way.  Nothing is said, but this puts patients at risk of infections - of a global kind. Case Western Reserve students, trainees, and faculty at times use the Dental Faculty Practice Clinic - and Dean Goldberg doesn't care.  He obviously hasn't visited his Dental Faculty Practice area recently - just down the halls or up/down a stairway or elevator or two - hardly a marathon walk. Can't take a roundabout Dean Goldberg, sit in the waiting room and see what you think of the dirty uphostery and chairs?  Rejects from your office or Boardroom?  Governor Kasich should support up-to-date Medical & Dental care and facitilities in Ohio.  The Dental/Medical Boards need to have individuals < 65 years of age on Board (not be reappointing 70-year olds so that they can have something to do).  Practitioners need to be appointed who are interested in new technologies and innovations - who can use a computer, do a google search, send a reply email to a physician/dentist that they reviewed a case or file - question the practitioners in an email instead of everyone having to drive to Columbus without the high-speed rail that Governor Kasich is so reluctant to envision.   The first innovation should be patient safety and common sense.    ",  Dental Services

 Ozarks Preferred Dental Group ,"  Ozarks Preferred Dental Group  3259 East Sunshine, Suite Q  
Springfield, Missouri USA ",none, 417-881-3220,""," My wife has been going to Ozarks Preferred Dental Group for 6+ years, she had a ""flipper"" made by them and was told that as long as she had it any adjustments would be free of charge. She even went and had an extra one made in 2011. So for over 6 years and 2 doctors she has made several trips to get the ""flipper"" adjusted, and each time she did this she would go to the front desk and ask if she owed anything and they would respond by saying it was free, part of the service. She made an appointment for 11/26/13, we went in as usual, and she went back to get her ""flipper"" adjusted. She was then told that there would be a charge of over $200 for the service according to company policy. What policy!?!?! This upset my wife and I a bit. So we asked to speak to the office manager. The office manager told us that the policy was that adjustments were only good for one year then after that first year charges would ensue. Our response was why had we not been told of this policy for over the last 6 years and had been getting free adjustments this whole time. She had no real response other than quoting the policy again. I then began to tell her I understood the policy and did not dispute it but it was her lack of managment ability to properly run the office and inform her staff that clients, like us, were not aware of this policy and that this policy had not been enforced for over 6 years. I have worked in retail for over 30 years and customer service has always been top priority for me. The customer comes first, you want to make and keep them happy so they will continue to come back and shop at your stores! Sometimes you take a hit lose some money, but you retain that customer and he/she continues to spend money which ensures you and your employees keep their jobs. Not at any point did the office manager go to Dr. Reynolds and fight for our case. Example, hey Dr. Reynolds we have some clients here who have been with us for over 6 years, we as a company made a mistake and misinformed this client. I think we should try to do something to retain her business since this was our fault not their fault. If we do nothing we lose a customer but if we work something out we continue to have a paying customer for years to come. (which would have been true)  We were not asking for free service, we were just shocked at the treatment we received and lack of customer service provided. The office manager did nothing just sat there and said I'm sorry there is nothing we can do. I then contacted them through there Facebook page, letting them know how I feel similar in the way this reads. I got a couple of responses, but they were simple We have the right to charge fees for our services, replies, which I fully understand and don't dispute like I said to them in my post on their page, they just did not get the fact that we were upset because of the way we were treated not because of the charges we would have to pay, because we would have paid them! They deleted my post from their Facebook page and blocked me from the site:) Another thing that points out their lack of office competencies is each time we called to set up an appointment you would think they would notice that we had not paid for the adjustments for over 6 years, and when on the phone they could have stated the policy so we could have been prepared. Especially on this last visit. I am sure Dr. Reynolds is a good dentist and his staff, besides the office manager, has always been nice. But this is his 3rd office he has been in and in my opinion he is losing clients due to Him and his office manager's lack of skill at running a business and how to properly use customer service. I would just warn people who are using or who are thinking about using this office, is to rethink it or make sure you are getting all the correct information. Which they seem to have a problem distributing around there.   ",  Dental Services

I have a small chip on a front tooth and a crown that needs repair due to mr previous Dentist ignoring my complaints that food was getting beneath the crowm.   After examining my teeth, being unable to find any real cavities, I was told that I needed a deep cleaning. I was good with that!. When I asked what happened to my basic cleaning as my treatment plan would not begin until January, 6 weeks from now. I was told that they were unable to do a basic cleaning when a deep cleaning was required.  My first thought was WTF? Not my first trip to the dentist and every dentist I have ever had did a basic cleaning before even suggesting a deep cleaning. I also wanted to look into either a bridge or permanent implant for a missing molar.

The kicker was went I got home and looked at the plan. Not only had they used the most expensive code for 'smile facing', crowns which require more work to match the exact line of the teeth as well as level of whitness, on top on the negotiated rate for my insurance provider, they added their own lab fee which would only make sense if taking it home in a box and inserting it myself was a viable option. The crown I needed was a molar which requires half the work and costs a heck of a lot less. I can understand additional costs for a root canal, which I don't need, but they have to be insane to think that someone is going to pay a grand just to have them cement something in your mouth plus additional lab feez. They even added theire expensive Chlora Hex and toothpaste. Both prescriptons can be filled at walmart for 5 bucks. Unless you are absolutely desperate for dental care, have no insurance and already have damaged credit. Don't patronize this place! If you are thinking about it, I suggest checking out Frontline's piece on these crooks. http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/dollars-and-dentists/ .

No matter the treatment or procedure you're considering, our Los Angeles dentist will explore your Southern California cosmetic dentistry options with you.  Many patients look to dentist Dr. Sands for dental services, whether it is porcelain veneers or teeth whitening.The information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Front Desk Administrator, Justin Horn and Dr. Kevin B. Sands D.D.S during an onsite inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Dr. Kevin B Sands D.D.S.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..Dr. Sands Patient Customer Service Improvements 

In order to provide great customer service for all patients, Dr. Sands’ front desk administrator, Justin Horn, takes measures to address all patient suggestions when they come into their office. He answers any questions they may have and strives to make their entire process run seamlessly. When a patient first comes in, Mr. Horn will assess their needs and make sure they are met by the doctor and the rest of the staff.

Their office also makes sure to follow up with patients after a procedure. If a patient has work done that day, their protocol is to follow up with them that same night. The next morning they will also get a call or email, whichever the patient prefers. They speak with every patient and find out whether or not they want them to call or email after a procedure. Then, depending on their feedback the day after treatment, they will determine when the patient needs to come back into the office. However, if a patient is experiencing any discomfort, they will have them come in as soon as possible.

When asked what he has personally done since complaints were made on Ripoff Report to provide a better level of customer service to patients, Mr. Horn stated, “We have just gone above and beyond to make sure any of the concerns brought up are addressed with every patient. We always thought we did an excellent job, but we can always improve. Any complaints that are brought to us are addressed immediately. First, I will be made aware of it and then Dr. Sands. I usually set up a direct line of communication and call them to see what we have to do to remedy the situation and rectify it immediately.”

Dr. Sands’ office aims to make each person’s treatment individualized so that no two smiles are the same. When a patient comes in for their first appointment, they take photos and x-rays. Then, they show the patient before and after photos to see what their goals are. They come up with a formal treatment plan and see what financially makes sense for the patient and try to work within their budget.

To ensure that a patient understands services during the course of their treatment, Dr. Sands makes sure to go over every detail at the initial meeting, and then again right before the treatment. They display working models that show the entire process like how a tooth is reshaped, how a tooth is bonded, a vainer etc. In addition, they also have a two page consent form that they give each patient that goes over every detail.

After every surgery or procedure, they will take x-rays to make sure everything was installed perfectly and will also do a follow up visit where they will do bite adjustments. They make sure everything fits and is comfortable. Patients are encouraged to come back as many times as they need to, but they usually only need to come back once. Their office also offers a warranty that states that if anything breaks of chips within the first five years, they can get it replaced at a reduced rate.

When asked how he would handle a situation where a patient is looking for a procedure done, but in his professional opinion it is not truly an area of concern Dr. Sands stated, “I constantly turn people away, the best surgery is doing no surgery. If someone does not need a procedure, I won’t do it. I am so busy that I don’t take on every case and that is how I have built my name and reputation. I only want someone leaving my office if we both know that they have achieved the best smile possible. I tell people very honestly if a certain surgery is not right for them and I encourage them to get second opinions.” Dr. Kevin Sands Patient Complaints 

During the onsite interview, Dr. Sands was asked about the complaints made on Ripoff Report that describe patients that have not felt as though they were treated with impartiality when receiving consultation at his office, and what he’s done since to resolve these issues: ""Well, I am addressing it now.  Most people who are not happy let me know, they do not write a report online. The fastest way to fix any problem here to is let me or my staff know about it and the problem will be remedied. We have surveys after everyone leaves so they can let us know how we are doing. As soon as I saw the complaint, I called Ripoff Report and offered some mediation because I like to make everyone happy. You usually know if someone is unhappy. People have to sign a waiver when they leave after surgery stating that they love their veneers, so that if they don’t love them, we can adjust or fix them until they do love them. It does not make sense for someone to write a bad review and not tell me. We could have resolved the issue, and they would have left happy.”

Since complaints were made on Ripoff Report, Dr. Sands maintains that he does not do anything different with how he interacts with patients, stating, “My motto has always been that the customer is always right. That’s why people come to me because I am the best, and they know I am the best. All of the celebrities don’t come to me because I’m known for bad work, they come to me because I’m known for being the best at what I do. I’ve always thought of treating my patients like royalty.”

------------------------------------------------
										 Dr. Kevin B Sands D.D.S Beverly Hills, Los Angeles California NOTICE: About the Report below.  Ripoff Report (((REDACTED))) the offending words and false accusations/statements because we found what was posted to be completely false and ridiculous.. If the posting was true, there would have been legitimate proof or some sort of documentation. The claims were absolutely ridiculous. Ripoff Report was not sent any evidence for the claims the author of the Report below made – this could be a competitor. As a matter of policy, when a business joins the Corporate Advocacy, Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program, .. Ripoff Report always emails everyone that filed a complaint so the member business could make things right with them…  our program calls for the member business to err on the side of the customer. It is our opinion, the Report below is bogus. Ripoff Report and a 3rd party verifier inspected the offices on different days. Dr. Kevin B Sandsis an extremely qualified and legitimate Dentist with the credentials and experience supporting this fact. If the doctor was that bad, Ripoff Report would have negative Reports about Dr. Kevin B Sands D.D.S from real patients. Dr. Kevin Sands in Beverly Hills takes the (((REDACTED))) dentist in the U.S. He somehow managed to (((REDACTED))). But don't let this fool you or make you think he's a top notch dentist. I unfortantly was fooled by this illusion of him being some amazing dentist because I saw him on T.V. Lesson learned and now let me pass this knowledge onto you, so you don't make the same mistakes I did.  I came into his office for a veneer connsultation, supposibily this was supposed to be free. The front desk seemed to be a little stuck up when I came in for my appointment, not thinking much of it tho I just continued to wait for the doctor. Well I kept waiting for about 90 minutes, finally I was called back to see the great Sands. He comes in the room and says ""what are you here for"", I respond back saying ""doesn't it say what I'm here for on the paperwork I spent 15 minutes filing out"".  Now typically I would just answer the mans question but... I waited for 90 minutes and him saying that retarded line really set me over the edge. He replies and says something like ""I don't appreciate the attitude, you come in here and speak to me like this."" ""That my hand writing is supper messy and he cannot read it"". Well this is a shock to me because I've never heard anyone ever complain for, how hard can it possibly be to read veneer consultation. So after this mimi stand off he tells me your a full case and that this is more then likely out of my budget, so he reccomeneds I call some guy over in east L.A. Now this is super shocking, how does he know I cannot afford the procedure? Does he know that I've been saving 17 years for veneers and that my family offered to help me pay for the procedure also? Guess Kevin Sands is a psychic and can somehow know your bank balance just by looking at you. Well I'm sure he has mastered this skill because this is his business, detect people who have money and then rip them off! At this point I was completly fed up with him and decided right then and there this guy is a total jackass.  So on the way out the door I see a lady in the waiting room who seems pretty upset. Her eyes where red and she kept sniffling non stop. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that Dr. Sands did some cosmetic dental work and that the work is horrible. She came in today to ask him to fix it but the front desk told her she needs to pay a consultation fee of $500 and that it will cost more money if anything can be done. Being in such shock I told her my situation and how he acted. She responded back telling me she had a similar experience but made the mistake of still going with him. At this point I told her step out in the hallway with me, the front desk girl started huffing and puffing like she was annoyed. In the hallway she opened up saying how Sands tried flirting with her and asked her out multiple times. This was just the craziest situation I've ever had when it comes to medical related things. I'm so thankful that I decided not to accept treatment and run for the hills. People do yourself a favor and never visit this guy.. This guy is by far the shadiest dentist in all of Beverly Hills, I'd rather go to Mexico then have him touch my mouth. If you like being talked down to and have 90 minutes to waste, then Dr. Sands is your man! In addition I went online and read a bunch of his reviews, man these are the fakiest reviews I've ever read in my life. Some of them are in Broken English and days apart from each other. I'd highly suggest you do a search and look at them for yourself, what a joke!  Ripoff Report Verified™ REVIEW:

I too,(read the other reviews on the internet) was taken by the deep cleaning scam. I had my teeth cleaned every six months at my prior dentist. I went for an exam and of course was told that I was about to have serious gum problems if I did not immediately have a deep cleaning. After forking over $160 on top on what my insurance pays, I had the cleaning. Then they tried to sell me a $400 laser treatment. I said no. Then they said I needed to come back every three months for more cleaning (at my expense since insurance only covers every six months.) I got the call back saying they needed more money because insurance did not pay enough. If you go here, check out what they bill to your insurance. My insurance was billed for things I never received (like nitrous oxide). BUYER BEWARE!!! On my next visit: One again they tried to rip me off.

 Ali Moheb ,"  Ali Moheb  1844 San Miguel Drive, Suite 206 
Walnut Creek, California USA ","", (925) 279-3326,""," My wife went to see “Doctor” Ali Moheb in late 2011 at his Walnut Creek office. She needed a simple crown replaced on an upper tooth. We were recommended by another couple who knows the Doctor and had used him before. First off- even though this office is under Moheb’s name, he has other, unlicensed, dentists practicing there. From what I understand he has a bunch of offices, and does the same thing in all of them. He has the practices under his license, then hires unlicensed dentists to work. There are NO licenses on the walls for these other dentists. Something we did not realize until we left. We were scheduled for a cleaning and exam. After the exam we were told she would need to have a full root canal and a extraction, a post placed, crown, and two more crowns placed on adjacent teeth. This was NEWS to us, as she never had dental issues in the past. Moheb wrote up a treatment plan then told us to review it with the receptionist, who is not even a dental technician. The front office assistant, by the name of Blanca Casillas, said she is the manager, and proceeded to discuss financing and payment plans before we even knew the full extent of the work. Even WITH our dental insurance the price was miles higher than any other Dentist would perform. I asked about the billing codes and was given a song and dance about the codes not being the important part and told to focus on the actual treatment. Moheb came over to see what was wrong and started arguing with me about the treatment asking me if I knew anything about Dentistry and telling me that I needed to pay the money and get the treatment. His assistant took him back to his office to calm down. A few minutes later he came out and apologized then he left. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN OUR WARNING TO NOT CONTINUE! However Blanca offered to reduce the bill by 20% and said they could “get creative” with the treatment in order to have insurance cover it. We are an older coupler on a fixed income and made the decision to get this treatment done for this reason. After much back and forth where we now realize we were lied to blatantly by this Blanca Casillas woman and the doctor. We placed a down payment and were told to come back in two weeks for the casting and told total treatment would take 6 weeks for everything! I asked for a statement and she said that they are “automatically mailed”. We never received anything in the mail. When we left without the cleaning we did not know they would charge us for it. We did not see the charge until our next month’s billing statement from the Insurance Company which was AFTER our second appointment. At the time of our next appointment they had “NO RECORD” of our initial down payment but again hoodwinked us into believing they would fix the issue and find out what happened. Only it turns out that they added this amount back on to the total treatment cost which had gone back up to the higher number. We did not find this out until AFTER this second appointment where they pulled what turns out was a perfectly healthy tooth. We paid the second installment and were told that they could not print an invoice because their “systems are down”. This time a Doctor Miles performed the treatment and not Dr. Moheb. When we got our billing statement we saw that they billed our insurance company for the SAME PROCEDURES they charged us cash for saying Insurance would not cover it. Including the cleaning. It also says he performed procedures that he never did perform on my wife (casting for the new crown, a second tooth extraction, placement of a post, etc…) My wife went for a second opinion when the pain would not subside and was told that Moheb’s plan for everything was a flat out LIE and that she only need a cracked crown replaced. This dentist asked where my wife had gone and when she said Moheb he laughed. Apparently it is well known in the dental community that Moheb likes to party and is notorious for using drugs like cocaine and ecstasy which would explain why his behavior was so erratic during and after our initial exam. Many other dentists have reported his practice “Art Deco” also known as “Unlimited Smiles” for fraud when they take over his patients. He can be seen all around the “San Francisco Bay Area” at clubs and parties just look at this link http://www.donovansf.com/PartyPics1.htm. We also heard through the Private Investigator we know that he likes to use escorts and has been for a while. With all of this it sounds like he must be using the money he SCAMS from his patients to pay for everything. He says he lives in Arizona but he lives in San Francisco. This is a common trick to avoid paying taxes in California. We wrote many letters to the California Dental Board and it turns out that he is being investigated by them and was sued by them: http://www.dbc.ca.gov/public/dds50324_20110720_accu.pdf When you look him up on the Dental Board’s website you see how many infractions he has: http://www2.dca.ca.gov/pls/wllpub/WLLQRYNA$LCEV2.QueryView?P_LICENSE_NUMBER=50324&P_LTE_ID=706 His credentials come from a Caribbean dental school where he says he is also a professor.  http://caribbeandentalimplant.com/ but look at the website and you can see that he is not listed on there as a professor.

Good material for a future episode of 20/20, or better yet American Greed. Full Story:I'm 38. I brush my teeth after every meal. I floss almost every day. I've had braces, a few cavities, and regular teeth cleanings in the past. I hadn't been to the dentist in approx 3 years. Recently my gums became inflamed for 2 weeks after flossing too forcefully. I decided it was past due to visit a dentist anyway, so I made an appointment. I chose Gentle Dental due to positive online reviews, and proximity to where I live in Coconut Creek, FL. I went in for their $69 special covering X-rays, exam, and cleaning. After X-rays, the dentist only probed my gums. She checked approximately 5 spots in my entire mouth. [continued below]....
									
										..... She poked deep and forcefully at 1 spot which hurt of course. She said she was able to probe 5-6mm deep (probably because she jammed it) and claimed I required a Deep Cleaning. She left me with a handheld DVD player to watch a video. The video was all about periodontal disease, and seemed quite clear to be a video to scare you into thinking your teeth will fall out if you don't get the deep cleaning treatment rather than educate. Then I went up to the front desk to find out how much all this would cost. $1,256. I would also need to come in every 2-3 months for cleanings and get locked into spending more money. I don't have dental insurance. For payment options they showed me two brochures. A ""VIP Program"" ($149/$199/year) which supposedly discounts the rate. They also offered their own ""CareCredit"" plan to pay monthly. So a few big red flags:Gentle Dental is a Chain that runs an 800# phone room to book appointments.The exam was short/rushed. Only 5 spots in my entire mouth were probed. Not 6 points on ""each"" tooth (standard).The DVD scare/sales video  $1,256 deep treatment with boardwalk sales pitch payment options. I decided to get a second, and highly trusted opinion. I sent my x-rays to my sister in NJ. She's a respected hygienist for over 17 years and current dental student. She could see right away that there was no tartar below the gum line and there was normal bone support. So nothing that would warrant an expensive deep cleaning. At the most it was Gingivitis. Just a standard teeth cleaning would help clear it up. $70-$150. She immediately reported them to the board. There's tons of unethical dentists everywhere. Use your due diligence and get a second opinion. My sister recommends getting a proper exam from a dental school, or contacting local periodontists to get recommendations for an ethical dental practice.

The plan that I've allowed $14.99 per month to be taken out of my checking account that obligated me for a year per contract DOES NOT COVER ME IN MY AREA.

Today, 10/25/13, I called back to explain that I receive an e-mail telling me Humana would continue to take money out of my account for the dental plan I CANNOT USE through December, but that it would be cancelled, because I agreed to a one-year contract.

The dentist's office gave them all necessary information from the beginning and now keeps resubmitting it; I gave Humana the information on the phone a couple of times.

German Arzate) he botched my families dental work very, very badly. My husband and I unfortunatly made a very stupid decision to try and save money and have dental work done in Mexico. We travelled there with our kids. Our daughter needed allot of dental work and we unfortunatly trusted them. Most of the crowns fell apart while we were still in cancun and continued to do so when we returned to Pennsylvania. Our dentist at home counted off the work dr arzate claimed to have done and what we had paid him to do was actually not completed and most of what he did complete had to be redone again.I also had dental work done and we had to pay for it be fixed aswell. I needed a root canal and  two overlays.  We called, faxed, and emailed with no response from them. Tired of being ignored we finally wrote and told them that we would report them to the international medical tourism bureau and with that we recieved a grumpy, crusty response that they would fix it for free. We no longer trusted them and didn't have the money to fly back again and nor did we think it was safe. I asked them politely to refund our money and thats when the nasty letters started too be sent to us written by Camila (dentists sister) and we were completly shocked at what she was writing.  Eventually they refunded a very small portion but we still lost thousands of dollars that we could not afford to loose. Like other people with complaints  (dr. Arzate) paid money to remove my complaints as well and that is why we have decided to leave our review here on ripoff reports so dr German wont be able to do that again. Where I did leave complaints in the past the staff at cancun dentistry would write horrible things about us and they would leave good reviews under my complaint. They still do this today and shows they have not changed a bit since we were there.  Our opinion is... you should not go anywhere near this fake money hungry clinic. We feel they treated us unethically and hope our experiance serves as a warning to others looking for cheap dental work at Cancun Cosmetic Dentistry.  Darlene     ",  Dental Services

For that reason alone we have gone here for the last 4 years, and we have never been happier with the work. Now for the bad, the billing and benefits coordinator are horrible. Over the passed four years we have considently been incorrectly charge. We go in being told one price then once the work is done we are told something else. The reason they give you is because are insurance did not cover the amount.  Well if they knew how to send the bill to the insurance company that wouldnt be the case. Every time they bill my insurance they code in statement incorrectly. Then I need to conferences call both my insurance company and the festival dental to get the amount corrected. The last time I we did this I found the festival dental actually owed me money, and of course rather then given me the money back they gave me a credit. I have finally has enough, thelasttime I went in, I ask the benifit coordinator (Kirk) tocall the insurance company before the work was done to very the  coverage. I was told what was going to covered  and my portion would  be 616.00 and that insurance would cover the rest. I paid my part at the time of service, and of course they they sent me a bill for another 175.00. I then questioned the amount. Then 30days later I got the same bill but now it was 735.00. When I call them about this I was told that my insurance didnt cover the service, when I asked way they told me previously that my insurance was covering it. The response was ""well this is your problem and you need to pay or we will send it to collections"". I then offered to paythe 175.00 they originally billed me for and they refused saying again the amount will go to collection.     This place has good dentist but horrible billing practises.

As I entered into the office, it was impossible to miss the sign on the TV that was typed in all large caps and bolded letters which read ""DO NOT TOUCH THE TV"" with the word ""NOT"" six times larger than the others, or to miss the sign on the closed glass reception window that was typed in all large caps and bolded letters which read ""DO NOT KNOCK ON GLASS"" - again - with the word, ""NOT"" six times larger than the others. I stayed only because I presumed that some unruly children could have necessitated the signs and that the staff had merely forgotten to remove them after the children left - no such luck. By the time my appointment had ended, I knew that the signs delivered loud and clear the message demonstrated by the attitude of the mature female hygienist to ""sit down, shut up, and don't bother us because if and when we get into the mood to open the window and acknowledge the presence of a patient, we will.  Until then, you don't exist."" While I was in the dental chair, the hygienist interrupted the cleaning of my teeth multiple times to roll away from me into the next room where she bragged to a co-worker that she had made her husband wait for her to prepare his dinner until he had asked for it five times the previous night, and then she proceeded to discuss with the co-worker the kind of refrigerator she liked. After explaining to her that sometimes it is difficult for me to breathe when the dental chair is in the reclining position, I subsequently raised my finger to require her to hesitate until I could take normal breaths, and she totally ignored me and stated ""You'll just have to wait until I get through here"". On my way out of the office, I stopped at the desk and stated to the young female staff member there that I believed that I had a $500 dental benefit with my Medicare provider.  The same hygienist was now in the same area with us and turned around from a filing cabinet and stated in a surly tone of voice ""She knows that!  When I realized that the hygienist was getting the toothbrush usually provided by dentists, I stated ""I'd like a soft brush if you have one"", she immediately replied in a gruff sarcastic tone of voice ""You'll get what we got""! By this time the person behind the desk had handed me cards for future appointments to replace two fillings which I cancelled shortly thereafter. When I subsequently made an appointment with another dentist to have the fillings replaced, I was instructed to bring my most recent x-rays with me.  Loganville dental stated to me on the phone that I would have to come to their office, sign a release, and pay them $25 in person - they refused to mail them to the new dentist. Therefore, I filed a grievance with my Medicare dental services provider, and the x-rays arrived in my mail; however, they are of such substandard quality that they are totally unusable for any dental purpose.  Had I gone to a new dentist, new x-rays would have been required at my expense because my Medicare dental services provider will pay for x-rays accompanying routine cleaning and exam only once every six months which means that Loganville Dental was the obstacle which prevented me from receiving the dental services I needed for six months, and minimallly conformed in every other way. In closing, the next time you want to pay someone to ignore, insult, and harrass you, place obstacles to your dental services in front of you, and just generally screw you over, be sure and make an appointment with Loganville Dental.  One visit will last a lifetime.   ",  Dental Services

Maybe because she changes to laboratory which one she use to work before because they were sending bad crowns like the secretary told me ( and I just want mention that, the fact that I have the 5 crowns form there doesn’t change the prices no , I have 5 crowns in my mouth from that place that the doctor herself changes because the crowns they make are not good, but I still had to pay the full price 750 each) and I am living with the fear that another day will happen that I will be eating and they will crack like the 2 other ones did… She told me at the beginning with a big smile a huge sympathy that ‘’ TO DO IT RIGHT ‘ I had to clean everything in my mouth I had to fix the cavities put crowns on the weik theeth, and when everything will be good to go, we put the invisalign, but she was clear with me everything need to be perfect for no moving the theet before the invisalign… she said that we will be able to be done after a month because she made me come in one visit for 5- 6 hours and worked on many teeth in one time, so she rushed the process and made me going through pain to go faster it was in march the start so I was supposed to be done for 15 april, we are in October 7 now and its still not done, so it give you an idea how many times I had to come back and forward and sometimes for nothing they just send me back home because the doctor wasn’t there or the crowns wasn’t delivered or it wasn’t the good size again, or cracked over there in my mouth when she was trying to put it no matter what even if I told her that I felt like it was to high, and felt like I was bitting only from one side in my mouth like walking on a short leg and the other one who is higher, just to give you the feeling of it. When I tried to explain how I feel because she is not in my mouth she started to have huge attitude and treat me like I was a 5 years old… letting me know that ‘’ she was the doctor so she knew what she had to do so I can just don’t say anything ‘’ Of course she had my money already because to give me a reduction of 1000$ from the other place I checked I had to pay in cash at the front desk like she asked me, no care credit, etc …. Just cash money. The total was 10.000 $. So now there are no reasons for her to be that nice person that she have been at the beginning. White a big smile all the time. On top of it she made a dental plan and went over me at the beginning of all the teeth she had to do. She did all the cavities and almost done with the crowns, then she said oh we are not going to do the back teeth because she doesn’t need a crown I was like ok so that make me save couple of $. The time past and in one time I started to have huge pain in that teeth ( that she said we are not going to put anything on this teeth, this teeth doesn’t NEED ANYTHING) so I went over there to check and then she realize that this teeth needed to be extracted as son as possible because it was going out of the gum and you had a black line on it sign of cavities IT WAS MY WISDOME TEETH ( I don’t know how as a professional she didn’t notice that) when it was the time to take an XRay the machine where I was seating didn’t worked so she asked me to wait until couple of days when she fixed it and come back ( TO TAKE AN XRAY) of something like that, that serious wanted to send me back home with pain and wait until her staff will be working! I was so upset, I said no I need to have that xray today to check and see what we can do I can not deal with the pain NO MORE, she said I can send you somewhere else but you gonna have to pay for it!!!! What I said; you made the mistakes by changing the number and think that this teeth didn’t needed anything ( because that was her excuse for the reason that she didn’t worked on that teeth , is that the secretary made a mistake with the teeth numbers) I was in choc because a real doctor will send you somewhere else and pay for it because its her mistake plus for everything I went in to, and all the extra money and time I lost because of her. Then I ask her what about this machine the one that was in my right side that the client just left, she send me there with one of her employee like she didn’t wanted to work on me anymore she was so ready to go home, she left without even saying I apologies, I am going to check on you by phone I have to leave I am sorry, no nothing she just pass me to someone else and didn’t appologies or explain what going to happen or saying goodbye, especially because I told her that I was going to vegas the day after everything was paid already it was for my anniversary with my husband and I was in a big worries that something will happen there. But she left anyway the room and went hiding herself in her private office … and guess what the employe and I went on the other machine and its was working we took the xray it was that simple and took 1 minute and the girl set me up an appointment, sending me to the pharmacy for antibiotic to hold the teeth to don’t get anything over the weekend. On Monday I came a man took care of me in a way that I wanted to cry with happiness because he have been so sweet and nice and considering I really realize that I made a huge mistake by paying her a huge amount in advances and give her my trust, I wished he was my dentist, but I was so ready to change my all mouth because of an history that bi had its sad but I have to share it to make you understand how important this treatment was for me, and worked harder to save the money to pay for that, its because I have been anorexic and boulimic for 6 years, I have been hospitalized for 3 months in Belgium and have been one time in the hospital because I was close to a heart attack because of the potassium I was losing. And because for over 4 years I have been over that I wanted to give me a treat for all my efforts and also that was the last thing that remember me the past I wanted to forget, I tough it would be a beautiful thing, sometime a little bit of pain but for the better. But it have been nothing else than a bad experience and suffering physically and psychologique… She argue with me, she doesn’t let me talk, she leave the room while I am talking to her, she even told me WHY DID YOU BRINGED MY HUSBAND WITH YOU !!! Like I wasn’t allowed too. I didn’t felt comfortable to go over there by myself because she treated me so bad that I wanted to go with my husband because he is American and I am European, I don’t know really how its work here i was really surprise and than uncomfortable so I needed the support of my husband and she got so upset, I know that she got frustrated because she couldn’t act the way she wanted anymore because my husband he is American leave all his life here and know everything about the system. And the only times he came with me ( 4 time I believe ) it was a different person but when she was with me a 27 years old woman who came from Europe she took vantage of me. I mean which professional dentist will say that? She told me that I should not complain because I got a good deal and she know that in the other place they wanted to charge me more, like my 10.000$ was nothing! At that time I tough I was saving a 1000$ but now whit all the extra hours of gas and taking off work so loosing money there too I lost more than a 1000$ and I am not even talking about the stress and less time for myself and more work at my job because I had to take off and couldn’t finish my duties, plus the bad treatments in both ways! I wished I sign the contract with other place even for 3000$ more!After all this ( I still have a crown that its not the final one because its too white and large she is going to change it at the end) I started the invisalign treatment when I wanted to cancel it to don’t continu with them but she blooked me by saying that she paid them already with my money that I gave so I was blocked and I tough you know what I am going to give everything in the hands of god I am going to stay, I was ready to fight for my money back but I tough ok now its just invisalign I will have to come every 3 months only to get only the trades so its fine I can be more patient. Its what I did and really because of the secretary who is so nice and respectfull, and because my husband and I are on the same page, we both are believer in god so we just leave it like this. So I did , now we are on the second month that I was wearing the braces but guess what again, they asked me to come back to re due the measurements because the attachements that they put on my teeth that I had to come 2 times for that because they fall, its because they don’t stay on crowns, but for crowns they have another materials that invisalign does for that to keep them, and its look like she didn’t know that!!! So she put the bad products for the crowns to attached the attachments and its what made me come 2 times already for nothing because I loosed them again She put the crown in my mounth she made the attachment the second time on the crowns and she didn’t knew that it was another material to put on these teeth!! So now what is happening is that I have to go back take again the measurements and wait for 4 weeks with the same trade that I have since 2 weeks already just to keep them in place but the processuc is stoped and then I am going to have hopefully the new correct invisalign treatment! So in about November 7 I will go again over there to re start the treatment when I went in so much pain to do it fatser it would be 8 months when I will have the invisalign instead of one month like she promised me … With all that no excuses, no kindness nothing. When I go over there I am always hoping that everything gonna be fine but it never have been the cas, only when somebody else treated me. not her with so much attitude and words that she said that make you so upset. Now I have to pay 380$ for the extraction that she didn’t put in the plan that I FOUND OUT by the pain that I had to pass by. The invisalign treatment is not even started and I still have a crown in my mouth that have to change so its not done, without even mentioning the 5 other crown that have been made by that other company that they stop working with because they do their crown bad. So even when I will be done I will always be scared for the future, you can not trust her, you can not trust the company she work with because I am pretty sure there are reasons for the fact that they use bad materials must be cheaper and she work with them to get more money from what she charge you (this is what I personally think ) she keep saying at the beginning that she treat her patient like family etc … that its not about money …. She didn’t proove me any of that that’s for sure, and I am not waiting for that anymore. I still own 1600$ but I am not going to pay any $ before I got my treatment finally done with my definitive crown, I have been less careful but not now as I can see everything can happen whit her bad work ethic and now I will pay for what I got not in advance for no reason and then get left on the side. She keep asking her secretary to get the 1600 ( when she have more than that $3900 form invisalign + $750 the crown that its not done) + $750 that they had to take off because they didnt put the crown on that other teeth that they extract from my mouth so $5400 – 1600= SHE HAVE $3800 of my money for work that its not even done yet or even started (the new invisalign) and I gave already $8000 cash in hand! And then she can say ‘’ its not about money’’  when she is trying to get more money for work that is not even done. I am not even going to say done the  right  way because that will never happen either. I am so disappointed that I had such a bad luck, I just trusted her with her words that was my big mistakes. But I am a strong believer in god and I know that she will not take that to heaven. And I really hope people will be aware of that by reading my comment and be saved from such a liar and save their money too.Sorry for mistakes in writing in English, its because I am French and I still learn how to write properly in English. But if I am taking my time to write all this its only because I had that strong feeling that now it’s about the time to let people now, I gave to many chances, I never wrote any bad reviews on her work you can check even on her website, yelp, google plus…( and its not like I had nothing to say like you can read) the only reviews that I wrote in the very beginning of course when everything was right, it was good reviews but I never shared the bad experience because like I said I always tough she is going to be thankful for that so she gonna treat me right, change her attitude and be correct to me, and do her job as a dentist, that never happened… I cried at work, in my car with my mom on the phone and a friend of mine from work, she is my manager and she pushed me to wrote a reviews for all the people like me naïf that could be a new victim for her, and the only thing I can do good its try to share my experience to keep them away from that type of practice. I will report her as well in the complaint wire and the ripoff report. I wish I didn’t had to pass by that but it’s the way it is, my only hope its that one day I am really going to be done with that treatment and start my new life, this will only be a bad memories, and if I can keep away people to have a nightmare with their ‘’ dentist’’ that will be my only good thing that I could get from there. I am still a patient there for normally 19 month it could be more with her mal practice. There is always something that we can do but I am just so over it nothing can make me sad anymore I feel like a release since I can help people. I am just going to be patient like I always have been and let the time take me to the point that I will never have to see her again. I wish you a beautiful day or night for the one is reading me.God bless you.   ",  Dental Services

Dr. Arzate holds several general memberships with dental orgainizations located in America such as the ADA and AAID, but has shown no intention of following ethical guidlines.

Their office is unsantitary and Dr. Mersha is very unprofessional and unwilling to listen. I complaimed to him but he acted as though I was a bother even after I paid his exhobrent fees. After this whole ordeal I found out that Nevada has a very low bar for dental practices so it is important to do your reasearch before going to the dentist here. I will never set foot in Dr. Mersha's office again. Hope this helps someone avoid the excrusiating pain I had to deal with.  ,  Dental Services

Don't Dentists have to take a Hippocratic Oath, or should we just hope they mean us no harm?  I went in for a $30 ""first visit exam"".

My mouth and gums were sore for a few days after. Then when she removed the x-ray vest she scratched my neck when she pulled it off. She laughed and apologized at the same time. I had a brief visit with DR. RONALD PERKINS. He told me I need two crowns, several fillings and a deep cleaning.  They put together an estimate one of over $2,500 and one of over $3,000. I felt I needed a second opinion because the doctor was so BRIEF, RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL. He even made a joke about my ""broken tooth""and said ""peasant"" under his breath as he walked off. The next day I called to get my x-rays and the they had a hard time finding them because they had misspelled my last name. They located them by the misspelIing. I went in and signed a release form, paid $25  and agreed to pick them up when the duplicates were ready.   The next day I took the x-rays to a private dentist and he was not able to use the x-rays taken by DR RONALD PERKINS ORTHODONTICS because they were NOT READABLE. My new dentist redid the x-rays and did not see any need for crowns. I only needed a few fillings. My tooth was nicked, not ""half missing"".  I do not feel I received proper dental exam at RONALD PERKINS ORTHODONTICS.

Bradenton, Florida USA ",http://drlivystoykadds.com/, 941.746. 5033,"","  I recently moved to Bradenton, FL. I found Dr. Stoyka through my insureance carrier. I schedule my intitial appointment cleaning, xrays etc. I also had a tooth that had broken off.  They first contacted me the day before my appointment saying they needed something from my cardiologist confirming whether or not I need medication before the appointment. The appointment had been made a week before. Knowing I could not get that to them in one day I canceled and re-scheduled the appointment for 2 or 3 weeks later. In the mean time they claimed they were not getting the form and my Cardiologist claimed they were faxing it to them as I was speaking to them. I finally told the receptionist at Dr. Stoyka's office I was tired of calling the two offices and attempting to get something faxed. That if it did not happen in the next 24 hours I would just cancel my appointment and start the whole process over with a new dentist. The form suddently appeared in their office that day. I go to my appointment Get my teeth cleaned first. I was disappointed because she did not polish them like other dentists have always done. The hygenist immediatly started talking about all my teeth needing work and go to great length to impress upon me that you cannot build a house on quicksand. Dr. Stoyka shows up after the cleaning looks in my mouth briefly, gives me the same speach about needing all this work on my teeth and using the same metaphors. I became suspicous because it start feeling like a hard sell and pressure that I better get this work done. She made eye contact with me once for what seemed less that 2 or 3 seconds if that long. She kept looking up at the ceiling. She did not answer any questions I had and proceeded to deveolp this ""treatment plan"" with the hygenist. Looked in my mouth one more time for a second or two telling me she was screening my mouth for canser. She looked in there. They then moved me on to the billing person who printed out this ""treatment plan"" with prices and every thing. Very impressive but very wrong. My treatment plan consisted of about 8 or 9 visits where most if not all wer going to cost me over 100.00 dollars and ranging up to several thousand. I stated at that time that my insurance should be covering some of that cost. I was informed at that time that my insurance ""did not reimburse"" and I was entiled to a 25% discount. This woman repeated Dr. Stoyka to the letter about making my mouth healthy and needing the work and so on. It was like they all were rehearsed on this speech. She then informed me that I was getting a break and when it was all over I would be paying out of pocket over 9 thousand dollars and without the discount it would be closer to 20 grand. Again when  I protested and said there must be a mistake about my insurance the billing person refused to consider that might be a mistake and continued to pressure me into agree with them. The final thing was if I couldn't afford to drop a few thousand dollars a visit they could get me approved for a credit card to charge all the fees. After being approved for the credit card, buying a waterpik I nervously left. I called my insurance company immediately when I returned home. They confirmed that I was over charged for the appointment. I would be over charged for the planned work. That my insurance does in fact reimburse and I should not be charged anything over what they say is my co-pay. I was also charged a 28 dollar ""co-pay"" as described by the biller and was informed I would have that ""office co-pay' each visit. The rep from my insurance said I should not be charged any office copay. My insurance company attempted to call them while I was on the phone but was told the biller was unavailable and she would call them later that day. She did not.  My insurance company said they would contact me once she called them. I never heard from anyone so the next day I called Dr. Stoyka's office to find that instead of returning the call to my insurance company the biller called their agent and was given a new pay scale which was still overcharging me. when I asked about the ""office co-pay"" I was then informed it was a discretionary fee by Dr. Stoyka for the office visit and infectious disease control. I was reminded I would pay that each visit. I also needed to have the broken tooth extracted and they gaveme a referral to an oral surgeon that they said did not accept my insurance but Dr. Stoyka preferred all her patients to see this guy. I was also informed that I owuld be charged 225 dolloars for the extraction. They made the appoitnment for me and reassured me about the charge by saying I could put it on the credit card they got me approved for the previous day. Again after talking to my insurance company I was told the oral surgeon did in fact accept my insurance and the fee should be no more than 75 dollars. I called the oral surgeon and they confirmed they did accept the insurance and they would contact Dr. Stoyka's office to clear up the confusion and get back to me. After I ddin't hear from anyone I called the oral surgeon again and was told the woman I spoke to the day before was wrong and they do not have an account. I canceled the appoitnemtn and called Dr. Stoyka's office and informed them I needed an oral surgeon that accepted my insurance and was not willing to pay 225 dollars for a service that I an get for 75 dollars.  They refuse to help me and referred me back to my insurance company. They also sent me a revised treatment plan with a new pay scale that I found to still be overcharging me. Once I realized I was going to be overcharged and that Dr. Stoyka and her staff were less than honest. Had pressured me into agreeing to do all this dental work that I may or may not need. I called canceling all future appointments and said I was going to find another dentist. At that point I did not want any further dealings with that dental office. The biller called leaving a message that Dr. Stoyka said she would do the extraction and all work and not refer me out to anyone. I did not return the call because I do not trust her intentions to be in my best interest. The billing person called me a second time and then a third finally from a phone that did not name Dr. Stoyka's office on the caller ID. I told her agian that I was not interested in seeing Dr. Stoyka, because of the pressure to accept her plan which over charged me and that I was over charged  for the service I did recieve. She denied this and said she would inform Dr. Stoyka. My insurance company helped me find an oral surgeon to extract my tooth and honored my insurance only charging me the 75 dollars. Dr. Stoyka was only interested in getting me in to her practice and getting as much money as possilbe. I strongly urge people not to go to her especially people with HMOs or Medicare. I also urge current patients to review their bills and compare with their insurance. The represnative at my insurance company said that it was good that I checked and compared her fees with my benefits and said the most people will take the word of the dentist and over pay.

My appointment was set for 3:00 PM and I arrived 10 minutes early for the new patient paperwork, etc.  I was not called back to the exam room until 3:50.  One woman escorted me to the exam room and said someone would be right with me-after 10 minutes, another woman comes in to do x-rays.  Well, she didn't have what she needed, she left to get whatever she needed, and another 5 minutes goes by.  This happened a second time, only it was just a couple of minutes.  Finally she takes about 16 x-rays-took at least 20 minutes.  She then tells me the dentist would be right in.  After another 10 minutes, the dentist comes in and looks at the x-rays and then looks at my mouth, and says she doesn't know why I have a loose tooth because the bone and tissue all looked good.  She said she could not do anything about it, I would have to see an oral surgeon.  She commented on my having so many ""silver fillings"" and said she would like to do a crown on one of these fillings.  That was it.  That took maybe 7 minutes.  I wait another 5 - 10 min for the assistant to return and she asks me if I have insurance, I do not have dental insurance, so she leaves yet again and returns with ""my treatment plan""  for a modest $1,949.  But, since I have no insurance, they were  to give me a $389 savings which made the total $1,560.   All this time I am wondering about my cleaning that was supposed to be included in the $89.  She tells me that my cleaning would be $210 and it was included in the $1560.  Then she proceeded to suggest a finance plan to cover this work and gave me paperwork for it.  At this point, all I wanted to do was to get out of there.  I paid my $89 and left, all the while knowing that I would never go back there.  I was so angry over my wasted money, time, and energy that I needed  a week to sort through all of this and decide what my next plan of action would be.  I know I will see a different dentist and get my teeth cleaned and examined. I suppose I am using this site to vent my frustration, but more importantly, to warn others and Beware of Towncare Dental of Ft. Myers!  ",  Dental Services

 Sexton Dental Clinic (Florence SC) ,"  Sexton Dental Clinic (Florence SC)  West Palmetto 
Florence, South Carolina USA ","", ,"","  I had been planning on having some cosmetic dental work done for quite some time, and since the work I needed was going to cost more than I could afford, I opted to use Sexton Dental. They had extracted teeth for me in the past, and they were always quick and efficient. After mulling over the website and looking at the various services and pricing, I decided it would be well within my financial capabilties to go ahead and get some dentures as opposed to getting the expensive veneers or implants. They have a list of various degrees of ""quality"" dentures, supposedly the ""standard"" being the lowest grade, and ""signature"" being next to the best quality. I chose to get the next step down from top grade, being signatures. I assumed this was going to affect the realistic look of the dentures. Once I got my initial exam, the dentist decided that he would not pull all my teeth, since most of them were still good, he talked me into a partial. This was fine, and I had no problem with it. It was two of my front incisors that were pulled, and they were replaced with what they called a ""temporary"" partial. Of course, I was not satisfied in the least with the finished results, but they assured me that these were the temp set, and I would get my permanent set before 90 days. Even the lady sitting at the check-in desk kept repeating that all dentures are temporary, and everyone should return before 90 days to get the permanent dentures. I toughed it out for 86 days with these loose fitting dentures in my mouth, rubbing my gums and making them sore. I was so happy to finally be going back in hopes that Sexton was going to finally finish what they started. When I got back into the chair, I pointed out all the little troublesome areas where the dentures didn't line up, and where they rubbed my mouth and mades sores. I told them I was unable to eat with them because they were not lined up straight and my bottom teeth pushed up on them causing them to be uneven in front. A tech came in and said that they were going to have to grind a little off my bottom tooth to stop the plate from grinding, and I was happy something was going to be done, so maybe I could finally have a normal smile. What did he do? He came back with some kwikset gel, and squirted it on my plate, putting it in my mouth and had me bite down on it. The whole time, I was thinking, ""why is he doing this, it is only compounding the problem, and now my plate will be permantly crooked..."" But I trusted, maybe he was just doing this to get an idea of what to do. No such luck. He takes my plate and sands it off, and brings it back. The SAME plate! The one that they told me was only temporary. I asked the assitant ""Is that it?"" and she said non-chalantly ""Yes, that is all."" I asked he about my permanent plate, and she then told me that no dentist is going to fit me with a partial until one year has passed since the extraction. But wait... they told me that I was getting a permanent plate at 90 days. I smiled for the assistant, and said ""But look at my smile, these two in the front aren't even with my other teeth."" She then tells me that it doesn't matter, because the ones on the bottom are crooked too. What!!!??? So, I asked her again. When do I get my permanent plate? She said, well after one year you come back, then you pay such and such for whichever quailty set you want.... but wait! I've already paid for the high quality set! Right? So, where are my permanent quality dentures? I didn't pay $500.00 for temporary dentures. This is a rip off, and someone needs to set it right. Be careful if you are trying to get quality work done, I got had by this business! ",  Dental Services

So after the crown shattered and the tooth broke off, I didn't have any more money to have anything done. I had to live with the agonizing pain for three years and finally sold my truck to be able go to another dentist. I had to have both teeth pulled.

This past February, I took my mother in for some much needed dental work. She is retired and on Medicare. He accepted her business as a cash paying customer which was very kind. She had to have an extraction, x rays, and cleaning done. He charged about 350.00. Not bad. Impressed, I decided it was time for my 13 yr and I to have our routine cleaning and x-rays done. His staff verified my coverage which covers 100% routine cleanings, x-rays, molar coating etc...His receptionist and dental hygenist confirmed for me that my coverage was accepted and what the pricing would be which should have been nothing. I asked what a molar coating normally costs and the dental hygenist informed me it is approx. 8.00 a tooth. So we made our appointment and had our work done. For those who do not know, I routing cleaning will run you about 60.00 and a bitewing x-ray will cost you about 35.00. My negotiated price with my ins company puts it at 60.00 for cleaning and 15.00-35.00 for bitewing as reasonable. I expected to see my insurance billed about 300.00. He and his staff billed my insurance 900.00! For a routine cleaning x 2, routine bitewing x-ray x 2, and 8 molar protective coating for my 13 yr old. He charged 40.00 a tooth!

On my first visit, I arrived at my scheduled appointment time but waited in the office for 45 minutes before being seen by a dentist.  Moreover, for the additional two appointments I made at SmileCare , I again waited in the office for a time before being seen.  I was not informed of any delays by any staff member in any of the visits.  I did note that during my visits that a number of patients were also waiting to be served. Apparently, SmileCare has a scheduling problem or they strive for patient turnover for monetary gain.  In my opinion, personal responsibility toward patients is nonexistent at SmileCare.  I was scheduled to have my teeth cleaned on my second visit to SmileCare. My dental insurance covered a regular teeth cleaning.  SmileCare, however, attempted to add a number of additional options to the regular cleaning process.  The additional options were not covered by my insurance but would have raised the cost to more than a hundred dollars.  The staff member was insistent that I purchase the additional options but I refused. Unfortunately, this dentist office used “bait and switch” to “up sell” a regular teeth cleaning.  On my final visit to SmileCare I was to have the new veneer cemented on my tooth.  I was told initially that the new veneer would take about a week to be made.  After more than two weeks from the initial visit for the veneer mold, I did not get a scheduling call from the office to have the veneer bonded to the tooth.  So I called them for status and was told the veneer had been received and was in the office.  I asked them why they did not call me to make an appointment for service.  I got no response.  I had to initiate the appointment for the veneer bonding appointment.  On the last and final appointment to have the veneer bonded to the tooth, I was charged a fee for the office visit even though I was required to come in to complete the bonding procedure.  I guess they seen me coming.  It is obvious that SmileCare is profit oriented; although I did discover later that SmileCare Dentistry is a corporation and not a private dental practice.  Dentists and hygienists are employed by the SmileCare Corporation.  Corporations, of course, must make a profit or they will not survive.  All too often, though, it is at the expense of the unknowing patient or customer. I learned also that the reviews for SmileCare  by prior patients were extremely negative.  (See http://www.yelp.com/biz/smile-care-san-diego)  My dental insurance is with Kaiser Permanente and their affiliation with Dentral Care USA.  I will inform them of my unfortunate experience with SmileCare accordingly.  Still though, the lesson I have learned is to always perform research when deciding on a given service regardless of any preconceived notions of the health care organization(s) giving the service.

They stated that they billed both, but on the bills it showed only one billed.  I called the insurance companies and they were either not submitted to both or they were and one was all that was included in the bill.  We had to pay what the insurance already paid because they had all the billing messed up that it could not be straightened out.  The messed up my false teeth.  I cannot even wear them.  I went to another dentist and the insurance refused to pay for a new set because of the dental records at BrightNow.  So now I have only 2 teeth in my head and cannot eat very well.  I have blisters on my gums if I wear them and they then start bleeding.  I have to wait 5 years before the insurance will allow me to get new teeth. My husband also went to them.  They put in a permanate partial.  We went back to have it cemented back in and it is again not staying in.  The fillings they put in his teeth fell out.  Went to a new dentist and they could not believe the work that they had done.  My husband had to have teeth pulled because of the partial causing break down of the enamel.  Our new dentist can not believe that anyone could do that shotty of work.  Never never go to that dentist office.  you never get the same dentist, they are rude, treat you as you are stupid, poor customer service, they do just enough work on you to keep you coming back.  I have never had to go through this with any other dentist.   ",  Dental Services

They started going after she became a client of my step da servicesds , he built her websight and took video. My first exsperience was that DR. Foster was very nice her satff was a little incompitent the dental assisstant was very rough taking xrays and during a procedure with the hose she squirted me all over my hair. My mom later told me that had also happened to her. My next visit was for a cleaning I was 10 min late I'm not making excuses but I did call them on the way and told them I was sorry I'll be right there. I had just had my daughter by c section a month and half before and was waiting for childcare. I live a few blocks down. I was repermanded by Deena(?) in front of everyone it felt like the princible and was very enbaressing. I was told that my insurance covered the cleaning by the girl doing the procedure. She did tell me it was going to be a deep cleaning because I hadn't seen anyone when I was pregnant but they did tell me the insurance would pay for it. They did it in 4 segments for 30min each 4 apointments. They also scheduled me for root therapy and treatment which I thouht I'd get a second opionion I'm a advid brusher and everything they wan ted me to get didn't make since. She said I had 3rd stage gengivitis and offered treatment. They talked abot my gap which is cosmetic and was trying to scedule me 4 to 5 times out of the month. It seeme like the office just needed money and seats to fill probably why she asked for my dads websight services. I felt uncomfortable they would try to book appointments I didn't have time for and I noticed the same thing with other members. They would also break privacy agreementd discussing appointments with my mom or step dad to make appointments. I'm married 25 husband 40 and we have two daughters. I felt uncompfortable and changed dentist (tender care). I exsplained to my new Dentist and hygenist what happend and they couldn't believe she wanted to do root therapy. The said I was young and healthy and so were my teeth and gums no sign or gigivitis. They wondered why they did a deep cleaning there were no signs of me needing that. They didn't make a sales pitch or try to pressure me for appointments and I had a filling that was $200 I knew before hand and paid it out. I got my file from Dr.Foster and they sent me a bill for $400 my insurance covere hlf so it was a $800 dollar cleaning. Wow So not free, wasn't exspecting that and thats a huge chunk of change when your buying diapers for two babies specially not being able to plan for it. I was told that my step dad would take care of it. I called and told them how ridiculouse this was. It seemed like more of a vendetta because I changed offices but I still told them I would look into this. I didn't sign anything but I know becuse of the cleaning done it sections even though they didn't tell me which was wrong I was still going to have to pay evn though they didn't tell me and I didn't sign anything. She told my family about my bill which was annoying and again felt like it was going against hippa without my permision. I hoped to  My family told me about DR. Fosters office after my husband and I moved back to Aloha. My step dad does her websights and websight video's for her office. My first experience with Dr. Foster was that she was nice the office was techy with the flat screen tv's on the ceinling while you hae your procedure done. The hygenist squirted me with water on my face and hair and I after found out my mom had the same unpleasent exsperience with the same girl. Also I live very close to Dr.Fosters office and I was 5 minutes late which isn't punctional But I just had my daughter a month before. I had to leave her with my mother and everything she needed. I called and let them know I was on my way and would be a few minutes late . Deena a associate was very rude about me being late even 5 minutes and said Dr.Foster Doesn't appreciate and said next time they would charge me 30 to 100 dollars. She did this in front of customers which made me feel degraded and embaressed. DR.Foster and the hygenist told me I needed a deep cleaning which I never herd of and I routinely have been going fo a cleaning every six months since I was a child. They sheduled me for 4 half hour segments. for the month. Dr.Foster also told me I had Gengivitis stage 4 and sent me home with information and told me about treatment and also root therapy which I have always took very good care of my teeth she discussed using my 1500 on my insurance before next year which was soon. We talked about my gap and possible choices. I asked if the insurance coveered the deep cleaning and was told it did. I told them I was concered because My husband and I just moved back and we had a t the time one newborn daughter. They eased me and said it was. I did the four painful deep cleaning's with in two weeks. They than wanted to procede with root therapy which I herd was painful and also hot and cold treament. I declined because I had a lot on and the cleaning took a lot of time. I was a new mother of a new born not quie healed form my c section and was breast feeding also It was winter. They started calling me my husband my mom and steap dad trying to schedule me for appointments I didn't want to do at the time. She discussed information with my step dad about my file which was weird considerring I was a cna and you can't discus things with out clients consent even with family. I'm 25 married live with husbands 40 with two daughters. I decided that I would try a new dentist it felt like my dad working for her was conflicting. I also didn't agreee with her diagnosis. I started going to tender care where I told them my story. My dentist couldn't believe that they did a deep cleaning my mouth looked healthy no sign of any gengivitis (I'm a non smoker). Root therapy would be absurbed he said my mouth was heathy and I was young (I guess for mostly older patients.) He also told me that root therapy would have been a painful experience. The dental hygenist also could'nt believe it. I wish I woulv'e got that in writing. I had to go back to Dr.Valerie Fosters on acoount she and staff refused to send x rays to new dentist never had a problem with anyone else x rays were paid for. I had to go get them in person they were snotty on the phone and also in the office I felt like it was high school they were rude about my decision to go with someone else and condiending and patronizing. I later recieved a bill in the mail with red ink circled PAST DUE, I never recieved a first one. The bill stated 400 dollars was due on a 800 dollar cleaning. My family and I tried to get it worked out my step dad was confident it was taken care of because They had lied about insurance and also not signing anything. It wasn't and started adding interest My husband and I has no idea how we would afford this with two babies and a small buisness we were starting. I aksed why he insurance didn't cover like they said and they said it was because it wasn't a regular cleaing. I feel like they took advantage of me and were just trying to make money. I have alos read reviews of the same happening. Even to a elderly woman with a fixed income and someone said they tols themn they would have to pay 100 and then got a bill for 400. My new dentist lets me know what I will pay and at most its a few dollars off not a few hundred!!! I told her I would go to the attorney general irte revies on her websight or file a complaint with state board. I couln't pay they sold it to a collection that I'm working with we paid them 400 but still owe 600 from insurance this has been a night marrer can't wait to get this paid off but she is still ripping people off on reviews.

The mouth guard hurts all of my teeth and does not fit my mouth.  I had a cracked tooth, which I am beginning to think could have been caused by this crappy night guard.  The woman asked me to send a photo of the mold, which I did and she said that the molds looked fine and basically insinuated that I couldn't return the item.  My husband also ordered a mouth guard from the same place and he is unable to use his because it does not fit properly either. You are not saving any money by ordering online. I am going to the dentist now to pay for the expensive 500 dollar mouth guards.

Honestly, I thought it was an article until I printed it out and saw that it was actually an advertisement. I ordered this for my boyfriend who always talks about whiter teeth but he does not have dental insurance. We can't afford a trip to have his teeth professionally whitened and a lot of the whitening programs you read about are very expensive. When I ordered the ""free trials"" it was directly from attachments found in ""the article"" so my experience is a little different. I ordered and agreed to pay $1.03 in shipping, which turned out to be about $3 instead. I figured that $6 to $7 for a whitener that would make my boyfriend more confident would be worth it. About a week later I saw that Brilliant White had charged me an additional $94.31!!! I tried to call and complain but the number I called would just say ""You have reached Customer Service. Someone will be in contact."" I called my bank and they gave me a phone number from the transaction. I called that number a quickly cancelled. I called my bank again to get the number for Action Pro White and ***it's the same phone number. Unfortunately, I thought the issue had been taken care of. Four days later Action Pro White ran my debit card for another $94.31. Okay, so this is now taking food out of my childs' mouth and I'm getting extremely upset that this company is trying to rob me. I go to my bank and have my card cancelled. The bank puts in a claim for the $94.31 from each merchant. Thanks to my lender, Wells Fargo, I was reimbursed for both $94.31 transactions that I had never authorized. Whatever you do, DO NOT give either of these companies your card information.

The only reason 1199 demands that claims be mailed is so that they can blame the United States Post Office for slow or no delivery. There is zero record of any mailings, so 1199 has zero accountability. My claim was mailed on 25 April 2013. On June 26, 2013, a complete denial of all services was received by my Dentist asking for credentialing information, and asking he re-file the claim. That is a total of two months. Very slow and then no. All credentialing information was mailed, along with a refiling of the claim. On 30 July 2013, I called 1199, I was informed that a partial denial was mailed on 16 July 2013, along was a request for another copy of my X-Rays, as ""something is not clear"". As of today, my Dentist has NOT received a copy of this partial denial. I was further informed that if I walked the X-Rays in, a decision ""could"" be made in 7 or 10 or 15 business days. That would be 4 full months of denial. The X-Rays are perfectly readable. The X-Rays are unclear to 1199 because this is a tactic used by 1199 to deny services. My teeth need to be cleaned, my crown needs to be replaced. Teeth that have a built up of tartar leads to heart disease, especially in the elderly. At 63, I am elderly. 1199 offers a $375.00 upper body scan of the heart, lungs, etc. I took the scan, on a scale of 0-3000, I scored zero, for zero plaque in my heart arteries. After waiting 4 months for approval for needed dental care, I wonder what my heart arteries look like now. No other entity collecting fees, (my mandatory unions) would be allowed to deny services on this level. The union is a business providing services of which it is mandatory that I paid. My dues are collected from my check just like taxes, yet I receive zero services. I was denied medical benefits for two full months. My benefits did not start until December. 1199 never received the form. The form was completed and handed in when I completed the form for the mandatory union dues. The form was completed twice more. Our medical benefits are supposed to start 90 days after employment. I saw the Eye Doctor in March, I received the acknowledgment of payment by 1199 to the provider today. This provider is in network. That is almost five full months after service. Many of my co-workers have also suffered denial of services. CB - a young adult female aged 25, a Juvenile Diabetic, denied total medical benefits for six full months despite working full time, and paying union dues. TH - has a 12 year old daughter, whose braces are about to come off, not one payment for services have been rendered to the Dentist providing the care for over a year. CJ - attempting to get information on his pension status, worked 6 full years at another 1199 hospital, 17 years at BI, 1199 has no record of the 6 full years at the previous hospital. MN - has a wife who worked for 1199 fifteen years ago. MN works at BI, and has received services for his son up until three years ago when suddenly 1199 stared denying services stating the wife no longer works for them. 1199 has stated this is a glitch in their system. This glitch has been going on now for three full years. This nurse was visit 1199 for each claim. 1199 flat out refuses to fix the glitch. PT - a patient at the hospital, has had her birthday incorrectly listed for five full years, 1199 flat out refuses to correct this. This is a retiree. Under any other circumstances 1199 would be convicted as a thief. My Dental benefits must be released so that I can get the care immediately. If you cannot help me please refer me to someone who can.

When I went in, Dr. Mann suggested that maybe I had a stroke, he even called another doctor to confer with, and between to the two of them they had no idea what I had, but the symptoms were absolute classic Bell's Palsy symptoms. When I described my symptoms to friends and relatives, many of them said it sounded like Bell's Palsy, but Dr. Mann, a trained medical dental practitioner with over 15 years experience, had no idea?

I came across ImmediaDent which is located in a small ""strip"" mall about a 1/2 of a mile away. I dropped in, asked them if they were ""in network"" (Aetna Dental Insurance) and what was involved if I ever needed their services. According to them all I needed to do was present my dental insurance card, they would contact the insurance company as to pricing, and all I would be responsible for was the ""co-pay"" - the amount the insurance would not cover. A few weeks later an old high school silver filling came out, so I made my first and last visit to ImmediaDent.. The service was prompt, although I thought for what was done was a little on the pricy side but paid the amount, right there on the stop, the dental insurance considered a co-pay and left. A few weeks later Aetna Dental sent me a copy of the services including what they paid ImmediaDent. [continued below]....
									
										..... These forms are hard to understand so I called Aetna for an explaination. Aetna in turn got ImmediaDent on the phone, so it was a three way conversation. Everyone was in agreement that this particular service was paid in full. Aetna had paid their share according to the information provided by ImmediaDent and I had paid the balance. The final conclusion: 0 balance.  Everything had been paid in full. About a month later I got a nasty letter from InnediaDent's collections department of out Kansas - demanding an extra twenty something dollars on top of the close to tweo hundred and some dollars that had already been paid. The collections department was completely automated, so there was no way you could talk to an actual person. (It was set up that way.) So I called ImmediaDent. I was told by the same person who told my insurance company there was a 0 balance that the insurance company plus what I paid wasn't enough and they wanted more money instantly or else.  After some checking I discovered ImmediaDent was not an ""in network"" Dental practice. (They accepted people as patients who had dental coverage but there were no breaks in price had ImmediaDent actually been ""in network"" as they had claimed from the beginning. Furthermore for what was done their prices were excessive for the same type of dental work done (a small sliver filling removal & replacement) compared to other dentists in the area ""in"" or ""out of network"" - in short: ImmediaDent's pricing was on the high side. I told the woman at ImmediatDent tp go phuck herself - she laughed and said so what, there was nothing I could do. I responded there was - never going back, filing a formal complain and advising friends and neighbors in the area not to do business with ImmediaDent. (If they were looking for a dentist work through their dental insurance carrier.) I also cut a chect to ImmediaDent's collection agency telling them to stick it up their butthole.  So what did I learn from this experience - the next time when I look for a dentist in my area to call my dental provider first, see if they are actually in the plan and then do some local checking about if this dentist has a good track record.

 Family Dental ,"  Family Dental  2022 Cherry Rd 
Rock Hill, South Carolina USA ",http://familydentalcentersc.org/, (803)324-9400,""," Dentist mill???  Our first 2 visits to Family Dental, a.k.a. Dental Dreams, LLC, were not so bad. Aside from chipping a neighboring tooth during one extraction, the clinic was affordable for someone with no insurance and fairly efficient. Our third visit, however, has turned into a mild nightmare. The worst part of the experience - the office placed an unauthorized charge of $39.88 on our debit card, a charge made without my permission and without my card being present.  My husband had an appointment for 12:30 on Monday, July 1st, 2013, made earlier that morning when the office opened at 10 -- they do get kudos for being super fast at getting you in. We arrived around 12:20, updated some paperwork, and sat around for about an hour before finally going back to the exam rooms. The wait during our other two visits was nowhere near as long, but they were rather busy that day - maybe a bit over-booked. [continued below]....
									
										.....  There was a 30% chance we would need to pay an extra $76.52 if additional procedures were needed. The initial $150.48 was processed before we were taken back. At some point during our 4-hour visit, we hit that 30% so I went up front and paid the extra charge. Cash/debit card customers pay before any services are rendered.  Other than our extended stay, we left feeling satisfied. He did remember the dentist saying her tool slipped, which turned out to be a gash on the underside of his tongue - deep enough to lay a plastic toothpick in. It looks like it could have been caused by the drill? But it seems to be healing.  The next day, I checked my bank account, saw a negative balance, and a third charge from Family Dental for an amount I knew nothing about. I called the office a little before 12:00, was told that I needed to talk to the office manager, Eva, and that she would return my call in 10 or 15 minutes when she returned from the bank,  I went on with my day, giving the people a fair chance. The office closes at 6 (that's their 'evening' hours) so I called back around 5 and explained that I had waited all day for a call I never received. Eva explained that she had been so busy making calls to the credit card processing center, that she hadn't had a chance to call me back. She assured me she was doing everything she could to fix the problem and to find out why the card processing center charged my card without permission. She agreed to call me back before she closed at 6. I never heard back.  I called my bank and explained what had happened. They removed the charge, but warned me to keep an eye on the account because Family Dental still had authorization to make charges.  Sometime Wednesday afternoon, the charge was resubmitted to my account. Thursday was the 4th, and I didn't notice the charge until Friday. I also received two messages from Eva that morning, asking me to return her call so she could process my refund.When I spoke with her - about quarter till 3 - she said she had tried to call me back on Tuesday, although the phone never rang and there were no messages. She said she would need my credit card number to process my refund.  ""You didn't need it to make the charge,"" I replied.  ""But I need it to do the refund,"" she said. Why would I feel comfortable giving this office my credit card number after they had already taken money from my account for no reason? I asked why this happened. She said the credit card processing center was to blame. She said they could mail a check if I wouldn't give her the card number or bring the card in. I asked why they couldn't give me cash.""We don't have it,"" she replied. ""We've paid cash before so I know you have cash.""  ""But we can't use it for refunds unless corporate approves it."" ""Then maybe I should call corporate.""   I did a little research on the Family Dental Clinics in SC. Their website (http://familydentalcentersc.org/) gives very little info. A quick who-is search for the owner of the domain name, on the other hand, gave me all the info I needed, leading me to Dental Dreams, LLC. What started as a small dentist-owned clinic in Illinois is now a chain of clinics in several states, boasting more than 200 dentists in offices nationwide.  The Dental Dreams website (http://www.dentaldreams.org/) tells a heartwarming story of founder Dr. Sameera Hussain's desire to provide affordable, quality dental services to families. The corporate number is easy to find: 350 North Clark Street, Suite 600 Chicago, IL 60654 (312) 274-0308 (312) 944-9499 Fax   So why are they called Family Dental here? And why is it close to impossible to find out where they're headquartered? Maybe it has something to do with the Feb., 2011 death of a 17-year-old root canal patient who only needed a simple filling (http://blog.dentistthemenace.com/2011/02/dental-dreams-has-become-dental.html)? Or maybe they choose to operate their clinics under a variety of names for some other reason entirely.  Or maybe, as the article above suggests (and supports), Dental Dreams, Family Dental, and whatever other names they may be hiding behind in Illinois, Texas, Massachusetts, Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, Louisiana, New Mexico, Michigan, DC, Pennsylvania, and beyond, are nothing more than dental mills, caring more about making an extra dollar than the well-being of their patients.  An employment brochure on the Dental Dreams website advertises a commission of 30% of adjusted production or a base salary of at least $120,000, claiming that most of their dentists make over $230,000 a year. (http://www.dentaldreams.org/docs/Dental%20Dreams%202012%20Brochure-1.pdf)  Maybe Dentist the Menace is right?  ""Dental Dreams saw Christopher as low hanging fruit and an opportunity to meet the days production goal. Instead of replacing the filling, as a normal procedure, the production junkie of Dental Dreams found the opportunity to over-treat and up-code to a, likely unnecessarily, aggressive treatment.""  Questioning who I should trust, I called my bank instead of Dental Dreams/Family Dental corporate. I explained the situation to the bank representative, who agreed that the office shouldn't need my card number to process the refund and who supported my position to withhold that info based on fraud concerns.  I called Family Dental's credit card processing company and spoke with a merchant tech support specialist. She couldn't assist me because I was a customer of her customer, meaning I needed to deal with the merchant and the merchant would need to deal with them. I explained that the office blamed her organization for charging me without authorization and that I didn't feel comfortable giving them my card number again. She was very understanding and also said that the merchant should be able to process the refund without the number. If they absolutely had to have the card number, she continued, I could visit the office, have the manager call the credit card processer, and could then give me the phone to give my number.  That seemed reasonable, so I called Eva at Family Dental back. She would need corporate permission to call the credit card center. I wonder if they gave her permission to call them on Tuesday when she didn't have time to call me back?  My request was emailed to her corporate office, she said, but she's not sure if anyone's in the office since it's the day after the 4th. Maybe I should've given her my email address and I would've heard back from her?  I called the corporate office. If you need to contact Family Dental, Dental Dreams, Dental Experts, etc., the (312)274-0308 number welcomes you to the “Administration to the Dental Offices”. By pressing 1 for a list of departments, you can access various employees or you can select 8 to file a patient complaint. This selection appears to forward the call to the general mailbox so it's unclear if your complaint will be addressed.  I chose the accounting department, which gave me a choice of 7 different employees. I left a message with a Jean who never returned my call. I called back a bit later and spoke with Jason Newell who explained that the person who handles the Rock Hill clinic was out of the office. I explained the situation and said that it wasn't fair for me to wait until Monday to get money back into my account that they had no business taking in the first place. If she can't call the credit card company without your permission, please – give her permission!! He said he would call the office. He also said someone would call me back.  I called Eva about 15 till 6 on Friday. The receptionist said she was on another line and would call me right back. It's now Monday afternoon and I'm still waiting.  If the credit card processing company used by Family Dental makes a habit of randomly charging credit cards through their merchants, I don't see how they could stay in business 25 years.  Family Dental, on the other hand, is still quite young. Even if you include the 13-year history of their parent company, Dental Dreams, it is riddled with complaints and lawsuits, as well as fraud and misconduct allegations in at least one location. Maybe Dental Office Corporate is just that corrupt?  Or is Eva really the Evil Office Manager? Maybe she didn't like the way I was looking at the tool tray during the procedure. She assured me she would address my concerns. She said 'her' IT department was investigating the cause of the charge. (After a couple questions, I learned that the IT department is the credit card processing center that she needs corporate permission to contact.)  After so many unreturned calls and so little effort to resolve this matter, I'm beginning to believe that this may be a case of outright theft that originated in the Family Dental of Rock Hill office, under the poor management of a corporate dental mill, not any sort of glitch in the computer or POS system.

He said ""im not going to use those"" while he was leaning back my chair I already felt uncomfortable. Not even 10 seconds later he puts those same u-tencils in my mouth, I couldnt speak as he said ""these stiches arnt disolvable"" so he started taking em out. as he finished he went back to the extraction site and started pulling out dark blod ""clots"" and said ""yes you have dry socket' I was shocked thinking I needed those clots to prevent dry socket ""as I read on other dentist websites"" he tried to tell me that he needs to get those out to have it nice and clean, so it can heal, as I thought I was healed already ""no pain plus it looked like there was no swelling"" So as he took the second one out I sat up and said i dont feel comfortable and wanted to leave, he said I can do whatever I pleased.

Alpharetta, Georgia USA ","", 770 569 0529,""," Imagix Dental in Alpharetta, GA. was listed as a CIGNA provider.  I was under a new insurance carrier and had to select a new dentist.  My internet searches listed this group as the best among the CIGNA dental groups.  All of their providers were not rated very well.  Unfortunately, I had no other choices under the plan. I scheduled a routine cleaning and examination.  Although I had panaramic x-rays completed 12 months earlier and had sent the group the x-rays before my visit, they would not let me have a cleaning until the panaramic x-rays were taken again.  My insurance clearly would not cover this procedure within such a short period of time (24 month minimum) Once the panaramic x-rays were taken, they wanted to take bite-wing x-rays.  Simply, this is over kill.  Again, they would not let me get a cleaning until the x-rays were taken. Once the second set of x-rays were taken, they placed me in the dental chair.  While I waited, I over heard at least three other patients being told of massive dental procedures that they would need.  This was either the worst group of patients to be in one facility at the same time or something else was going on.  When the hygentist arrived, a quick exam was performed.  The dentist then arrived and also did a quick exam.  Both of these exams were quick peeks in my mouth and did not resemble previous exams that other dentist offices had performed.  The hygentist returned once the dentist left and prompted told me that all of my fillings needed replacement.  It seemed strange that all of my fillings had gone bad within six months.  The hygentist wanted to set up another apppointment to replace all of my fillings and also offered a payment plan to cover any expenses not under my CIGNA plan. At this point, I was concerned about this dental group.  Nevertheless, I played along and set up the appointment.  I also asked the hygentist what I could do to make my fillings last longer.  I was told to have at least one filling replaced every two to three years to avoid the expense of a full mouth replacement.  I was now ready for the cleaning.  Unfortunately, I was told that to have a cleaning performed, a deep cleaning would be necessary.  The deep cleaning would cost another $200 beyond any insurance payments.  I was told that a deep cleaning went under the gums and went deeper into the mouth than a standard cleaning.  I was also offered a payment plan for the $200 expense. I asked to have the deep cleaning performed on my next visit, but wanted the standard cleaning today.  I was told that a standard cleaning could not be performed and that a deep cleaning was the only answer.  I then asked for the dentist.  I was told that the dentist was with another patient.  I told the hygentist that I would wait for the dentist.  after about 15 minutes, I was told that the dentist was performing a surgical procedure and would not be available for the rest of the day. I then asked to speak to another dentist.  I was told that all of the dentists in the Imagix Dental office were with patients and could not see me that day.  It was only 2:30 PM and the entire Imagix Dental staff of dentist were tied up.  I asked again for the standard cleaning and was once again denied. I asked the hygentist how my teeth could have gone so bad in only six months.  I was then told that they could only perform a deep cleaning.  When I once again requested a standard cleaning the hygentist told me that they could do nothing else for me. I wasted one hour of my life having x-rays taken with no preventive dental procedures being performed on me.  Imagix Dental would not perform a simple cleaning without an extra $200 being paid to them.  In six months since my last dental checkup, Imagix Dental claimed that my teeth became so dirty and my fillings so bad that only Imgaix Dental could save me.  I later discovered the deep cleaning that Imagix Dental was describing is normally reserved for extreme cases and that an Oral Surgent should perform such a procedure.  I have not doubt that Imagix Dental is scamming patients out of money for needless procedures.  I would never go back to such an establishment.    ",  Dental Services

										..... They refuse to work with you, the office staff are EXTREMELY RUDE. The fat woman who called herself a doctor (but was not the actual oral surgeon, thank GOD) who's name is either DOROTHY or DELORIS (the staff refused to give me their names to report to corporate,) even went so far as to CALL ME A #$%$, and stand in my face and tell me that if I wanted them to do the surgery, I must not care if my fiance lived or died. A medical professional said this. Multiple times, whenever I tried to talk over her shouting all she had to say was ""You don't care if he dies! and I have 40 years experience, so it doesn t matter what you think!"" Once again, this is the behavior of a doctor we are PAYING to render a service. We were treated like idiot enemies from minute 1, not patients or customers. When I asked for their names and the number to corporate, the receptionist LIED about her own name (she said she was Jackie, when I overheard her answering a call saying her name was Carmen,) and refused to provide any further names because ""sixteen people work here, I can't possibly give you all their names, it's too many people!"" Yeah, right. They do not care about you, your teeth, or anything else but your $$$$$$$$$$. When I called customer relations to complain, the woman said the entire office had made a statement along with some patients that were present at the time that I was not disrespected, and that I was a psycho, BEFORE I started calling customer service and corporate to complain. This is impossible-- I started making calls the moment I exited the building. Another lie from a shady service. Customer service said since I was not the patient, it doesn't matter how the doctor or staff spoke to me. So, don't take your family to the office, especially if they could be distraught by staff treating your family member like garbage, because you'll get cussed out! Customer service also said we had been told ""six to eight hours"" no water/food, WHICH HE HAD NOT CONSUMED. He had a small amount of water 6+ hours prior to the surgery to take medication. This was not good enough for the fat ""doctor"", she kept shouting over me that one drop since MIDNIGHT the night prior means he will die in surgery. She just kept repeating ""YOU DON'T CARE IF HE DIES! YOU DON'T CARE IF HE DIES!"" over and over every time I tried to get a word in edgewise. The woman from customer service insisted this was not true, that they told us 6 - 8 hours. If it was 6 - 8 hours, they should have been able to perform the surgery, BUT they wouldn't because it ""had to be since midnight."" So all customer service did was tell me I lied about my entire horrible experience at this place, and that the office women are angels. But it's still our fault somehow???? Even though THEY'RE twisting the info they gave us to fit their needs? To be fair, the actual (male) dentist knows his work and did a fantastic job.

 Monarch Dental ,"  Monarch Dental  FM 731 
Burleson, Texas USA ","", ,"","  My husband had numerous teeth pulled, a full denture upper, and a partial lower, just over a year ago. After he got them, he made repeated attempts to have them fitted properly. He was told numerous explanations, but they never really fixed them. It was said that it would take about a year for his gums to fully heal, and they would do a ""soft fitting"" on the top for now. Every time it seems he would have to see a different person. and about 1/2 the time it made them fit worse, but when it did get better, it never lasted long. When he complained that the bottom was unusable, because it comes loose and stabs him in the jaw with a sharp piece of metal whenever he tries to eat with them, he was told he'd have to get used to it, or that he must have bent it himself. Also, the lower has never lined up correctly with the upper. The top should have lips around the gums, but there is almost no lip in the back, and it was made before the lower was in, so there was no way to correctly fit them together.  Now that it's been over a year, how can he get correctly fitting dentures, instead of these practically worthless things that were VERY expensive. After complaining at their website, they did try to help us, but we are still very dissapointed and dissatisfied in the service we have received. The second dentist there tried making some adjustments that made the bottom better, but said the problem with the top was due to his ""lack of bone structure, so he wouldn't be able to get a deeper lip"" on the outside. Then she started trimming more off the lip on the upper dentures, even though my husband came right out and told her that he didn't want her to do that. She just kinda sighed and kept on grinding on them. Then she gave them back and said that down the line we should consider some implants for the dentures, and he said he was not going to spend any more money here. She actually made the top fit worse, since there is now less lip to hold onto his gums. I guess the big dissapointment is that we were never told before paying to have all that work done, that he would probably be dissapointed in the results, due to his bone structure. We feel that Monarch Dental misrepresented the results we could expect for the amount of money we paid. And we absolutely cannot see why we should throw more money at the problem, since he has not been satisfied with the results we got for the money we spent. This is not the way a complaining customer should be treated, and now he's not ever going to let anyone touch the dentures he has for fear of them making it worse.  She also said something about doing a hard reline, but didn't seem to think it would make it any better. I can't believe in this day and age, a person can't get decent dentures, at least not from Monarch Dental. We are sorry we ever got talked into doing all this work with Monarch. ",  Dental Services

denver, Colorado USA ","", ,""," Greetings! I would like to warn everyone about Cancun Cosmetic Dentistry/ Cancun Top Dental/ Dental Maya- and they have/had one other name, but I have forgotten. The theory of dental tourism- having dental work done outside the USA is excellent.   And Cancun is a wonderful location.  However, Cancun Cosmetic dentistry is perhaps the worst clinic you can visit.  I would like to briefly outline my concerns and experience. 1) Cancun Cosmetic Dentistry is a money making center first, and a dental clinic second. 2) The owner, Dr German, is not a specialist, he is a general dentist.   He and his sister are business people- they spend a tremendous amount of money on advertising, marketing and professional sales force.  They spend around 30,000 usd per month to get business- maybe more.   All of the 'positive' press is bought and paid for.   All of the websites they advertise on are bought and paid for- we are talking major money.  3) All of the work is performed by young dentists right out of school.   It is easy for the owners to recruit young dentist because everyone in Mexico wants to live in Cancun.   The owners pay these young doctors very little.   And all of the young dentist are paid by commission.   because these dentist are young and want money (who does not) they perform unnessacary procedures so as just to get paid.   Also, because they are young and inexperienced, these dentists make a lot of mistakes. 4) In another attempt to maximize profits, the clinic purchases the cheapest dental materials available.  and the clinic uses the cheapest dental lab (the people who make crowns, veneers, etc).   The consequences of this is that the crowns/veneers will not last that long.   let me explain why- if the crown/veneer does not fit perfectly, mostiture and bacteria will get in between the crown/veneer and the file downed tooth.   Then, with time, the underlying bone will rot away.   also, if the crown/veneers are not fitted properly, over time the crown/veneer will just pop off, especially if the crown/veneer is seated too high or not vertically correct.  The continued force of the crowns/veneers coming together over and over again will not only break the crown/veneer, but will compromise the shaved down tooth- which mean, not only will your crown/veneer be worthless, but the underlying tooth will be destroyed, leading you with nothing! 5) These people change names like I change girlfriends.   Dental Maya, Cancun Cosmetic Dentistry, Cancun Top Dental, and at least one other name, I think 2.   They change names when the complaints pile up, and maybe for other reasons. 6) The refund policy is flawed.  If you are lucky enough to get a refund, it will not be 100%- maybe 75%- and the lady owner, I forget her name, will make you sign a non-disclosure promising not to post anything on line- and they will sue you in the usa if you break the non-disclosure! If you need serious dental work, Cancun is a great location.  And if you come to Cancun, you should get consultations from 3-4 clinics.  I would recommend Dentiras, Dentcare, Hospident or Dentistar; If you are going to have a lot of work done.   All of these clinics are owned by the surgeon who does the procedures.   All of these clinics are more concerned about a quality outcome than over money.  Since these surgeons are so good, they have a steady amount of business, so they do not advertise as aggressively as Cancun cosmetic- they do not need to.   I know for a fact that when Dr German needs dental work done, he goes to one of the clinics I have listed. I work for none of these people.  I met with all of these clinics.  I know what I am taking about.  Feel free to email me any questions. (((email redacted))) ",  Dental Services

I was scared after not being to the dentist for a while and they used this to their full advantage by hard selling me a deep cleaning for $1117 (by telling me that i could die if i did not get it!) and recommending another $1500 worth of work. I was in their office for nearly 5 hours and my Mom was scared that they ripped me off (she has had lots of dental work in her life) so I got a second opinion at her dentist (a small local office) lo and behold the additional work was mostly unnecessary and when they took x rays their was still plaque in between my gums! their $1117 scaling was not done correctly at all! w When I called and spoke to the manager he said they would make it right with me but they didn't at all and after my emails and proof (X-rays) they their office did a bad job he would not refund me and than they just stopped replying to my emails. I had an absolutely horrible experience with this company and will make sure to tell every single person I meet to never go there. they should be ashamed for using scare tactics to sell unnecessary procedures to people who are scared and drugged up on novocaine.

Internet USA ",www.affinitydentalfresno.net, 5597174179,""," I am a former patient of this dental office. In this review I am exposing all the scare techniques and cheating strategies the management of this office uses to fool patients into accepting dental treatmentsfor the profit of the owner doctors. I came to know about this after my initial visit because my friend is a dental assistant and former employee of this office. My friend’s job as a dental assistant offered her a first hand experience of the unbelievable system of deceiving patients that stands behind the operation of Affinity Dental in Fresno. What’s amazing is that everything she actually told me, proved to be exactly true?.In spite of this office portraying itself as an outstanding cosmetic dental office, this is primarily an HMO office that accepts patients insured by low cost dental plans|. Because of the low level of patient education on the dental insurance matter and due to the high cost of running such a huge operation, the solution implemented by the owner doctors and management is simple: deal with high volumes, push dental upgrades and unnecessary treatments, collect as much up-front, send the work to the cheapest possible dental laboratory and wish to never see the patient back.It all starts with the new patient exam. Patients are initially sized-up by a treatment coordinator. Questions like what’s your occupation, do you like your smile, when was the last time you were at the dentist and many other questions are asked in the friendliest manner:. You wouldn’t know that you’re actually embarking on a nasty and expensive ride"". There is probably a scheme and specific pathway to follow depending on each possible answer!After this interview is done, the treatment coordinator talks to the dentist who will be doing the exam behind closed doors. I don't know what’s exactly said in there, but after this conversation the dentist doing the exam will use any of the following techniques in determining the patient to accept expensive and often times unneeded treatment: convince and scare the patient that without deep cleaning andantibiotic treatments he/she will get heart disease and teeth will start falling out; embarass the patient about the looks of his/her smile then promise an expensive cosmetic dental solution; diagnose non-existent cavities; overlook dental treatments needed for kids because of the low reimbursement fees; plan unneeded gum cutting procedures; propose unneeded material upgrades. After the whole speech and scare of what it would happen if these issues are not addressed immediately, patient is handed over to the treatment coordinator. Here the “sale” takes place, because in the end it’s all about the money in this dental office. These people are paid like used car dealers a bonus on the amount collected. The more is collected and work done with less expense, the more money they will make. So it follows that all kind of sale techniques are employed here including high interest credit cards where the whole amount is charged out even before the treatment starts, in order to avoid patients have second thoughts or change their mind once they left the office. If you would like to be taken for this nasty ride, you definitely should pay this office a visit. If none of these bother you, it will probably bother you that at the end you will get a bad result. That is because they work with the cheapest dental laboratories in the country. Dentists employed by this office as well as the dentist owner are very rude with zero bedside manners, most likely the cheapest to employ they can find and they keep changing very often. If you think of taking your complaint to the office manager, as related by my friend, dealing with her is a nightmare. Managers and dentists know what’s happening but they are ruthless for an extra dollar earned for themselves and this almighty multi-location California dental corporation. As a patient you don’t have a dentist, you will get the dentist based on his ability to perform the most tricks for the least cost. The work goes to the Philippines and Belize dental laboratories and the end product looks nothing like human teeth. Get a grip on reality, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. This corporation has offices in San Diego, Fresno, Ventura, Los Angeles and many other locations probably coming up running by the same business model. ",  Dental Services

										I would first like to say 
that I have been suffering from TMJ for years. I made this clear to Dr. Sid 
Solomon's staff when I called them. They assured me that he is the best and is 
world known for helping TMJ patients. I felt a bit uneasy when speaking with 
his staff it seemed like a bad scripted sales pitch. But when youre in chronic 
pain all day you will take risks and money becomes of no object. They informed 
me that there is a consultation fee because Dr. Sid Solomon's time is so
limited because of all the TMJ patient's he sees. I agreed to pay the fee and 
scheduled my appointment. 
I arrived for my first appointment and noticed the office was 
empty, no patients anywhere to be seen. Just one lady in the front that seemed 
to be very nice and polite, she looked very familiar. Come to find out she's in 
the testimonial videos on his website. So I guess he's having his staff do fake 
testimonial videos so they can add to their credibility. I didn't find this out
till it was too late. On my first appointment they brought me into this little 
room and sat me in this comfortable chair. He began asking me questions while 
hooking me up to some device. He really has this entire scam set up pretty well
to make you think he knows what he is doing. So after about 20 minutes of 
talking and doing his tests he calls in the front desk lady. They start talking 
about the mouth devices I need so that I won't be in pain anymore. They assure 
me that this special device costs only about $6500 and it will 100% cure my 
pain. This sounded way too good to be true, I think to myself why has no other expert 
suggested this before? Maybe he knows something they don't know because he is 
""world known"". Anyways I fell for this very elaborate sales pitch and 
accepted treatment. Shortly after I receive this mouth guard look alike device that is 
going to cure my TMJ. I wear it just as explained to me and guess what?
Nothing... Same pain levels no change what so ever. 
So this is where all the fun begins. I call them to explain 
that the device isn't working and what the heck should I do. They bring me back 
in for another review with the Doctor and he explains to me that I need some 
special surgery. At this point I'm telling him I cannot afford this and I want 
my money back for the device since it doesn't work. As soon as he heard money
back he lit up his eyes got big and he became enraged. He quickly calls the

They offer to re do the device for free and if that doesn't work they will 
refund my money. So soon after I get the device and use as directed, no change 
in my pain. I call and say enough is enough, refund me my money! The front desk 
lady turns into a different person and basically tells me to screw off, she hangs 
up the phone. I called them a dozen times and they would continue to be 
extremely rude to me and hang up. So now I'm out a lot of money and I still
have zero relief. Don't trust their fancy devices and their very strong sales 
pitch, its all a scam. This guy has no idea what he is doing he's just here to 
scam you out of your money. If you do a yelp search on him you will see many 
bad reviews that expose him for what he really is. I really wish I would've 
done the research beforehand, would've saved a lot of money.I would first like to say that I have been suffering from TMJ for years and my case is very advanced. I made this clear to Dr. Sid Solomon's staff when I called them. They assured me that he is the best and is world known for helping TMJ patients. I felt a bit uneasy when speaking with his staff it seemed like way to much like a bad scripted sales pitch. But when your in chronic pain all day you will take risks and money becomes of no object. They informed me that there is a consultation fee because Dr. Sid Solomon's time is so limited because of all the TMJ patient's he see's. I agreed to pay the fee and scheduled my appointment. 
I arrived for my first appointment and noticed the office was empty, no patients anywhere to be seen. Just one lady in the front that seemed to be very nice and polite, she looked very familiar. Come to find out she's in the testimonial videos on his website. So I guess he's having his staff do fake testimonial videos so they can add to their credibility. I didn't find all of this out till it was to late. So on my first appointment they brought me into this little room and sat me in this comfortable chair. He began asking me questions while hooking me up to some device. He really has this entire scam set up pretty well to make you think he knows what he is doing. So after about 20 minutes of talking and doing his tests he calls in the front desk lady. They start talking about the different mouth devices I need so that I won't be in pain anymore. They assure me that this special device costs only about $6500 and it will 100% cure my pain. This sounded way to good to be true I think to myself why hasn't any other expert suggested this before? But maybe he knows something they don't know because he is ""world known"". Anyways I fell for this very elaborate sales pitch and accepted treatment. Shortly after I receive this mouth guard look alike device that is going to cure my TMJ. I wear it just as explained to me and guess what? Nothing... Same pain levels, no change what so ever. 
So this is were all the fun begins. I call them to explain that the device isn't working and what the heck should I do. They bring me back in for another review with the Doctor and he explains to me that I need some special surgery. At this point I'm telling him I cannot afford this and I want my money back for the device since it doesn't work. As soon as he heard money back he lit up his eyes got big and he become enraged. He quickly calls the front desk lady in to ""save the deal"" and explain to me no refunds. They offer to re do the device for free and if that doesn't work they will refund my money. So sooner after I get the device and use as directed, no change in my pain. I call and say enough is enough, refund me my money! The front desk lady turns into a different person and basically tells me to screw off, she hangs up the phone. I called them a dozen times and they would continue to be extremely rude to me and hang up. So now I'm out a lot of money and I still have zero relief.

Went back to office crying where the Dentist Dr. Horoutz yelled at me to stop crying u r not a baby he states.I said u ruined my good tooth when all I came in for was a filling for a back tooth.I made that pefectly clear when I made the appointment.You said it needed a crown so I paid for it. He now says he can fill that one  for another 239.00. At first he said it needed a crown,but now he says he can fill it because he saw how distessed I was in loosing a good tooth and then needing a crown on it since the tooth was drilled down to nothing I had no choice.So $1239.00 later I have a tooth that was filled as I wanted to begin with and told he couldnt do, and a cap on a pefectly good tooth that was ruined from dentist drilling it away.

										I was very hopeful after reading glowing accolades on their site from grateful former clients, who in detail discussed how greatly their lives had been changed for the better after the ""Cosmetic Dentistry Grants Program"" paid out tens of thousands of dollars for new crowns, bridges and implants, all of which I am in dire need of. 
I filled out the application at about 2 am and heard from ""Paula"" the following morning at 9, who left me a message that I had been accepted and it was very important I get back to them within 48 business hours or I would lose my place. She also sent me an email letting me know she's just left me a voice mail. So, when I woke up I called them immediately. The very first thing I was told by Paula was:""It will be $150 to$200 for X-Rays. Hope that's okay with you"" 
After a moment of stunned silence I hung up the phone. Within minutes I received an email telling me I had been ""dropped from the program"". ""Gee"" I wondered..if they're grating 10's of thousands of dollars...why won't they pay for x-rays? 
So in my opinion this is a scam. ""We give you 10's of thousands in grants for cosmetic dentistry,you just have to give us a lil 'ol $200 to get started"". I don't think so. 
I also looked up the reviews of the participating dentist in my city and they basically said he treated his wealthy patients well, and everyone who came in with a groupon was given short shrift, with long waits, major attitude and attempts to get the person who came in for a cleaning to commit to much more work. I saw something like 40 of this type of review for their local dentist. Well, if its too good to be true, it usually is. Buyer Beware!",  Dental Services

										I was charged 94.31 on my debit card for a sample of prowhite.  I called the number on my bank statement and was told that I did not cancel the trial order in time.  This is definitely a scam and when I called, I can hardly understand the person I talked to.  First she said she could refund $45.00, then I said no, and she offered a refund of $60.00.  I didn't understand most of what she said.  The phone number on my bank statement was 888-824-0297 NV.  thank you. EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN

ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder

										Paid this Dentist $14,900.00 for new crowns and veneers. Told him the color I wanted. Temporary color was good. The day he put on the permanent crowns and veneers, I said they are too dark. He told me ""oh no, it's just the lighting in my office. This is the right color for a person your age"". Being that I couldn't hardly speak because my mouth was so numb, I left. When I got home, my husband was shocked. He said I can't tell you had anything done. The color is the same as your old teeth. I still had the black area on my gumline above a previous implanted front tooth (Dr. Peralta was to replace this with a white one so you don't see the dark area under the gum).  I waited 24hrs to see if I still hated them and I did. I sent an email to Dr. Peralta (as he wouldn't talk to me on the phone) explaining that I hated the color and that he did not give me the color teeth I had asked for. I said, even the temporaries were lighter than what he gave me for permanent teeth. Wouldn't a person think that the permanent teeth will look at least as nice as the temporaries ones? 
Dr. Peralta never once asked me to come to his office to discuss or even tried to resolve the issue. All I received was a poorly written letter telling me that because he felt I insulted him and his work, he would no longer see me and would not give me any refund to get this fixed.
The man is very arrogant. He will shake his head yes when you are telling him what you want and then does whatever he wants to do with your mouth. 
After this occurred, my husband decided to get his teeth done in Los Algodones by another dentist. The work that Dr. Peralta quoted him was going to be $15,500. My husband had the exact same work done in Los Algodones for $5,400.00. My husbands teeth look great. They are not too white for his age, not the ""Hollywood White"" - they just look nice and healthy.
Dr. Peralta knows what he did and could care less about what his patient wants. He also knew he was going to get away with this. 
I would still recommend going to Mexico for dental care but BEWARE. Never assume anything. Asl questions. Here in the united states and in Los Algodones, the temporary teeth they place are the color you will receive for your permanent. That way, if you don't like the color, you have time to have it changed. After the fact, Dental Bliss told me ""oh no, we only have one color we use for temporaries. It would cost too much to carry all the colors.""
I feel as though Dr. Peralta didn't care about what the patient wanted. He just ""stole"" my money. He is not an honest businessman/professional.
I have asked also asked for my x-rays so I don't have to pay a new dentist to do this.  I have called Dr. Peralt's office 3 seperate times asking tio have my xrays sent to me (so I don't have to pay my new dentist for unneccessary ones). Instead of just saying no, we aren't going to send you the x-rays that belong to you, the office staff keep saying ""we are working on it"". That was 3 monthsa ago.

I asked to see if he was the doctor, and he just replied NO without giving me his name. I asked him for his name again, and he never replayed.

										I was looking for a dentist in Tampa, we are new here, and I found Oceanside. Probably the worst mistake of my entire life. I should have known when I called on a Saturday to make an appointment and they tried to get me to come in that day. I scheduled for Friday afternoon of the following week for my daughter and I (I asked very specifically if they did kids dentistry and he said they did. More on that in a moment). 
Upon arrival, the place smelled of old recycled, smoky air. I thought ""maybe it's just an old building?"" So we filled out the paper work and waited. There was more paper work about collecting on our bill than there was about our dental history, which was odd. So we waited for an hour, then they took me back, my daughter stayed in the waiting room with my husband. A nurse, who was quite nice, took me into a very ""retro"" looking exam room, sat me down only to do an about face and direct me to another room where she took an x-ray. Then we returned to the original exam room. I waited in there for about 30 minutes before a man wearing jeans, a button up shirt that was unbuttoned half way and he was dripping with sweat, came in to ""examine me"". He didn't even look at my teeth, he looked at the x-ray, found a cavity on it, then ran to tell the nurse how excited he was to have found it. Then the office manager came in and the ""Doctor"" told him that I was going to need a root canal. They made it sound very urgent, like my head would explode if I didn't have it done right then and there. So, I consented. The ""doctor"" shot me up with an unusual amount of Novocain, then left the room. He was gone for about 30 minutes. While he was gone, I heard the office manager down the hall yell ""She's got good insurance, MetLife... covers 80%..."" then he came in and said my portion would be $230 and asked for my credit card while we waited. It was getting late, so I thought maybe they were just trying to speed up the process. I paid, then waited for another 20 minutes.
MEANWHILE, at 7:30 my daughter still hadn't been seen (our appt was at 5:30). When they finally did come and get her, she's 6 mind you, the nurse told my husband he wouldn't be allowed to accompany her because of the ""harmful radiation"", which obviously wasn't true because they never did a singe x-ray on her as they are not equipped to handle children. They literally brushed and flossed her teeth, she never saw a doctor, just the nurse. 
So I'm still in the exam room, waiting for this amazing root canal. The doctor finally comes in, after 45 minutes and shoots me up with a little more medicine and starts in on the most disorganized dental procedure I've ever had in my whole life. There were things missing, he and the nurse had to leave the room several times to get tools and supplies, things fell on the floor, they were just picked right back up and put straight in my mouth. The nurse had to remind the ""doctor to put on gloves several times. They said the tooth was pretty infected so it would take 3 visits to complete the procedure. It was a nightmare. 
We got there at 5 we left at 8:30, I was never given an actual exam, not a cleaning, nothing. They scheduled another procedure for the next day, we went along with it just so we could get out of there, and I left with a mouth full of sloppy cement and a distinct possibility that I could have tetanus. 
Monday I called my insurance company to make sure the right things were charged after reading some rather damning reviews. They charged for several things that never took place: for my daughter they charged for an oral evaluation, a panoramic x-ray and a complete set of x-rays, none of which were done. For me they claimed an oral evaluation, a crown, a porcelain veneer, and a full set of x-rays. The insurance agent also informed me that for all of the procedures they charged 100% over the usual rate (ex. generally a child's evaluation would cost $60, they charged $150). 
I am now under the care of a new dentist that is re-doing the root canal as it was done incorrectly.

me and not my insurance company.    
I set up payment arrangements even before my procedure was done (which they accepted).  However, I was thrown in a back room which has a door on it on my next appointment to be told that they could not accept my payment arrangement (after the papers were signed, sealed and delivered a week earlier).   The office manager was very rude, and said that there was nothing I could do except to pay them that day.   Then they stated that they were only going to do half the work.

Dr. Ponce is also known to LIE to your face and talk behind your back with her office staff.  She also pins you down in the chair.  She does not the parents come in the exam room with their children.   Her dental work is very substandard.  I ended up having to go to another dental office to have all the work she performed redone!

We both had a coupon that indicated first time patients receive a full comprehensive exam at $69.00. When I made the appointment I specifically asked whether they would be padded charges that we are NOT informed up up-front and the answer was NO! I had the first exam and my companion went in after my exam was concluded. I paid the assistant manager in full $138.00 and made it clear to her that it was for me and my companion so she was well aware of the fact we were both paid in full. Half-way through the exam my companion called me on my cell (I left the office to take care of business calls since he and I went to the appointments together) and told me he was informed that he needed additional services. We discussed that he would either wait and do it at some later date or just take care of the additional service right then and there. However, he DID NOT RECEIVE THE ADDITIONAL SERVICE AND WE WERE CHARGED FOR IT. He was unaware that this was done, and I was unaware that he opted out of receiving the addition service. Later in the day we discussed our exams, and I asked ""How was the additional service?"" To which he replied, ""What are you talking about? I declined and told them I would take care of it at some later date!"" Now I ask you, how would you feel?

										My family and i have spent thousands of dollars with this Dentist, we like to stick with one Dentist and establish a 
relationship and feel comfortable with every visit.
We had thought things were going in the right direction but then my wifewas admitted to Hospital she was in Hospital for over a month and then  our baby came early at just 25 weeks weighing only 1lb and 5 ounces. The next 4 months that followed were very stressful with the Dr  giving us  just a 30% chance of survival for our baby ! 
As one could understand our mail was piling up , luckily all our bills  were on autopay with our bank so we were able to focus on our premature  baby.
When our baby finally came home i was able to get back into my routine of opening up all my mail ect when i came across a bill for $100.00 that had come about 8 weeks prior and was placed in my big stack and left  unopened. [continued below]....
									
										..... To my surprise this Dentist sent me to collection for just $100 that was not paid by my insurance. 
I of course paid this charge right away and tried to talk to the Dentist regarding this charge and explained i did not know that was not covered by insurance and also explained we had just spent the last 5 months dealing with a premature baby in the hospital and the lady just out right didn't care. I WAS RUDELY TOLD THAT PEOPLE WHO DON'T PAY THEIR BILLS GET SENT TO COLLECTIONS ! I even sent a letter to Dr Himmelstein explaining our situation with the premature baby and the fact we also had no idea the insurance didn't pay this bill and he never even gave me the common courtesy of a return letter, seems like very bad business to lose a whole family who has spent thousands of dollars with them to just throw us away for $100.00
Now my 800 plus credit score has dropped way down all due to this 100.00 collection account and even though its paid it still sits as a negative on my credit report affecting my score and the Interest i pay for items. I even tried disputing the charge with credit report and Dr Louis Himmelstein sends a reply back to the reporting agency that its a valid mark on my credit, yet when i sent Dr Louis Himmelstein a personal letter explaining what has happen i get no reply back ! GREAT BEDSIDE MANOR - Dr Louis Himmelstein wants your money he does not care about his patients  ! 
I would stay far away from this practice, they only care ONLY about the money you are not made to feel at home with them, you can spend thousands of dollars with them and if you miss on just $100.00 you are sent to collections in just 8 short weeks.
Dr Louis Himmelstein is a good Dentist i cant take that away from him, my son and i both had good experience as far as the work that was performed, but the lack of understanding & compassion for our situation and the fact we were sent to collection after just 8 weeks is not acceptable. I would like to think if this Dentist actually knew what had happen he would be calling me and making this right ! But maybe this all comes from him i guess i will never know !

										On 3/11/13 I was seen at the Coast Dental Office to have the dentist fill cavities. I was told that since they did not offer the silver fillings I would need to pay an up charge of $117 per tooth.  Since they deal with the insurance company on a daily basis and I obviously go to them because I trust they will not get over on me I did not question it and paid them $379.00 for the fillings. About two weeks later, I had to take my son to get fillings at another dental office and was NOT charged for white fillings. We have the same insurance so it raised some questions. In general conversation at work, my co-worker brought up that her dentist tried to charge her for white fillings and she called the insurance company to verify the charges. She was told that if they only do white fillings they cannot charge the up charge. So I called the dental office and asked the general question do you offer silver fillings. Jennifer, which is the office manager, advised me that they do not.  I then called my insurance company and they advised me that the dental office is not suppose to charge the customer if they do not offer anything other than white fillings.  The insurance company called the office and spoke with Jenifer. Now all of a sudden the silver filling option is on my treatment plan. When I was in the office the day of my visit I was told you need fillings and this is how much it was going to cost. There was no mention of options just fees. I trusted that I would have an honest dental team.  I am not an insurance agent, they told me the cost and what needed to be done. I consider myself to be a fairly intelligent person so I can just imagine how many people they have ripped off.  According to my insurance company, this happens all the time. I called the office to get the corporate number and Jenifer was so abrasive. She said, you signed it, and there is nothing anyone can do about it. So I am going to yell until someone hears me.									",  Dental Services

Broken Arrow, Oklahoma United States of America ",www.emersonbraces.com, 918-459-0092,"Emerson Orthodontics Dr. Clinton Emerson, Beware of Breach of Contract as well as abandoning his patients Broken Arrow, Oklahoma","
										Dr. Clinton W Emerson has not fulfilled his end of the contract signed on June 9, 2011 regarding a frenectomy that was to be done on our daughter. 
Our twelve-year old daughter had one front tooth that stuck out considerably and was requiring orthodontics to fix it. We visited several different orthodontists and chose Emerson Orthodontics because he had treated one other client with the same problem and felt confident his method would fix it. We also chose Emerson because he was able to perform a frenectomy in the office. While his price was higher than other orthodontists, the additional savings we would incur by not going to an oral surgeon were to our benefit.
On June 9, 2011, we signed a contract for orthodontic treatment from Clinton W Emerson, DMD, of Emerson Orthodontics. It was based on an evaluation dated March 10, 2011 and included the following recommendations of treatment by Emerson at a fee of $2024:
* 9+months of estimated treatment
* No extractions of permanent teeth are needed for the treatment
* Removal of excess tissue between the top front teeth to close space
* Limited braces/appliances to correct a limited dental problem: headgear used to help with your deep bite
* Braces called bands will be used on the following teeth to increase bond strength: upper right first molar: upper left first molar
* Watch for development of #29
I called on June 10th at 11:45 a.m. and spoke with Melissa to verify the contract information and she said anything in the estimate will be covered. She informed me that they can do the frenectomy in the office with a laser procedure. We began treatment with headgear and asked several times throughout the year about the frenectomy. I asked about it when her braces were removed on 4/12/12. We were told that it would be done towards the end of the treatment. 
My husband took our daughter to her most recent appointment at Emerson Orthodontics on Monday, January 28, 2012. They checked the bonded retainer that is currently still on her teeth and verified that everything was good and informed us to make an appointment for 6 months from now. My husband, again, asked about the frenectomy and Dr Emerson told him that he is not comfortable doing it and we need to take her to an oral surgeon. He also informed us that he is done with her treatment and we need to find a new orthodontist. 
We paid $xxxx for Phase I treatment which included a frenectomy, and are now being told it will need to be done by an oral surgeon. We would never have chosen Emerson Orthodontics at a higher cost if he had been honest with us and told us he was not doing the frenectomy. In addition, we now have to find another orthodontist who can continue the other phases of treatment, particularly since she still has wires on her teeth and Dr Emerson is unwilling to continue treatment. We are requesting a refund of $500 so that we can have a frenectomy done by an oral surgeon since Dr. Emerson is nervous about performing it and has not fulfilled his end of the contract.     									",  Dental Services

										In early January 2013 while on Facebook I clicked on an ad for free teeth whitening samples. It took me to the HydraWhite Website.
I completed all the information requested including my debit card number to cover the shipping charges for the ""free samples"". When I got to the end of the personal information page, I saw that it was a monthly subscription program. I DID not click on ""Order Now"" or what ever the request was. I then exited the website and went back to my Facebook page.
The following day I get a phone call from a man saying that he represented HydraWhite and other Web based companies. He asked why I didn't complete my HydraWhite order and I told him that I did not want to enroll in ANY subscription program because I was/am undergoing treatments and surgeries for breast cancer and I didn't want to have to keep up with subscription or membership cancelation deadlines. He told me that I could get the samples without signing up for a subscription and asked if I still wanted the free samples. I told him yes and gave him my approval to apply the shipping charges to my debit card.
When I got my February Bank Statement in early March, I found a $98.32 charge from HydraWhite.
I called Hydrawhite on March 12th to inquire about the charge. I spoke to a Supervisor named Matt. He told me the charge was for the 2nd shipment of my subscription and that they had charged me $87.41 on January 9th for the January shipment. 
I reiterated the phone conversation that I got from the guy saying he was a HydraWhite Rep. I told Matt that I did not give my approval for the subscription, that I wanted a full refund and to cancel my subscription. Eventually Matt agreed to give me a full refund upon receipt of return of the product.
I returned the product on March 21st via overnight USPS and was told HydraWhite would receive the package by 3:00pm on March 22nd.
On March 26th I got my March Bank Statement and found another $98.32 charge from HydraWhite. I immediately called HydraWhite to inform them that I had not received the shipment and to follow up on the product return on March 21st. I was told that they had not yet received my return and that the Post Office delivered the March shipment of product on the 9th. We ended our conversation so that I could find my receipt from the Post Office to get the tracking number.
I went to the USPS Online tracking site and found that HydraWhite received the package at 10:18am on March 22nd and it included the recipients name and signature.
I called HydraWhite back to relay the information I got from USPS. I spoke to a different supervisor who informed me that they had received the return. I told her I expected a full refund for all three shipments. She told me that they would only refund me $98.32 for the last shipment. I told her that Matt assured me of a full refund and she said he did not have the authority to do so. While I was asking her why he would tell me I would get a full refund SHE HUNG UP ON ME.
HydraWhite to date (March 26, 2013) has charged me a total of $284.05 and have caused me to have two Insufficient Funds Charges totalling $70.
This whole situation has put me in dire financial straits, created a great amount of anxiety and many sleepless nights. I've not been able to pay my utility bills or buy groceries.

										They did not actually clean my teeth at my check up. They claimed I needed a more expensive 'deep cleaning. This 'deep cleaning' was exactly like the regular cleaning I got at my previous dentist.
I told them I did not want to have any work done until I knew what my insurance covered. They gave me an estimate. I said I wanted to be sure that was what they would pay for. They led me to believe the information was accurate. Turns out they never contacted my insurance. 
I get the 'care card' to fix a broken molar. The filling was very big. It did not get bigger between the check up and having the crown work done. Apparently, my insurance did not cover the build up for the crown to actually sit on. I think a dentist who knows what they're doing could tell from the check up whether they would have to make a 'post' for the crown. I think an office that processes insurance would know if a company covered this or not. First they said my insurance changed and no longer covered it. When I called my insurance, they said they never covered 'posts' for crowns unless it was a root canal or implant. They also told me this office had never requested verification of my benefits. 
they started sending me a bill for $350 with absolutely no explanation as to what I supposedly owe them this money over. Just a highlighter mark over the amount. I highlighted the blank spaces under 'date? patient? code? Description? and returned it.
I got a list of everything my insurance paid for along with what was billed to the card. The outstanding amount is listed as 'not a covered benefit by employer'.

On Sunday, March 17, 2013, decided  that the wasn't going to be enough time to evaluate the product, so not being near a computer called the number given. Computer generated, I gave my phone number for reference as it requested.  They  didn't have any such number, I tried twice, and twice the same.  Early Monday, March 18, 2013, I was checking my bank account and noticed that $94.31 was being taken out of my account. So, I phoned the company again and spoke to an associate. He that I have gone past the trial period and that was why I was charged.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and he said that there wasn't one available.  I persisted and he eventually said there wasn't one. He said as a courtesy they would refund my account $45.00 to keep the product, or refund $60.00 and send back the remaining. I told him I was going to report the company as well as my bank for investigation. I am so upset about this in so many ways.  I work part time, I work hard for my money and thieves like this that scam us is infuriating.

										The other report is 100% accurate. Though he did not lie about mercury and amalgam, and offered me composites. I don't doubt he is liar though.
The other report is right about them overbilling you. I always paid after my visits and was quoted the rest would be covered by insurance. However the bills kept coming in as well, one after the other. I know this is my health insurance that won't cover everything, but Complete Dental is at fault for misquoting you, not getting on the phone with your insurance, and adding on things that you don't consent to. I paid more than twice as much as I was quoted here.
I don't know why it didn't strike me as strange that I have been cavity free all my life, and suddenly when I come here I have more than 10. I think Dr Herradine looks for any brown stain on your tooth and claims it is a cavity . I should have gotten a second opinion right away, but since what they quoted me to fill it wasn't much (around $130) I did not think too much of it. I ended up paying almost $300 to get all the cavities filled, and on my ""last visit"" they told me I sitll had one more. That was BS, and I refuse to go in ever again. Is it a surprise this last ""cavity"" hasn't been bothering me?

										I went to a health expo at the Dallas Convention Center a couple of years ago and met Dr. Petra Yarno Schubert here.  I was so impressed with her knowledge so I decided to go to her to have all my amalgams taken out since I am on a holistic cancer protocol and needed to have any amalgams in my mouth taken out before doing the Gerson Therapy.  I was excited to finally get my amalgams out and have white composites put in.  Dr. Schubert's office is well-equipped with all the required standards for removing amalgams properly without inhaling the toxic mercury.  
On my first visit, she hurt my teeth so bad and my last tooth was in so much pain that I ended up having a root canal (with another dentist).  The rest of my teeth where the amalgams were removed were okay but my bite was very off because I couldn't close my mouth fully. On top of it, during the procedure she gave me a mercury tattoo on my bottom lip!  She turned to her assistant and asked her ""how did that get there?"" She didn't do anything to remove it. [continued below]....
									
										.....  
In fact, she blamed me for ""moving too much.""  Let me remind you that I am on an intense cancer protocol and mercury is very toxic.  After my procedure, I was hoping that the pain on my last molar would subside since she told me that it was normal to feel pain for a few days.  After a week, the pain got worse.  After 2 weeks it was so unbearable that I begged her to see what was causing the pain in my last tooth.  I called her very early on a Friday so I can try to see her that day but she got mad that I ""bothered'' her at such an early hour.  
I went back the second time (on a Monday) and my bite was still not fixed.  My last tooth was so unbearable that I just decided to go to another dentist to have a root canal.  I couldn't wait one more day.  I will AVOID this dentist at all cost.  Her knowledge is superb but she is a terrible dentist with terrible manners!  I would never recommend her for anything even if her service was free.  I still have the mercury tattoo on my lip.  Beware, she attends all kinds of health expo and even speaks at conventions.  Like I said she's got an impressive knowledge in holistic dentistry but her hands on are downright terrible!  You will be sorry...I was...very, very, sorry!

										Dr. Petra Schubert Orthodontist is the worst and most unprofessional company that I have ever worked with in my entire life. My fianc decided to purchase a Groupon for Invisalign from them. Dr. Petra Schubert Orthodontist agreed to make a pay by month thing seeing as we could not just pay the $5000 up front. Of course, they always make us aware that they were nice enough to work with us. We bought the Groupon and went in for the first visit. 
She went in May and had her pictures taken and they told her they were going to send the pictures off and in 6 weeks the aligners would be there and she could start the process. She went back 6 weeks later (after taking time off of work) expecting to pick the aligners up and it turns out they had forgotten to send the pictures off They tried to lie about it and say that invisalign was backed up but then they finally admitted they hadnt gotten the pictures out. They said they would submit the pictures to invisalign over the internet immediately and it should only take about 2 weeks to get in. 
My fianc called two weeks later and the lady at the front desk, once again, had an attitude and said it takes several weeks for the aligners to come in. So instead of it being 2 weeks, she had to wait about another 5 weeks to get the starting set of aligners. We were told that insurance would cover $1,000 and we would be left with a balance of $2000. My fianc and I talked it over and we decided that we would make it work because it was important to my fianc to straighten her teeth for our upcoming wedding. 
They are extremely unprofessional when it comes to responding to correspondence. My fianc has sent them SEVERAL emails without a receiving a response back (or it would be weeks later). She has left the office voicemails and they only seem to get back to her when or if its convenient for them. Dr. Petra Schubert Orthodontist does NOT care about their customers! They rope you in with deals and then they feel like they can screw you over. Their customer service is abysmal. The front office receptionist is rude and does not know how to do her job. 
Dr. Petra Schubert Orthodontist is luring customers in with the Groupon and then cheating them out of money! When my fianc went in for her first visit she was FORCED to undergo a deep cleaning that was never discussed prior to us agreeing to the deal. Then we get a bill for the cleaning even though we stated that the cleaning was not necessary because she had her teeth cleaned recently. Dr. Petra Schubert Orthodontist insisted on the cleaning, but NEVER told us that the cleanings would not be covered by our insurance. 
They conveniently left that information out! In fact, they made it seem like insurance was going to cover the cleanings. We have been waiting to hear from Dr. Petra Schubert Orthodontist in regards to insurance, but havent heard a thing. The receptionist said she would let me know as soon as she heard something, but she never did. We just received a HUGE bill! It is unbelievable how Dr. Petra Schubert Orthodontist operates their business! When Dr. Petra Schubert Orthodontist called us about our new bill, that we had no idea about, they were EXTREMELY rude! 
They could not give us ANY details on the bill because the receptionist said quote she doesnt have time to sit on the phone with me for 20 minutes.... She said she had been sending the bills to my fiancs email account, but when we asked her what email address she had been sending it to and she COULD NOT give us an answer! She then said the she didn't have time to go through her sent folder. My fianc has two email accounts and we have checked both. NOT ONE EMAIL ABOUT A BILL! 
She then tries to say that she has been sending the bills to my fiancs mothers home. Her mother informs us that she has not received ONE piece of mail from Dr. Petra Schubert Orthodontist! This is a HORRIBLE establishment and I want to let anyone who is thinking of using Dr. Petra Schubert Orthodontist to BEWARE!

back in five dayseven though I was in pain and my gum was swollen! I end up
going to a different dentist who did a great job on my tooth. And the highlight
of my story, the filling on my third mistreated tooth chipped.
The long story short, very unprofessional staff sometime wait time can be up to an hour from the time of your appointment. I felt mistreated by the doctor! South dental group operates like a factory treating
every patient as if they just a money making material. I had to suffer the teeth
pain and pay hundreds of dollars to have them treated. ",  Dental Services

On top of it, during the procedure she gave me a mercury tattoo on my bottom lip!  She turned to her assistant and asked her ""how did that get there?"" She didn't do anything to remove it. [continued below]....
									
										.....  In fact, she blamed me for ""moving too much.""  Let me remind you that I am on an intense cancer protocol and mercury is very toxic.  After my procedure, I was hoping that the pain on my last molar would subside since she told me that it was normal to feel pain for a few days.  After a week, the pain got worse.  After 2 weeks it was so unbearable that I begged her to see what was causing the pain in my last tooth.  I called her very early on a Friday so I can try to see her that day but she got mad that I ""bothered'' her at such an early hour.  I went back the second time (on a Monday) and my bite was still not fixed.  My last tooth was so unbearable that I just decided to go to another dentist to have a root canal.  I couldn't wait one more day.  I will AVOID this dentist at all cost.  Her knowledge is superb but she is a terrible dentist with terrible manners!  I would never recommend her for anything even if her service was free.  I still have the mercury tattoo on my lip.  Beware, she attends all kinds of health expo and even speaks at conventions.  Like I said she's got an impressive knowledge in holistic dentistry but her hands on are downright terrible!  You will be sorry...I was...very, very, sorry!

										In mid December I was looking for a new In-network dentist to save some money from the out of network I had been using. I contacted an employee (receptionist) at An Elegant Smile Dentistry and found a Dr Susman. I was advised that I needed to get my X-rays from my prior dentist for a ""consultation"" and new x-rays with their dentist. After the initial consultation they would set up a cleaning appointment. I asked about the cost of the consultation and was advised there ""was no charge"". They wanted to see my teeth to determine how long would be needed for the cleaning and what kind of shape they were in. After the consultation i would have a cleaning that i would be charged for. I scheduled the consultation for 1/17/13. I hung up with An Elegant Smile and contacted my old dentist to arrange for my xrays/charts to be transfered to An Elegant Smile. He adviseed that they would not need the infromation that he had. Concerned, I immediately called An Elegant Smile back and Valarie answered the phone. I explained that my dentist did not have the infromation to provide. She said no problem. I again verified that there was no charge for the appointment. She verbally confirmed that ""there is no charge"" for the appointment. I had the consultaion on 1/17/13 and new x-rays, no charge from the front office I again asked during check in if there was any charge, and was told a third time, ""there was no charge for today"". The front desk girl did not ask for payment or a credit card. I scheduled my cleaning for 2/6/13 and left. On 1/31/13 I received a bill in the mail where  An Elegant Smile charged my insurance company $133.00 for the visit and I was to pay the remaining  $26.60. I returned for my cleaning on 2/6/13 and asked to speak to the office manager. I explained my situation that I was puzzled about the charges. She AGAIN said there should be no charge, she would have her supervisor Valerie research the charge and contact me.  On 2/6/13 Valerie called me i expressed concern over the billing. She advised that I had to pay 20%, insurance had covered 80%. I told her that I was informed that numerous times by numerous employees that there was ""No Charge"" for the visit that they want to meet the patient and assess their dental needs before a cleaning and ensure that everyone is comfortable. Valerie explained that neither she nor any of her staff would tell anyone that here is no charge and that if my insurance had covered it at 100% there would in fact have been no charge. After argueing with Valerie for 20-30 minutes it was obvious that she would not budge. I advise that they had misrepresented the service and the fact that there was a charge for the service. I told her that she had definate training/customer service issues and that ALL staff should tell patients ""we do charge for the initial consultation and it is billed to your insurance, you (the patient) are responsible for whatever portion is not covered by your insurance company.""  Valerie was rude and lied about telling me during the second phone call that there was ""no charge"".  I told her that I had paid for my cleaining on 2/6 but would not be paying for the consultation from 1/17 and would file a complaint with the better business bureau. On 2/7/13 I made a taped telephone call to An Elegant Smile and posed as a new patient that needed a new dentist and cleaning but needed to know the cost because I was on a fixed budget.  I have voice recordings of the telephone conversation where again the employee again TWICE said that they do not charge for the initial visit.

										I have reported this to the BBB and they told me they cannot help, I should contact an attorney or such. This is the original complaint, I am looking for advice as to an agency I should report this to.
After going to another dentist and receiving an exam and quote on the work I wished to be done I called CPW Dental Studio to compare pricing. Monica, the secretary, then quoted me $450 for a tooth bonding, both sides of the tooth. I made an appointment. When I got to the appointment Dr Bhalala took X-rays and gave advice to have veneers done for $2000 each tooth. I told her I could not afford it at the time and wished to have my teeth bonded to fix a small gap on my bottom set of teeth. We rapped up the exam and she told me to go speak with Monica about the pricing,etc. I had planned, took off from work to get this procedure done, I was not expecting a discussion regarding price because I already knew exactly what I wanted/had been quoted a price over the phone. [continued below]....
									
										..... 
When I spoke with Monica, she told me it would cost $900 for the ""veneer"". Spoke very fast and forceful, I barely understood the jargon, I was swindled. I went back n and spoke with the dentist Dr Bhalala who as well reiterated That the work she was doing was a veneer, would last longer, and would cost 900 per each side of the tooth. I agreed to get the work done. I wrote a check for $500 and agreed to charge my card 125 every two weeks until paid in full. I was happy with the work and glad to have it finished. The problem occurred when I see my account over drafted 1100 from this dentist in one payment. 
Apparently the check bounced and I was not notified, and they decided to charge my account for the full amount instead of the arrangement I agreed to. I wasnt aware of any of this until I received my account statement around the first of February.  I called them, and Daniel told me he would refund the majority of the charge and continue my scheduled payments and we could talk when I came in to have my work finished? Red flag. I did some research and found out the work I had done was only a tooth bonding, not a veneer even though that's what my receipt says, the dentist, and Monica ""front desk"". i was lied to bold face and charged double. When I call now Monica is very rude and unhelpful. I am ashamed at the way I was treated and taken advantage of.
The office admitted that the work I had done was not a veneer, but a tooth bonding and contouring/charges I occurred for the work done was $500 even though I agreed to $1040 and thats what I agreed to and they charged me by credit card. I have proof- email from the manager Daniel saying I can settle up and the services I recieved was valued at $500 tooth bonding and contouring, his words. My receipt say Veneer #26, $900 plus $100 for the contouring. I want to know why I was over charged and lied to. Treated badly when inquiring about these fraudulent charges. I want a full refund because of the dishonesty and bad business by this dentist. I want this dental office investigated, I'm sure I'm not the only one one they ripped off. 
As an update, CPW Dental is still denying that they lied to me and is mainting that the service I recieved was a chairside veneer, Daniel is saying the email he sent me was a mistake. Keep in mind I came in because of a gap in my lower set of teeth and ""Chairside Veneers is a great option to enhance your smile. The procedure is used to brighten your teeth and to straighten misaligned teeth"" according to every dentist and website Ive researched. I am more outraged at the fact they continue to lie to my face and want to make me out the bad guy saying ""You bounced a check on us"" when they never notified me of this check I couldve cleared up quickly, then they charged my credit card $750 more than I agreed offsetting my other bills.  Even with my knowledge of the procedure to date, they say "" You recieved a chairside veneer"" I'm in outrage, I cant believe they are doing business like this in Manhattan. I do plan on reporting to the attorney general and following through on this scam of a dentist to every organization who deals with this sort of dental ripoff.",  Dental Services

										This is the most incompetent and unscrupulous dentist I have ever seen! I made an appointment with this dentist simply because he is a ""preferred"" provider under my dental insurance plan. I  made an appointment as I have some periodontal issues and the dentist I  had who was great unfortunately opted out the insurance plan I have.  
I gave them all the information they required, they ran the obligatory  x-rays and he did a quick oral exam and concluded he ""couldn't help me"" but he was sure his buddy specialist could..who doesn't happen to accept the insurance I have.

insurance company I knew the worst I would be on the hook for  this  visit  was $30, which kind of sucks because he really provided nothing  of value..but ok. Then I get a bill for $250 that must pay ""immediately"".

their incompetence to follow of filing insurance claims with the company they partnered with! Unreal!

										Arranging, or making patient care decisions, in moments of no sleep - without discussion - doesn't work.  And with Dr. Stellato he will tell you to schedule a surgery, that you have to cancel on - because he was in no condition to discuss the situation.  In the 1980s surgeons could still do this, in 2013 they can't.  
Surgeons coming in without sleep = a no-fault reschedule situation = a no-brainer, no discussion, come back another day situation, not a refund situation.  The current Hubay Professor of Surgery at University Hospitals in Cleveland has changed the policy - and Dr. Stellato is still part of UH - you see patients awake, alert, and focused - or you reschedule without blaming the patient.    
The problem - his Office Manager/secretary - Carol.  Carol does not understand medical terminology - don't think she has taken ever even a Community College course in it - but runs Dr. Stellato.  And she runs Dr. Stellato as no colleague is allowed to give any advice - she's an MD without an MD, dicatating that patients that don't show are 'standing Dr. Stellato up.'  Maybe she should call the next-of-kin, or the patient's parents or spouse, but she doesn't.  She only calls them to have the Police show up at the house - threatening that the patient is not to contact Dr. Stellato again.  This happens even when Dr. Michael Rosen refers back to Stellato, and his secretary has a laugh about it - but it isn't funny.  
Dr. Stellato needs to examine patients that he caused problems, complications, on without calling the South Euclid police.  If only to prevent those complications in the future.  University Suburban is not just for blacks, the good result patients, the no complication patients, or the nearly dead patients - it's for real patients.    
This is not a protest situation, like climate change.  All surgeons are responsible for the complications, both early and late, of any procedure - even 10 or more years later closures can rupture.  So 'late complications' mean nerve inflammations, ruptures, and chronic abdominal wall pain.  And there are now Pain Clinics, but Dr. Stellato still has to fill out a requisition for a pain clinic consultation - but when he has no sleep he doesn't think to do that.  And it is not a woman MDs 'place' to remind him of that.
University Suburban is responsible for all Dr. Stellato's complications - early and late - of any procedures - procedures that he did at University Suburban Wright Surgical Center are still the responsibility of the place & the Medical Director - who is really a surgeon and not a medical anything.  
There is no statute of limitations on the late problems of surgical procedures - you just bill again.  It's not the Mayo Clinic's problem, Dr. Shuck's problem, Dr, Gauderer's problem, or the South Euclid police's problem - Dr. Stellato's nerve inflammation problems, and whatever another surgeon has done to try to treat this, are his problem.  Dr. Stellato has to handle complications of surgical procedures that he caused.  Bariatric surgeries will have metabolic complications that can occur decades later.
Complications, and handling them, are a part of surgery, and the art of surgery - something that Dr. Stellato forgot to include in that talk.   									",  Dental Services

I was listening to the personnel in the office while I was in the waiting room tell more than one patient that having mild to moderate periodental disease can cause diabetes, heart attacks, and many more serious conditions; as if reading off of a script trying to scare patients into spending more money for expensive scaling and antibiotic treatments.  When the patients pleaded with them to just give them a regular cleaning, they refused; once again reading from the script.  The office was also covered with pamphlets for various credit options for these procedures.  
We were upset so we called to complain to the dental office when we came home.  The office staff just defended their position and basically told us to ""pound sand"" (They then read me from the same script I heard many time before)   The person I talked to even had the audacity to tell me that I was being irresponsible for not providing my wife proper treatment.   I asked that the Dentist call me back.  He  called me back in the afternoon but would not budge on his defense that she needed this treatment, even though we told him we had just seen a Dentist a couple of months ago with no issues.   He agreed to me that this could be very subjective in Private Practice.  He refused to discuss it with my wife.  He seemed nervous that I might file a legal greivance against them and was very defensive. 
So we believe the scam goes like this:  
#1: You make an appointment for an exam and cleaning where they have no intentions of giving you a cleaning on that visit.  
#2. They take a full set of xrays which they charge to the Insurance Company.  They then ask you to pay for an Oral Cancer screening which has always been part of my regular dentist exams.  We refused these.  
#4.  The Dentist comes in and pokes around on your gums and tells the Dental assistant about all the deep pockets that you have in secret Dental lingo.  
#5.  You ask when can you get your teeth cleaned, they respond that they cannot do the cleaning as it would be far too dangerous with your Periodontal disease.  They then give you the plan to come back and pay for the expensive procedures.  No cleaning if you don't pay up first!
We cancelled our Dental Insurance and will now self Insure instead.  We are also filing complaints with the Insurance Company and with the Florida Department of Commerce and BBB.   We will also get written letters from our previous Dentists for their professional opinion of my wifes gum conditions.  
We believe this Coast Dental office is running a fraudulent scam operation and should be shut down.  It's obvious that they bait people into believing they will get a regular dental  exam and cleaning but you quickly find out that they won't unless you pay for very expensive proceedures which are highly questionable.

										To make a long story short, this doctor charged me over $3,000.00 for what was supposed to be a free consultation.  He put the bill on my credit and it is ruining my credit.  Yelp him and google him, many others are dissatisfied with his service as well.  I would recommend not going in for a consultation or else you may be charged.Here is my Yelp review on him:
I went to the office for a free consultation, interested in invisalign. 
 We went over costs and payment plans.  I agreed to the payment plan.  I 
told the doctor I wanted veneers or lumineers before I got the 
invisalign.  He said NO.  I explained to the doctor I wanted my front 
tooth fixed with veneers or lumineers before I began wearing invisalign 
for 2-3 years.  The doctor said he would do it at the end.  I told the 
doctor I didn't want to wear invisalign unless I had my front tooth 
fixed.  After the doctor told me no the first time, he just kind of 
ignored my continued requests of the front tooth being fixed.  I knew 
then that I would leave that office and never come back.  Who wants a 
doctor that doesn't listen to them and wants to do what HE wants to do 
and not what the patient asks.  I finished the consultation, which 
included taking molds of my mouth and x-rays.  I couldn't wait until he 
finished so I could run out of there.  When he finished, that's exactly 
what I did, left and never went back.  My complaint is that the doctor 
has placed on my credit that I owe him over 3,000.00.  Bill collectors 
call me about this all the time.  I get countless letters, phone calls 
and it's effecting my credit.  I have received nothing from him, why is 
he charging me.  I would NEVER want a horrible doctor like that.  This 
doctor owes me big time for messing up my credit and slapping me with a 
balance for something I did not receive. Bad Bad doctor who doesn't 
listen to patients.This was his response:
Dear Toni,  
I would like to first thank you for choosing my office 
and also taking your time and placing a comment for us on Yelp. I am 
truly sorry that you were disappointed from your visit to my office. I 
do apologize if there was a confusion with regards to the treatment you 
received.   However, it appears as though you are confused about 
something.  I will not get into detail about the treatment you receieved 
on yelp, but you did receieve treatment and you did sign a contract. 
 My office tried calling you over and over for 3 months in which several 
times you hung up the phone on my secretary.  You were asking for a 
treatment which was impossible for someone in your case.  You are simply 
making false allegations.  If you need to review your clinical findings 
and treatment please call the office and it would be my plesure to do 
so. 
Thank you. 
310-208-8551
This was my response to that:
Okay so, I'm writing this update in response to Westwood Dental Care's 
response to my initial review.  Due to Westwood's review, I finally put a 
picture of myself up, so everyone can see my teeth.  I wasn't asking 
for a miracle here.  Only a very very small chipped tooth that you can 
barely see unless I point it out, and a little alignment perfection.
Firstly, 
I'd like to insult a bit lol.  You're a doctor and spelled ""receive"" 
wrong, twice AND the word ""pleasure"" , further proving to the world of 
Yelp, that you are an incompetent doctor.  How did you get through med 
school?  Or maybe you didn't and that's why you have such horrible 
service. haha
Secondly, the only reason why I choose your office 
was because you had awesome discounts.  I see you are still reeling 
customers in using those discounts.  PEOPLE BEWARE OF DISCOUNTED 
DOCTORS.  The saying you get what you pay for is pretty accurate.  Or in 
my case, with Westwood Dental Care, what you don't get, you still pay 
for.  How desperate of a dentist are you?  Charging people for nothing 
and continuing these discounted specials.  So don't thank me for coming 
in.  It was a HUGE mistake and cost me thousands of dollars.  Not to 
mention, I DIDN'T GET ANYTHING FROM YOU!  You are a complete scam.
Thirdly, 
please due explain the treatment I received I am curious myself and I'm 
sure the world of Yelp is also wondering.  I came in for invisalign, I 
choose not to go with you, and you charged my anyway.  What, you're 
charging me over 3 thousand dollars for the moldings you took of my 
mouth?  If you say this is true, I will post on here your discounted 
rate of Invisalign for 3,200.00, the amount you charged me for.  So go 
ahead, what treatment did I receive from you?
Fourthly, yes I did 
sign a contract with you for the Invisalign priced for 3,200.00.  After 
you refused to honor my request, and was such a horrible dentist, I 
left your office, never came back, and oh yeah, I NEVER RECEIVED 
INVISALIGN.
I spoke with another dentist and my request is not ""impossible"".  It may be impossible for you, but it is not impossible.
Lastly, 
nothing that I'm saying is false.  I have absolutely no need to take 
time out of my busy schedule to fabricate stories.  Furthermore, why 
would I choose you to make false allegations against.  Puh-leeze.  I'm 
taking the time to write about you because you suck and the world should 
know.  I use Yelp all the time to see how good a business is.  It is 
also my duty to share my experiences as well.
If you're a bad 
doctor, you're just a bad doctor.  I'm not the only one who has had bad 
experiences with you.  I dare you to sign up with the BBB and you will 
watch the bad reviews pour in.  Get better with your practice dude and 
treat people right.

										I have two dental insurances and they would bill one and make me pay for the rest without billing the second. They would tell you that you had a cavity and then go in the next time; the next dentist says you do not.  I only have two teeth.  They gave me a fluoride a treatment without telling me that was what they were doing and that the insurance would not pay for it.  Because of having only 2 teeth they said the fee would be $15 not $50.00.  I paid the $15 and was billed for the rest stating the insurance would not pay. I called the insurance and they said that the wrong code was put on the claim.  The insurance said they were never billed.  When I called the office.  The office manager was very rude and treated me as if I was stupid. When I stated that the insurance said she had not put in a couple of claims she said that we were talking about current charges and not past charges.  Most of the claims stated that undisclosed or no codes.  The insurance will not pay for that at all as they do not know what work was done.  If I had been told that the insurance would not pay I would not have had the cleaning done.  The insurance pays for two cleanings per year.  
My husbands partial fell out. That they had put on.
I do have a cavity and refuse to go back to have it fixed.  I will wait till I figure out how I can pull it out myself.  In the mean time I suffer every day.  
They keep sending me a bill and I refuse to pay them as I paid what they said I owed while I was in the office. It is a big rip off to bill someone the same amount for two teeth as they charge for someone with a full mouth of teeth.  They stated I needed new dentures and said they would call me when it was approved by the insurance and there was never a call.  Originally when I got my dentures the other dental office billed both insurances and they was no money due from me.  
Why does this dentist office insist on ripping me off.  I am on social security and cannot afford this. Also I am disabled and the stress is not helping at all.
There is a lot more I could write but will not at this time unless I do not get an answer.  I also turned them into the BBB and have not received any communication.

										Doctor Alberto Coto was the medical tourism dentist who butchered me. He was even promoted on an NBC news station wjhg where he guarenteed all of his work to American patients. I need to first mention that this man was located outside of San Jose when I went to him and his business name was High terch Dental Clinic. His location is now in Rohrmoser san Jose and his new business name is Implant and Cosmetics Solutions. I'm quite sure he will change his location, name and business name over and over to fool the trusting public.  I went to doctor Coto for a few dental procedures including a couple of implants and to have veneers put on all of my at the time healthy teeth. I was sent home in terrible pain on all my teeth and was told it was from the grinding of my teeth and put on a liquid diet for a month. One month later (and still in the recission period on my credit card ) I contacted Doctor Coto stating that I was still in pain and had been to several American dentists who all confirmed that my veneers were put on incorrectly and needed to be re-done. I then went back to Doctor Coto where he put crowns on all of my teeth instead. While on the 2nd trip. doctor Coto broke my tooth causing 3 root canals to be preformed while in his care. He screwed up my bite so badly that I now suffer from severe TMj and live in constant pain. He left me with over half of the crowns in my mouth open margin ( that means the crowns are popped off the teeth). I've been quoted $35,000 to fix my bite plus thousands more in additional work that I need because of Doctor Coto's incompitence. I don't have the money to pay to have my teeth fixed so the story gets even worse. I've been told by several dentists that my teeth will start falling out because of all the open margins. I suffer from a sezure disorder and dentures can slip during a sezure. Therefore, when I become toothless no dentist will risk my life with dentures. Doctor Coto refuses to pay to have my teeth fixed and he refused to refund the small fortune that I paid him to ruin my mouth in the first place. I tried the legal system in Costa Rica which was a joke. After Doctor coto refused to pay to have my teeth fixed I complained on-line everywhere I could and to anyone I thought might be able to help. Unfortunately, there is no freedom of speech in Costa Rica. According to Costa Rican law, it is a felony to speak against the reputation of a Costa Rican citizen unless or until they have first been found guilty of a crime in a Costa Rican court of law. Therefore, I committed a felony according to Costa Rica. I was lucky to flee that 3rd world country before I was arrested. I have a few u-tube video's that's gives more details about my nightmare. There are also have several comments from other Americans who were also butchered by this monster as well. One poor man was even sent home from Doctor Coto with his nerve exposed.

										When a dental office greets you with multiple people, all dressed in uniforms, wearing headsets and carrying clip-boards, you know you will be getting ""shuffled around"" and, boy, did we ever!
I had just moved here from Colorado and my parents moved to Bradenton from St. Petersburg about a few years before. My elderly parents were going to these ""dentists"" once they moved to Bradenton, and were getting outrageous claims that all sorts of dental work needed to be done. They told my dad he had gum disease, my mom needed all sorts of expensive dental repairs. They had gotten their teeth cleaned every 4 months when in St. Pete--yes, four times a year, believe it or not and their dentist would surely have told them about work needing done since he saw they so often...
I was skeptical about this new dentist office they were going to-- Creekwood Dental, and so I went there myself to get filed off a teeny tip of a tooth that was rough on the end of my front ""eye"" tooth. Before I could escape they had given me approx. 30-40 X-Rays and was telling me I needed a root canal (on a tooth that previous had one), several fillings replaced, on and on they went. I was very upset because what they filed off took maybe 2-3 seconds, yes! --seconds. My dental insurance was billed for a huge amount and I was feeling ripped off. 
The following week, I went to a dentist in St. Petersburg that my parents used to go to, who was known to be very honest and to the point. He confirmed what I suspected--none of my parents dental ""work"" needed done; I did not need any root canals. My dad did not have gum disease, on and on. I was so angry I went into their offices at Creekwood Dental and in a loud voice (in front of an office full of waiting patients,) told them how they ripped me off and demanded my money back. They gave me a ""copy"" of my dental X-rays that were xeroxed copies that were so blurry and hard to read. There ought to be a law against these people. I hope they read this and hopefully they will remember it--2009--check your records, Creekwood!									",  Dental Services

Cleveland, Ohio United States of America ",http://dental.case.edu/facultypractice/faculty, 216.368.6759,"CWRU School of Dental Medicine: Faculty Practice Hussein Assaf, Associate Professor drilling on dental x-rays from 2-3 or more years ago when the current last 2 or more years of x-rays are completely negative - drilling on bone defects that repair themselves or were fixed to begin wi Cleveland, Ohio","
										Dr. Assaf, in the Case Faculty Practice (Cleveland, Ohio), is faking cavities & trying to drill on x-rays that are 2-3 or more years old - where a tooth lesion suddenly appeared that never came back.  This 'cavity' could have been fixed, or an artifact that he knows about from the machine, as he keeps track of these lesions.  He apparently trained at Ohio State University Dental School by way of France.  But this is not good dental practice.  Or something that residents should be trained to do, or that a dental hygiene person should be keeping silent about.  
Sometimes teeth repair themselves, sometimes things are in the x-ray machine or the film is old, but you don't drill when the last x-ray is negative - or the last 2 - except at Case Dental Faculty Practice & Clinics.  These are Associate, Assistant, and a Chair Professor - Fady Faddoul.  But they are all foreign extraction for some reason - not a local among them.  Students at CWRU, Faculty, and even Clinic patients - should make other arrangements.  All Clinic Faculty are probably involved= St. Lukes' Dental Clinics.  If the dentist will use the old x-rays, you have a problem, and will potentially be harmed.
Dr. Assaf has been reported to the Case Dean's Office at CWRU Dental School, and the Ohio Dental Board for this - faking cavities.  But President Barbara Snyder is probably 'in' on it, and reporting won't fix the patients that he has unnecessarily maimed with dental drillings & holes in their teeth.  This practice should have been stopped years ago - 3 years ago at least.
No one should go to Case Faculty Dental Practice unless they want to be treated for past dental x-rays, or want an unnecessary 'drill job,' until this policy is clarified & fixed.  When Dr. Assaf drills on these 3-year old cavities that have gone away - he fakes the sound effects like a bad orgasm - cavity orgasms.  An Arab faking a cavity.  The Residents go along and say that well - the lesion showed up in 2010 (but it is now 2013, and the lesion mysteriously vanished?).    
You can have an x-ray from 3 years ago with 2 medium cavities, no cavities on the last 2 x-rays, and are told to make an appointment for 'medium' cavities that are no longer there.  The clerks, office administrator & hygienist are in on the take.
Marna - the dental hygienist - is silent for the money.  Medium cavities don't go to no cavities without some faking of something - they just don't disappear unless they were never there or the bone remineralized - and you don't touch that.  You first do no harm.  You don't treat the x-ray from 3 years ago, you treat the patient and their last x-ray.  This could be even x-ray storage, but whatever it's a HOAX.
It is probably that the other CASE Dental Clinics are doing this, as the CWRU Dental Residents appear to be 'in' on this noticing that the x-rays are so many years old, and current x-rays 'missing' from the room's viewbox.  They say nothing - but English is their second language.  It's all for the money.  
Marna Negrelli - the Dental Hygienist -will tell you that everything is 'clear,' and then suddenly Dr. Assaf wants to drill - and he's a bad driller - on the 3-year old 'cavities' that are not there anymore.  One patient had a thyroid condition being treated - where bone lesions & teeth defects were resolving with synthroid - Dr. Assaf doesn't bother to ask about anything 'medical.'  These lesions are now in trouble from the malpractice of Dr. Assaf.    
The Office Administrator at Case Faculty Practice, and other Faculty in the Practice, appear to be doing likewise.  Faking cavities, and leaving unnecessary defects in normal teeth.  If the current x-ray is clear, there is no reason for this; anything could have happened with past x-rays & machines.  The white composite that CWRU is using will cause allergic reactions, and vasculitis-like skin lesions.  But the whole drilling was unnecessary - the whole caper.

 = AVOID THEM ALL.
Hussein Assaf, with Marna Negrelli (dental hygienist), will fake a cavity, or cavities, and drill using a 3-year old faked x-ray for money - that will be on the x-ray photobox view area - not the recent x-ray - which will show nothing.  The residents won't notice that the x-ray is about 3 years old.  They are THAT STUPID.  
It's an ARGO caper, an ENDGAME, a fraud.  It's definitely not dental care to drill with the most recent x-ray showing nothing.  You will ask 'WHY ARE YOU THERE?'  The answer will be two medium cavities, or is that 3?  Small, Medium, Large - Hussein Assaf can make them any size, at any time.     
The dental drill will be a horrible unsterile outdated dental drill - and give you a concussion from vibrations.  The white dental composite, of plastic & glass, will give you hives & vasculitis.  The dental residents, all foreign, will go along with the charade, and the patient will be lucky to survive.  There will be veils, Islamic names, and nothing American - it's a terrorist cell, a gambit, a calculated move.  
It's a hoax that you will get any real dental care at CWRU School of Dental Medicine - it's all a CAPER.  You get HOAXED and HAD.  Find another place for dental 'care' - do not go to any Dental Clinic at CWRU.  Attendings helping with Clinics will be held accountable, and need to check into what is going on.    
The most recent dental x-rays will show nothing - for the last 2 years because they will not be faked.  Marna Negrelli will say nothing as told - she's a fake & a parent?  Dr. 'Hussein' Assaf, and residents, will make fun of the patient and 'cavities' - when none are on the current x-ray.  He says that he only has one - because his x-rays are not faked.  He's immature, a jerk, and a fraud.  Artifacts are everywhere on CASE DENTAL films - only he knows what is artifact - but drilling on 3-year old films?  Try to question, and you will get told to make an appointment for a drilling - but Dr. Assaf can't drill.  
The Dean of Case Dental School is apparently involved in the faking of dental care, x-rays,  and the need for dental care.  Parents of students at CWRU should be aware - do not send your kid to the Dental Clinics or Faculty Practice - even to get their teeth cleaned.  Dr. Assaf will fake the cavity like a fake orgasm - oohh, aahh, and all kinds of commentary that you didn't floss or brush enough.
Dental care is being faked for fake billings, fake care, fake drillings - and all patients need to be aware.  Drillings will be done to destroy teeth, and make money for nothing - except Dr. Assaf's bank account - which is going where?  To what country?    
Marna Negrelli, dental hygienist, will lie, and not say that there is nothing on the x-ray to drill for - her daughter is at Case, and she will try to destroy the teeth of other Case students, graduate students - anyone who goes near her for a teeth cleaining.  No one should go NEAR Marna Negrelli if you want your teeth, find another dental hygienist - find someone with a conscience, ethics, and common sense.  Marna cares only for herself, not even what her daughter will think of her.  It's a TAKE - get informed, get suspicious, and GET OUT.
There is a problem at CWRU School of Dental Medicine, which needs the Dean, and President of CWRU's attention - Barbara Snyder.  All community Dental Faculty helping with Dental Clinics need to be aware - that they are part of fraud - and will be blamed and held accountable.
There needs to be an investigation, as to what is going on at CWRU School of Dental Medicine Faculty Practice.  Why all the foreign dentists, and why all the faking, drilling, and 3-year old x-rays on the dental view boxes.  The Administrator, dental hygienists, and Faculty up to the Dean are involved.  RUN?!?!

The two of them will do anything that they can to fake cavities & dental care.  It's a disgrace.  Drilling on artifacts that came from the x-ray machine and never come back is the lates idiocy.  
Mothers beware of undergrads going there.  Faculty beware of losing your teeth to a FMG Dentist or resident who doesn't know squat: you treat the patient and not the x-ray.  ",  Dental Services

										A little over 2 years ago, I went to Affordable Dental in Springdale, AR (Dr. Sharnn Aarin Shepheard).  I paid $1,300 for removal of six teeth and got complete dentures.  I received no copy of a dental care plan or contract.  They were much more interested in getting my money than my care.
I was told it would be at least a year of healing before I could get my new permanent dentures (as I was considering implants).  That said to me that I had to wait at least a year - a/k/a no hurry.
I called the other day to find out about implants and finalize my treatment.  I was informed by the charming doctor that because I did not come back within a year's time, my contract was void, he would not complete the process and intended to KEEP MY MONEY!  I don't think so.
There was never anything in writing saying I had only a year and that after that time, no services would be provided.  He made that up.  I spoke to him/his office, he was totally unpleasant and unprofessional and told me to SUE him.
I contacted their corporate headquarters and after my and their conversations with the doctor, I am receiving at least a partial refund and all my records so I can go elsewhere.
Avoid this guy.  ""He ain't right"".  I have only seen him for about 15 minutes total in my life.  His staff did all the work.  However, every time I saw him, he was unpleasant and angry (not at me, I just got there.)  
After my dealings with him, it is very apparent that he has ANGER MANAGEMENT ISSUES.  He is a liar and not an honest person.  He lied and said that he would not do anything for me because I swore at his secretary.  I did NOT.  I might have said something to the affect that ""if you think you can keep my money, not provide the service I paid for and expect me to walk away, 'THE HELL I WILL"".  I said nothing stronger than that.  ""Hell"" is an expected response when someone tries to steal $1000 of your money and brow beat you.  He was very confident that he could get away with this.  He can't.
I may not be able to further pursue this, as I did get some relief from their corporate headquarters.  However, YOU ARE WRONG DOCTOR.  I COULD SUE YOU AND WOULD WIN.
I may not take him to court but you can bet I will put in a bad word for him anytime and anyway I can. Shame on you!  All I wanted is the service I contracted for and paid for.  You are a rotten person.									",  Dental Services

It absessed within days and has cost 3 ER visits and now needs an$850 Extracti Twin Falls, Idaho","
										MY back molar was in excrutiating pain so I went to a general dentist. After taking ex-rays it was determined it either needed a root canal or extraction. Because it was the very back molar I counted on the advice of the endodntist I was reccomened to, being . Dr. Oler Cameron. He is qquite young and I was suprised he could see me immediately, in fact he was sitting bhehind the couuonter chatting with the receptionist and there was no one in the waiting room. That should hve told me something right then and ther. Dr. Oler Cameron helped me decide to ""SAVE"" the tooth. I paid him $900 for the root canal. I have 3 other crowns, so I am familiar with the process. I was leaving on a planned vacation for one month within days. Within 2 days the tooth started to bother me, I assumed it was from the many shots and trauma to my mouth. During my vacation it got worse and worse until I went to the Emergency Room. I was given penicillan and told it had absessed. AGAIN. As I contimued traveling I was often unable to participate in my planned activities and in fact I had many people traveling to come visit me while I was there nand for 2 weeks I could barely manage to just have dinner and then back to rest. I missed out on several wine tastings, a dear friends Yacht christening, a visit to a high school friends home and other social gatherings i had been looking forward to. The penecillan didn't work. By the time I got to my final destination beautiful Lake Tahoe my mouth looked like there was a golf ball in it. I was in pain and this was the time I had with my aging and ill father. He took me back to the Emergency Room and I was given a shot of antibiotics as well as much much stronger oral antibiotics. Again all this cut into the time my father and I had together, I was very very dissappointed. I returned to Twin Falls, the stronger antibiotics worked and i went back to Dr. Oler Cameron, again he could get me right in, it appears to me he doesnt have many patients. He took another x-ray and told me the tooth had cracked and now need to be extracted, great I was still making payments to him for a tooth that needed to be pulled. I went to a dentist who said he could pul it but after looking at the x-rays he said he couldnt do it. The tooth had so many tiny fractures it needed to be pulled by an oral surgeon, and any endodntiist that reccomended a root canal on that tooth was a crook. The fractures in the tooth were obvious and there was no way it would withstand a root canal. Now I had to come up with $850 for an oral surgeon. While saving for this it absessed again and again causing me outrageous pain each time. Again limiting my activites and costing me Emergency Room visits. I have now had 2 Dentists tell me that only a greedy fool would have recommended a root canal on this fractured tooth, es!pecially because it was the very back molar that really wouldnt be missed. I got advice which has cost me  alot of money, pain and practically ruined a very imprtant vacation, travelilng to go to a celebration of the life of a friend I lost. We are at the mercyof what our dentists tell us, Dr. Oler Camereon made $900 in less than an hour and I have spent 6 months batteling with the pain and inconvenience while trying to save the othe $850 with the holidays just being over. I have no family here so I must travel to see them. I could have stayed home alone and had my tooth pulled, thanks alot Doc. It is my opinion that Dr. Oler Cameron could have cared less about me as a person. He got me in his office and with his big smile stole that 900$ from me, knowing I had to borrow the downpayment and after coming back claiming it was my own fault for not going directly to another dentist to get the permanent put in. I told him I was leaving town within days and I had a temporary, he knew my schedule. the other crowns I have had after root canals I have waited as long as 8 months to get the permanents put in, cost being an issue and I have had 2 of these crowns for close to 2 decades without incident. I truly believe Dr. Oler should refund my money , in fact he should pay for the ER vistis. It seems obvious to anyone who looks at the tooth it should have been extracted right then and there ..... OH! BUT! Dr. Oler doesn""t do extractions. Imagine that!									",  Dental Services

Boulder, Colorado United States of America ", , 800-964-4593,"Ivory White  THE REVIEWS/COMPLAINTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES! Unfortunately I did not see these ahead of time. Boulder, Colorado","
										I started to fill out an order form online for a sample of Ivory White under the assumption that it would cost $1.03, as stated. I read the terms stating it was a 7 day trial period. Now to be honest here is where I messed up, I always write on my calendar when I need to call by to cancel these sort of things, so I had it on my calendar to cancel on the 10th of January, but did not log when I actually ordered it. I learned my lesson the hard way a few years back with WEN haircare charging my account almost $300 because I failed to read the ""terms"" properly, so I do read the fine print and terms and conditions of these offers. 
As I was completing the pages of the trial offer an additional $3.87 came up, I DID NOT ACCEPT THIS PORTION, instead I closed out of the page. Knowing how these offers work due to prior STUPIDITY I still planned on calling to cancel, IF I received the product (since I wasn't sure it would be sent since I closed out the order when the additional charge came up) and depending on how it worked. The $3.87 came up as looking like an additional offer... you know how the internet can lead you from one scam to another, this is what I figured was happening at the time and the reason I closed the order out at that point. Turns out the $3.87 was S&H, and I did receive it EVEN THOUGH I NEVER COMPLETED THE ORDER! My card was charged the $1.03 on 1/3 and the $3.87 on 1/7, so I find it very sketchy that the $3.87 was charged 4 days after the $1.03, but there seems to be a number of questionable things about this company now that I have researched them, but not before I was ripped off too!  In hindsight (don't you love how it works) I should have called right away to make sure the $3.87 wasn't being charged and only $1.03, if anything at all, but I honestly thought since I closed out the page without accepting the full terms, I wouldn't receive the trial. Being that they had my cc info already I REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL!
 I received the trial on Tuesday January 8th and realized they had taken the $3.87 unauthorized; at this point I figured it would be more of a hassle to deal with returning it and disputing the charges than it was worth. I tried the product on Tuesday night when I received it and it irritated my gums, but SEEMED to work. I skipped Wed due to the irritation and the fact that my gums were still bleeding and hurting when I brushed. 
I called Thursday January 10th (the day I had on my calendar) to cancel the trial period and also ask why I was charged the additional $3.87. While speaking with the customer service representative he started going over the charges ""You were charged $1.03 for the trial and $3.87 for S&H and $94.31 for.... WHOA!!! $94.31???? I never authorized this, I tell him this as well as telling him I never authorized the $3.87, instead I closed out the page and did not check the box agreeing to being charged this amount. 
While I am talking with him the phone keeps ""going out"" or something, it sounded like he was hitting mute on his end. I would think we got disconnected, so I kept saying ""hello"" and then after a few seconds he would respond and say ""yes"". It was irritating because I couldn't tell what he heard me say and I kept repeating myself with no response from him.... IMAGINE THAT!!
While I was on the phone I pulled up my bank charges and did indeed see the $94.31. I stated that I just received the product 2 days earlier and had hardly had to to try the product out, let alone decide I wanted monthly shipments and I wanted to cancel my trial period. He said it was too late?? Did I write the wrong day down??? Doubtful!! Not that I don't make mistakes, just seeing the shady way they scam money from people I assume no matter what I did they would have charged me. 
So we all know how the story goes, they can't refund me any money!! I tell him I DO NOT want the product, I will send it right back to them, I want the charges reversed. They can't do that. I tell him fine, I will call my bank and stop the charge. He says ""That's your choice I can't keep you from doing that, I can only tell you we cannot offer you a refund under any circumstances"". 
Everything about the way this company operates is dishonest and a scam. If you have a good product you shouldn't have to STEAL peoples money to make your money! In hindsight (there is that word again), how is a 7 day trial period even long enough? I assume this is the point, one of the many marketing ploys to get you to sign up for ""such a deal"" without thinking it through to the end. 
Ivory White has numerous complaints brought against them on all sorts of sites and with the BBB. The funny thing in reading the responses from Ivory White to these complaints (through the BBB) is that every complaint gets the same generic response, they just input different dates depending on when they ""claim"" you placed your order for the trial and how long your period was. The trial period, by the way, ranges anywhere from 7-30 days, why??? That in itself is weird.
In looking into this company some additional shady findings I have noticed include:
1) Ivory White looks to be known under more names than just ""Ivory White"". The only reason a company would do this, in my opinion, is to scam. 
2) They advertise 24/7 customer service in big print, it's only after reading the ""fine print"" that you find out this does not refer to ""live"" help! Since when has a automated system been considered customer service? I guess when you care so little for people in general, that your business finds nothing wrong with stealing as it's means for making a profit, an automated ""customer service"" makes sense. 
3) When you go to their web page and scroll to the bottom and try to open up the Terms&Conditions, Privacy Policy and Return Policy, these pages do not open or open to reveal unreadable characters. Sure, this could be a legit problem (just like the phone connection I had when I called customer service) but I am going to assume this is because is conveniently works in the favor of Ivory White.
I hope that something is done to stop this company from stealing from people! Yes, we as consumers, MUST READ THE FINE PRINT, but I also feel that companies have a responsibility to make this information CLEARLY available to the consumer. If you have hundreds, if not thousands, of complaints against you that all state the same thing, as well as a request from the BBB to change your marketing tactics (which they DID NOT DO), obviously the company is to blame!

I urge anyone to report bad business practice like this-It will go a long way to keep us all protected from these rip off companies. EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN

ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder

										Warning about bad dentistry in ""Affordable Cancun Dentist"" and Newton Henderson III.  I am Mexican dentist who use to work with Dr. Newton Henderson. I stopped working with him because I could not stand his unethical practices with Americans and Canadians that seek an American dentist practising in Mexico.Newton Henderson's clinic in Cancun is like a revolving door for new unexperienced dentists.  Dentist are either fired for not meeting their revenue quota or resign because they could not stand the bad ethics at the clinic. Never forget that Newton Henderson III is a runaway dentist from America,he ran away from Arizona where he used to practice Destroying people's teeth  and decided to come to Mexico to test his luck as a terrible and unethical dentist.  This doctor runs a high pressure environment where each Mexican dentist are asked to get as much treatment as possible from each patient.  To meet the quota, often times doctors are encouraged to recommend more than what patient needs.  Simple fillings become root canals and crowns.  Crowns are rushed without regard for professional dental procedures such as proper bite or sealed crowns.They even perform big implant cases when none at the facility are properly trained to do so, including Dr. Newton Henderson III  himself.  They perform entire mouth work (they call it smile makeovers) without the proper training to do so.  Most of the time, a new dentist work on your case, regardless of how extensive your case. Thats just unethical.  Dr Newton Henderson III is a General Dentist and he performs cosmetic dentistry without proper trainning or experience. Again, he is a runaway from the United States. why would a ""extensively trained"" and ""experienced"" dentist as he claims to be comes to Mexico to practice? Exactly. He even says he had tons of patients in AZ so why would he runaway?
Patients experience problems within a year and oftentimes have to redo the work after wasting so much money under Newton Henderson DDS hands.
The way he sells his service to Americans and Canadians that come to Mexico to find affordable dental work is saying that you will save money while you get your dental work done by an American dentist. But the reality is so different.I feel terrible for many American and Canadians lured by Dr. Newton Henderson III and his marketing machine with false advertising of high quality dentistry.  Many Americans including some local government agencies have warned about NEWTON HENDERSON III and His ""Affordable Cancun Dentist"" website.  He has  plenty of bad review online.  ""Affordable Cancun Dentist"" is the new trap used by this unethical, runaway American doctor.  Dr. Henderson III can change the name of his practice, but he cant change his last name.  For every 1 good testimonial he gets, 2 or 3 others have experienced bad dental care.  CHeck for yourself his unethical background.I cant tell you enough how many teeth have been ruined by Dr. Newton Henderson III and his dentists.  He gives Cancun dentistry a bad reputation.  Many dentist in Mexico think he is a bad example and destroys reputation of other small hardworking dentists.I dont even speak English very well, so I had a friend translate this letter.  I just feel compelled to say something before more people experience bad dental care from this dentist.									",  Dental Services

										I wish to inform you of a transaction that recently took 
place on the Internet.  On December 25,
2012, I came upon an advertisement for a tooth whitener.  The ad offered the opportunity of receiving free trial of HydraWhite for a total price of $1.03.  I took advantage of the offer, using my 
bankcard/credit card number in order to pay for the offering.  In very small print and in another 
part of the offering (not immediately visible, and then only barely) was the 
proviso that if I were to keep the trial offering for more than eight (8) days, 
HydraWhite would assume that I wished to join a club that would send me a
monthly supply at $78.43 per month. In other words, they would charge me for something that I had not ordered.  
As of todays date, I have not received anything 
from HydraWhite, other than the initial sample.  Nothing.  Nor
do I want anything from them.  
I simply want a reversal of these fraudulent charges.
I checked my bank account on line on January 4, 2013 and saw 
that $78.43 had been deducted from my account on January 3rd.  When I called the number (888-528-0305) 
provided on my bank statement I was told that I had ordered the monthly supply 
at the $78.43/mo. price by default. 
The person with whom I spoke told me that another larger package was 
being sent to me and that if I would return it they would give me a credit of 
$60.  When I asked why I would be refunded 
an amount so much smaller I heard a great amount of verbiage and confusing 
information.  Since this persons words 
and speech were so incomprehensible, I called back a second time.  I then spoke with a woman who informed me 
that the cost of the samples was $78.43, and I would only receive a
refund if I returned the sample. 
I immediately terminated the conversation. 
The situation has not changed.  The charge is still on my account.  I have not received the tooth whitener and I informed HydraWhite 
on the telephone on 1/3/13 that I have no interest in it.  I am attaching a copy of a site on the

So even though it takes on average 3 days to get it in the mail, you may think you have 7 days to use it but you don't!!  They charge your bank account on that 7th day the full amount too and they don't give refunds. Not unless you return everything to them and then they only give you a partial refund.  If you're like me and happen to throw away the product that you used b/c it didn't work for you and therefore didn't save the other product either. Well now, you have nothing to send them back and they won't give you a refund at all. YOU HAD BETTER CALL THEM THE DAY YOU RECEIVE YOUR PRODUCT IN THE MAIL TO EXTEND YOUR TRIAL PERIOD! That's the only way you will be able to actually use it for roughly a week to see if it works for you or not and still have time to call them up to cancel before they charge your credit card. Make sure no matter what though, you keep everything that is sent to you, so that you can mail it all back to them in order to receive some sort of refund or they will charge you the full amount even though you cancel the account.

										My foster child needed braces and Western Dental was the only provider in the area that accepted Medi-Cal. I went to them over 2 years ago and was told that they would file a claim but first they needed to take out her baby teeth, make an impression of her gums, take x-rays, etc..  We did everything, however, the claim was denied due to an error by the office in the order in which they performed these procedures. Over the course of 2 years they submitted the documents for approval 5 times and each time the forms were rejected due to errors.  Further, I had to bring her in on several different occasions, once because they lost her impressions. Once because they lost her X-rays. I did complain once and was told that the employee in charge of claims had been fired and not to worry, the new person in charge would make sure she got approved. So I went down and met with him and he assured me the same. Well, on December of 2012 I received a letter from Medi-Cal again that she was denied again because the forms were filled out incorrectly. It's now January and this poor girl hardly ever smiles because she's embarrassed about her teeth. In my opinion Western Dental is guilty of malpractice. They are her primary care physician and obviously they could care less that her teeth become worse over time, or about her self esteem issues. I have now decided to pay for the braces on my own even though I can't afford it because she's 13 and deserves to be able to smile.									",  Dental Services

I have to say I am terrified of Dentists. But Dr. Harrison is the worst of all Dentists. They get you with their $39 dollar special and then try to up sell everything they can. But they picked the wrong guy to do this to.
I paid over $2,000 for a front tooth that looks very bad and they will not fix it. I called. No answering machine how convenient. My attorney sent letters wanting refund and no way are they going in to my mouth. 
I'm so embarrassed of my smile...Dr. Harrison tried to tell me I need veneers on all my teeth. WTF!!! My teeth are not bad in fact that was the only bad tooth. And it was bad because of a car accident and I had an anterior fracture and my jaw was wired shut for three and a half weeks and my front tooth dad to be replaced by a Dentist in Florida.
Whom attached a temporary and told me it was a crown. Only to move to Denver a few years later and that's how I found Cherry Creek Modern dentistry.   hey know of my experience they did not care they knew I was fooled once and I could be fooled again. 
You know they pick and choose their victims...you can't mess everyone teeth up you would not stay in business.  So the ones who had a good experience this is why.  The ones that are victims of Mrs. Harrison know you know why!!!
I'm going to file a rip off report and this is what my attorney told me to do as well:
 ""The only legal option is to file suit in small claims court. However, you can pursue non-legal resources such as lodge a complaint with dental board/association, BBB, give them bad reviews, etc.""

										Warning about bad dentistry in Cancun Cosmetic Dentistry and Dr. Arzate in Cancun.  I am Mexican dentist who use to work with Dr. German Arate. I stopped working with them because I could not stand their unethical practices with Americans and Canadians.Cancun Cosmetic Dentistry is like a revolving door for new inexperienced dentists.  Dentist are either fired for not meeting their revenue quota or resign because they could not stand the bad ethics at the clinic. Dr. Arzate runs a high pressure environment where each Mexican dentist are asked to get as much treatment as possible from each patient.  To meet the quota, oftentimes doctors are encouraged to recommend more than what patient needs.  Simple fillings become root canals and crowns.  Crowns are rushed without regard for professional dental procedures such as proper bite or sealed crowns.They even perform big implant cases when none at the facility are properly trained to do so, including Dr. Arzate himself.  They perform entire mouth work (they call it smile makeovers) without the proper training to do so.  Most of the time, a new dentist work on your case, regardless of how extensive your case. Thats just unethical.  Patients experience problems within a year and oftentimes have to redo the work after wasting so much money with Cancun Cosmetic Dentistry.I feel terrible for many American and Canadians lured by Dr. Arzate and his marketing machine with false advertising of high quality dentistry.  Many Canadians including some local government agencies have warned about Dr. Arzate and Cancun Cosmetic Dentistry.  They have plenty of bad review online.  Cancun Cosmetic Dentistry used to be Dental Maya. Dr. Arzate changed the name from Dental Maya to Cancun Cosmetic Dentistry because the name Dental Maya had so many bad reviews online.  Dr. Arzate can change the name of his practice, but he cant change his last name.  For every 1 good testimonial he gets, 2 or 3 others have experienced bad dental care. I cant tell you enough how many teeth have been ruined by Dr. Arzate and his dentists.  He gives Cancun dentistry a bad reputation.  Many dentist in Mexico think he is a bad example and destroys reputation of other small hardworking dentists.I dont even speak English very well, so I had a friend translate this letter.  I just feel compelled to say something before more people experience bad dental care from this dentist.

My wife and I had some odd experiences with Lynnwood Dental Center (4202 198th St SW, Suite 3, Lynnwood, WA 98036).
My wife and I enrolled at Lynnwood Dental Center as it on my employers insurance plan.  During an examination, Dr. Asja Adams asked me to come in for cleaning every three months rather than twice annually.  This was surprising as I had no cavities or major dental problems, but I came in three months later as requested.  I then learned my insurance did not 
cover this accelerated cleaning schedule.  I paid the bill immediately but asked to have a note put in my file that I would come in only twice annually.
At a subsequent appointment last August, Dr. Adams asked me if I planned to resume the quarterly cleaning schedule.  I earnestly advised her I could not do so, as the extra cost was prohibitive.  She just nodded as if this was acceptable, and the examination continued pleasantly, with no cavities or need for other procedures determined. [continued below]....
									
										.....
A few days later, I received a letter from Lynnwood Dental that my wife and I had been removed from their patient list.  At no time had I been told that my continued use of their clinic depended on utilization of their intensified cleaning schedule.
My wife, Kay, had unsettling experiences with them as well.  When she called to make our initial appointments, the receptionist would not allow her to even tentatively set a date without proof of insurance, which the clinic did not have yet.  When they finally got the proof a few days later, the day requested was no longer available.  
Kay had an unprofessional experience with hygienist Lynn Shatz at her first appointment.  As my wife sat back in the examination chair for the first time, Shatz looked at Kay, told her that she had excessive facial hair and gave her a
business card for her friend who does electrolysis.  She had a stack of these cards, so apparently she does this to other patients. Surely a medical professional should not be remarking on irrelevant, sensitive issues with a new patient, nor making unsolicited pitches for outside aesthetic services.
Further, my wife and I are still receiving reminder postcards from Lynnwood Dental to make new appointments.  This clinic should have removed us from their reminder list when they removed us from their patient list.									",  Dental Services

Cheap, cheesy, and overkill.  
All of this communication which is nothing more than an effort to get me in there and give them some money is annoying.  I never gave her office permission to do any of that.  I had to call and complain twice to get them to stop.  One of her assistants continued to call me anyway in order to reschedule an appointment.
Second, I decided to get a second opinion from another dentist after my last visit to Dr. Sundberg's office.  Dr. Sundberg told me that I needed 3 cavities filled and possibly a fourth.  She was so happy when she found them.  This was the appointment I needed to reschedule due to financial reasons, which weren't acceptable to the receptionist. I was surprised when the second opinion came back (after xrays) that I only had a single cavity with a spot that needed more brushing and needed to be revisited in the next six months.  Saving me a few hundred dollars, I went with the second opinion.
Having recommended Dr. Sundberg's services to my wife, we went over an estimate given of $1500 in dental work by Dr. Sundberg.  She also went to get a second opinion at another dentist which had basically the same end result - the appearance of blatant over-diagnosing.
Third, the receptionist is typically very rude to me over the phone.  I needed to reschedule an appointment and was immediately given the option of paying a $50 fee for this because I hadn't given them a 48 hour notice.  My appointment was on a Tuesday at 3pm.  I called Monday at 3pm to cancel/reschedule.  I have doubts they were open on Sunday to give me the opportunity to call.  I got a bill and almost immediately for $50. 
After ignoring the bill for a month, they actually sent me to collections for $65.  Nice.  I'm not sure it's legal to send someone to collections for services never performed.  When I called to inquire, the receptionist argued with me and then just hung up on me.  When I called back, she just picked up the phone and continued to hang up.  Real classy and professional.

Third, the receptionist is typically very rude to me over the phone.  I needed to reschedule an appointment and was immediately given the option of paying a $50 fee for this because I hadn't given them a 48 hour notice.  My appointment was on a Tuesday at 3pm.  I called Monday at 3pm to cancel/reschedule.  I have doubts they were open on Sunday to give me the opportunity to call.  I got a bill and almost immediately for $50. 
After ignoring the bill for a month, they actually sent me to collections for $65.  Nice.  I'm not sure it's legal to send someone to collections for services never performed.  When I called to inquire, the receptionist argued with me and then just hung up on me.  When I called back, she just picked up the phone and continued to hang up.  Real classy and professional.
I won't go here again and I regret having recommended services here to others. Super, super BOO.									",  Dental Services

""Call your insurance company before you get here; Office Manager Tina M quotes ""I don't have time to call insurance companies to get information (i.e. copays, cost of services, patient care schedules, etc.) - says Office Manager Tina M. Then the Office Manager Tina M. shows her prefessionlism and level of education by placing the blame on the insurance company in a disrepectful, misguided and unproductive way in front of a lobby full of patients.

Dr. Hattar and the Office Manager Tina M. feel that they are doing patients a favor by providing their services; ""It is a privilege to be a patient here"" - Office Manager Tina M. states 3.) Dr. Hattar quoted "" I don't know the numbers that is Office Manager Tina's responsiblility. That is the primary reason why businesses fail poor leadership and lack of knowledge pertaining to the daily functions of the business. 4.) Refused to provide service to patients based on the patient's specific need even after conversation. Recommending costlier services beyond patient's immediate need. I understand the economy is bad; however it is a doctors fiduciary responsiblity to do what is right for patients, execute honest business practices and grow a successful business. I DO NOT recommend anyone to establish a relationship with this dental office or return to this office if you are an existing patient.

										I have had the Cybersonic Toothbrush for about 8 years. This is not the newer model 3, just the basic one. I have had no problems with the company at all. The product works great. I get my replacement heads on schedule every three months. Anytime I either moved or changed my shipping payments to another card or whatever, I have just called and had the change made easily.
I also have had to replace the main toothbrush body once, due to its getting too loud but that was after a few years of use.  I only paid about 12 bucks for shipping, and the service was great.It would be nice to be able to find the replacement heads locally, but since they send them to me on a regular basis, I really don't need to shop for them. And paying less than 5 bucks shipping to receive two heads is a lot cheaper than the replacement heads I see for other electric brushes. 
Others may have had problems with the company or product, but I am not one of them. I recommend this company and product to anyone who wants a great electric toothbrush.									",  Dental Services

If you have to go to this dentist (there are many other alternatives) be very careful to get a full fee quote in writing, ensure they include followup visits in the same fee.  I have seen more than one individual (while in the waiting room) disputing the fees charged.   Bottom line, these dentists are dishonest business operators.

										 This website started out as a site where people could post their evaluation of a dentist. Over the years it has morphed from a site that posted  honest reviews to one which  manipulates the information to favor the doctors that advertise with them.
Years ago I paid the fee the website charges so that I could read the reviews. This fee is posted as a once in a lifetime payment. They have since removed my ability to read them even though I paid to do so. I wrote to them and told them that they should allow me to read reviews since they took my money. They have not. This is really not the big issue however. Over the years I had over 30 reviews posted on the site and I followed them. A couple years ago however, I went to the website and all of my reviews had been removed. Across my name on the webpage there was a header which read  Expired. I wrote to Doctoroogle about this and they responded back that I would have to pay them to advertise for me. In my opinion it is unethical to pay a site which post reviews where the review stats are manipulated. Presently they have 3 reviews posted for me and one of them is a bad review . The problem is there is now one bad review out of  three. Well one negative review too two good ones basically harms me as it is a dishonest representation of the reviews patients have posted to my name on their site. This along with the facts (FAQ) that they post on their site give the impression that I am not in the same league as the others on the site who advertise. If they can do this to me , I am sure they are doing it to a lot of other clinicians. No company or person should be allowed to run such a dishonest website.									",  Dental Services

										When I made this appointment, I was only going in for a dental cleaning/checkup.  I was not experiencing any problems that would have required special treatments or fees.  I had been quoted $54.00 via phone prior to this visit. After the cleaning, they told me that they were charging me $82 and that I had to come back to their office in TWO HOURS to be seen by the dentist.  In previous visits to dentists,  I have always seen the dentist immediately following the cleaning, so that my mouth would be clean for the exam.  They did not inform me that I would be paying an extra $42.00 to see the dentist.  My bill ended up being $124.00!  If I had known that I would be charged $124.00 for this visit, I never would have scheduled the appointment.  Perhaps that is why they didn't tell me the real fees?  They finally agreed to refund $10.00 for the copay fee since I am not on an insurance plan, but a discount dental plan called DentalPlans.com.  The office manager ""Toby"" at Spring Dental told me that when they called DentalPlans.com that Careington allows the dentist to charge for his exam.  I had called DentalPlans and was told that the dentists fee is included in the other charges.  I am confused as to why Spring Dental
would have me sign an agreement for a treatment plan dated 4/19, the day the services had already been performed, then charge me for different services than noted on the treatment plan they had already completed.  I also found that the verbiage at the bottom of the treatment plan was very offensive and indicated desperation of their having problems getting paid for their services.  They threatened to sue me or have an collection agency come after me if I didn't pay.  Perhaps people can't pay because of the dishonest way they do business,  by not quoting the true prices of their services and the patient can't afford to pay their exhorbitant prices?  In my case they changed the price twice from $54 to $82, then after theysent me home for two hours and returned to see the dentist, the total was suddenly $124, which is quite an increase when they knew that I am currently unemployed. When I filled out the initial paperwork, they wanted me to fill out a form called a ""wish list.""  All sorts of cosmetic dentistry, which I wasn't at all interested in.  I went in thinking my bill was going to be only $54.00, and went home with a bill for $124.00, and the bill wasn't broken out by $54.00, $82.00, and an additional $42.00 to see the dentist.  This dentist obviously just wants to sell you big ticket services you don't really need so we can pay for his 52 inch digital computer technology.It's just no wonder that his patients can't afford to pay his bill at the end of services.  What he performs doesn't match what is on the bill and not anywhere near what they quote over the phone.  It's a bait and switch plan.Neither DentalPlans.com nor Spring Dental have been able to explain why they cleaned my teeth and sent me home for two hours prior to being examined by the dentist.  I would think that this is unethical.  It is definitely not common practice.

HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.

Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder

										I have been a Patient at Family Dental Solutions for about a year and a half now. I have had several issues 
with this place. There is a story behind why I am posting a bad review
For the last year, I had a tooth that needed a root canal.  I had this condition for some time, and haven't had the money to get it done. After putting it off as long as I could, the tooth cracked.
After having some issues with my insurance, I went in and told them money was tight, and that my dental insurance had dropped or changed, but I just got it back, and I told them to check it,,,,,, and make sure everything  was good.  I wanted them to give me a quote of how much it would cost,, and what my insurance wouldn't cover..
SO , after they called, they gave me a written quote (WHICH I STILL HAVE)  saying that my charges after insurance would be around 700 for the root canal and around 560 for the crown,plus the resin-based composite, two surfaces, posterior, and interior, 85, 65..
well, I ask him how much for just the root canal.  They said it would be around 600, and the rest would be due upon return for the crown.  
They knew I was having a problem with money, and understood that my insurance had some issues, but after they gave me the quote, and went over the charges, I was under the impression that it would be 600 for root canal and about the same after I came back for the crown in month or so...
SO, after the procedure and me paying 630 dollars,   they called me about a week after the procedure, and said I owed them around 500 bucks. I was confused, because they said that the other wouldn't be due until the crown was sized. 
They said that I didn't have the same insurance, and the charges were going to be more..  My insurance didn't cover the procedure.. How convenient for them to tell me after the procedure is over and done.... That was the point of me asking them to check and see what my insurance wouldn't cover, and give me a quote.
Well, I thought that was the POINT of them calling and verifying that, and giving me a written quote, with my insurance deductions from that....(WHICH I STILL HAVE). 
SO right before this phone call telling me my insurance didn't cover the procedure,, my fiance lost her job, and I told them that,,,, I didn't have the money, but felt like I was done wrong, baited and switched,,,  and she said that I could make payments,, but I didn't have the money for payments and still feel like I am being done wrong, so she said she would call me back in a few weeks,
Instead of getting a second phone call, They Sent this to collections and on my  Credit Report.  The time frame that this transpired from the first phone call and collections was about  3 weeks.  The last conversation Anna told me that they would call back, and maybe I could pay 30 dollars a month, I told them, I didn't know if I could do that, but still felt like I was done wrong, well  I didn't receive a second phone call, only one bill in the mail, and they sent this to a collection agency and its on my credit report. 
That's what you get for being honest and upfront with someone. Thanks for the Call back, and Yes, I think I could make payments IF I felt like I was done right and justly,, instead of feeling like they lied and said my insurance would cover something, and then charge me after the fact and send it to collections in less than a month..... 
It falls on the patient to know what their insurance pays..yes, but when I ask them to call and verify that,  I am still at fault, stuck with a false sense of them giving me a quote based on a guess, and it's my fault, 
I am not happy with the Lack of communication, professionalism,  and results of the problem at hand.  I would not recommend this place to anyone,, if this is the way they treat a patient that has been there almost 2 years...  How would they treat a new patient???									",  Dental Services

Well, instead of going in for a cleaning, they tried to sell me $5K worth of work.  Scared the crap out of me telling me I had gum disease, receding gum lines, a TON of cavities, etc. etc. etc.  Oh and they refused to clean my teeth until I started on their regimen.  
I went to another dentist to get one tooth taken care of, and without seeing the x-rays from Dentalworks, he couldn't say what they were seeing (I couldn't afford a second set) but through visualization, he didn't see all the issues they were discussing.  He said he could not say they were wrong, but he really didn't see it.
Now I finally have Delta Dental again so I went to a real dentist.  He told me I DO NOT have any cavities, and as for the other things, BS!  He also said I take very good care of my teeththe opposite of what Dentalworks told me!

However, given our most recent experience it's clearly just all about the $$$$ for Dr. Gary Kijanka. Dr. Kijanka's staff evidently now is also willing to deceive to try to avoid reimbursing for overcharges.

My son filed a grievance with Humana, which ruled on 10/22 that Kijanka overcharged by $200.00.  Humana stated they had spoken with a member of his staff and adjustments would be made. I sent a letter to Dr. Kijanka, when his office didn't call or write. I placed a merchant dispute, sent follow-up letters. Finally one of Dr. Kijanka's staff called to say they had received the check back due to a problem with our mailing address. They had the correct address. This was now on 11/7.

										I recently signed up for a free trial of Ivorywhite for $2.87 (they actually charged me $3.87+$103). After I received the teeth whitening kit my account was charged $78.41 without my consent. EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!

										Dear sir or mam:I have written to the HEAU. about this fraud case by Dental One Associate Annapolis. But since, my case is the insurance company  both extra and false  charge ( fraud to my belief according to the Maryland law ); a  malpractice and defective  denture which was  made for me. Also, from the first step it was involved in a stealing  patient by Dental one; because by  a previous dentist  advice to make my denture a Prosthodontist ,my wife asked them an appointment for the prosthodontist whose name was in Met Life insurance company Network, but Dental One Associates in Annapolis never said this dentist who has been there has left  there 3 years ago and gave appointment to another doctor without our permission. Whereas never Dental One tried to cancel his name from Met Life Network. I have document for my entire claim. As a result of this scandal, Dental One offered me 500 dollars cash and waives that fraud charge to make me  quiet. That is why I am trying to follow this case thru another organization like yours.  I want these crooks be investigated in a court which even partly insurance company has cooperated them and is responsible for it. They issued  an  illegal order which was mailed to me( the insurance company has judged in an addendum  of a legal contract not initialed by me_  between me and Dental One_ to be paid by me ) however, even  they had told before that  service was not done by Dental One  .Thank you very much

										The insurer sells the HI215 dental plan, at first glance, the Summary of services document indicates what an insured (you), will pay. Cavities are a common problem, that most insured will need treated, the ""plan"" states that silver filling (a/k/a Amalgam), prices range from $30 -  $45. So for example, if you have three (3) cavities, treatment cost should be in the $175 area, including office vistit cost and sedative (at $45 per cavity). HumanaOne should know, that almost no dentists, recommend using silver fillings and will refuse to provide that service. The evidence of this can be determined by speaking to an office manager, whom will disclose that ""no silver filling claims"", are submitted by their office.Instead, you are pushed to purchase the ""Resin based composite fillings"", price ranged from $90 - $110.So, again for example, the same three teeth mentioned above for the same treatment will cost you $370, including the office vist and sedative (at $110 per cavity). Almost a $200 price increase. The purpose of the silver fillings advertisment located in the Summary of Services, is to lure you into purchasing the policy.",  Dental Services

Davis made ill fitting dentures that broke within a few months,have caused extreme pain, unable to wear due to poor fit and Davis has refused to do anything to correct the problem. He has been offensive and Las Vegas, Nevada","
										Dr. Davis was working at Affordable Dental, Lake Mead, Las Vegas, NV. I went there for dentures. I am 73 and disabled from COPD. The doctor had to make three different molds of my mouth on three different occasions because he kept getting it wrong. I asked for ""No Metal"" and the first set of teeth came in with metal. The other two just didn't fit. When I said ""these do not fit, they hurt and they look bad, they are crowded and crooked."" He responded, ""at your age it doesn't matter how they look!"" I don't look my age. I look 20 or so years younger and it is important that when a dentist makes dentures that he may them to fit and look right and to take responsibility if he gets it all wrong which this doctor? did. My doctor wrote a note letting this dentist know I could not eat properly because of these teeth and with COPD (or even without it) proper nutrition is important. The note was disregarded by Affordable Dentures as well as Dr.Davis or shortly thereafter left Affordable.k In ]checking I have found he has worked for quite a few places. One wonders about that. 
Affordable Dental refused to do anything about the problem. What the manager did was write up a cost estimate to make a new set of dentures. Why would I pay for the doctors unskilled work and abuse? Why would anyone pay to be used and abused by a company that is unethical and should be put out of business. They have lied to me about who owns Affordable and about their business in general. They refused to give me any of the papers they coerced me to sign while I was having my'mouth worked on. To this day I have not received a single one of those papers or ""estimates."" I would caution the public to be aware of this company and this dentist and to not use either.",  Dental Services

										Paces Dentistry is the worst and most unprofessional company that I have ever worked with in my entire life. My fianc decided to purchase a Groupon for Invisalign from Paces Dentistry. Paces Dentistry agreed to make a pay by month thing seeing as we could not just pay the $3000 up front. Of course, they always make us aware that they were nice enough to work with us. We bought the Groupon and went in for the first visit. She went in May and had her pictures taken and they told her they were going to send the pictures off and in 6 weeks the aligners would be there and she could start the process. She went back 6 weeks later (after taking time off of work) expecting to pick the aligners up and it turns out they had forgotten to send the pictures off They tried to lie about it and say that invisalign was backed up but then they finally admitted they hadnt gotten the pictures out. They said they would submit the pictures to invisalign over the internet immediately and it should only take about 2 weeks to get in. My fianc called two weeks later and the lady at the front desk, once again, had an attitude and said it takes several weeks for the aligners to come in. So instead of it being 2 weeks, she had to wait about another 5 weeks to get the starting set of aligners. We were told that insurance would cover $1,000 and we would be left with a balance of $2000. My fianc and I talked it over and we decided that we would make it work because it was important to my fianc to straighten her teeth for our upcoming wedding. They are extremely unprofessional when it comes to responding to correspondence. My fianc has sent them SEVERAL emails without a receiving a response back (or it would be weeks later). She has left the office voicemails and they only seem to get back to her when or if its convenient for them. Paces Dentistry does NOT care about their customers! They rope you in with deals and then they feel like they can screw you over. Their customer service is abysmal. The front office receptionist is rude and does not know how to do her job. Paces Dentistry is luring customers in with the Groupon and then cheating them out of money! When my fianc went in for her first visit she was FORCED to undergo a deep cleaning that was never discussed prior to us agreeing to the deal. Then we get a bill for the cleaning even though we stated that the cleaning was not necessary because she had her teeth cleaned recently. Paces Dentistry insisted on the cleaning, but NEVER told us that the cleanings would not be covered by our insurance. They conveniently left that information out! In fact, they made it seem like insurance was going to cover the cleanings. We have been waiting to hear from Paces Dentistry in regards to insurance, but havent heard a thing. The receptionist said she would let me know as soon as she heard something, but she never did. We just received a HUGE bill! It is unbelievable how Paces Dentistry operates their business! When Paces Dentistry called us about our new bill, that we had no idea about, they were EXTREMELY rude! They could not give us ANY details on the bill because the receptionist said quote she doesnt have time to sit on the phone with me for 20 minutes.... She said she had been sending the bills to my fiancs email account, but when we asked her what email address she had been sending it to and she COULD NOT give us an answer! She then said the she didn't have time to go through her sent folder. My fianc has two email accounts and we have checked both. NOT ONE EMAIL ABOUT A BILL! She then tries to say that she has been sending the bills to my fiancs mothers home. Her mother informs us that she has not received ONE piece of mail from Paces Dentistry! This is a HORRIBLE establishment and I want to let anyone who is thinking of using Paces Dentistry to BEWARE! They do NOT care about you, they only care about milking you for every nickel they can. It is unethical, immoral and down right WRONG! I wish now that I had read some of the reviews before we got involved with them.Please, take your hard earned money to a dentist that cares about you and wants the best for you.

										I went to Dr. Edwards because he was the dentist nearest my location that was on my dental insurance. He is a very friendly and likeable person as are all the dental assistance. The office has a problem with overbooking appointment  far worse than any doctor I have ever been to. They were always behind by the second or third hour of the day.I had to have my remaining teeth pulled and upper and lower full plate dentures would now replace my partial. My medications for pain control destroyed my teeth by means of dry mouth syndrome, and the teeth which growing up never had a cavity or any other problem were now a disgrace. After removing the last 15 (about) teeth I was fitted with immediate dentures.The permanent plates would be molded and fit after the swelling went. I was in and out of the dentist's office over the next several months. Every time I told the dental assistant who inturn informed Dr. Edwards that the dentures did not fit properly. They would not stay put and adhesives did not help. I was basically ignored, when dentist was satisfied - whether I was or not  - he sent me on my way.I had also paid for everything up front based on what was expected from the insurance. After the new year the office manager tried to collect additional because the insurance had changed a little as to what they paid. Fortunately, Dr. Edwards said they were bound by the original estimate even though more than 30 days had passed because the services being done were to be done over a 9 to 12 month period.I was also over charged for teeth that did not even exist or the lesser treatment was done and charged for the higher surgical treatment. It took over four months to get that straightened out, I finally had to call accounting in San Antonio myself the office manager said they were not responding to her e-mails.This is a place to be avoided if you can.

But y opinion is this is bait and switch and false advertising. How can you say the average fee will be $631 when all of the plan dentists charge much more? You do it to sell discount dental plans for $159 or more to as many suckers as you can. Its just too bad for them that they end up having to pay a lot more than your fantasy average fees.

Then they find out that no one charges that and they have to pay more, much more, 40% more. This is a total scam and I will make it my job to make sure this is well known.

One of my daughters fillings was in a brand new tooth, which came in with a cavity that could not be filled with amalgam because they would have to drill into the nerve. Most Dental insurance companies cover resin on visible teeth. We explained to customer service that we had no choice but to have this tooth filled with resin.

no signs of a cavity and that we go to the dentist every 6 months and never received any warning of preventive care but now she has a cavity and preventative care with two teeth.  She has only had one cavity in her life and that was when she was pregnant 10 years prior which I am told is common when you are pregnant.  We ordered the cavity to be fixed.  Mr. Jacobs
decided to do one of the preventive care teeths instead of the cavity.  Thinking that it was an honest mistake we
rescheduled for September specifically asking for same cavity and nothing else because funds are tight.  Mr. Jacobs this

										Meet Raymond Krietchman, DDS. with offices in Brooklyn, NY and Staten Island, NY.I have been a patient of Ray Krietchman's since approximately 1999. This past summer (June 2012), I needed to have a tooth extracted. I had the option of either a bridge or an implant.Dr. Krietchman recommended a bridge as it is significantly cheaper as well as cosmetically better. Needless to say, Krietchman does not do implants. At this point, he has not given me a definitive cost. I was not concerned as I felt I knew him. Upon completion of the first phase, shaving the other two teeth and creating a temporary bridge, he said the price is $3800.00. His math: $1200 per cap (x3) plus $200.00 for the extraction. I told him I thought that the price was exorbitant. I had my girlfriend call him for a price. He told her it is $900 per cap. In fact, she called two other dentists in the area and they were both $900 per cap.After two more visits (because the manufacturer of the crown said the tooth was not shaved properly), he finished putting in the bridge. I confronted him with what my girlfriend had surveyed. He said ""do you know what they get in Manhattan?"" I reminded him that he is not Manhattan nor Beverly Hills. He is on 13th Ave. in Brooklyn and Staten Island. He no doubt mentioned that because I live in Manhattan. But it is irrelevant. And a cover up line for someone who is obviously looking to overcharge you .I also reminded him that I am a member of Plan Plus which entitles me to a 15% discount. He rolled his eyes and ignored it. For the record, he is also a member of American Dental Care which also claims to give members a discount.He then instructed the person at the desk to deduct $400.00 from the bill. That was still $935.00 more than he should have charged. ($900 x 3 plus $200.00) less the 15%. A month prior to this, Krietchman charged me $658.00 for 2 cavities and a cleaning. While I thought it was high, I did not say anything. However, I am now aware of his schemes. That should not have cost more than $350.00-400.00. If you go this dentist, be very careful with what he charges.Any questions regarding this, please feel free to email me at (((REDACTED))) @yahoo.com.Thank you.

										    I had an appointment at a Coastal dental in Cape Coral, Florida. I have a 1 tooth flipper in which I needed replaced. The technician that was there to due an impression started out not answering any questions that I had about different types of flippers. So I went ahead and let her proceed.     First of all she could not get the impression clay to harden because she mixed it improperly. Then she proceeded to get the clay on her rubber gloves and got in in my hair in which I had to cut it out later. After all was said and done she finally thought she had everything she needed to make my new flipper. they completed the process at the end of the day and it would not fit correctly. The impression was done wrong.         I work away from the city during the week so my time is limited. They tried to grind it and I stopped them because she was ready to break it. So I said I would come back at a later date. The impression cost me $465.00. $100.00 dollars higher than they quoted me. Also they did not run it through my insurance and my insurance would of paid $200.00 of the cost. A few weeks later I was told they would fix the problem and I said as long as there was a different technician. I go to the office for my appointment and a nice lady took me back to the room and guess who walks in but the same technician. So I left and I am still fighting them over to bill my insurance so I can at least have this done by another dentist.      I am out $465.00 and will have to pay another $100.00 plus $200.00 from my insurance company to get this resolved.

										This dentist recently opened a second dental office in the Cool Springs area. His dental license was revoked in New Jersey because of his healthcare fraud and income tax evasion convictions, both are felonies. He defrauded his patients, insurance companies including Tricare, and he defrauded the IRS. If you Google Ralph Sharow fraud all of this information and more are available to you. He admitted in court to re-writing patients' medical records and making false notes in patients' charts in order to hide the fact that he routinely billed patients for services he never performed. He admitted to this in court. 
The investigation of Dr. Ralph Sharow started because of a patient who contacted Tricare to complain that Dr. Sharow billed him for a three tooth bridge that the patient objected to but was billed for it anyway. Dr. Sharow was convicted of healthcare fraud and income tax evasion, he had to pay a fine of over 1 million dollars to the IRS, and over $246,000 to several insurance companies including Tricare. He had to pay back the patient mentioned above for the money he spent at that visit, he had to forgive the balance of what he said the patient owed him for that three tooth bridge, and for the cost to repair what he had done to him. Dr. Sharow was sent to federal prison for 2 years and received 3 years supervised probation. 
New Jersey revoked his license. He tried but failed to get his New Jersey license back. He tried to get a license in the states of Vermont, Maryland, Maine, and Kansas but they all denied him a license due to his crimes and convictions in New Jersey. Somehow, I can't imagine how this happened, but somehow he was able to convince the Tennessee Dental Board and the Nashville Health Department to give him a license even though five other states denied him a license. I was of course oblivious to all of this when I went to Dr. Sharow. 
On my first visit, March 5th 2008, I was taken aback by how much money I had to spend but he explained to me that it was a lot because it had been awhile since I had seen a dentist and therefore I needed more work done than I had thought. I had no dental insurance at this time so I put this on two credit cards. They gave me the credit card receipts which only had the amounts on them but nothing that stated which procedures were performed. 
On October 29th 2010 he did a root canal, drilled away part of this tooth, he said that happened because of the decay underneath the old filling, and he mixed something up in this room and applied that to my tooth. His assistant said this was a ""different kind of crown"". By this time I had dental insurance and so I paid my part and didn't think to check my EOB to see what he billed to my insurance. I found out later, when I retained a lawyer to force him to turn over my medical records and x-rays, that he did not bill my insurance for a root canal or crown on October 29th 2010. 
He knew that he had already billed me for a root canal and crown for that very same tooth 2 years before on March 5th 2008. What he did bill my insurance for on October 29th 2010 was for a cleaning and x-rays. Four months later this ""different kind of crown"" broke in two above the gum line. Now that this tooth broke in two he and his assistant clamped something onto the tooth and pushed, not pulled, pushed this tooth out sideways until it finally broke out of my jaw along with a piece of my jawbone. Yes, I actually lost a piece of jawbone due to his kind of tooth extraction. 
He then destroyed the expensive crown in front of this now open space and he destroyed the natural tooth behind this now open space in order to make room for a three tooth bridge. Does a three tooth bridge sound familiar? He billed me $3,600 for a three tooth bridge. I refuse to accept his three tooth bridge. He refused to turn over my medical records and x-rays. I retained a lawyer to get my medical records and x-rays. When I finally received my medical records and x-rays, that is when I found out that he had billed me on my very first visit, March 5th 2008, three years earlier for a root canal and crown on this very same tooth. 
I never did receive any of the x-rays of this tooth even though I requested those from the Health Department and I paid for those x-rays. He also billed me for work that he did on another tooth which in turn became a hole in that tooth one year later and I had my new dentist to fix that. Dr. Sharow defrauded me out of $2,000 dollars on my very first visit, he billed me for services that he never performed, he re-wrote/forged the chart notes in my medical records in order to hide what he really did. 
He caused permanent damage to my jaw, he caused me to lose three teeth, he caused me to lose a piece of my jawbone, he caused me to spend another $5,000 dollars to get a dental implant, grafts, and three crowns in order to repair what he had done to me. He has had a collection agency and lawyer calling and threatening me at work. He has put the charge for the three tooth bridge on my credit reports. I had PERFECT credit before I met Dr. Sharow.

										On the 1st of Oct. my wife ordered a product from this company to whiten her teeth and the website stated it was a 14 day trial period. After cancelling the order on the 14th day we noticed that on the 10th day this company had charged us for the full order which we never received. I then contacted them on Saturday 20 Oct. and spoke to a representative who told me that my wife signed up for an 8 day trial period, I then proceeded to ask him if he was calling myself or my wife a liar because when ordered she read to me exactly what she was seeing and it said 14 day trial period; he also informed me that the trial period starts from the date you place the order. I then asked him how can that be when you don't even have the item to try, he could not answer that question and proceeded to tell me that he would not be able to issue a refund; I then requested to speak to a supervisor who got on the phone and sounded just like the representative I just spoke to, at that point my 12+ years of doing customer service for a call center kicked in and I started asking the supervisor how they can run a company that starts a trial period prior to getting the product and he stated to me that is their policy and that he would not be issuing a refund. When I requested to speak to his supervisor he then explained to me that he was the only supervisor on duty and that if I called back on Monday to speak to his boss the notes would show that I spoke to him and the call would just be routed back to him. I then began to explain my experience with call centers and asked him if he realized just how rude and unprofessional he was being by making a statement like this at which he responded, ""I'm only being as rude as you"" or words to that effect, at which time I told him he was an idiot and said I'd be speaking to him again on Monday and hung up.

										Found this business online, everything seemed legit. Fast, easy and inexpensive (compared to going to the dentist).
I gave them my credit card number, (after they had called numerous times following up on my inquiry).
Finally i decided to go with this company. They sent out all the wrong items and the package was incomplete, missing items. The promised to re-mail them immediately.
Had to remind them to re-mail the items in question on numerous intervals, clara promised and promised, yet, the results were always the same, no replacement kit. It arrives after an endless array of calls to them and begging-pleading to send it.
The second package was their ""NEW"" kit...again it was a mis-match of parts and pieces of various kits, I was able make it work, did the molds and sent them back ASAP. Again, we had a deadline, my daughters wedding in three months, well, that didn't happen, I didn't receive the veneers.
The day of arrival, I excitedly ran to ""snap"" them, oops, it didn't snap, they didn't fit, the molars were not even on my gum line. They were not snapping like their videos would make you believe. They sort of grabbed the teeth enough to keep them in place. But, you cannot eat with them or even talk with them in. 
here we are almost a year later, I sent them back to get ""re-fitted"" (what ever that means) months ago. I have yet to receive them, once they have your credit card, they will never return calls or update you on their status, thank you Clara, hope you sleep well tonight knowing how many people's dreams you smash.
Clara and her crew of misfits should get into a line of work better suited to their abilities, perhaps vacuuming out porta-potties would be more geared to their level of expertise and customer service skills.",  Dental Services

										Thank you Ripoff Report, for providing this forum to all of us.
I used RevaHealth to find a dentist in Tijuana, Mexico.  We chose Dr. Sergio Penunuri based on the positive reviews.  My wife had a mouthful of crowns, bridges, and implants.  It worked out horribly, as virtually nothing fit right.  Severe headaches, food impaction from poor fit, and half of the crowns fell out within a few months.  We stressed that we would take the time to do a proper job.  Didn't want any one day procedures if medically unsound.  He went ahead and installed an implant crooked because the bone had not sufficiently healed.  If he talked to us, we would have opted to wait for an additional trip, instead.  He did honor his warranty, but what do you suppose a warranty is worth if the practitioner (or more likely in this case, dental lab) is an imbecile?
Time to fix it.  Someone suggested trying Los Algodones, Mexico (near Yuma, AZ), instead, as it's far more likely that we will return with our heads still attached to the rest of our bodies.  I came across Whatclinic.com as a source of Los Algodones dentist reviews.  Here is what I found out after doing a lot of research.
Revahealth.com was junked by Caelen King of Global Medical Treatment.  If you navigate to www.revahealth.com, you end up at Whatclinic.com.  Inspection of the whois records at networksolutions.com confirm that the same organization owns these two websites.
At Whatclinic.com, go to ""Add Your Clinic"" in the upper right corner.  It opens a page where doctors can sign up.  Near the big yellow ""Sign Up"" button, select ""Terms and Conditions"".  There, you will clearly find that Whatclinic.com is frequently paid by the doctors for listings under a number of schemes, though it does indicate there is some form of free account.
Now, the scam.  Select any doctor, and attempt to make a review on that doctor.  Try ""Review This Clinic"" towards the bottom of the page.  On the subsequent page where you can fill in the review, there's a button all the way on the bottom of the review named ""Review Policy"".  Click that.
The Whatclinic.com review policy clearly states that they are not a review site.  All patient reviews are submitted to the clinic, and the review is only published if the clinic approves the review.  It also stipulates that aggregate consumer ratings only include those ratings that meet their guidelines.   Patients are forbidden from making a defamatory review, and no reports of criminal activity are permitted.  
The review policy states that if the clinic refuses to allow a patient review to be published, then that will be disclosed on the clinic's review page.  OK, there are complaints at the Ripoff Report that Whatclinic.com refused to publish their negative review of Doctor Alberto Coto Calvo of San Juan, Costa Rica.  Well, his review page is here:  http://www.whatclinic.com/dentists/costa-rica/san-jose/implant-cosmetic-solutions and you're a better person than I if you can spot where Whatclinic.com made the disclosure they promised in their policy.
My opinion time.  There are a lot of marketing websites scattered all across the web that are no more than hype for services.  They are paid by subscribers (doctors in this case) to make the advertisements appear like objective consumer ratings.  Throwing out the reviews you don't like is far from objective.  In my opinion, I consider words like lies, fraud, misrepresentation, scam, illegitimate, and don't use if you care about your health to be far more accurate.  Don't use Whatclinic.com as a source for choosing a dentist.  									",  Dental Services

										Oct. 2011 I Went to Western Dental with promises I'd be happy with the work and service. I had 8 teeth pulled and an upper denture made. My INS.paid $800. And to date I paid $700. They never finished the denture. I had problems from day 1. It hurt so bad that they made a soft liner. Well it worked for a day. They then refused to help me until 3-4 months passed. I was shocked! I said how do I eat? I can't go to work with no teeth! I had a contract to make monthly payments. I stopped paying as I won't pay for a device that's defective and they refuse to try to correct. Right?
The total that would have been paid had they finished was $$1900. They got $1600. The denture isn't finished and now they turned me into collections for $1800. Everything they had promised me was a lie. Once my teeth were pulled the rules changed. Terrible dentists. Office help is awful. I've filed with BBB, and People Claim.

HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN

ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder

										My name is Kimberly. I am one of several American patients who were severely butchered and maimed by Doctor Alberto Coto Calvo. I've put my own nightmare with Doctor Coto on a few u-tube video's. Since then, I have been contacted by other former American patients of his who have also been butchered by him as well. One such patient commented on one of my video's that Doctor Coto screwed up their mouth horribly and even left their nerve exposed. Feel free to look up my video's on my u-tube channel - kimberly4064 and watch any of my video's of my nightmare with this horrible, incompetent and unscrupulos man.In short, I went to this man for a few dental procedures and a complete cosmetic make-over.  This horrible man broke one of my teeth causing 3 root canals to be preformed while in his care. He screwed up my bite so badly that I now suffer from severe TMJ and live in horrible pain daily. In addition, half the crowns in my mouth are open margin ( the crowns are popped off my teeth ) I'm also in need of more root canals because of his negligence. There is much more damage that he caused and is detailed on brief story on all of my u-tube video's. I have proof and medical evidence of everything that I am stating with several detailed medical reports confirming severe criminal negligence against Doctor Coto Calvo . Anyone who would like a copy of any of these medical reports is welcome to them if you contact me on u-tube.The cost to fix my bite alone is $35,000 ( which I don't have ) plus thousands more for additional work that I need because of this monster. Doctor Coto offers a 100% guarentee on all of his work but, that is a LIE !!! I am stuck this way and he will not pay to have my teeth fixed. I was threatened with inprisonment for complaining publically about being butchered by this man. It is a felony to speak against the reputation of a Costa Rican citizen unless or until they have first been guilty of a crime in a Costa Rican court of law. ( no freedom of speech in Costa Rica ). I was lucky to flee that country before I was thrown in prison for complaining - I kid you not !!!Before going to this man for any dentistry, let me inform you of the consequenses that can occur from an improper bite. They include, but are not limited to fracture of the teeth, fracture of the porcelain, loosen of the teeth in the bone, bone loss around the teeth, infection, jaw pain, pain in the facial muscles, neck pain, shoulder pain, inability to eat or speak properly, pain in the teeth, etc.I now suffer from all of these symptoms and would not wish this on anyone.In addition, I've been told that all of my teeth will start falling out because of all the open margins in my mouth. When I become toothless,  no dentist will give me dentures because I have a seizure disorder and dentures tend to slip during a seizure. Therefore, no dentist will risk my life with dentures. I have spoken to many, many other victims of botched medical tourism dentistry since this has happened to me. Doctor Alberto Coto Calvo is not alone in this. There are many medical tourism dentists and doctors who are just as unscrupulos. Many of them also behave with unethical business practices as well. Some of these doctors and dentist might have some certificate on their wall claiming that they took a class in America. This means nothing Americans ! There is no real way to check these dentists and doctors out. Their training is not even close to the training and education of someone who passed medical school in your own country. The lack of ethics & regulations for physicans in these third world countries is horrible. Doctor Coto gave me an American refrence to speak to before I went to him who claimed that he was wonerful. As soon as I arrived in Costa Rica Doctor Coto offered me a commission for bringing him American patients. The other former patient of his who were also butchered by him were also offered money to bring him American customers to him as well. Therefore, you can not trust the motive of any of his references. From all the research that I've done since I was butchered abroad, central and south america is the absolute worst place to go to for medical tourism. Mexico and Costa Rica are on the top of the list for the most unscrupulos doctors and dentists abroad. Doctor Coto's business name was High tech Dental clinic when he butchered me. He has since changed his location to San Jose and his new business name is ""Implant and Cosmetics Solutions"" God only knows when he'll change his business name again.I know that if your considering getting dentistry abroad it's because you need a lot of work done and are short on funds. Your local dental schools are up to 70% of the price of your own dentist at home. I've had 2 root canals preformed at my local dental school for $325 each instead of $1,100 each. They even do cosmetic dentistry. If it's an emergency such as a root canal they will usually get you right in. If it's not an emergency you'll be on a waiting list for a few months. You just send them your medical report from your local dentist which will determine if it's an emergency. Once you become a patient and get in, you will never to be on a waiting list again. The instructors watch over everything that the students do and make very sure that everything is done properly. All the work takes a little longer but, atleast you don't have to worry about being butchered by some medical tourism dentist and ripped off. This is not a joke people ! The American constitution does not travel with you outside of the country !Again my u-tube channel is kimberly4064 all of my video's are on my medical tourism nightmare",  Dental Services

I was going to be charged $76 extra for this, yet the dentist would not explain to me on the phone why this was necessary, when I was NOT previously told subsequent cleanings would need to be ""special"", and when the condition of my teeth with all my other cleanings from my previous dentists were excellent and my teeth needed no special attention.
The staff did not return my call as they said they would, and when I requested to speak to Dr. Luban to ask a question, they scoffed and said ""he doesn't talk to patients"". Long story short, after asking to speak with him twice, I told Celia, ""Let Dr. Luban know that if I can't ask him a question on the phone about my care I will need to find another dentist."" She didn't skip a beat and immediately said ""That's fine with him"". Arrogant! Needless to say, I've found another dentist and can't recommend someone who A).

Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder

										Dr. Tracy Van Blargen installed a crown improperly.  He left a 1/16 gap between the crown and the base of the tooth.  It leaked bacteria due to the space.  I asked Dr. Tracy Van Blargen at one point if that was normal.  He responded, It wasnt a problem about a year later, he gave me a bottle of Herbal Antiseptic and Applicator spray so I could spray Herbal Antiseptic into the gap to get rid of the odors emanating (bacteria).  Eventually, I thought I was going to die.  I became so sick from all of the bacteria in my system; I was unable to sleep at night.  My immune system was on over-load trying to get rid of the bacteria.   Finally, I got new dentist, who installed a new crown correctly.   After the new crown was installed, it took about a month for my body to get rid of all the bacteria.  Finally I was able to get some sleep.  At one point, my friends and family were very scared; they didnt think I was going to make it.

										Completely shocked by a $1000 cost to redo an existing filling. I was not given an estimate when I told them to do the filling because I was in pain. At check out I was asked to pay for my visit, for which I could not pay.  I just bought a home, and they ran my credit 3 times for a dental credit plan for which I was denied. I was SO EMBARRASSED! I never paid for a filling that cost over $300 and they did not accept insurance billing. THe office manager is Dr. Willock's wife and was super rude to both me and my husband. We paid the bill in 3-4 months, but she wrote nasty notes on our bills each month. I should have been writing nasty notes to her and her office for the RIDICULOUS prices they charged. I recently got an in-office (CEREC machine) crown at another dentist that cost me $1100, so I know that Dr. WILLOCK is overcharging for my small filling.  I couldn't believe they were mad at me for not knowing that the bill would be $1000 that day. Who has an extra grand in their pocket to spend? I think they don't bill insurance companies because the prices are WAY Above customary and standard prices. I have had 11 of my 12 mercury filling redone since then and not one has cost me over $300 with ""Specialty mercury removal"".  They charged extra for the CEREC filling, and safe mercury removal.  There are dentist in Durham and Charlotte who specialize in Safe Mercury Removal, and you can get 3 done for the price of one at Dr Willock's Dental Office.

										I had gone to western dental twice this year. Once in El centro ca and about a month ago i went to the Poway ca location. The ONLY reason i even went back to western dental was because i had an open account with them.

One payment per location. I was not told that before i spent 1000 in poway. Now i have 250 dollars a month going to the same company.

										.....Remember, no company or individual can ever satisfy 100% of the people 100% of the time. There are no products or services that will always be perfect for everyone and even the best companies will receive complaints from time to time. However, by participating in the Corporate Advocacy Program, the member business has made a commitment to working with its customers to resolve complaints quickly and fairly whenever possible.Please keep in mind that as a consumer you have some responsibilities as well. Success has many definitions that based on your past experiences, current situation and your perceived expectations. Success with any product or service is always based on the proper application and understanding. The fastest car will not run if you never turn the engine on.

Ripoff Report REVIEW / Dr. Sherri Worth/Center for Reconstructive Dentistry Dr. Sherri Worth joins Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program -- a long name for a program that does a lot for both consumers and business alike.Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program -- a program that benefits the consumer, which helps to increase consumer satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business Verified By Ripoff Report.When a company or individual joins the Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Program, they must make a commitment to us in writing to 'doing whatever it takes to make things right with their customers.' What does that mean? It means that Rip-off Report expects that members of our CAP program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected, the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. It means that if a customer requests a refund and if there is any reasonable basis for that request, we expect the customer will be given a prompt refund (some refund requests may not be reasonable, so this does not mean a refund is guaranteed in every case). Making things right can mean lots of different things to different people, but our point is thisby working closely with the company or individual to resolve any disputes, Rip-off Report can track the footprints of customer service to ensure that our CAP members are doing everything they can to treat customers fairly and to increase their customer satisfaction.ALL COMPANIES GET COMPLAINTS, BUT HOW THE COMPANY HANDLES THOSE COMPLAINTS, SEPARATES GOOD BUSINESSES FROM BAD BUSINESSES.By Ed Magedson - Founder, Ripoff Report Dr. Sherri Worth approached Ripoff Report with the intent of wanting to resolve any customer issues and reports posted on Ripoff Report.As a Part of the Corporate Advocacy Program the member business allows Ripoff Report to send an email to all of those who filed a complaint in the past, letting the customer know, the member business wanted to make things right with them, .. whatever it takes to do so. Ripoff Report always monitors these emails to insure the member business does what they agreed to. The people at Dr. Worth did just that.

										In April of 2006 I was referred by another dentist to Dr. Larry W. Dunford, DDS to replace my upper bridge.  Since I was referred by another dentist I assumed he was competent.  I trusted his ability based on this and assumed he would proceed with the best course of action and in my best interests.  Although Dr. Dunford reports that I had the bridge replaced due to decay that is not accurate.  I had a problem with a tooth under the bridge and decided it was time to replace it.The work was long and painful.  After approx. 2-1/2 years my $20,000 dental bridge fell out.  When the bridge came out a few of the teeth holding it in broke off and came out with it.  I am now living with teeth broken off into my gums and have to keep glueing the bridge back in as I am not in a financial position to go to another dentist and at this point I don't trust anyone.On my last visit, Dr. Dunford had what I can only classify as a very blase attitude towards my dilema and suggested that I come back and have a radiograph ""in order to properly diagnose what remaining tooth structure there is to work with"".  I declined any further work from him as I obviously no longer trusted in him or his ability and wasn't going to give him any more money; I did'nt have it anyway.My life has been tremendously altered by this.  I am constantly depressed due to the discomfort and the fact that I have to hold the bridge in when I eat.  I am having stomach problems as I cannot fully chew my food and I fear the medical problems that can also arise.  I not only feel that Dr. Dunford is incompetent but he is insensitive.  He states in the report of my last visit ""Pt was a bit argumentative in the beginning"".  He stated that I was informed of concerns with recurrent decay.  If he felt this why did he suggest doing a bridge which in the end cost me approx. $20,000.  He also said ""Pt then got very quiet, started to cry and did not say very much afterwards"".  Considering I paid dearly for this work any normal person would be upset. In Dr. Dunford's reports he states about possible further tooth decay.  What I don't understand is that he is the supposed expert.  If he felt this course of action was sketchy at best then why didn't he offer an alternative plan.  He did not.  If he felt that the quality of my teeth could not sustain the bridge and that it would eventually come out then he should have offered an alternative or explained to me that the bridge was not the best way to go.  He did not.I don't know what I can do from here.  I have suffered since July of 2011.  We no longer go out to dinner because I cannot chew without holding in my bridge.  I am afraid to talk because at any given time my bridge falls out.  I worry about all the things that can happen from having teeth broken off into your gums.The best I can do right now is to suggest that no one use this dentist.  I would not want anyone else to go through such a horrific experience.  									",  Dental Services

Internet  *EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back into your bank account that someone wrongfully takes it from you!","
										My son tried the ""free"" trial for Ivory white and about 10 days later, he noticed an unauthorized debit from his account of 78.41. This company scams people out of money and its ridiculous that they disguise it as ""free"" and continue to get away with it.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN

ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder

So i told them to clean just the bottom teeth, so they charged me 1000, plus $69 for xray.I was having a swolen gum and pain. The clening didn't fixed that. So a week later i was worse, so i went back to them and then they reffered me to a periodontist. So i went to the periodontist and he deep cleaned my upper teeth. For my surprise he only charged me $600, dollars. Then i later found out that this was a ripped off at the clinic i went first. They are so expensive . Now, my complain is today i got a bill from them where i still need to pay then another 150 dollars, when i was told the total would be 1069.00 Now the bill says the total was over 1200. Where can i complain? I was NOT suppouse to get a bill. They never told me i would receive a bill. They charge an arm and a leg, and they still want more money.
Do not go to this dentist. They are thieves. They bill your insurance and take your money. They diagnose you for things you don't have. I would like to save you from the unpleasant experience I had.
I do not like this place, they have been rude since Day 1. The turnover rate for dentists is ridiculous. There is no formal way to file a complaint either, and letters of dissatisfaction go unanswered. I brought my kids and myself for years only because my insurance gives a hard time switching to another provider, and we only came for cleanings anyway, plus sealants for my kids. But we have got to find another dentist, I will just have to deal with the hassle of changing providers because the only thing I trust the ""professionals"" at Forest Parkway Dental to do is clean my teeth. I will NOT let them do fillings or crowns for me ever again! And they do the most expensive stuff, I still need fillings and they'd rather focus on cosmetic instead of preventive (the expensive $$$$)! They are all about money and little about patient care, the staff is rude, and they make you pay out of pocket! Then have the nerve to suggest to you Capital One Credit if you don't have the full balance at the time of service.

										I want to make sure that anyone reading this knows that this dentist did this to me at another facility and not the one on Valleydale. Dr. Gonzalez has caused me MANY problems! When I went to this facility many years ago I was placed under Dr. Gonzalez' care. I explained to him from the very beginning how my dental insurance was not good and how I basically had to pay out of my own pocket for everything just about. When he had xrays ran of my teeth he came back into the room and told me that I needed all these root canals on different teeth. It was a lot of teeth that he stated I needed work on! I sat in the chair crying not knowing what to do. He had no emotion. I allowed him for weeks to go ahead and do many root canals. I trusted him and knew he had knowledge of what he was seeing. At least that's what I thought! It wasn't until I met up with my sister one day that we started talking about all the work I've had done. I told her that I had strong teeth just like my dad. Her teeth were even stronger than mine. She mentioned she had to have many root canals completed as well. I was shocked. I asked her who completed the root canals on her? She said it was Dr. Gonzalez. I was shocked! I knew right then that something wasn't right. I asked around for a trusted dentist. I finally found one. I had this new dentist to run a lot of xrays. I knew that Dr. Gonzalez had said that I still had all these root canals that still needed work done on them. After running the xrays the dentist came back into the room and showed me the xrays while explaining that on the teeth Dr. Gonzalez stated I needed all these root canals done on, none of them actually needed a root canal! There was only one of those teeth that he said needed this work done that only had a tiny cavity! Yes, I was VERY UPSET! I immediately called my sister and told her to NOT go back to Dr. Gonzalez! I had very bad dental insurance at that time and could not get the remaining amount of work completed on the teeth he had already messed up on. Upon trusting Dr. Gonzalez in the beginning I also allowed him to extract a few teeth in the very back of my mouth that he stated had no way of being saved. I had to pay A LOT of money because my out of pocket expenses were so costly. Not to mention my dental insurance was not going to cover hardly any of it. I had to borrow money and work my tail off to get this money and than I find out that all the root canals were NOT EVEN NEEDED! It wasn't until I got new dental insurance in the past few weeks that I started going back to the dentist I trusted. I had this dentist to run a lot of xrays again to tell me what needed to be done. I was told that I needed a root canal on one of my teeth and yes this root canal was actually needed! When I went to the specialist that did these root canals I spoke of the issues I had in the past with Dr. Gonzalez. I mentioned that my new dentist had told me that the teeth Dr. Gonzalez extracted in the past..still had teeth fragments left and they would need to come out because of the infection that was being set up from them still being at the gumline. Not to mention the infection getting too close to my bone and how much trouble I would have if these were not taken care of. This dentist ran the xrays on the tooth needing the root canal and when the film came back it also showed right next to that tooth the one Dr. Gonzalez did the extraction on. When the dentist came back in my room to show me the film he also mentioned that the tooth that was ""extracted"" by Dr. Gonzalez was not actually extracted! Yes from the looks of the film (that I also have a copy of myself) it shows where Dr. Gonzalez basically just broke that tooth off and didn't even get the root out or do any of the necessary work needed like a normal dentist knows to do. So now I have to pay AGAIN to have a real extraction completed and I have to go through the pain all over AGAIN! Than I find out that the other two teeth Dr. Gonzalez completed the so called ""extractions"" on were also needing to have a real extraction done on them, resulting in paying once again and going through the pain..you got it..again! I will tell anyone and everyone reading this post right now to STAY CLEAR of Dr. Gonzalez! If you want to keep your teeth healthy and in your mouth by all means go to a TRUSTED dentist! This dentist apparently doesn't care for the well being of his patients. It's all greed. I don't ever like posting remarks about anyone but this has cost me a lot of pain, money, time and grief in my and my families lives. I will not stop at just merely writing a complaint on this dentist. This dentist should not have a license and not be allowed to practice dentistry.

										I have had several reports for this location that I'm surprised have not been reported to the Attoney General of Texas. Perhaps there is an on going investigation for price gouging and manipulation of its customers in order to gain more profit. I wouldn't know, however; if there isn't one, there should be.
On the first occasion in which I noticed price gouging was through a close friend of mine. She went attempting to get some partial implants. She had dental insurance, and after an examination was charged five hundred dollars just for the visit, and told her that it would cost an additional five thousand for the implant (At which point she was refereed to a specialist). Going with her gut, she felt that something about the estimate just wasn't right...and knew for a fact that she was being over charged for the visit and decided to get a second option. She did get a second option, and was shocked to discover that she was being over charged three thousand dollars for the implaints as well as an additional three to four hundred dollars more than was necessary for an examination. [continued below]....
									
										.....On the second occasion in which I became aware of price gouging, and quite possibly self-referral fraud. My husband went to this same dental office in order to get a tooth pulled. He went in and got xrays done. He set up an appointment for ""one week later"" in order to get the feedback from the xrays from the dentist to see what could be done about the tooth. When he returned, they had him redo xrays that did not need to be done. They already had them. Before he even got the chance to see the dentist he was told that he would have to go see a specialist in order to have the tooth removed. A estimate that would cost six hundred and fifty two dollars. At the end of his visit, he was charged one hundred and thirty dollars for two sets of xrays, a prescription for the pain, and a referral. A referral that would have taken him to the same exact specialist that my friend would have gone to. Acording to the desk clerk, his appointment was placed into the computer as an emergancy appointment.

I made an appointment as I had a Tooth partially broken and in pain.They informed me I needed a Root canal and was missing a cap on a previous root canal told me my share of the procedure would be 525.00 due day of appointment. 
Day of appointment they asked for 1,050.00 said both teeth needed a root canal. 325.00 for non surgical access on both and 200.00 for each tooth for a needed irrigant.So I paid them they drilled and filled both with a temp filling and scheduled me another appointment to crown the teeth which my benefit book clearly states no cost to me. They wanted another 1.050.00 to complete the work ,despite my telling them my plan says no charge to me.
Before I could make the next appointment I received a Denial from Deltacare for the D3331 procedure code that smilecare billed them for with a code of M47 which states it is not a separate and billable service and neither the plan or the enrollee is responsible for any such unbundled component.
So I get a hold of Delta and tell them what I have paid. They instructed me to file a complaint online and I would get a resolution within 30 days. I did it said smilecare owed me 725.00 and I would receive a check no later than 30 business days.And that I was to pay nothing for the crowns as they are covered in my plan.
I did not receive the refund within the time allowed  so I called Delta's quality management dept, They told me they were going to call the corp office and I would have the refund within 20 days. During this time one of the temp fllings fell out so I made another appointment to have them complete the work. Again they asked me for 1.050.00 I explained showed them the letters and booklet they still insisted on charging me. So I left.
They are now billing me 33.00 for that appointment and I still haven't received my refund. the teeth still have no crowns and I just don't know what to do, it has been like this since Feb 28 2012 and still no refund. I question who is the crook? smilecare or delta or both ?",  Dental Services

appointments and went to see him.  His staff as well as Dr. Zimmer preceded to tell us that we all needed extensive
dental work done.
We started having the procedures done by his office and the first thing we found very odd is that my Credit Care account was immediately debited for the entire cost of my work before any work has actually performed.  When claims were paid by our dental insurance company they were not posted to the individual patients' account as they were posted to any account that the bookkeeper felt like.  
We only received 1 statement and we had to ask for that.  We were never shown the actual
insurance payment for each individual account.  At my last appointment with the dentist, I inquired what the cost of my
portion would be.  I was told that I would probably have a credit.  This came from the bookkeepers mouth.  I did not
hear anything until sometime in July when the bookkeeper called me and said I owed money on my account.  I said how you billed the entire amount of my dental work to my CreditCare account before any work was even started on my mouth.  I said I have never received a statement.  The response from the bookkeeper was I know I never sent one.  I said that I want to speak to  Dr. Zimmer regarding my bill.  She took the message but he never contacted us.  Instead I received a statement in the mail stating that I owe money and that I am 90 days past due.  What kind of billing system is this? She bill whatever she wanted to.
Dr. Zimmer has no regard for patient confidentially.  During one of my appointments the dentist went off on me regarding a situation that was strictly between him and my husband.  The dentist upset me tremendously. The problem was  the temporary crown came off several times when waiting for the permanent crown. He blamed my husband for the crown coming off several times. It was not his fault. This was not the way to handle any issues with other patients. 
Upon my husband calling him on the issue he apologized profusely and told my husband that he would refund the monies spent on his dental work.  He didn't. The dental work for my husband is frankly not up to our satisfaction and we are not pleased. His teeth still hurt. He also pulled an anchor tooth for my husband's partial and never address fixing the partial to fit his mouth without that tooth.   
This just goes to the overall feeling that I received every time he said something to his staff they just rolled their eyes .
We have had a horrible experience with Dr. Zimmer and do not trust anything he or his staff tells us. He kept taking money from us and never indicated where it was going. This dentist is a predator and should be stopped.
We have called several times and he does not respond. Please help us.									",  Dental Services

										My name is Kimberly. I am an American who lives in the south Florida area. I went to Doctor Alberto Coto Calvo just outside of San Jose Costa Rica for some dental work and to have veneers put on all of my at the time healthy teeth.  After doctor Coto finished placing the veneers, all of my teeth were in a lot of pain. Doctor Coto stated that the pain was from the grinding of my teeth and I was placed on a liquid diet for a month.One month later ( still under the rescission period on my debit card ) I called doctor Coto and told him that all of my teeth were still in a lot of pain. I also told Doctor Coto that I had been to 3 American dentists who all confirmed that the veneers were put on incorrectly and needed to be re-done. Doctor Coto told me to fly back to Costa Rica and he would re-do my dentistry. After I flew back to Costa Rica, Doctor Coto looked at the x-ray's from the American dentists and apologized. [continued below]....
									
										..... He also stated that he would do a better job this time. Doctor Coto put zerconia crowns on my teeth this time because zerconia crowns are made by a computer. Doctor Coto claimed that he could not possibly make another mistake because the computer would make them perfectly.I need to mention that Doctor Coto used some type of plastic strips across rows of approximately 6 teeth at a time to be used as temporaries. These strips were cemented on much too tightly. Instead of cutting off the strips, Doctor Coto struggled for several minutes with bruit force until I screamed at which point he broke one of my teeth. At that point, Doctor Coto called in a man by the name of Marco Aguilar to do a partial root canal on me. Afterward, Doctor Coto told me that Doctor Aguilar would finish the root canal the next day. I was then sent back to my bed & breakfast. Approximately 20 minutes later the Novocaine in my mouth began to wear off. I was in excruciating pain in 2 other teeth where the plastic strip was ripped off my grounded down teeth. I then called, e-mailed and left messages with Doctor Doctor Coto's staff explaining that I was in unbearable pain. Doctor Coto did not call me back until the next day.The following day a driver took me to Doctor Aguilars office to finish the root canal. Doctor Aguilar took x-ray's and then called Doctor Coto and stated that I was going to need 2 additional root canals where the strips were ripped off my grounded down teeth. For a total of 3 root canals preformed.After doctor Coto placed all the crowns on my teeth, several of the teeth were still in a lot of pain. Doctor Coto told me it was from the trauma of having the bad veneers on my teeth for an entire month. He stated that it was going to take another month for my teeth to heal.One month later ( past the rescission period on my debit card ) I called Doctor Coto and stated that I was still in pain and that I had been to see several American dentists again. The long and short of it was that Doctor Coto refused to have my teeth fixed. The damaged Doctor Coto caused this time was far worse than the first time. I've had to have 2 more root canals preformed in the area where doctor Coto ripped the strip off my grounded down teeth. Doctor Coto screwed up my bite so badly that I now suffer from severe TMJ. I've been living with horrible pain in my face, ears, jaw and teeth for 18 months. Half of the teeth in my mouth have become open margin ( the crowns are popped off my teeth ). Several American dental specialists have explained that my teeth will now start falling out one by one because of all the open margins. When I become toothless, no dentist can give me dentures. I have a seizure disorder and dentures tend to slip during a seizure in which case I could choke to death. Therefore, no dentist will risk my life with non-permanent dentures. The cost to re-do my crowns is $35,000 ( which I don't have ) plus thousands more for additional work that I need because of Doctor Coto's negligence and incompetence. I wrote a review about my botched dentistry with whatclinic.com ( The medical travel company where I found doctor Coto in the first place ). Whatclinic.com refused to post my review to warn the public and did not care about my medical evidence. I then filed complaints with placidway and several other medical tourism providers who use Doctor Coto as one of their dentists. Neither Whatclinic.com, Placidway nor any of the other medical tourism providers who use this man would post my review or stop using Doctor Coto as one of their dentists to the unaware public. In addition, I  filed complaints against doctor Coto about my botched dentistry to several other complaint boards. 
I hired a Costa Rican attorney to try to get doctor Coto to pay to have my teeth fixed. My Costa Rican attorney explained that if I tried to file criminal charges on doctor Coto or sue him that Doctor Coto would just bribe an official and make the case go away. I had to take my case in front of the Costa Rican dental coleigo because they had the power to take a dentists license away. In addition to my American dentist medical report, I had to be seen by a dentist in Costa Rican. I was actually examined by 3 Costa Rican dentists including a specialist who was on the board for approved opinions with the Costa Rican dental coleigo. All 3 Costa Rican dentists agreed with the American dental report which confirmed severe criminal negligence against doctor Coto. I also had medical evidence with before and after x-ray's proving my case as well.When I got to the Dental Coleigo meeting, all they cared about was the fact that I filed complaints against Doctor Coto. According to Costa Rican law, it is considered a felony to speak against the reputation of a Costa rican citizen unless or until they have first been found guilty of a crime in a Costa Rican court of law. ( no freedom of speech in Costa Rica  ). It did not matter that I filed those complaints from my own home in America. I had to flee Costa Rica immediately and I was extremely lucky that I wasn't arrested first and lock up abroad.There are multiple consequences that can occur from an improper bite. They include, but are not limited to fracture of the teeth, fracture of the porcelain, loosened of the teeth in the bone, bone loss around the teeth, infection, jaw pain, pain in the facial muscles, neck pain, shoulder pain, inability to eat or speak properly, pain in the teeth, etc. My botched dentistry and severely improper bite caused from Doctor Coto's negligence has led to and endless amount of dental and medical problems. I now suffer from almost every symptom listed above. My condition continues to get worse because I can not afford to fix the mess that Doctor Coto left me with. I am only in my 40's. My quality of life has changed from that of a happy and active woman to horrible daily suffering, terrible constant pain and depression. Knowing that I will become toothless soon and can't even have dentures has almost paralyzed me. I am willing to send copies of my medical reports to anyone who asks ! When Doctor Coto butchered me, the name of his company was high tech dental clinic. Doctor Coto has since moved his practice to another area  in San Jose Costa Rica. He has also changed the name of his company to ""IMPLANT AND COSMETICS SOLUTIONS"".  I have no doubt that Doctor Coto will change his company name and move his location over and over in an attempt to deceive the public. I am not writing this complaint out of revenge. I am a christian woman and I am truly writing this to help innocent people who are desperate for less expensive dentistry. I understand that vengeance is for God and not for me.  I have been praying about this nightmare for 18 months now.  As much as I am suffering, I also know is that there is a reason for everything and that God uses people for good. I have spoken to several other people since this has happened to me who have also been butchered with medical tourism. I've even discussed it with a few church ministers as well. Almost every victim that I have spoken to or person who knew a victim, received their botched treatment in Costa Rica. The 2nd worst place for botched  medical tourism in my research was Mexico.

										Went to southwest Dental due to the fact they accepted my dental plan. I thought with insurance coverage I would not have to pay so much out of pocket for work I needed done, I was indeed very wrong. After looking into other dental offices ,which did not accept my insurance it would have cost considerably less.My dental needs were extractions of remaining teeth and to be fitted for a complete set of dentures. I was informed I would receive a temporary denture and a few months later a permanent denture. Only to find out the temporary denture was unnecessary.The permanent denture did not fit any better than the temporary denture. I at this time was informed implants would now be needed in order to wear bottom dentures. The cost would be an additional   $4,311.00 on top of the $6,959.00 already paid.The permanent denture was made with no mention of implants. I now have bottom dentures that can not be worn. Also the cost of implants does not include if possible to be fitted to the denture. Southwest Dental has not done anything to try to correct this problem.Obviously they do not gurantee their work nor care if customer is happy. I feel very deceived due to all the extra charges I would incurr to have teeth I could actually wear as I have not been given but one option.The $10,000 dollar question is are they ripping me off more???",  Dental Services

										This was my first time at this dentist and I was NOT impressed. I didn't feel that welcome there, and before I even went back for my appt, I had to pay $200+ (and I have insurance!) The doctors were kind of cold and did not have good bedside manner at all. They told me I had several things wrong, and then asked if I could fork over another $500 for a down payment (to purchase equipment because I have some ""big cavities."") This request was made after my mouth was bleeding all over from a cleaning! They were essentially trying to get me to drop money there on the spot. Who walks into a dentist expecting to pay $700+? When I said I wanted to take a little time and think about it (how I wanted to pay - apply for a credit card or hand over the $500) I felt like they got snippy with me. They asked me what the issue was and I told them money. They explained the issue is serious and has to be taken care of immediately. I was about to get charged for a procedure I hadn't even scheduled nor did I want to do there for after all I had been through! I asked if they knew how much everything would end up costing me, and they said they didn't know. What?! I was in pain, and about in tears as I left. I will NOT be returning.

										On 7/27/2012 
I signed up for Humana One Loyalty  Dental insurance. I understand there are premiums and such, but when I found there was a huge deductible on the insurance before I could receive work. I decided not to get the work done.  The dentist that I went to gave me a lot of trouble for using my Humana One card even though they are listed as one of the dentists.  I refused their services and left. 
I am in the process of changing my dentist insurance because I am not satisfied with Humana. It has been less than 30 days on Humana.  As of 8/23/2012.  I called to cancel them so I can make my switch. 
VERY much like the previous person that dealt with Humana One. I received the same treatment. Then to add insult to injury-  the representative butchered my name and made fun of it. Calling me something totally different.. laughed about - then  told me I was under a year contract. I signed nothing. I received NOTHING stating such. When I signed up there was nothing That said your soul is theirs for a year. I  refuse to be under such contracts like that. I don't even have a cell phone/or internet contracts.  
I asked to speak to a suprevisor, who told me the same thing in regards to the contract.  I have all the paper work that sent to me in my possession. After working with an attorney for 3 yrs I learned to save EVERYTHING.  So... I have one letter with my insurance cards on them- nothing else.  Nothing about a contract, nothing that I had sign and send back. Nothing that stats that I am under a contract for an entire year.  
Even if there were a contract- I still should of been able to cancel as its been less than 30 days. 
Also... 
When I signed up... they took out 67 dollars for signing up and the first month of insurance. TWO WEEKS later  on the 15th of August they took out another 32$  I am following what the previous person went through. I am cancelling my bank card.									",  Dental Services

										I am new to the area and visited Bryant Dental for a routine cleaning.  It is a very nice facility and very high tech.  The receptionist and hygenist were nice.  That is the extent of the positives.  Here is what happened:
They took xrays and checked my gums and then told me that they would need to use a special instrument to clean my gums AND do a second appt to polish my teeth.  They said that it would be $140 more than insurance would cover.  What they didn't know is that 2 prior dentists in other places I've lived have explained how they check your gums and this instrument, etc.  I have had this instrument cleaning and polish done in one visit and totally covered under insurance for the last 5 years, 2x per year!  They insisted on classifying it as gum disease instead of cleaning even though they admitted that it really wasn't too bad.  They were just trying to find a way to classify it so that they could get more money.  This was also their intent for splitting it into 2 sessions.  
When I told the hygenist that I only wanted a regular cleaning she informed me that they could not do that because insurance would not accept that.  I think everyone on here knows that is crazy.  
I was not arguing with the condition of my gums or the procedure they were going to use - just how they were spinning it to get more money out of me.  THEN - while in there I hear two other people going through the same exact conversations!  This place is just ripping people off period.  
One other thing - This ""routine"" cleaning that was only supposed to be part one took 2 TWO hours!  
Stupid me - I felt that since they had done xrays and started that I was stuck so I paid half of it.  When I got home and really thought through it I was very upset and called them, calmly to discuss why I thought this whole scenario was unfair.  They said they would only comp me for the half I had not done but I explained that they did not even finish the first half.  They had all kinds of issues with the instrument and finally said they would add it to the second part when I came back.
The whole experience was unfair and obviously rigged/planned.  Very sleazy feeling.  If you think I am being at all insincere, I invite you to make a visit.  I feel 100% confident that anyone going in will have this same thing happen.  As I said, I heard two others going through it and when I told the hygenist that I thought it was being unfair and I was unhappy she said ""we are used to it"".  WHAT?  How many times do they do this?  I bet you it is every patient!  I just wonder how many people fall for it.

When she called back 2 days later and explained she couldn't afford all this work and just wanted the cleaning provided by our insurance company she was told that now that the dentist had examined her she had to have the $6000.00 worth of work 1st.
And oh don't forget that $100.00 toothbrush.
Later that night while discussing this we realized we had been to the Coast Dental in Brandon Florida years earlier. Apparently they figured by moving their location they could avoid their bad reputation.
We remembered that this deep cleaning scam had been played out then as well. We remembered every single person coming in and out of that office that day also needed a deep cleaning. There were also a lot of angry customers commenting on this fact and one had even turned to those of us in the waiting room to expect this after our exams.
Sure enough we came out with the same prognosis.
Since my insurance provider cannot get me anyone closer then an hour and a half away as Coast is ""it"" here in Hillsborough County Fl. my next move is a request by my insurance carrier and the State of Florida Insurance Commisioners office to conduct an investigation as I see that this practice, from the looks of it here on the web is a concern nation wide.

He broke my tooth causing 3 root canals to be preformed while in his care. He left me with half of my teeth open margin  ( the crowns are popped off  my teeth ). He screwed up my bite so badly that I now suffer from severe TMJ. I live constant horrible pain every day of my life. I can't eat or speak properly 
and so on. In addition, a few of the cheaply made Costa Rican crowns in my mouth are now breaking apart. One crown in the back of my mouth has completely broken apart and my grounded down tooth is now bare. The cost to fix my bite alone is $35,000 ( which I don't have ) plus thousands more for additional work that I need because of Doctor Coto's incompetence. Every American dental specialist that I've seen states that what 
Doctor Coto did to me falls under severe criminal negligence. In addition, I have been checked by 3 Costa Rican dental specialists who also confirmed severe negligence as well. Anyone who would like a copy of these medical reports is 
welcome to them.  Several American dental specialists also confirm that all of  my teeth will start falling out one by one because of all the open margins. I can't  get false teeth put in my mouth after I become toothless because I suffer from a seizure disorder.  Dentures can slip during a seizure, in which case I could choke to death. Therefore, no American dentist will risk my life with non permanent dentures.  I was threatened in Costa Rica and almost charged with a felony and thrown in a foreign prison for complaining publicly about being butchered abroad. ( no freedom of speech in Costa Rica  ). It is considered a very serious felony in Costa Rica to speak against the reputation of a Costa Rican citizen.  Anyone reading this should bare this in mind. If your dentist or doctor butchers you in Costa Rica and you complain about it in that country, then you will be charged with a felony and thrown in a Costa Rican prison.  When I originally went to Doctor Coto for my medical tourism dentistry, he worked under a different business name. Doctor Alberto Coto Calvo  has since conveniently changed the name of his business from High Tech dental clinic to "" 
Implant and Cosmetics Solutions "" and has moved his practice to "" Rohrmoser - San Jose Costa Rica. ""  I have no doubt that he will to continue to change his business name and move his practice over and over again in an attempt to deceive 
the public. He could also possibly work under the name of a different dentist or use a fictitious name all together. One of his latest tricks on-line is an advertisement heading under ""dental implants and cosmetics solutions"" and when 
you pull it up, it then states "" implant and cosmetics solutions "" on his web-site.  Hence the word dental is in under the first heading which is meant to deceive you. If you decide to risk getting medical tourism dentistry in Costa Rica anyway, you can always google search ""Doctor Alberto Coto Calvo San Jose Costa Rica Images"" ( my image will most likely be next to his ) at least you will be able to see what he looks like so that you are not tricked by him once you get to Costa Rica.  As of today August 13, 2012 - I have been living in constant horrible pain daily. My medical condition has become much worse since I went to Doctor Coto for treatment 18 months ago. Also, as of today -  I  contacted Doctor Coto one 
more time and asked him if he would pay my local dentist directly to fix my teeth that he botched so badly. On August 13, 2012  Doctor Coto first asked me first if I would go to a dentist in Costa Rica to have my teeth fixed.
I told Doctor Coto no for 3 reasons. #1.)  -  I can never step foot in Costa Rica again after I was threatened and almost  charged with a felony. I know that  I was lucky to flee Costa Rica as quickly as I did to escape imprisonment  for complaing about my botched dentistry publically with Doctor Coto. # 2.)  -  It will take several months for any dentist to fix my teeth including in Costs Rica.  # 3.)  -  I've learned my lesson about trusting anyone outside of my own country with any medical and or dentistry ever again. On this same conversation ( August 13, 2012 ) Doctor Coto stated that he did not have $35,000 to pay my dentist in America to fix my teeth.He also stated that he may contact me in the future about it. It's been 18 months since Doctor coto butchered and maimed me. It's been 18 months that I've been fighting for Doctor Coto to pay to have my teeth fixed that he severely botched.  I am not holding my breath for Doctor Coto to call me back. Doctor Coto runs an international medical tourism practice. Mainly his patients come from America, Canada and some from Europe. Unfortunately,  Doctor Coto does not understand our morals, ethics or how we think and feel as a people.
Doctor Coto seems to think that if he gets some of his friends to write good reviews about him, that it will make him seem like a great guy. He doesn't seem to understand that when someone offers you medical evidence of being butchered from several highly respected American specialists then we know it to be true pure and simple. Doctor Coto refused to refund the small fortune that I paid him. He has refused to pay to have my teeth fixed that he botched and maimed so badly. My condition is getting worse and worse every day. In addition, Doctor Coto has 
also called me a scam and other nasty things on-line. Doctor Coto thinks if he calls me bad names and throws references out there, that the public will be "" stupid "" enough to ignore the medical evidence that can not be disputed.
Like I said, Doctor Coto thinks we are stupid and he does not understand us at all !Anyone who would like a copy of my medical reports can leave me a message on my u-tube channel and I'll e-mail them to you right away.My story gets much worse and something every American, Canadian and European should watch !  Before getting any medical and or dentistry abroad, please go to u-tube and click on my channel ( kimberly4064 )   I have 4  video's

It sounded very muddy to me because to my understanding, the original reason my bill wasn't paid was because they thought I had a dual insurance.

										I made the mistake of taking my daughter to Western Dental Ortho 3 years ago.  After she had been going for 2 years -- we had been paying regularly, sometimes in advance, I discovered she still didn't have bands placed on her rear molars and they were tipped toward her tongue making it impossible for her to use them for chewing food.  I had assumed all was going well since I had not received any communication from the doctors or staff, but at that point I went in to speak with the orthodontist about her molars.
I found out at that time, she had been through several orthodontists and none of them had even noticed she didn't ever have bands placed on the molar teeth.  It took several months for them to place the bands because it would take an extra long appointment and they kept scheduling her for ""shorter"" appointments.
Obviously she didn't finish her treatment within 24 months and never did they tell me how long it would be extended or why her teeth were still not properly lined up.  At one point I took her to a dentist for a cleaning and found out she had a case of gingivitis, which they never noticed or alerted us to at the Western Dental office.  
After doing some research of my own, I found out that it is the standard of care to do regular fluoride treatments to prevent white lesions of demineralization when the brackets are removed, but she has never received even one.  After I asked the orthodontist about it, he said I could purchase a rinse over the counter.  Also, I discovered that sometimes orthodontia can cause bone resorption, so it is the standard of care to take x-rays periodically throughout treatment to be sure everything progressing okay with bone health.  My daughter has not received any x-rays and seeing how they operate in there, I am very worried!  
Parents never go into the back where all the kids are herded through like a cattle call, but I went back with her the past couple visits.  The instruments they used on her were rusty!  The barriers were not changed between patients.  There was a wall of shelved plaster teeth models that were just piled on top of each other, no boxes, just piled up models -- had to be at least 100 of them.  
There was only 1 dental assistant who seemed to know what he was doing.  The others kept making mistakes.  
Needless to say, I do not want to take her back there.  I have tried several times over the past 3 months to reach patient relations at headquarters, but it is just a voicemail and nobody calls back.  I still owe them $500 and they call for the money every day.  I've tried to get the billing department to put me in touch with someone who can talk to me about my daughter's care, but they will only discuss payment ""in full"".

										The following is a email sent to the Gentle Dental Offices:
I must cancel all further appointments.
REASON: I requested an appointment on 07/27/2012 via email. I received a phone call from Paige Gatton (Patient Services Team) to confirm the appointment and receive new patient registration forms. I was sure to ask if Gentle Dental accepted my Insurance, She said she would call the number I gave her and get back to me. She called back and informed me that Gentle Dental did accept my Insurance. On my emergency appointment August 1st., I was charged $25.00 (not a deal breaker) for a routine visit, my bridge was removed, inspected and given a prescription for antibiotics and a pain reliever (which should have been covered by my Insurance, I inquired about charges and was told there was a 25% discount?) and referred  to a Oral Surgeon. I was never told I was NOT covered.  August 6th. the tooth was removed and the charge was $255.00 ( extractions 
are covered by my Insurance also). As I sat in the Doctors chair, waiting for the Novocain to take affect,  an assistant came in with a bill,clipboard,and a pen and inquired how was I going to pay, cash, credit, or debit. Confused,and in severe pain, I thought I was covered by Insurance, I said debit and reached for my billfold/credit card. I was NOT previously informed I was NOT covered.
AS TACTFUL AS A FLYING BRICK, She said it would be easier to pay before surgery than after; as if I were going under for a major operation. She returned to ask about a PIN number or could they run it as credit.  Luckily my mouth was numb, I felt as if I had been slapped in the face. Returning again so I could sign the bill, all this before the Novocain took full affect!
I called my Insurance and no claim was filed and that Gentle Dental is not a Provider with my Insurance. I fell I was duped by the person I spoke with that told me I was covered by my Insurance and the Office Staff was aware of that when I was treated on August 1st and August 6th hence the Tactful way of asking for the payment before services rendered and pointing out that my next visit would be $83.00. 
Further, the day after,(8am), my bridge was removed I was experiencing severe pain and requested a stronger pain reliever, I was told the Doctor was not in but they would contact him and I had to pick up the prescription in person. I told the office I didnt have access to a vehicle and CALL ME when the prescription was ready to be picked up. After a few hours,(11am),.. NO CALL, I call back, talked to another person, and was told the doctor that was in could sign the prescription but he was seeing patients at the moment, I asked this person to CALL ME when the prescription was signed. At 3:30 pm...NO CALL, I called back and was informed I could pick up the prescription. I arranged a ride to the Gentle Dental Office to pick up my prescription, 
much to my chagrin and dismay the prescription still was not signed when I arrived at the office. Perhaps the Terribly Efficient  assistance with the bill, clipboard and the pin would have been a better choice to handle the Prescription Issue.
All that aside, the Physicians are TOP NOTCH!  Im 63 years old, I have never had a Physician give me a follow- up-call the day after a treatment...NEVER.  Both Doctors Dr. Zylbering and Dr. Seider  call the day after my procedures  and inquired as to my condition and if I required any thing( I complained about the Insurance issue). Above and Beyond, Extraordinary comes to mind. Both Top Notch.   My conundrum is, stay with TOP NOTCH Physicians and endure Boiler Room bill collectors and Misinformation or change Dental offices. Meanwhile, to date, I am $ 280.00 out of pocket,( that should have been covered by my Insurance) and must try to recoup in some way.  Reasons for Cancellation/Termination:
1)Borderline deceptive Practices (Tell the patient what they want to hear/get them in the door; we can extract the money)
2)Myopic Business Policies ( get the money now, some will not be back)  
3)Boiler Room Bill Collection Tactics (get the payment BEFORE services rendered and at all cost)
After days of negotiations with Gentle Dental they, of course, they except no responseability for this debacle content to lay it on my Insurance Company, which by the way is culpable as well. That said, it does not excuse the ""Boiler Room Collection"" tactics.

										First visit.  $55 cleaning.  Was told for cosmetic reasons I should get my 
crown redone.  Like an idiot I agreed not thinking this was just an 
upsell.  Crown gets done.  Crown is not test fitted.  Crown is cemented 
on FIRST.  X-ray is done and shown the crown is not done properly.  So I 
am asked to come again.
Wait two weeks.  Go back.  Crown gets drilled off.  While drilling, my 
tongue gets cut 1/4"" deep.  I ask the dentist to stop and ask why they 
did not stop and asked if my tongue got cut.  The dentists question was 
""you felt that?"".  To this point I'm trying to stay calm.  Crown gets 
made.  Crown is test fitted this time and checked with x-rays.  Crown 
doesn't fit properly.  Crown gets put on as a temporary.
Wait two more weeks.  Go back.  Crown gets made again.  This time I'm 
being told my gum line needs to be lasered.  Gum line gets lasered.  
Crown gets put on.  I'm looking at the x-ray.  The crown is NO better 
than the old crown.
Their reasoning in replacing my old crown was there was a ridge hangover 
toward the front of the tooth.  The  new crown has a ridge hangover in 
the back.  MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO FLOSS.  This was all due to an upsell 
by your $55 special teeth cleaning. 
I have visited another dentist since then after letting my tooth heal a 
little.  The crown isn't that great.  The dentist is not happy with the 
gum line for that crown.  It's more difficult to floss back there 
because the floss gets caught in that ridge hangover.
This is supposed to be about health care, not upselling.  If a patient 
doesn't need dental work, don't sell it or don't run these specials to 
ploy customers in.  I will make a big fuss about this using every review 
site possible.  You guys are horrible.  No better than a fast food

										If your looking for a dentist in the Ocean City, MD I strongly recommending to avoid this place at all cost. The following is a honest report of my expierence with the purposes to educate other citizens so they will not be taken advantage of. I'm a 46 year old teacher from Bel Air who spends my summer at the beach.  I decided to go to a local dentist instead of tracking back to my own dentist whom I been seeing since college.After being greeted and shown to my chair (which was the only non abusive part of my experience) the ""denist"" assistant began to inquire about my dental history. After clearly stating I just wanted a cleaning the assistant she began to insist that ""for my best intreats"" I should get some X-rays done. I asked why since I had my family dentist back home. Her response was to update my records. So she began to peck around mouth and again asked me if she could recommend a few X-rays, again I refused. She then got up after not even starting the actual cleaning process to get ""dentist"" Micheal Depalma.Dentist Michael Depalma greeted me and made the usual small talk. He then took a look in my mouth and asked when was the last time I have seen the dentist, I told him January. He then took out a small object that looked like a pen that was connected to a machine and started touching my teeth. He did mention before this process that this was the new way to check for cavities and ""he has cutting edge tecnoligy at his office"". When he was finished he told me I had 14 cavities, mind you I have only had 3 in 46 years. I told him that's impossible and I would not even been able to afford that work. Michael Depalma then mentioned similar to a used car salesmen that they offer payment plans. I laughed it off of course and requested very politely to just finish the cleaning. Micheal Dipalma then told me he can't because I need a deep cleaning. After the stunning response I then proceeded to leave where I was greeted by the front desk receptionist who presented me with a 146.00 bill. I asked for what, she responded for the cleaning. I told her they didn't do any cleaning and 
Instead told me to get X-rays and I had some how been told I have 14 cavities. I took a deep breath and paid for basically nothing.I went to my family dentist in Bel Air because I was worried. My dentist then did a follow up and 'shockingly' he found nothing wrong with me. This Michael Depalma should be ashamed of him self and I can only imagine how many of those poor simple people down there he has basically robbed and lied to.									",  Dental Services

										Doctor Alberto Coto Calvo was the medical tourism dentist who butchered me in San Jose Costa Rica.He broke my tooth causing 3 root canals to be preformed while in his care. He left me with half of my mouth open margin ( the crowns are popped off my teeth ). He screwed up my bite so badly that I now suffer from severe TMJ. I live in horrible pain on a daily basis. I can't eat or speak properly and so on.The cost to fix my bite alone is $35,000 ( which I don't have ) plus thousands more for additional root canals that I now need because of Doctor Coto's negligence. Several American dental specialist have confirmed that all of my teeth will start falling out one by one because of all the open margins in my mouth. When I become toothless no dentist will give me dentures because I have a seizure disorder. Dentures can slip during a seizure and I could choke to death. Therefore I am stuck. For the record Doctor coto knew of my seizure disorder when he butchered me. 
When I complained publicly about being butchered abroad, I was threatened and almost charged with a felony for speaking against the reputation of a Costa rican citizen ( no freedom of speech in Costa Rica ). I had to flee that country immediately and was lucky that I wasn't thrown in a Costa Rican prison. 
When Doctor Coto butchered me his company name was high tech dental clinic in curridbat Costa Rica. Like most scam artists, he has since changed his business name to ""Implant and Cosmetics Solutions"" and has moved his practice to Rohrmoser San Jose Costa Rica in the Rohrmoser Medical Center. Beware, he could change his business name and location over and over again. He could also possibly work under another dentists name. Like most sociopaths, Doctor Coto is a good talker, lies well and offers references to his patients as he did with me. Bare in mind that Ted Bundy had many people who swore that he was a great guy too. Doctor Coto also offers a 100 % guarantee on all of his work. He refused to pay to have my teeth fixed after he butchered me so there you have it. Doctor Coto comes up with many lies and excuses for what he did to me thinking that  he can scam the public. I have medical reports from highly respected American dental specialists confirming criminal negligence against Doctor Coto pure and simple and without dispute.I am including a copy of my first medical report taken shortly after I was butchered by Doctor Coto. My condition has become far worse since then. The medical report doesn't align right on this complaint but, I can send a good copy to anyone who wants one. Just go to my blog http://www.rogers406412.blogspot.com and it will take you to my utube video about my nightmare with doctor Coto. Send me a message on my utube  channel and I will send you back a better copy. You should watch my video anyway as my story is much more horrific than what is on this complaint.I hope this complaint spares many people from my fate.

To Whom It May Concern:
I am writing this letter on behalf of my patient Kimberly Rogers. As you can see from my Ietterhead, I am a Prosthodontist, which is a dental specialist in the fabrication of crown and bridge procedures. I have been working as an expert in this field since 1992. I have done a comprehensivedental evaluation, reviewed all available x-rays and analyzed the patient's bite. It is my professional opinion that the dental work previously done was beneath the standard of care and done improperly. The patient had a full mouth of porcelain crowns done and when she bites down, she should be able to make contact with all her teeth simultaneously. That is not the case.The patient is only biting down on a few of her front teeth and none of her back teeth are hitting.That is totally improper and by any dental standard would be considered negligent. There are also multiple areas where cement was not cleaned properly after the crowns were cemented and one of the crowns shows an obvious poor fit to the tooth when evaluated on the x-ray.
There are multiple consequences that can occur from an improper bite. They include, but are not limited to fracture of the teeth, fracture of the porcelain, loosened of the teeth in the bone, bone loss around the teeth, infection, jaw pain, pain in the facial muscles, neck pain, shoulder pain, inability to eat or speak properly, pain in the teeth, etc. The patient already relates that she is
having several of the symptoms. As you can see, if left untreated, the patient's current condition can lead to an endless amount of dental problems.
Unfortunately, the solution to the problem is not a simple one, especially when the bite is so incorrect. The only solution the patient has is to start from the beginning and redo the improper dentistry that was done. in other words to replace all the crowns in her mouth. That is the only way that a proper bite could be established. I would estimate that the time necessary to correct the dentistry would be a 3 to 4 month time frame and would cost approximately 35,000.I hope this information is helpfu lto you.

										Doctor Alberto Coto Calvo Butchered and Permanently Maimed me. He broke my tooth causing 3 root canals to be preformed while in his care.   He left me with half of my teeth open margin ( crowns are popped off the teeth ) And he screwed up my bite so badly that I now suffer severe TMJ, constant pain, can't eat or speak properly and so on.The cost to fix my bite alone is $35,000 ( which I don't have ) plus thousands more for additional work that I need because of his incompetence.Several American specialists have confirmed that my teeth will start falling out one by one because of all the open margins.Once I am toothless, no American dentist will give me dentures because I suffer a seizure disorder and dentures can slip during a seizure in which case I can choke to death.Before Doctor Coto touched me my teeth were all fairly healthy.I was threatened and almost charged with a felony for complaining publically about being butchered abroad ( no freedom of speach in Costa Rica ). [continued below]....
									
										..... My costa Rican attorney explained that it is a very serious felony to speak against the reputation of a Costa Rican citizen unless or until that person has first been found guilty in a Costa Rican court of law.It was also explained that if I tried to file criminal charges on Doctor Coto that he would just bribe an official and make the case go away.Since I committed a felony by complaining publically about being butchered and maimed by Doctor Coto, I had to flee Costa Rica immediately.Fortunately, I got out of that country before I Doctor Coto has since changed the name of his business from High tech Dental Clinic to Implant and Cosmetics Solutions. I'm quite sure he will change the name  of his business over and over in order to deceive the American and Canadian public.Medical Tourism is a booming industry in which millions of Americans flock abroad for less expensive medical and or dentistry.Unfortunately, way too many Americans are being butchered and or  killed by incompetent doctors and dentists in 3rd world countries.My personal nightmare gets much worse than I am covering here.I have decided to follow scripture and not be over come by evil But, over come evil by good.For this reason, I am trying to protect as many other children of God as possible from this fate.Before you or anyone you love takes this horrable risk, please watch all 3 of the u-tube medical tourism video's that I made of my own terrible nightmare abroad.Please pass it along and pay the warning foreward !!!You can either go directly to my channel on u-tube which is kimberly4064or All three of my blogs will connect you to to each of the video's below.Thank you and God Bless, Kimberlyhttp://www.rogers4064.blogspot.comhttp://www.kimberly4064.blogspot.comhttp://www.kimberly406412.blogspot.comThank you,   Kimberly  ",  Dental Services

As soon as Paypal's 45-day limit for disputes had expired, they simply stopped answering my emails.  I never received the goods I ordered, nor did I receive the requested refund of 68.28.
Of course, I wrote to Paypal and they expressed their regrets, saying there was nothing they could do since 45 days had passed since I made my order.  I wrote back asking if they knew whom I could contact, and the second letter I received, an obviously very poor cut and paste job, gave me essentially the same response with no answer to my question.

I have had nothing but problems since my Care Credit bill was paid off. I had sent my payments in regularly until August 2010 when I was in a car accident that left me unable to return to work. I borrowed from relatives to continue to pay off my bill, although I did have a few payments paid late. In January of 2011 my Aunt (co-signer) received a call from a Care Credit representative stating that if a payment of $365.00 was paid it would pay off and close the account. During that phone call she made the final payment via credit card. They gave her the final payment confirmation number. We though it was done and over. A few weeks later a representative called saying the bill was overdue and no payment had been received. The continued to call my former place of employment 3 to 5 times daily for weeks . It went well beyond embarrassing, getting calls daily or weekly reports from former coworkers about constantly needing to stop what they were doing to answer calls from Care Credit trying to collect debt from myself. Every time it was explained the payment had been made and debt forfilled. I called them repeatedly trying to get answers as to what had gone wrong. No one could give me any answers and said all they could do was tell me how much my bill was and last payment received. After doing this for weeks, a representative finally told me that I needed to send in a copy of the payment that was made along with the confirmation number. On March 3rd,2011 I faxed in the information along with a note requesting that my Aunt's name  be removed from my bill. They continued to call. I was told that a credit card payment could not be taken to pay the debt.I tried explaining to them that they charged her card and I had already given her the money for the bill. I would be unable to re-submit the final payment until her credit card was refunded. At that point they sent me to collections. This has been an unending nightmare for the past 2 years. This has caused irreversible damage to the relationship between myself and my Aunt. I tried many times to get help, answers, anything to put this to rest. I have scoured the Internet only to find numerous stories like or similar to mine in dealing with Care Credit, and like me the most common complaint was the communication issues with Care Credit, no answers, no end. I never thought that having 5 teeth pulled could cause so many problems. My Aunt had great credit before this happened . I did not have health insurance. All she was trying to do was help me out. I was beyond eager to be out of pain. If I knew then what I do now about this company, I would have never allowed her to help me in this manner. I am have yet to return to work since my auto accident in 2010. I do not have any money, much less money to repay a debt that has already been paid. I will never be able to repair the damage caused to my Aunt's credit by this paid debt, or repair the damage to our relationship.									",  Dental Services

I do not have dental insurance and stated that I could not afford to have the work done now.

The other cavity that Dr. Ali Fakhimi stated was  'deep' as he  showed me an enlarged picture of the cavity,  said that it needed to be done immediately. The new dentist who did the work stated that there was 'no' cavity there. While my daughter did indeed have two cavities, one was a little surface cavity, the other was not even a cavity. I do not feel that Dr. Fakhimi is honest and I am grateful to have followed my instincts to get a second opinion. I saved $240.00 by not going to Dr.Fakhimi. After talking to the new dentist that completed the work on my daughter, I felt compelled to report Dr. Ali Fakhimi.

They proceeded to give me information about how much the plan cost, and they charge a fee of $29.95 nonrefundable to send the welcome package and $19.95 monthly fee and they would   debit my checking account monthly, meaning they needed my account information,  When I did not receive this so called information package in the mail after 2 months I became very suspicious. I unfortunely never wrote down the telephone number or I could not find it. Based on this 2 month waiting period for the package I went to the bank to see if they could help me. There response was that I needed to contact them. How do you contact them if you do not know the telephone number or the web address? The account is debited through ACH, so how come the bank was not able to help me at the time?

They told me I would have to leave and go to an oral surgeon immediately to have the tooth removed since the WD dentist was unable to do it.  I left with a partially extracted tooth.To sum it up:  I spent the next 2 days in an ER hospital and then made it to a wonderful oral surgeon who properly removed the (partially extracted) molar.Now, if all of that is not bad enough.  I come to find out weeks later, by an endodontist, that my pain was due to excessive grinding, and that I NEVER NEEDED MY TOOTH EXTRACTED!  I just need a good bite guard.I am devastated, tired, feeling hopeless and powerless.

										Tooth Extraction: ""Drew Hawk"" caused HORRIFIC PAIN, Hospitalization+ $10K in Bills.
   
DREW HAWK, ""dentist"" in CLARION, PA. caused me unnecessary pain, suffering and over $10K in Hospital and subsequent Dental bills (from a Qualified Dentist) to FIX THE DAMAGE caused by the SERIOUS INFECTION that resulted from a molar tooth extraction by HAWK, AND AN INFECTION OF THAT TOOTH THAT HE SHOULD HAVE DEALT WITH.   
Not only did he ABANDON ME (AGAINST DENTIST CODE) while I suffered UNBEARABLE pain. Tooth extracted on Thursday afternoon, Nov 17, 2011, and HORRIFIC pain began on Friday evening, Nov 18, 2011, approximately 7 or 8pm. When the pain kept rising in severity, I called the dentist office on Friday evening, got a voicemail (expected that) and left a message that I was in severe pain. I got no return call. The next day (Saturday) I called the office, again. No return call.  The next day (Sunday) I called the office, again and also his home number (which is listed) and left another message, begging for help with the pain and the significant swelling of my face on the side where the tooth had been extracted (I was actually crying). NO RETURN CALL. 
 
On Monday, THREE (miserable, for me) DAYS LATER, his office called and told me I could come in if I wanted to. I saw the ""poor excuse for the title: dentist"" on Monday. He saw that my face was significantly swollen, and I believe that my eye was about 1/3 CLOSED at that point, like someone had punched me. He said ""well you have an infection from the tooth that was pulled (No Kidding, huh?) and that it spread, which would probably cause me to have Root Canals in other teeth (Oh, THANKS A LOT. How Lovely!) and gave me a list of 3 root canal specialists, on the back of his card, that I could call for an appointment. I asked HAWK about giving me something to STOP THE SWELLING AND PAIN. He gave me a different Oral Antibiotic which I guess the ""Uninformed, Unconcerned, Sadist S.O.B."" thought MIGHT help this ""run-away-train"" Infection, but HAWK'S first concern seemed to be to get me out of HIS office so he could go and possibly ruin the health of the unsuspecting people that were in the waiting room. I asked for something for the Horrible Pain and HAWK said ""NO"". He intimated that I was asking for a pain killer (NOTE: the PAIN was actually VISIBLE from my swollen face) for illicit drug use, or something?!?!?!. I COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS!!! I AM A 59 YEAR OLD WOMAN AND I DO NOT ABUSE DRUGS!! IF I HAD THE MONEY &/OR TIME I WOULD HAVE SUED HIM FOR SLANDER! (BTW, since this fiasco, people in the area (I was just in the area temporarily) told me HAWK gets a lot of patients because he advertises A LOT AND because he is cheap. Well, as far as cheap goes, the Qualified Dentist that I went to after ""HAWK"", CHARGES $9 LESS for a molar tooth extraction than HAWK! So much for bargain shopping, people! BTW, I did NOT go to ""HAWK"" because of price, as I never even checked the price until I made an appointment with his office and, then, wanted an idea of what it would cost.)
 
By Tuesday afternoon, on a chart of 1 to 10, the PAIN was a 15 AND MY EYE WAS CLOSED DUE TO THE SWELLING. I had NO CHOICE but to go the Emergency Rm. When the Doctor saw me, the FIRST thing he said to me was ""Who did this to you?"" At the time and because I was in SO MUCH PAIN, I didn't want to say, so my husband just said ""a dentist"". To my husband's and my surprise (actually, not a big surprise), one of the staff in the ER said, ""was it DREW HAWK""? My husband asked if they had seen a lot of patients who had visited ""HAWK"" and they indicated that they had!!! The Doctor told me to expect to be in the ER for awhile because he was putting me on IV medication, and an IV was immediately put in my arm. The doctor prescribed an IV antibiotic to arrest the infection, an anti-inflammatory to help with the swelling AND a pain-killer (IV) which I found out was Dilaudid--look it up, it is like Morphine and is used for SEVERE PAIN!! The Doctor also gave me a prescription for Percocet tablets-look that up--again for severe pain, to take AS NEEDED, after I left the hospital. I guess A REAL DOCTOR SAW THAT I TRULY WAS IN EXCRUTIATING PAIN, AND NEEDED PAIN KILLER MEDICATION, AND THAT I DIDN'T HAVE  SIGNS OF BEING A DRUG ABUSER!! (That comment by HAWK was SO WRONG AND UNNECESSARY, ESPECIALLY WHILE THE PATIENT (ME) WAS IN SUCH HORRIBLE PAIN! PEOPLE: IF HE SAYS THIS TO YOU, GET UP AND WALK OUT.  DON'T STOP, DON'T PAY, JUST RUN (don't walk) OUT OF THIS HORRIBLE PERSON'S OFFICE. (HE'S POSING AS A GOOD ""DENTIST"" & EVEN THOUGH HE HAS A LICENSE, HE'S N-O-T A GOOD DENTIST!) I THINK (IF HE DID GRADUATE FROM ANY DENTAL SCHOOL) HE MUST HAVE HAD A ""D"" AVERAGE. 
 
HAWK IS AN UNCARING, UNSKILLED, USELESS PIECE OF FLESH USING UP GOOD OXYGEN THAT SHOULD BE SAVED FOR OTHER REAL HUMANS. B-E-W-A-R-E!!!! DON'T LET ""HAWK"" WORK ON YOU FOR ANYTHING!! IF YOU'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED THE TREATMENT OF THIS HORRIBLE UN-PROFESSIONAL, D-O-N-T DO IT. IF YOU ARE A CURRENT PATIENT, LEAVE BEFORE YOU FIND OUT HOW ""HAWK"" CAN HURT YOU, FIND A-N-O-T-H-E-R REAL DENTIST, WHO REALLY CARES ABOUT THE PATIENT.  A DENTIST WHO LEAVES HIS/HER CELL PHONE NUMBER ON THE VOICEMAIL AT THE OFFICE JUST IN CASE A PATIENT HAS AN EMERGENCY, AND WHO CALLS THE PATIENT TO CHECK IN WITH THEM IF THE TREATMENT WAS A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT ONE!  A DENTIST WHO A-C-T-U-A-L-L-Y C-A-L-L-S B-A-C-K WHEN YOU LEAVE A MESSAGE REGARDING HORRIBLE PAIN!

Around January some family members went in to get some dental treatment. When we got the bill it was higher than expected. When we called the office they said they had dropped the dental plan that we were on, Florida Combined Life PPO copayment plan.
We got no warning of this what so ever. When I called the head of customer service in Jacksonville she said ""we don't have time to send messages to millions of customers"". Well they don't have any trouble collecting monthly payments from millions of customers.
Our office said we could up grade to the ""plus"" program and so did our agent. Several people at BCBS helped us fill out the paper work. Then we get a letter in the mail saying we can't upgrade until our aniversary date. 
If they allowed the dentist to drop the plan at anytime they should have allowed us to upgrade at any time.
As it is I need 2 root canals and 4 crows and have to wait until November 15 to get any work done, that is if they didn't lie about ""no waiting"" period when we sign up for the new plan. 
Finding a new dentist isn't like going to a different gas station. I have had some bad ones. My wife lost a tooth because of a bad one. How can they legally dumb this on us without sufficient warning. 
My daughter also needs 4 wisdom teeth removed and wanted to get it done before going back to college.

But, the last draw was when my daughter said to me (in a fit of both anger and pain), ""where were you Mommy""? That was when I decided to do my best to warn those that were coming or were considering walking through those WD doors behind my family and me.
Those posts that I was making then began to morph into me providing advocacy to those who were reaching the ends of their ropes"". I was now also providing my contact information so that I could get a voice attached to a grievance. [continued below]....

I understand being anonymous when you have been made to believe that you are somehow responsible for what ever has gone wrong.  This is what I have experienced as being their #1 Mode of operation.  Turn the tables to make the debt seem as though its your fault.

Therefore, I am formally asking that everyone who has become a victim of Western Dental.  Even if the paperwork that Western Dental sent you (or didnt send or respond in writing you but instead told you) determined that somehow, you were the one at fault and you still feel that this is not the case. 
Please dont be afraid of stepping forward. Your perspective will not be ignored.  If we continue to put our voices together as one voice representing many allegedly shady behaviors on the part of WesternDental.  Western Dental can only charge for the work that they actually performed.  Please keep this fact in mind.

Dr. Sherri Worth listens carefully to client concerns and sees them as an opportunity to learn from past mistakes and become more efficient as a company in the services offered and the support for those services. Our experienced team specializes in aesthetic and reconstructive dentistry, dental implants, and general dental services. Since 1995, we have been providing excellence in dental care, technology innovation, and expert results to celebrities, full-time moms, professional athletes, business professionals and models...The information provided in this report was based on comments made by Dr. Sherri Worth and her staff during an On-Site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases towards the Center for Reconstructive Dentistry. . 
Dr. Sherri Worth and the Center for Reconstructive Dentistry specialize in Veneers, Invisalign, Teeth Whitening, Crowns, Bridges, Inlays, Onlays, and Bonding. During the On-Site Business verification, Dr. Worth and her staff stated they work with individual patients to address their concerns, needs, and phobias in order to create an appropriate solution for services desired. They do this by asking questions throughout the appointment with the patient and always allow ample time to educate them about their oral health. Additionally, they feel their staff is equipped to provide feedback to their patients and continually have an open line of communication. Dental Hygienists work to show patients areas of concern throughout their appointment through the use of an oral camera. Furthermore, if a patient has a question, the hygienist will stop the procedure and address it immediately to ensure they are getting the best care possible. 
Before a major dental procedure, Dr. Sherri Worth explained that she goes through a comprehensive dental care plan which involves consultation with the patient to determine their needs, a history of the patients dental concerns, a comprehensive exam, and x-rays. Dr. Worth states that she will bring in specialists to meet all of the needs the patient might have in order to provide additional options. They try to present all options to the patient; however, if the patient is looking for something that is not in their best interest Dr. Worth always informs them of her concerns. Overall, they have found that an effective way to eliminate confusion is to explain procedures several times before treatment and then again after it has been completed.
After a patient has had a procedure done, their office manager commented that she is persistent in following up to address any concerns by phone as they feel it is more personal. Additionally, they send thank you cards and make an effort to follow up with them more than once to ensure they do not have additional concerns that have come up. After major procedures, Dr. Sherri Worth stated that she will personally follow up with patients through phone calls, emails, and text messages depending on the patients contact preference. If an issue does come up, they work to give it attention immediately and provide additional consultation for the next steps. 
The Center for Reconstructive Dentistrys office manager is generally the first to hear a complaint. Since the Corporate Advocacy Program through Ripoff Report she stated that she makes sure to make immediate contact with the patient and talk with them personally while walking them through possible solutions until they are satisfied.  They believe that the level of care that patients receive is top quality. If someone is dissatisfied with anything they work to discover the reason, correct it and apply that towards future situations. Dr. Sherri Worth mentioned that she is especially concerned with doing whatever it takes by providing patients the opportunity to have extensive consultation with all parties concerned, exams, and diagnosis. Additionally, they are concerned with follow up and have patients come back for further consultation appointments after procedures. Furthermore, Dr. Worth believes that the CAP program is good resource for assessing businesses on behalf of potential consumers.

===================== Dr.  Sherri Worth  Dr Sherri Worth Found Negligent in Massive Dental Malpractice ... Opinion cites Worths inaccurate diagnoses and untruthful testimony InternetHigh-Profile California Dentist Sherri Worth Found Negligent in Massive Dental Malpractice Award 
Opinion cites Worths inaccurate diagnoses, untruthful testimony
In what may be the largest dental  malpractice award of its kind (defective crowns and veneers) in
California history, high-profile Newport Beach cosmetic dentist Sherri Worth, D.D.S.,  has been found negligent, and much of her sworn testimony not believable.Judge Geoffrey T. Glass of the Orange County Superior Court ordered that an arbitrators award be confirmed and that judgment be entered against Dr. Worth in the amount of $641,542. The judgment has been satisfied and paid in full by Dr. Worth. The opinion awarding the plaintiff this record judgment cited Worths substandard dentistry and an alarming pattern of prevarication, including inaccurate diagnoses, substandard work, altered record-keeping and specific instances of misleading testimony. The judgment has been reported to the California Dental Board which is now reviewing the matter and has authority to take disciplinary action against Dr. Worths dental license.It is very difficult as a trier of fact to evaluate Defendant Sherri Worths
testimony when so much of it is evasive, nonresponsive and untruthful,
according to the opinion issued by the arbitrator, who further indicated
Worths testimony demonstrated a total lack of candor and was not believable
and was not credible.
Based on testimony by experts and treating dentists, the opinion found Dr. Worth diagnosed dental conditions that were not present and had not performed
certain dental procedures as claimed. Further, the opinion noted substandard
work by Dr. Worth, including crown overpreparation, which led to irreversible
harm to the plaintiff. The opinion also found Dr. Worths record keeping highly suspect, concluding: The office chart is not reliable [and] has been rewritten in substantial part; critical evidence has been lost or destroyed; and the defendant's testimony is not credible.
The opinion further stated Worths defensiveness in the record defies belief.  
The Plaintiff sought Dr. Worth for a consultation related to one chipped upper front tooth and a gummy smile.  Dr. Worth, however, told the Plaintiff that she needed 22 teeth to be treated after misdiagnosing conditions which did not exist and/or require invasive dental treatment. Ultimately, virtually all of Dr. Worths dental treatment required replacement; eight root canals needed to be performed and two gum surgeries were required to repair Dr. Worths substandard dentistry.  The pain endured by the Plaintiff as a result of Dr. Worths negligence care was described in the opinion as hard to imagine.Dr. Worth has been named as a defendant in many other dental malpractice actions alleging negligent dentistry in the Orange County Superior Court. To see a copy of the full 28 page opinion (Valdez et al  v. Sherri Lee Worth, DDS (et al) case # 30-2010-00348533)  go to the on line case access system of the Orange County Superior Court.

										A few months ago I went to Aspen Dental in Bradenton Florida, we have dental insurance and were going for standard cleaning, and x-rays.  After the initial exam the office manager was standing by the dentist ready to take me to his office to give me the bad news.  They proceeded to tell me that first of all I needed a Deep tissue cleaning which was going to cost me out of pocket after insurance $350.00 
Furthermore the x-rays indicated that some dental work I had done earlier was done wrong and would need to be re-done.  After insurance my cost would be around $7,000.00.  And not to worry they could finance the work for us.  I felt like I was in a used car dealership being pounced on to purchase a vehicle that I did not need.
I thanked them but told them I would get a second opinion.  I obtained a copy of my x-rays and took them to another dentist, they did a routine cleaning, when I asked them about a deep cleaning they informed me that this was pretty much a standard practice with many dentist in the USA now and that I did not have gengivitas or other cum problems and they did not see any reason to do that procedure.  
This week my wife went to Aspen Dental and they proceeded to tell her the same thing, that the first thing she needed done was a deep cleaning and would cost about $350.00 after insurance.   They said that is the first thing we should do then see what else needs to be done.  It appears to me that this is just a scam and way to get money out of your pocket.  
I found this article very helpful in analyzing if a deep cleaning was needed.
http://thedentalinsider.com/deep_teeth_cleaning.php
When I called Aspen Dental and told them that we did not have funds to do a deep cleaning and that we would like to have the cleaning that our insurance company covered the office manager proceeded to tell me that they could not that it would be considered malpractice if they did a regular cleaning and not the deep cleaning.  Stay away from Aspen Dental unless you have money to burn.

										After googling ""Dental Planet, LLC Reports"" I saw this site and found that my experience with Dental Planet, LLC was not an isolated event of poor customer service.  Let me start by saying I have never written a negative comment on any internet site for any reason.  I am the owner of a small business who employees 40 plus people.  We have a five-star rating on any site who rates us and we work hard every day to maintain our reputation.  One of our core values is to work every day to achieve exemplary customer service.  When I encounter the appalling customer service that I have received from Dental Planet, LLC over the past six months, I am stunned.  
I initially called Dental Planet, LLC and spoke with several of their very eager sales representatives describing what I was looking for.  They assured me that they would meet my needs and promptly took my order and my money, to the tune of $4008.00.  After not receiving the items I ordered or any reason for any delay in my order, I was told that my order had been misplaced and that they were very sorry.  This is approximately 2-3 months after I paid for my three Pelton-Crane dental lights.  I eventually received the lights, but to my dismay, two of the three lights were badly damaged to the point that they could not be used.  They had been packed very poorly.  The order department told me ""this never happens"" and that ""they would have a company meeting about what had happened to my order so it wouldn't happen again"".  I was promised that I would receive two replacement lights ASAP and after many weeks, I received two more lights.  Guess what?  They were also badly damaged.  After so much time had gone by and so many voice mails had been left with Dental Planet, LLC, I ended up taking apart the damaged lights to use parts from each to get three that would have some function.  When I took them apart, I found bare wires and rusted parts inside.  The only refurbishing they did appeared to be putting a fresh coat of paint and shipping them out to me, the trusting customer.
At this point, I am now in month four of dealing with Dental Planet, LLC and Gordon is now promising to have a local service rep come out and service my lights that have parts falling off them and they are shorting out daily.  Four to six weeks later after multiple promises by Gordon, no independent service rep has contacted me.  
Now comes the best part.  Dental Planet, LLC is billing me for $2,900.00 for the two replacement lights they took so long to send out.  I've paid one of our employees to repackage the lights at their request and waited for the UPS call tags they assured that they were sending for the lights.  
We're in month seven of trying to deal with this company.  At this point, I am going to turn this matter over to our attorney.  Maybe he'll receive more attention than I have.

										After over 8 years of avoiding the dentist it was recommended that I try out Dr. Eric Yaremko, because he specializes in people who have dental anxiety.  Before I scheduled the appointment I made sure to ask if they took my insurance or if there was anything I needed to know.  I was completely assured by their staff that my insurance would go through just fine.  
The initial appointment was a complete waste of my time.  I spent two hours being poked and prodded and they did not even take the time to clean my teeth.  After spending as many years as I have avoiding the dentist, the least they could of done was spend half an hour cleaning my teeth!  They took numerous x-rays without consulting with me regarding costs or referring back to my insurance plan to see what would be covered.  After all of this was complete, the dentist sat me down to discuss my treatment options.  He claimed that I would need braces (otherwise my teeth would fall out by the time I was sixty, despite the fact that I already had braces in middle school), I had multiple cavities, I needed a deep cleaning that would require me to be anesthetized, he made me feel that the appearance of my teeth were only satisfactory (I believe his quote was if youre happy with the way they look then I guess thats good enough), and it was very dire that I get my wisdom teeth (that are not even halfway grown in yet) out IMMEDIATELY.  
If the extensive treatment plan wasnt enough to upset me, then the cost of it all certainly would be!  He quoted me for the minimum at $1,910, which my insurance would allegedly only cover less than half.  If I wanted a valium to take before my fillings it would be $330, if I wanted a series of valium to take it would cost me out of pocket $550.  I have dual coverage under my mothers dental insurance as well, they informed me that her insurance would not apply to my appointment unless I used up all of my yearly allowed amount.  It made me suspicious.  The whole appointment made me angry.  
As I was leaving the receptionist said they would send my insurance the information from my visit and IF there was a bill I would receive it shortly.  To me, that implied that there would not be a very large bill, if any!  
I left shocked and upset.  I had such a horrible experience that I vowed to never go back and got a recommendation from a co-worker for a reputable dentist for an appointment the next afternoon.   The next afternoon I went to the other dentist, again fearing the worst and I was very surprised.  I only had one small surface cavity, I did not need braces, the x-rays that were taken were not adequate and some needed to be redone (at no charge), they offered to write a prescription for valium if I needed (which would be covered my Rx insurance), basically the cost of necessary treatment was 1/6 of Dr. Yaremkos estimateeven before insurance! 
I waited for several weeks to hear back from Dr. Yaremkos office and one day I received a call from my mom saying that she got a statement in the mail.  I was surprised that they billed her insurance because I was informed that they were not going to.  I called Dr. Yaremkos office and asked about my billing and insurance confusion because I had yet to receive a bill, they informed me that their records show that I had zero account balance.  The NEXT day I received a bill directly from Yaremkos office for $130.  My moms bill that she had for me stated I owed the insurance $180.  I was very confused at what could possible cost that much!  
I called the insurance company and was incredibly surprised to find out that Dr. Yaremkos office was not in my dental network.  I also found out that they took more x-rays then my dental plan allows within a 5 year period, leaving me to pay for the extras at cost.  Right away I phoned Yaremkos office.  They seemed surprised when I asked them why they didnt inform me that they were not in my network.  If I had known this I would NOT have gone to them in the first place, hence me asking if I was completely covered with my insurance.  
None of this seems right to me.  I was lied to and I feel like they have some unscrupulous business practices.  In my research I found one other review from a prior patient saying that Dr. Yaremko was very quick to come up with costly and unnecessary treatment options, they reported complications with insurance and also recommended getting a second opinion.  They are billing me for unnecessary x-rays that I had no idea werent covered by insurance!  They are the dentist, they are the professional, I trusted them not to rob me for their own financial gain.  When he was discussing my options I should of realized it was a red flag when he kept mentioning how important it was for his office to receive good reviews, even on the bill it mentions a good review is the best thank you we can receive.  All of that says to me that they are just about the gimmicks and superficially worried about their reputation to a point where they have to tell people to say nice things about them, as if people wouldnt think to do that on their own.  All they need is just for a patient to walk in the door and then the dollar signs start adding up.
UPDATE:  Talked with staff on the phone, again they informed me that several other co-workers of mine go there (and they don't mind that it's out of net work and have to pay 3x as much??) and they said that I signed papers staying that I knew I would have to pay high amounts.  In regard to the extra x-rays, they said that was my responsibility to know exactly how many x-rays I am allotted (and I should of known to say 'no thank you that will be sufficent?).  They took advantage of me and when I asked them about their mistakes they turned it all around and blamed me.  Nice.",  Dental Services

										This company gives the impression of being ""low-priced with easy payments"".  This is not the case!  I went to them to get a single extraction that did not require any more than a couple of twists of the tooth to get it out.  They talked me into signing to have more work done later and also to have a ""partial"" cleaning done during the same visit.  All in all, for the work I had done that day, plus the upcoming work, which included two roots canals, more extensive cleaning, and a couple of caps and/or another possible extraction, the total amount came to just over $2,000, with payments of $217 per month.  It seemed reasonable enough at the time, so I agreed to it.  However, upon leaving the office after the first procedure, I was told that even though I was paid up for what I owed that day, I would be receiving calls for further payment and was told to ""ignore"" them and that I would be billed for the rest.  Within one week I began receiving calls for payment, even though I was current on my payments, and it never ceased.  They called my home at least two or three times a day (and night!) from that point on until I was paid in full, and I continued to receive calls even after that, stating that I still had an ""outstanding balance"".  The amount I ended up paying for the ""non-surgical"" removal of one tooth, which they listed as a ""surgical extraction"", and a ""partial cleaning"" was over $700.  Mind you, this was the ""reduced"" amount, from the amount of $1200 that they originally wanted to charge me.  It took numerous discussions to get the amount lowered.  By the way, on a good note, the gentleman I dealt with on this was exceptional in his handling of my account.  He is the only person I spoke with that tried to help me and did an excellent job.  Meantime, I had gone to the office to ask how they could justify charging me that much for so little work having been done and they gave me nothing but a stupid look, very disrespectful treatment, and no answers other than, ""Sorry, that's what you owe"".  They could NOT justify the amount!  I will NEVER do business with these people again!  On a final note, I would just like to say that the whole ""clinic"" appeared to be more of a ""training ground for students"" than an actual, legitimate dental facility.  I am paid in full, according to the ""settlement agreement"", but my account has not been ""closed"" as of yet and shows money is still owed.  So, now I am just waiting to see if they will honor their word, and close the account, or if I will be looking for an attorney to settle it once and for all.  What a joke this place is!  My mistake was in not doing more investigating before I went to them.  People, please do your homework.  It's worth it! 									",  Dental Services

										I am now being contacted by bill collectors regarding this situation.
I am being billed for close to $400 by a bill collector for services they told me were covered by my insurance company when they verified with them.  HOWEVER the service was not a covered benefit under my plan and if they would have verified my benefits as they told me, we wouldnt have been in the situation.
Now onto the situation
I was receiving services from a Dentist Dr Michael Imboden DDS of smilemckinney.com at 2301 W Eldorado Parkway Suite 500, McKinney, Texas 75070 972-542-3005 (office) 972-542-6776 (fax).
We were informed we would need some additional services.  To be completed at a later date.  When we went to check out of our routine cleaning, the assistant/receptionist told us that they verified with Delta Dental that the procedure was covered and told us we would have to pay the copay at the time of the appointment.
We came back and had the procedure and paid the copay.
Weeks later we received a denial letter from the insurance company that the procedure wasnt covered under our plan.  We called Delta and verified that this is NOT a covered benefit.  We then called the dentist office up and they told me we are responsible for the money if the insurance didnt cover it.  I said, you said you verified the procedure.  They said the procedure is a normally covered benefit and unfortunately since it isnt, I am responsible.  She said they verified we had insurance, not that it was covered.  She said we had to pay.
So we were lied to about them verifying the procedure and now we have to pay.  They claim because we signed a waiver for payment.  So we got taken by a provider that only cares about making money and not doing what they say.  If we knew this was a covered benefit we wouldnt have had or would have figured out other arrangements.

										Dr. Farid Noie's office was exceptionally unprofessional. I made an appointment for an exam and cleaning and spent over 2 hours and 40 minutes in their office, the vast majority of which was waiting needlessly. I spent less than 10 minutes with the dentist himself and during that time he did not examine my x-rays (in front of me). 
He told me that I had something called ""abfraction."" I researched this and it is currently only a THEORY.  He tried to get me to pay $600 for a night guard for my teeth. I can go to a pharmacy and buy a mouth guard for $20! 
To add insult to injury, I had waited an hour to see this guy, and I only got to see him because I got up and walked out to complain to one of the oral hygienists. He is very charming and good at small talk. He is probably very good at what he does, but I don't know because I barely got much interaction with him.
I finally got up and left because I was left in an exam room with no explanation after waiting another 30 minutes. The office manager (I think?) gave me a haughty attitude when I told her that I had been waiting for nearly 3 hours. She said ""Well, an exam is 45 minutes and a cleaning takes an hour.""  According to basic math, that should take not even two hours. Who can explain the other 40 minutes of pointless waiting? Their office didn't even seem busy, and no one had informed me that they were behind, or had an emergency, or any other issue. I was just left without a word in a room to wait for over an hour at one point. 
Staff is unfriendly, dentist seems keen to rip you off, and they make you wait forever. Also, they will charge you $60 to get a copy of your x-ray. First and definitely LAST time I ever go here. I highly recommend you avoid this office.									",  Dental Services

										So I was approached by a guy named Matt at my work recently soliciting Teeth whitening, exam, and cleaning.  First of all, the guy lied about being let into our building. There is a no soliciting sign posted on the front and all visitors are supposed to check in with security.  So I thought he was ok to be there just because he was on my floor. Not the case!  He was a real slick salesman. He told me that he worked at Dr. Radar's office, a dentist in Thousand Oaks.  He was selling a  Teeth Whitening, exam, and cleaning deal  for $59.97. I knew it sounded too good to be true, but stupid me I went for it! I paid him cash too. He gave me a flimsy piece of paper with the info on it and said if I had any questions that I could call him at the dental office. This would turn out to be a lie also. I specifically asked him ""twice"" if there was anything else I had to pay.  He said no. Again total lie straight to my face. As he was leaving my office I told him I was calling his office to make my appointment. He said he could not wait for me because he had some people waiting and took off pretty quick. So I finally got a hold of his office and spoke to a Kerry.  OMG! She was terrible on the phone! I started to ask questions about what I get because I was a bit worried that I got scammed. She was soo rude and just kept saying ""do you want to make your appointment, I can't keep answering all of these questions.  I couldn't believe it. So I just said can you please just verify that I a will not have to pay for anything else as I was told. Here is the good part : Come to find out the cleaning is not included! And I would have to pay up to $800 for a deep cleaning if the doctor said that is what I needed! I told her he lied to me and that I demanded a refund. She told me to talk to Matt! I said what!! He is your employee!! She then said that he does not work for the office and said I need to call the number on the paper he sold me! What the hell! So that's when I started to look into Dr. Radfar online and this Million Dollar Smile Scam. On the back of the paper he gave me it gave a web site to www.smilewizard.com . I called the number and it went straight to a cell phone recording for a Million Dollar Smile company. It was clearly the guy Matt's voice on there.  So I looked into that name and a company Called MEDSCORE LLC out of Simi Valley came up. Dr Radfar obviously has ties to this company also because Dr Radfar was on their site too promoting his company Million Dollar Smile!!  It is a crazy web of different company names and people saying they don't work for each company! Total Scam. Do not buy anything from this Dr. Radfar in Thousand Oaks as it is not what they tell you and you will have to pay over $800 for a cleaning that I can get for $39 at most dental offices. I left multiple messages with Dr. Radfars office to call me back for a refund. To this day I have not received a call back. Every time I call the 805 231 9225 number the scum sales rep Matt left it just goes to voice mail. I have not got a call back from any of these other shell companies either. Good job!

										Do not WASTE you money on their products. Everything about them seems to be cloaked in mystery..... NO physical address available on their website....no return address,  No online reviews available at all EXCEPT for the few that have received a free sample and either blogged about it or made up something nice in return for the freebie. Certainly nothing legitimate.  I received a Groupon discount email and thought I would give it a try, it was then I find there are numerous online coupons always available for 50 to 70% off their so called retail price...I hate that scam by itself...but all things considered, for just over $30.00 shipped you can try it. Seems like a simple idea. Pack some Peroxide gel into a pen with a brush on the end, turn a dial to feed the gel to the tip of the brush and paint it on.  Well first off the pen doesn't work. You have to turn it ten times at least to get the gel to tip, even then it barely comes out, the you paint it on at least one tooth maybe two then turn and turn again and again then wait and wait for it to slowly ooze out to the tip, paint another few teeth and so on and so on. 
 It just doesn't work like it should. And then when you finally finish, set the pen down and five minutes later, there still gel slowly oozing out. It just takes WAY too long for it to make it's way to the brush period. 
 If that weren't bad enough, It is probably only about 3% peroxide gel or at least some of the weakest gel available and after following every instruction and even using a hair dryer on my teeth to be sure it dries on my teeth before I close my mouth..for two weeks.. I see very, very little improvement at all. VERY POOR RESULTS!!I have used Night Effects, White strips, Rembrandt all in years past and every single one did at least twice if not ten times better than this. Even with a 14 day return policy it makes it almost impossible to see if it would actually work within that time period. By the time you even receive it at least three or four days have already passed. At any rate, I find absolutely no redeeming quality in this product at all. After two weeks there has been only the very slightest of whitening. Very POOR results, Very WEAK product. Save your money!!!  The pen was a great idea if only it worked as it should or at least better than it does.  I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a ligitimate whitening product, in fact, if a peroxide gel is all you're after, look online. You'll find ten times the amount, far stronger for the same cost or less and  there are legitimate sites to purchase it from.

										MICHAEL A. WHITE, D.D.S. d/b/a Webster Dental Care, is the VERRY BOTTOM of the barrel and deserve a grade of ""F-"" HE  DESERVES  MY  AWARD  AS THE  2012 WORST ST. LOUIS DENTIST OF THE YEAR AND HAS COST ME OVER $2300, IN MY OPINION BY HIS GROSS NEGLIGENCE, MANIFEST INCOMPETENCE, AND UNETHICAL CONDUCT! I ONLY WISH I HAD KNOWN THAT HE WAS PREVIOUSLY DISCIPLINED BY THE MISSOURI DENTAL BOARD AND ALSO HAS A RECORD OF NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS IN THE ST. LOUIS COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT! THIS IS MY ACCURATE, COMPLETE, AND HONEST REVIEW AND OPINION OF MY 2012 EXPERIENCE WITH DR. MICHAEL A. WHITE, D.D.S., d/b/a WEBSTER DENTAL CARE of Webster Groves, Missouri.  I am a diabetic w/neuropathy (nerve problems) +previous ""standard"" crowns (porcelain bonded on metal), installed decades ago and which have never caused me a problem. Michael A. White, D.D.S., nevertheless, installed a CEREC office-produced porcelain crown with PERMANENT bonding cement on a lower molar, (without EVEN telling me of the alternative-- PORCELAIN BONDED ON METAL---already on the 1/2 crown he was replacing, used on other teeth, and available and produced by competent laboratories.  He never elected to tell me of the overwhelming ADVANTAGES of the porcelain-bonded-on metal crown compared to CEREC!  
WHITE never apparently cared to look in my mouth or view my X-ray or even realize that the 1/2 crown he was replacing was traditional porcelain-bonded-on metal. Then, without telling me of any DISADVANTAGES of his office-produced CEREC, he installed it with PERMANENT CEMENT and THEN caused extreme trauma to the molar by his ""adjustments:"" heavy grinding AND grinding AND grinding on my innocent molar instead of installing it with temporary cement and letting me try it out for several days to see how it fit.  Then, he could have easily removed it and done all of the heavy grinding adjustment necessary outside of my mouth without any trauma to my molar's roots.  
Instead, White just presumably decided to save time--after all, to Dr. White, his time as a dentist is apparently more important to him than practicing what I consider competent and professional dentistry.  He immediately permanently installed it, did repeated heavy grinding, and thus destroyed the viability of the molar's roots by the overwhelming-and-repeated trauma to my tooth.  He mentioned to his dental assistant during my TRAUMATIC ORDEAL:  ""Give me the 'diamond drill because the CEREC is 'so hard!'"" 
AFTER I THEREAFTER ADVISED White personally, confidentially, and privately of my excrutiating pain and after spending $100 for pain medicine, WHITE  INSTRUCTED HIS STAFF--WHICH THEY COMMUNICATED TO ME as I was already leaving hiswaiting room after gathering up my things:  ""DR. WHITE TOLD US TO CALL POLICE IF YOU DON'T LEAVE IMMEDIATELY!"" QUERY: Is this how an allegedly caring professional dentist acts toward his trusting and victimized patient?   
I experienced excrutiating jaw pain--then ~$100 for pain pills+anti-inflammatory drugs--the latter was even contradicted in a patient like me with heart disease, diabetes, a problem with non-steriod anti-inflamatories, and a family stroke history!  The pain continued for weeks.  THE RESULT:  my molar's roots were destroyed and I thereafter had to undergo root canal by an Endodontist at a cost of $1,175. 
I later learned that ""the other"" Webster Dental Care dentist"" will NOT use CEREC with his patients;  HE acts professionally in their best interests and does not seek to recoup any expensive office equipment investment!  Subsequent research also reveals that CEREC crowns, unlike porcelain-bonded-on- metal, do not flex with periodic mouth/jaw changes.  When the CEREC crown won't expand and flex, the result can be excruciating and debilitating jaw pain and misalignment--constant and unremitting!  Also I later learned that CEREC crowns can shatter or fracture when installed on a molar because of the high pressure exerted on molars while chewing.  The CEREC manufacturer will not even guarantee them!   WHITE's guarantee: 5 years"" MAX!   Also, once shattered or fractured, porcelain CEREC, unlike customary long-lasting well-accepted bonded crowns with underlying metal casing, leaves one's tooth vulnerable and exposed!  WHITE never advised me of ANY OF THIS! ""Expediency"" seemed to be the ""order of the day"" for Dr. Michael A. White!
Then my CEREC crown started catching on my inner cheek; a dental expert advised--""YOUR dentist"" ground so much that the crown was ground too low! His advice: the ONLY solution--replace the CEREC crown!  Cost to me, an additional $1,000 MORE!  This, added to the $1,175 for root canal has cost me a TOTAL of $2,175.00!  White promised to mail me, by a certain deadline, a check for $1,175 for ""your root canal cost.""   NO CHECK WAS EVER RECEIVED FROM Dr. Michael A. White, DDS!  His word means absolutely nothing!  If you can't count on Dr. White's word, is there anything about Dr. Michael A. White that one can count on?  
MY HONEST AND WELL-THOUGH-OUT OPINION:  IF YOU WANT TO GO TO THE WORST ST. LOUIS AREA DENTIST available, then DEFINITELY make an appointment with Michael A. White, D.D.S. d/b/a Webster Dental Care of Webster Groves.  Among other things, you can probably count on CEREC without White affording you ANY fair and honest choice because of White's heavy CEREC equipment investment and his desire to recoup his overwhelming costs and desire to maximize his profits at the EXTREME detriment and expense of YOU, his trusting and vulnerable patient!  
Keep in mind, however, WHITE will say anything--whether true or not--his WORD is WORTHLESS!  Based on my experience with him, I think he is a disgrace to the dental profession; I honesty believe that he cannot be trusted anywhere near a patient's mouth!  From me, he gets an F for customer satisfaction, F for politeness, F for competent dentistry, F for honesty, an F for integrity, and an F for ethics!  
Further, Michael A. White has previously been the subject of discipline by the MISSOURI DENTAL BOARD and has had numerous St. Louis County convictions.  It's all in the public record!  I only wish I had known all of this before I made my first appointment with him--before I was beguiled and enticed by his ""introductory"" prices! I guess you get what you pay for!
MICHAEL A. WHITE GETS MY VOTE for THE 2012 AWARD AS THE WORST DENTIST OF THE YEAR IN THE ST. LOUIS AREA! His ""5 year"" CEREC warranty"" became worthless when he told his staff to tell me: (and they did): Dr. White told us to call police if you do not leave IMMEDIATELY!  What had I done to deserve this incredible treatment:  I had only told him politely, confidentailly, and personally how I felt and about the pain I was continuing to suffer! IS THIS HOW A PROFESSIONAL AND COMPETENT DENTIST BEHAVES--APPARNETLY IT IS WITH MICHAEL A. WHITE, D.D.S!
GOOD RIDDANCE, MICHAEL A. WHITE, D.D.S. I'm out almost $2,300; hopefully others will be warned about my sad, unconscionable, outrageous, and painful experience with Dr. Michael A. White, DDS. d/b/a Webster Dental Care.  I'm not going to hold my breath that he will have an epiphany and will reimburse me with a check for just for my out of pocket losses due, $2,300--which has been totally due to his gross negligence, dental incompetentcy, and manifest lack of ethics--that is, until scientists DEFINITELY and IRREFUTABLY determine and confirm that the moon is really made of green cheese!

New Haven, Connecticut United States of America ",C2, 2035003806,"Dr. Henry P. Cohen, DDS  DDS Performs Root Canal that was incongruous to expected outcome. New Haven, Connecticut","
										Based on my research regarding Root Canals my findings are below.  I did this research because I am not convinced that if I go to a professional in the case an Endodontist that he or she is unable to accurately assess the condition.  My thinking is if the outcome of the procedure is a ""saved"" tooth and the world of Denistry has determined that this procedure warrants a special consideration... the study and practice of the basic and clinical sciences including biology of the normal pulp,  for prevention and treatment of diseases and injures of the pulp and associated periradicular conditions.  How Successful Are Root Canals?  According to some studies Root Canals have 95% success rate,
Incisors (front teeth), canines (pointed teeth next to incisors), and 2nd bicuspids (small teeth right in front of the large molars) typically have a single root.  Me - 95% success rate... to the lay person that sounds like a hundred, otherwise its only 95%.Cost of a Root Canal - The cost varies depending on how severe the problem is and the tooth affected. Many dental insurance policies cover endodontic treatment.  A ballpark estimate for the root canal treatment itself (not including a dental restoration following the procedure) performed by a general dentist could range from $350 to $540 for an incisor and $520 to $800 for a molar.Me - if the cost could range to $540 why was I charged $2,500.00 (price does not include the restoration)
When a patient experiences a failed or complicated root canal, she is subjected to additional pain, inconvenience, and cost. According to WebMD, a root canal can cost $350 to $1,200. Patients without dental insurance pay all of that cost out-of-pocket, and additional visits add additional cost. A failed root canal requires the patient to seek follow-up treatment.Me - When I made my rd visit for this tooth (2 to the Specialist and 1 to my dentist for the cap) to my horror!!! she informed me that Dr. Cohen and ""thinned"" out the tooth too much and the tooth could not sustain the cap.  She gave a temporary filling to fill the  gaping hole in my tooth that in less than 2 weeks began to chip away.A Procedure Designed To Repair...
If removal of the tooth is required, the patient incurs the costs of extraction, anesthesia if needed, and cosmetic replacement of the tooth. These costs add up on top of the initial cost of the root canal that has failed.
So in conclusion Dr. Cohen would like me to pay $2,500 for the repair of a tooth that ahhhh eroded away like a canal when the structures that sustain the canal give way... 
I don't smile like I used to smile...I don't laugh out-loud like I used to....I have to do a grin and try to elude real heartfelt laughter...Let's not forget about meeting with clients, friends and family for dinner and if I make the grave mistake of forgetting I must eat with my mouth closed until all the food is gone and (make sure I rinse, swish and repeat) if I want to engage in conversation.  It's always that little piece of food that you can't feel in that gaping hole that just want to jump out and land back on the plate or on someone arm or their shirt...
So I made about 15 attempts to get Dr Cohen on the phone but alas no avail, so I spoke with his colleague and he agreed to at least take off the $250... when i relayed this information to Dr. Cohen's receptionist I received a law suit...",  Dental Services

										From day one of dealing with Cascade Dental I have had nothing but bad experiences. First off, I went in for my new patient exam and ended up sitting around for an hour and 45 min before I asked if I was going to be seen soon.  I was told that they had over booked people for that day and was told to rescedual and go home. When I got my exam by Dr. Kimberly Tustin I was told that she wouldn't fix my problem (a broken crown) until she had fixed other things that she found to be more important (fillings on teeth no where near my crown).After having my fillings done (very very painful 3 hours), one of the teeth she had worked on was in horrid pain for several days. I called and asked for an emergancy visit it see what was going on. When I got there I was told that there was nothing wrong and that I needed to give it time. She hardly even look in my mouth for more then 10 seconds and my ""exam"" was less then 5 min in which Dr. Tustin spent most of her time complaining about stress and other life problems. Later I found out from a different dentist at a different office that the tooth had been cracked when the filling had been done.Not only were my exams terrible, but they also have messed up evey single bill so far and I have even received a rather rude note hand writen on one of my bills saying ""you need to keep your promise"". I have yet to miss a payment and when I called to yet again fix the problem I was brushed off saying they would call me a different time since they were about to close.This was by far the most horrid experiance I have had with any sort of medical/dental office. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone what so ever.

They were small ranging from 3-5 years old. Naturally the office does a ""Pre-Authorization"" on billing so if anything was WRONG we would have OR should have before we entered or left the office. They said nothing as we left nor mentioned anything could be wrong. A few weeks later I recieved a Bill in the mail. I spoke with Janice Vasquez at his office whom assured me it would in fact be taken care of. Months went by I heard nothing I assumed it had been dealt with. After some time I recieved yet ANOTHER BILL, again I called and was assured nothing was wrong! We went in for several more visits (myself included) and nothing was mentioned! About a month ago we were served with a court order to pay $1,700 for a teeth cleaning for a BABY!!!! Mind you we are a family of 7. I called my insurance to find out what was going on they said ""They never sent a denial letter for insurance to Dr. [continued below]....
									
										..... Craig Readings Office nor were ever billed for a teeth cleaning on my child."" I called ""Norma"" His biller and she refused to give me information on the account in order to use as proof for my response to the Law Suit. I am under California State law entitled to any records and billing under My chart. 2 of our 5 children are disabled and One of them was just diagnosed with a Blood disorder similar to ""Hemophilia"" Dr. Readings blood hound attorney took So much money out of our check that we could NOT afford to pay for our 6 year old daughter to see a ""Hematologist specialist"" We are now only able to afford to pay the rent on our house and gas for 2 weeks.

I wanted him to pull my tooth to get the infection to go away or do something to stop the infection. Amoxicillan and/or antibiotics do not stop infections in the mouth.

In accordance with the Ripoff Report VIP Arbitration Rules (the “Rules”), the Arbitrator was asked to decide whether each of the 10 challenged Statements is an opinion or a Statement of fact. If, and only if, the Statement is determined to be a Statement of fact, the Arbitrator will then go further and decide if, by a preponderance of the evidence, the statement is true or not.  Each Statement challenged by the Complainant has been considered, together with any Witness Statements and/or Documents provided by the Complainant for the determination of the truth or falsity of the Statement.  The Author did not, in accordance with the Program Rules, properly submit a response to the Complaint.  In this case, the Arbitrator has only the evidence submitted by the Complainant to consider.  The evidence submitted included: Ripoff Report #887156; 3 sets of tooth x-rays; a thank you letter to the Complainant for the referral; an additional Ripoff Report; an Arbitration Award; and a determination by the Dental Board of California that the Complainant did not violate the Dental Practice Act. The Arbitrator was further asked to decide whether the preponderance of the evidence submitted to establish the identity of the Author of Ripoff Report #887156, shown as “LT.” Complainant essentially believes the Author who posted Ripoff Report #887156 is a competitor and posted the Report in retaliation as retribution for testimony given in a trial.  The Arbitrator found it more likely than not, given all of the evidence in this case, that the Author of Report #887156, was using his/her initials as the Author name for the Report. The Arbitrator determined that certain statements in the challenged Report were false. Therefore, according to the VIP Arbitration Rules, those statements have been redacted. _______________________________________________________________ Sandra J.

										I trusted this dentist, thinking he really wanted to help me, and that the end result would be so gratifying and worth every dollar. After agreeing to his plan, spending over $10,000.000 over the two year period it involved, we finally came down to the very last step of affixing the teeth onto the implants placed into my jawbone, and he says to me, ""sorry, but you need to find another dentist"". When asked why, he simply replied,""because I decided not to complete this, and I no longer am your dentist"". I was astounded and could not believe what I was hearing, nor could I understand why. The advertisement states, 'dental implants from start to finish' and is an outright lie and false advertisement as I so well found out. I left that day with three implanted steel rods surgically placed into my jaw, and no teeth to cover them. I was completely horrified and could not believe this could happen. I finally found a dentist that had made a special made denture that fits over the implants, costing me $8,000.000 in itself. Otherwise, to complete the implants would cost me $18,000.00, which I could not afford. So this whole procedure with the two needed surgeries and two year healing periods was all for nothing and a complete waste of money as the
implants are there for no reason whatsoever. I also had suffered nerve damage after one surgery, leaving my bottom lip always numb. I had spoke to various lawyers, but the majority would only deal with such a case if there was a death involved. The one lawyer who stated he would take the case held onto my x-rays and file for a long time, without accomplishing anything, until the statue of limitations finally ran out.Upon finding a new dentist, turns out Dr. Gagne would repeatedly call him wanting to discuss my case and get his opinion, so I believe that he did not follow through because he was unsure of what to do.  All I know is he never offered me any refund, and left me in a horrible state of mind. I can not believe that someone can honestly do this to another, and get away with it. All of my savings went to him, as well as all the time needed, all for nothing. I truly hope this does not happen to another, and I can honestly state you can not believe anything that you read. His advertisement is completely untrue.Though he does offer greatly reduced prices, you pay for the incompleted work tenfold.

										Where to start - how about the over hour wait for my appointment with no reason as to why and then when asked why and when I would get in - I was told just a few more minutes. At this point, I called my husband who had an appointment after mine, and said come down, I am giving you my appointment so we are not here all day. So, my 10 am appointment for a routine cleaning became his appointment for the same thing and he was called in at 11:20 - this in essence my appointment was almost an hour and a half late. I am sitting there waiting for my husband thinking he is getting his x-rays and cleaning when I get a text from him saying only 15 min more and I get to see the dentist. Silly me - I am thinking his x-rays and cleaning are done. He finally comes out over an hour later (mind you it would only be 15 min to see the dentist) and tells me that he has to come back next week for the cleaning. What?? He sat there for over an hour just to get x-ray's. Then when told he'd see the dentist in 15 min it was over 45 min. So, my husband was in their chair for over two hours and all he had done was x-rays and about 20 min with the dentist trying to tell him he needed a crown replaced (that did not need replacing), and that he had two cavities that the dentist never did show him on the x-ray. Mind you when he was at the dentist (his original before we moved to Arizona) everything was fine. At this point neither of us are happy - I rescheduled my ""cleaning"" for the very first appointment on a Sat. so we would not have to wait an hour and a half again for an appointment. I was not happy at all with the service and asked for the office manager to call me Monday morning. I was told no problem. On Tues. afternoon I called and was told oh she is not here today and has left for CA for a corporate meeting - never did tell me why she did not call me on Monday. I then proceed to call the corporate officee to voice my concerns. They tell me that they have had complaints because of the wait times and lack of communication with patients and she was not surprised. She in turned called the Glendale, AZ office and told them that they were to make sure that both my husband and I were in and out on time for our appointments and all that was to be done was a cleaning. So - here we are - my husband has an appointment today (Sat.) to do his cleaning. He gets a message telling him that he has to come in early to do a ""service-plan"" and his cleaning would cost him $180 because they only do deep cleanings and his insurance does not pay for deep cleanings and he has to agree to pay for additional services. I call them back and ask to talk to the office manager (she left the mess). I explain that I am not happy, we are not paying $180, and there will be no ""service plan"" - I get hung up because I am told that I am not talking nice. Really - I call back - I tell the person on the phone that I want to speak to the office manager again - she tells me that the office manager wants me to come in and discuss this with her. I tell the receptionist that I am sorry if I sound angry with you it is not your fault but you do not want me in your office right now as your patients probably do not want to hear what I have to say.Imagine my surprise when the office manager gets on the phone and tells me that I just threatened her employee, mumbles something and hangs up on me. Also, keep in mind not only did I tell them but, corporate told them that they needed to call me not my husband as he is very hard to reach and I can get ahold of him and have him call them if necessary - and they keep calling him not me and he cannot return calls or answer his phone while he is working. In addition - their reception area is awful, dirty, (my husband likens it to a free clinic in a third world country) and not very inviting.Believe me when I say that corporate is getting a call first thing Monday which will probably do no good, and I am posting this everywhere I can - it joins the other 30+ or so bad reviews that I have read about Western Dental.

They are misleading the public.First let me state that I am a dental professional who takes great pride in the care of my patients.  Several years ago I noticed that I was receiving excellent reviews from patients on a web site known as Dr.oogle.com .    I thought this was great as I knew that I was providing excellent patient care and why not let the world know it.   Well the positive reviews started pouring in and after several months had I had 6 glowing reports from my patients on their web site.The email response then attempted to extort money from me declaring that if I did not pay up they would remove my listing.   I said that was fine as I felt my practice did not actually need their recommendation as I had plenty of great reviews on Yelp....(which is  a great legitimate site).It gets worse, instead of simply unlisting me, they listed me as expired leading people to believe that I no longer practiced.  Even worse, they removed all 6 favorable 5 star reviews and posted a single 3 star review from an anonymous source, with no actual review..just a 3 star listing.So the bottom line is that because I refused to pay them any money they decided to slander my online reputation in a very sneaky fashion.   The Doctors that are listed are paying money to keep Dr. Oogle at bay.is that because I refused to pay them any money they decided to slander my online reputation in a very sneaky fashion.   The Doctors that are listed are paying money to keep Dr. Oogle at bay.Yelp is a far more accurate assesment of your doctors ability.  It is unbiased, they screen their reviewers to ensure that they are real people, and while they would  like advertising dollars, they do not threaten with removal of all positive reviews. I encourage anyone with any similar negative experiences with Dr. Oogle to post them on a blog or for free on Weebly.									",  Dental Services

										This dentist really ripped off my family and me.  We started going to Dr. Ray because he is conveniently located near our home. Anytime we visited, his associates would recommend needless x-rays and dental services.  Luckily, my family and I always got a second opinion before agreeing to Dr. Ray and Associates suggestions.  Finally, I moved my family to another dentist.
Over a year later, I received a court summons from Dr. Rays lawyer demanding payment for an outstanding bill within five days or else.  I immediately wrote back to Dr. Rays office and his lawyer explaining that my family and I have no outstanding bill with them as my insurance company covers 100% of the routine cleanings we had done at his office.  In the letter, I asked for a detailed bill explaining what fees Dr. Ray was claiming in his lawsuit.  His office has refuse to respond to my letters and his lawyer will only provide dates my family and I visited Dr. Ray's office with the words Services Provided next to each date.  I sent a copy of the papers Dr. Rays lawyer provided me to my insurance company.  My insurance company refuses to pay stating that Dr. Ray must specify what services were provided.  
To date, Dr. Ray has refused to provide any explanation of the charges but Dr. Ray and his lawyer are harassing my family and me with countless copies of the same court summons.  I warn everyone to stay away from this dentist and if there are any lawyers who can help with this case, please contact me.",  Dental Services

Oh yeah, and I found out from my insurance company that All Smile billed me at a rate ABOVE the contracted rate (a no-no) and tacked on finance charges on a bill that was never presented to me prior.  Needless to say, I will be picking up my dental charts ASAP and going to a dental practice with ethics.  I also filed a complaint with my insurance company against All Smile, and I recommend that others do the same									",  Dental Services

										Community Smiles, referred to by Jackson Memorial Hospital dental clinic.  Trying to make contact with this office for two weeks before someone picks up the phone.  As some rude employee answers the phone, and I let them know that I was trying to make contact for two weeks, as my tooth is decaying, she tells me, I have to get a referral, and I respond, but I've been referred to you by Jackson Memorial Hospital dental clinic.  And still detect an attitude, no one at Jackson Memorial  Hospital dental clinic, after being there for 5 1/2 hours, no one gave me any kind of referral sheet they just gave me a list of a few clinics addresses and phone numbers, that were not even in service anymore. keep in mind this is a hospital, that's always bragging of how great an advanced their health care system is.  It's the blind leading the blind.  No wonder hospitals kill about 400,000 people a year no joke. [continued below]....
									
										.....  Finally decided to use another route.  And contacted the administration.  I finally got someone that was professional and kind. 
Her name was Elizabeth, she immediately took action and went downstairs, and let their dysfunctional staff, know that I had been calling for two weeks to book an appointment. They called me right back, I couldn't believe it, the same rude woman that had answered the phone. finally she gave me an appointment, for within 48 hours. so I asked her what about the referral, oh you don't need one.  For goodness sake these are patients.  This system is so disorganized, that they tell their patients, that they have to ride across town to book an appointment in person, something that could be done simply over the phone.  Keeping in mind, that these are patients who are of low income, mostly who don't have a car, war veterans, elderly, mothers with kids, patients who have to take three buses, just to get their to book an appointment, is that lack of consideration for a patient or what.  After waiting weeks or months, while you're teeth are decaying.  Finally I take three buses to get to my appointment. 
You come in, the window between the office and the patience is closed.  So the staff can ignore their patience.  They make you sign in and have a seat.  Then they call you up, so you can pay them, and they ask you if you sign a waiver.  No I've never been here before. no one told me to sign a waiver,  So another rude office woman tells me, well now you know sign the waiver.  Great communication skills.  Then you're signing a waiver, get this, that states that you're not paying them.  So much for our great county corrupt systems.  And if you go to their website it states, that this is a taxpayers dental clinic, yeah right, more abuse in our system, their nonprofit organization, they get grants from the government, that takes our money, they charge you, and they make you sign a waiver, that states that you're not paying them. Then as you're waiting for your appointment, there is this huge dirty fan, pointed right at the patience, some lady walks in, and turns it on.  I get up and move.  You have this dirty fan blowing right at the patient's face.  Keep in mind this is a healthcare facility, so that's what they want you to believe.  As I walk into the facility the students are actually pretty friendly.  Keep in mind the no experience shines through here.  This is a medical facility for learning.  I've been dealing with the medical field for close to 40 years.  I question everything, and I observed everything, sitting in the dental chair, noticing that the dentist that is going to take care of me, is mixing solutions with no gloves. 
Then they take about 50 x-rays.  By this time I'm feeling radioactive. Then the dentist approaches me, and starts the consultation.  I had to tell him to put on his face mask,  he was breathing on me.  I proceed to tell them, that i was referred by Jackson Hospital dental clinic for a root  canal, I went for one root canal after being diagnosed by Jackson Memorial Hospital dental clinic, now they tell me I need 4 root canals.  That's it,   they book another appointment for about six weeks later, now I am at  eight weeks to start the work, since the process began with Jackson Hospital. 
Now I understand there's a lot of patience here that need help.  But is there any clarity here.  How can a system that works so incompetently actually help someone.  Next step, first you wait two months or more to get into Jackson Memorial dental clinic.  Then you wait two weeks for someone to answer the phone at community smiles,  Then they book you again six weeks later.  Major tooth decay going on here. that's two months or more waiting for Jackson's systems, two weeks to answer a phone, that's 2 1/2 months, six weeks to book you again, do the numbers, and the day before that actual appointment, they call you with no notice and tell you they're canceling the appointment.  They call me back two days later, too asked me why I canceled the appointment.  When I explain myself, and have the voice mail on my phone and tell the office manager by the name of Marissa, that they had called and canceled the appointment at last moment, she just responds with an attitude, and doesn't even listen to the voice mail.  And after it was their incompetence they booked me for like two months later, like it was my fault.  there is absolutely no patient care or responsibility there.  Then I come back,  and they have some kind of emergency, and after I sat there for over two hours, and no one told me anything.  All they did was ignore me.  They canceled the appointment again.  Time to take action.  I contact the district office for the county, and asked for the chief of staff, Esther abolila and explain to her my frustrating situation, she actually tried to be nice. but her response was predictable, for county workers milking the tax payers. get this, you know if i tell them anything there going to deny it. can you believe this..... so much for the taxpayers dollars.  So many people out there looking for work, and al these dysfunctional incompetent county workers acting like victims, at the suffering of patience who pay for their salaries.  That's how stupid these people are.  Go into any business in the private sector of America. 
Business owners protect their businesses.  And under no circumstances do they fall into the ill behavior of their employees no no, they standby  for the people who pay them, their customers their patients.  These are people and patience who are in need of medical healthcare. and they're not doing this for free, all these patients are guinea pigs for their facilities, and there inexperienced staff, the only one that suffers here is the patients. 
Trying to get to the next step, by this time more frustration is setting in.  i go back for the next appointment finally they start the root canal, no one wants to speak any English in this facility, they don't know that I can understand what they're saying, I'm listening to the doctor or so-called doctor, telling someone that's assisting him, that he's never done this before, its getting scary by now, and their inexperience  is shining through. I can hear the so-called doctor telling the person that's assisting him, that why is there so much blood, plus he had to give me more anesthesia, because it was hurting and he didn't give me enough the first time.  Keep in mind this is a learning school, and you're the guinea pig. by the time hes getting to the end of the procedure he's asking the person that's assisting him, the stuff that's in the tooth he's working on what to do with it,  The assistant told him, oh just leave it in there. Every time they do something or any type of procedure.  They have to call the head doctor, so he can check and see if it was done wrong.  Finally finished the procedure, over three hours later.  then i had to return a week and half later as an emergency because the filling they had  put in, fell out.
the so-called doctor that had done the work was not available at the time.  He came by to see what had happened, and actually try to be nice about it.  Keep in mind these people refuse to speak in English, and they don't understand that I can understand what they're saying.  The doctor that had done the procedure, told the doctor that was seeing me not to charge me because of what had happened.  And get this.  This female dentist is discussing with the doctor that had done my procedure, that yes, we need to charge him again.  By this time the office manager named Marissa, walked over with her personality disorder.  And I'm telling her this place is incompetent, and instead of being a professional, and being on the patient's side or the customer side. and simply saying sir Im sorry for the inconvenience will take care of this problem for you, She decides it's more important to give me a bad attitude, and give me 360 shift.  And make it sound like it was my fault for their incompetence. furthermore they tell me they cant do anything that day, we'll need to book another appointment for another day. so they book another appointment, and after all my time and money that they have wasted, they don't even go out of there way to give me an earlier appointment, when i already had appointments before other patients.  And guess what, the day before the appointment is arriving, they call me with no notice and canceled the appointment again.  This place sucks.  Their office staff is irrational, biochemically imbalanced, show no courtesy, or respect for their patience, and they just really don't give a d*mn.  So I just go back as an emergency on another date understanding that my condition that Ive had almost all my life accelerates everything and worrying about losing my teeth, I approached the office window and let them know that I need to see a dentist, they tell me that they cant see me that day, but to have a seat, I wait for over two hours, finally out of frustration I get up and asked them, whats going on with my appointment.  Oh we can see today the dentists is not available.  Can you believe these people, after sitting there for over two hours, taking three buses to get their.  They couldve had the courtesy to let me know that they couldnt help me.  The office manager Marissa attacks me with an attitude like its my fault for their incompetence.  That show contact me in the afternoon to book an appointment for me. 
Well she never called.  So I contacted again the Miami-Dade County District 11, Chief of Staff  Esther abolila, and explained to her again, the ill behavior of the office staff. She told me the first time I spoke to her about maybe trying another clinic.  After all the time that these people had wasted for me and money.  Youd have to go on another waiting list, and drive the Fort Lauderdale to get this work done.  When it should be done here because I live in Miami-Dade County.  And that she would file a complaint with Jackson Memorial Hospital, and that she would get back to me.  She never called back.  No satisfaction anywhere in this county system.  Never heard from her again.  By this time theyve wasted a lot of my time and money, and is not cheap, keep in mind youre the guinea pig, theyre practicing on you, and charging you hundreds of dollars for incompetent work. I decided that why should I be inconvenienced, I really had lost a lot of time and money, and I was not driving to Fort Lauderdale and going again on a waiting list to see whats happening here.  So I saw the dentist one more time again, now he tells me that were he did the root canal, there was an infection.  He calls over some specialists and tells me they have to open the gums and see whats happening.  No for the next appointment it wont be for almost 2 months, more wasted time how wonderful.  This started back in August, and now we are getting into the holidays, and the work is still not done.  This place sucks.  Well to make a very long story short.  I needed some clarity here, so I go back to my old dentist who I had been seeing for over 15 years, and unfortunately due to unemployment I had to go deal with this incompetent staff of community smiles. Well my past dentist,  does a full diagnose of my mouth.  And tells me that I may lose that tooth, and what they had told me about three other root canals was crazy.  That he would bring in 10 colleagues into his office and he was sure that they would tell me the same thing.  And opening up my gums were the infection was could lead to major problems, and would not solve the problem. And the root canal that they had done, was done so poorly that they had punctured my gums, he asked me who are these people Ive never seen anything like this before.  Remember I mentioned that the dentist asked the assistant that was helping him why there was so much blood when he was doing the procedure, will now you know incompetence.  And this dentist has been professionally practicing for close to 30 years.  My dentist felt so sorry for me knowing that I have a condition that could cause even more problems, that he told me whatever theyre charging you Ill do it for the same price. And this dentist is not cheap.  Man that sounded so good, almost a year later after starting this venture, hundreds of dollars later, tons of time wasted, being treated with no courtesy, kindness, respect, or responsibility. and having to pay my dentist again to fix the problems they incurred and all the pain they inflicted. Im still fighting to save that tooth, and I believe my dentist will save it.  And everything else is going well, you always need to get more than one opinion get several opinions, questioned everything, remember I mentioned that Ive been dealing with the medical field for close to 40 years. 
I have a Masters degree in exercise science and health and fitness, I constantly do health nutritional, and biochemical and diabetes research, the medical field and medically prescribed drugs kill close to 800,000 people a year in this country alone.  Hospitals kill due to negligence about 400,000 people a year.  And nobody does anything about it. They dont even guarantee their work.  A license to steal  But some low income person steals some food to feed their family and they stick them in jail for five years.  This country is starving for integrity.  Question everything.  And everybody.  To your great health.  The Master blaster.",  Dental Services

										These people are the ambulance chasers of dentistry in PSL, AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS!! They will not follow proper billing procedures and especially if you have insurance they will nickel and dime you for every penny they can possibly get. For instance I saw them in March and today received a bill for $12.00 for the difference between their retail stock rates and the rates they agreed to accept by accepting United Healthcare insurance, so in essence they will get their full retail rate, no matter what insurance company you have, and folks that is not ethical. Also anyone who walks in their for a dental cleaning needs to have a mouth debridement instead of a cleaning, their way of getting extra money. I will be reporting them to the medical board for pushing debridement instead of cleanings, ethics board for obvious reasons, and the state of Florida for not following their agreed upon terms with United Healthcare, FAIL! If you are familiar with the medical field when a medical provider agrees to accept certain insurance they agree to accept that insurance companies payout and not bill the patient for the additional money they are out by accepting said insurance company. [continued below]....
									
										..... In recent times specifically in the south east of the USA dentists are tired of accepting payouts for dental cleanings, what they then do is inform an unusually large percentage of patients that they are ineligible for dental cleanings but that they need to receive what they call a mouth debridement, google it, the reason for this is the payout is larger for the company providing the debridement, versus the very small payout for basic cleaning. My debridement at this place was the same as a cleaning in the North East section of America, only difference $200.00 out of my pocket versus my insurance pays for it. Also, I had to go in three separate times for this cleaning, and each time I was billed, or my insurance was billed, What a crazy way to operate.  I was ok paying these people off, but then to receive a bill for my follow-up 60 days later with a notice that says 60 days late for $12.00 is insane. I thought I was going to a nice little mom and pop dentist office but instead a nightmare. They had virtually no web presence no review no nothing prior to this, so this is to help anybody in Port Saint Lucie considering these clowns, go somewhere else, and if you have cleanings done every 6 months like I have had for my life and the dentist mentions debridement RUN dont walk to the next dentist office. 									",  Dental Services

										I will begin this long-winded complaint by saying I was in excruciating pain for hours upon hours before this began. I had a molar whose nerve had been exposed and I was in paralyzing pain forcing me to leave work. I thouhgt I could wait until the next day to go to my normal dentist. I was wrong. So I began looking for dental offices that were open on Sunday. I found Immediadent. I live in Dayton, Ohio and they had a location on Miller Lane, miles from my house. I went there, walked in to see a receptionist on the phone. She noticed I was in agonizing pain and motioned for me to hold on. When she got off the phone she went on to explain that there were no dentists in the office to day that i would have to go to the Miamisburg location. I thought...dentist office, no dentist, only ones open on Sunday, I'm dying, ok whatever I will go to that one. I arrive around 7 PM to see 6 or so people waiting, a few of them had body language insinuating they had been waiting for quite some time. I approach the receptionist, who was actually the only nice, respectable, professional person there. She hands me a bookof paperwork to fill out, and I hurriedly filled it out. I wasn't called back until around 8.The assistant took me to a chair, told me to sit down, asked me what was wrong, etc. I told her the story, and she could see I was in terrible pain. She typed some stuff into computer and walked away. The dentist comes in a few minutes later, asks me whats wrong...(waste of time, why not ask the assistant, that's why she gets paid, right?) I tell him. He, seeing my level of pain, asks me what tooth, I tell him the exact tooth. He pokes on it to see if I grimace in pain to make sure it was that tooth, as if I lied to him. Then, takes a piece of ice and touches it to make sure it was sensitive to cold, as I had told him already. Pain. Great PAIN. He walks away.Minutes pass, my pain increases because it's been aggravated. I hear 2 women in the back talking about the ""Sunday phenomenon"" she will see each week. One can only assume she was referring to the people coming in before close to get work done. Very unprofessional. Very rude. The assistant comes back in to tell me the xrays the dentist wants will cost $217. I said ""I don't care, let's get this done"" as I was in a GREAT deal of pain. She takes 2 xrays from the chair, then instructs me to take my piercings out, which I did and takes me to the panoramic machine to get a panoramic view (I never once said anything about pain anywhere else, and the dentist never looked at the pan. view, it cost $110). All the xrays were then put on the computer screen in front of me. The only one investigated was the side view taken form the chair (that cost $29). Again the assistant and dentist leave the room. They both return to say that ""Tomorrow we can either do a root canal or an extraction the details can be worked out at the front desk"".    What?! I exclaimed about how I basically sat in pain, and wasted 2 hours (it was now 10 til' close. they close at 9), to be told what I ALREADY KNEW AND HAD TOLD THEM! I said ""When she came in to tell me about the price, I would've walked out had I known there would be no relief, I don't feel I should be forced to pay for anything!"" The dentist started asking what days I would be available etc I said that I live 15 miles away and only came to this one becasue of the day, and other location had no dentists... blah blah. He then offers to numb my mouth for my inconvenience. Of course I was going to take that as I was dying from pain. When I told him I cannot live like this until hes ready to take it out, he said ""we will give you medication until.."" ""I dont want drugs, I want the problem solved"". I could see my efforts were in vain, I said I will take their estimates for service not yet rendered and went to desk to pay. The nice receptionist actrually gave me 10% off (I know right? ten whopping percent...but it was something.) so my total came down to $194.40... 194.40 to sit, in pain in a dental farm, have radiation shot into me, waste my time only to be told we cant help you right now.I will definitely not ever go to that place again. I will go to my dentist in the morning. Probably have to purchase new xrays (although a much more fair price I'm sure), and have to pay another $200 to pull the tooth. Which is what I should've done in the first place, but the pain was too great...still is. No one should ever go to this place again. In fact, if I can sue for my money back I would love to know how (if I can sue anyone except the nice receptionist, I would like to know how.). This place is a criminal organization and manipulates patients into paying for things they dont necessarily need. I hope it gets shut down.   Oh, by the way...the estimate for the root canal.....$2,281. I think not.									",  Dental Services

										In November 2002, my wife, our 8-year-old son and I went to Coast Dental in Tarpon Springs because of our new insurance (we had just moved there within the year). My wife and I were diagnosed with ""periodontitis,"" or periodontal disease, and our son with two cavities. We were each given a detailed plan of treatment which was going to be extremely costly. We were also told we would need to purchase three ""Rota-dent"" battery-operated toothbrushes (also quite expensive, about $140 each). We had gone in seeking a routine cleaning and exam. We were told that they could not, by Florida law, clean our teeth until we had the required treatments performed. We left in shock, wondering how our teeth and gums had become so bad in a few months' time. A couple of months later, we moved back to our native Michigan. We scheduled appointments with our dentist right away. After examining our teeth, he informed us that we had no periodontal disease, that our son had no cavities (and 9 years later, still has never had one). So the bottom line is, the dentist and staff at Coast Dental had lied to us about everything. I wish now we had filed a complaint with the state Attorney General. I was just reminded of the experience last night when I found my ""patient care"" folder from these people. It would appear that the dentist we saw on our visit (Dr. Sofer) is no longer at this facility, and the Tarpon Springs office has moved to a new location.									",  Dental Services

										My daughter saw Dr. Ted Ritota on 4/17/12 for an abscessed tooth. She was in an extreme amount of pain and her dentist could not see her for another week. She has Metlife Dental insurance and Dr. Ritota is listed as a network dentist with Metlife (the only reason that we called him). Per Metlife - dentists are only permitted to charge the Preferred Dentist Provide fee, but he told her that day that she needed to pay $350 and they would refund her the difference after they got the EOB from Metlife. Because she was in severe pain, she paid him $350, hoping the money would be returned by the end of the week. It was not refunded by the end of the week, and she could not pay her. All of this was explained to the dentist but he did NOT care about her financial plight. 
The EOB was completed by Metlife and the amount of money paid to the dentist was $198. The EOB states that the patient responsibility is $68.40, meaning that the dentist owes my daughter $281.60. 
He refuses to give her a refund because he ""helped her"" and ""he told her that $350 was the fee"". This is a breach of his contract with Metlife and we would have NEVER picked him if it were not for his contract with Metlife. He is willing to give her the amount that the insurance paid him ($198), but when she protested that it was not what he owed her, he refused to give her the money because she had a bad attitude. 
I tried to speak to him calmly, but he got quite rude and irate with me. He insisted I take the $198 as that was the ""only way to resolve this"". When I stated that there were two ways of resolving this (Give us the refund of $281.60 that we or owed, or we file a complaint/suit against him) he refused again to give her the refund she is owed, thereby forcing us to file the complaint with Metlife and potentially a suit in small claims court.

										After going to this practice for five years, I'm changing dentists. Over the last two years Dr. Henley has spent less and less time with patients. One time I was billed for an exam with the dentist, but he literally just popped his head in on his way home, asked if everything is going ok, waved, and left. He definitely did not do an exam. I've also had billing issues where their office has billed my insurance comany for Xrays that were not done and a cavity that had not yet been filled.We got it straightened out, but we've had this happen at least three times in five years. More recently the office has become extremely aggressive on collecting payments. I have been told over and over that we could pay our portion and let the insurance company pay theirs. Over the last two years they have been sending bills constantly for the insurance portion. Even after I paid part of the insurance portion, they still kept coming. [continued below]....
									
										..... When I called in, they said it was fine to wait for the insurance to pay, but the bills kept coming anyway. Over the last six months they have gotten nasty with the bills signed very ostentatiously by &#34;Mrs. Henley,&#34; but addressing me by my first name. There is highlighting and underlining all over it. I know my insurance company pays slowly (state employee), but this practice needs to be upfront about their requirements. If they tell me in person that the insurance portion can be left for the insurance to pay, then they need to stick wtih that. Clearly the practice is falling on hard times, though, because they are becoming extremely aggressive -- over $50! And even downright rude. The most recent billing statement came with more highlighting and a note saying &#34;Insurance has already paid. This is YOUR portion. Pay now! ~ Mrs. Henley.&#34; They received the last check from my insurance company literally the following day, and now they owe me a refund for the amount I paid that covered part of the insurance amount. So not only are they aggressive, they don't take the time to find out if they are right or not. They pretty much accuse you or ripping them off, which is a quick way to lose customers who actually do pay on time and follow their stated office policies. Overall, our experience began as pretty positive. But the service has declined over the last couple of years while their accounting has become aggressive. Their main accounts person has always been very nice, but with the wife now involved (probably a sign of a problem in the practice), they have become aggressive and rude. Now that our insurance has paid up, we're switching to a new dentist. Pay it forward and spread the word about nasty people like this. They have ripped people off time and time again they need to be investigated by the state. 									",  Dental Services

										The first time that I stepped into Immediadent was last week, April 21, 2012, and I had an appointment at 1 PM. I got there a little late due to getting a bit turned around to where I needed to go. When I got there, the lobby was filled with people and, apparently, they had been there for hours. I filled out all the paper work and gave it back to them. They told me to sit down and wait. I was never seen for the 4 hours that I sat there patiently waiting, even though there is a sign that says that you shouldnt have to wait for more than 30 minutes. I was sitting next to a mother with her son who had been there for 5 hours and he had his wisdom teeth coming in and he was bawling his eyes out. They told him it would be 30 minutes. Anyway, as we were waiting, I noticed that they were only allowing others to get in first, such as an African American male walked in, holding an ice pack on his mouth and he just walked right in and got to see the dentist right away. The receptionist working that day was also African American, and she did this for other people. The only people who were in the lobby were Caucasian. Im not racist, but it seemed to me that the people working in this office were on this day. So, since I didnt get to be seen, I had to reschedule for an appointment today at 9 AM, which is when they open.
Today, April, 28, 2012, I get there 10 minutes before my scheduled appointment. I wait almost 30 minutes for the dentist to get there. He was not there when the other client and I first came in. I had to ask what was going on and complain to them that I waited 4 hours the week before and I had an appointment. Once they got me in, they asked why I was there. I told them that I needed my teeth cleaned and that I wanted to be checked for gum disease because it runs in my family. The dental assistant looked at my teeth and took the x-rays. The dentist came in and looked at my x-rays to see what all needed to be done. He asked me why I was here, and I had to repeat what I told her. (You would think that he would have listened to her.) Anyway, he then looked at my teeth and proceeded to tell me that I needed a crown and have 3 cavities. I also need all 4 quads scaling and root planning, which is not covered on my insurance and will have to pay this out of my pocket. He told me that it was a preventative deep cleansing or something like this, and this cost $1100. He didnt bother to even clean my teeth. It seemed to me that all they wanted was the money up front to do this procedure. This does NOT even include the 3 cavities and the crown, which costs $499. I wanted my teeth cleaned, but they didnt even offer me that service. This was a waste of my time and theirs. I think that they should have honored my teeth to be cleaned at least, but the dentist just looked at me like I was the stupid one. The employees, including the dentist, are so rude and unprofessional. The only thing that they did was recommend me to another place where I could go to get this cleansing done (this does not include the crown and other things) because their services are more affordable. 
This place should be shut down. If they are not going to offer even the basic of dental work to be done, why are they even opened to help people? They also tell people over the phone that the wait is only 30 minutes when most people end up waiting almost 5 hours to be seen and sometimes are there the whole day. They close at 9 PM. Their services and professionalism are awful, as well as inconvenient as they make you wait so long. Also, last week when I waited the 4 hours to NEVER be seen, my mother was watching my kids for me and she had things to do. I thought that I would be in and out of there, but I wasnt. She was really upset that they inconvenienced her, me and my children.

When I complained to the dental assistant Cyndi (no last name on her business card) about the poor quality of the work the dental assistant called me a trouble maker.She smashed my teeth and pushed a sharp object into the wound left from a tooth extraction. 
I asked the office manager, Michelle Herring,  for the name of the dental assistant who had abused me and the office manager gave me the name of another dental assistant who worked in the office. I filed a police report and began to file a complaint with the State Health Department using the wrong name.
At my last appointment I realized the business manager had lied to me and I was very angry. I asked to meet with the Dentist Dr Perkins and Michelle Herring. At this meeting Ms Herring denied giving me the wrong name. Ms Herring then said we are going to give you a full refund. Dr Perkins was in agreement for the full refund. Ms Herring then asked me to leave.
Latter that afternoon I tried to get some clarity on the refund. Ms Herring was always busy. After the third
call the receptionist told me if I called anymore they would charge me with harrassment.
I went to Coast Dental because they were an in network provider for my insurance. I told them I want only whats covered on my insurance. When I got the charges back from my insurance company the patient responsibility was for 1961. Coast Dental had charged me 4272. The insurance company said I should request a refund. 
Ms Herring had billed the insurance company for a porcelaine bridge but she said I got the cosmetic bridge
which they will not pay for. Ms Herring had submitted a false bill to the insurance company. They went against my wishes to use only goods and services provided for in my insurance.
Dr Perkins rushed through the procedures and spent very little time explaining my options and went against my wishes to be treated on the contract. At the appointment to repair the temporary that I was abused Dr Perkins was suppose to adjust my bite. I never saw Dr Perkins and Cyndi never asked if I had premedicated for my joint replacement.

Surfside, Internet","
										Hello I am a dentist who marketed with WebMarketingForDentists.com for over 7 months (also known as 100marketers.com, wm4d.com). I did receive leads from this company, but the efficiency and how they manage my budget is questionable. With promises for months (actually the day I started with them) I have yet to see a proper report of my website hosted by them. I cannot be happy if I am unable to see how efficiently they are working or how my money is spent, conversions, traffic flow, keywords, seo value and much more. I invest thousands every month to an Adwords budget, and although I get a few leads, it always seems that WM4D is trying to take credit for more leads than they actually sent my way.
Another big concern of mine is that I have seen other Dentists sites in my area and in other regions across the United States sharing the same content on my site, as well as graphics, theme, templates, exactly identical. [continued below]....
									
										..... I surely didn't pay a couple thousand dollars for a site to be exactly like every one of their clients. I have listed all the sites I have found hosted by them that look exactly alike (see below)
It was brought to my attention by a leak in the company, that they use a free CMS: wordpress.org and all their sites are clones one one big unorganized multisite. One of these wordpress sites cost under $300, so I don't understand why I was charged over $3000 for the initial setup of a site that looks like everyone else's. it just seems like I was given a template for thousands, how naive was I?
I have personally seen communication from within the company stating that 80% is good enough and that Dentists won't tell the difference, and that clients are not priority unless they spend a certain amount or have a certain amount of offices with WM4D. This is ridiculous. I am furious. An email was leaked of David Herman the owner of the company stating that everything other than Craig Abramowitz (his client that spends the most) takes lower priority. I want to know where my Adwords money is going and how it's being spent. I need to see data and figures, something they have always put off, or completely ignored my requests. I don't want Isaac Gorin, Steven Mills and David Herman trying to take credit for appointments and leads at the end of the month things they have nothing to do with.
Since I have switched to another marketing company, my adwords budget is less than half, and I have almost doubled the leads coming in. Not to mention I have full control of my site, the reports, I can see traffic and visitors, conversions, costs per click. I am not trying to promote another marketing company so I will not mention the name. But I am making you aware of the WM4D scam.
There are no SEO specialists, PPC pay per click specialists, web developers, programmers, web savvy people in this company. When I asked about the qualifications of the people working on my account I could not get a proper answer. A friend told me to ask them about Organic SEO, and many other things, and it sounds like they are unfamiliar with the terminology, you can tell their ""elaboration"" is BS. Actually I don't think any of the web staff at this company has been there for more than 6 months, maybe the customer service and the people like Isaac, Miriam, David, Steven who are obviously not Web Savvy.
If you check sites of their clients, they are pretty much all identical:

										 I went to my appointment and was given an estimate of approximately $1000 AFTER my BCBS dental benefits.  I was given the explanation that this was the price for my replacement crown.  I was then offered a medical credit card to break down my payments which I accepted. I then received a temporary crown.  While being worked on, I had the DISTINCT taste of cigarettes on someones gloves when the dentist or assistant was working in my mouth.  The only conclusion can be that someone had smoked and not re-gloved. 
I had to return TWICE for the dentist to fix my broken temporary crown that was disintegrating in my mouth. Because of the cigarette incident, I was very cautious of hygiene.  I noticed that gloved hands touched and adjusted lights, but the light handles were not cleaned (therefore MANY different gloved hands from other patients touched the same light).  At other dentists I see a plastic sheath over things that they adjust when you are in the chair.The office called to say that the day I had taken off of work to receive my new permanent crown was to be pushed back because the lab was very backed up from the holidays.  As per the other 3 appointments, I didnt have any of this work done by the dentist except the Novocain shots.  
IMPORTANT* As I was leaving, the assistant told the front desk to schedule me a full work up.  I (having found the place disgusting and not at all satisfied with their work) did not want to ever go back so I explained that I had a regular dentist.  THE ASSISTANT EXPLAINED THAT BECAUSE I WAS NOT SEEING COAST DENTAL, THEY COULD NOT GAURENTEE THE CROWN AND MY WARRANTEE WAS NULL. I said this was fine and left.
IMPORTANT* I called the dentist to go over my bill, and was told the ADDITIONAL amount on my bill was for the warrantee (LISTED AS LAB FEE for $395).  This is suspect because why would they not submit it to BCBS?  And why is called a lab fee?  
I explained I had not signed up for a warrantee and was told you signed the paper (again listed as LAB FEE).  I then explained that I was told BY them upon leaving that my warrantee was VOID since I would not be seeing them.  I was then told that the fee was for a higher quality crown that I  ordered that BCBS would not cover.  I disputed this and they went back to the its the warrantee.
There are some serious issues at hand:
1.) Coast Dental is fraudulent or at least very dishonest in their practice (LAB FEE?  I was NOT told about any warrantee) and was told it would be VOID! As they told me it was void, why are they still charging me?
2.) It is not hygienic by any means.",  Dental Services

										I recently required (and still do) a cosmetic dental procedure to address a now-missing tooth. I came upon the website of the Cosmetic Dentistry Grants Program. I was contacted by Paula Velasco by e-mail and I later contacted her by phone (the first and ONLY time I ever cvonversed with her through ANY medium) and I was referred to a dentist in the metropolitan area. 
I went trough the consultation and informed them (the dentist, not Cosmetic Dentistry) that my dental benefits for the year would start on March 28. I called the dentist to inform them that I would like to begin the procedure for a dental implant, but was informed that they no longer work with Cosmetic Dentistry Grants Program! Stunned, I called the number of the program myself to ascertain what was going on and if they could refer me to a dentist with whom they are currently working. I got a recorded message stating that I should leave a message and that they will get back to me. That was LAST WEEK! I then sent at least two e-mails to Paula Velasco, the Program Coordinator and those e-mails may as well have been sucked into a black hole -- NOTHING! The dentist referred me to a sleep center to address my sleep apnea (totally different issue, but I felt they were looking out for my well-being) but because of THAT I am now down to almost ZERO for my MEDICAL benefts for the year! To confirm my suspicions about the Cosmetic Dentistry Grants Program, I searched online and found others had been scammed also! I was lucky in that I didn't have to pay any out-of-pocket costs lkike these other poor souls, but I still got burned.

 Aspen Dental ,"  Aspen Dental    
Internet United States of America ",www.aspendental.com, 877-277-4354,Aspen Dental  Poor work/high prices Internet,"
										If you need dental care, find a real, respectable dentist. This company does poor work and is all about the money.I had my teeth pulled in November 2006. It is now 2012, and I'm still having problems. Aspen promised me a five-year guarantee on its work. However, a year after I was first treated, they began charging $170 for annual ""exams."" You have to pay for the exam once a year, or they will not treat you. This ""exam"" consists of a dentist looking around your mouth for less than five seconds.
I really went through hell with these people. I had my teeth extracted in 2006. For the next 2.5 years, I was in their office at least once a week with problems. The first set of teeth (after the temporaries) looked awful and made my jaw jut out. The second set they made me kept breaking.
I've had nothing but problems with the third set, which I didn't get until March 2009. I can't chew correctly. I can't eat steak, a piece of fresh fruit or pizza (my teeth can't bite through the toppings, so I end up pulling off the cheese when I try to take a bite). Same with sandwiches -- I pull out the insides whenever I try to eat one.
The teeth come loose and food gets under them when I eat if I don't put on a lot of adhesive -- so much that it oozes all over my tongue, cheeks and teeth. I have to scrape off the excess with my fingernail or I end up eating with a mouth full of adhesive. Aspen tells me they might ruin the dentures if they try to fix the problem.
They also talked me into getting implants. A big ad in their waiting room showed a man with dentures biting into an apple. They told me the implants would enable me to eat anything, and also that I could leave them in all day without using adhesive. I spent $1,200 on four implants.
All of them eventually fell out, and caused me a lot of pain. Aspen kept replacing them. Then, they referred me to a dentist in another office. He told me he would never have put in the implants. There was no chance they would stay in because of my bone structure. I have to wonder why they didn't figure this out before I spent the $1,200.
The worst part about this is that I always have to be thinking about my dentures. I have to be sure that I'm near a bathroom when I have to add more adhesive (every three or four hours). I can no longer hike, camp or ride my bike long distances. Aspen greatly reduced my quality of life.
I do understand that dentures are not the same as natural teeth, and there are bound to be problems. What I don't understand is why my grandparents had fewer problems with their dentures 40 years ago then I'm having with mine in the 21st Century.
On top of all this, my employer required that I take vacation or personal days for medical appointments. I used every single day on Aspen Dental appointments for two years straight.
Actors in Aspen's ads claim that Aspen ""gave me my smile back."" All I got was pain, inconvenience, frustration and a $7,200 bill. If anyone is part of a lawsuit against Aspen, please let me know. They need to be stopped.									",  Dental Services

Los Angeles, Orange County California *UPDATE: Recognized by Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Program as a safe business service  Dr. Sherri Worth pledges to always resolve any issues, feel safe, confident & secure when doing business with DR. SHERRI WORTH Center for Reconstructive Dentistry."," Ripoff Report Verified REVIEW:
EDitors UPDATE: Positive rating and recognition has been given to  Dr. Sherri Worth, Center for Reconstructive Dentistry  for its commitment to excellence in customer service.
Dr. Sherri Worth discussions with Ripoff Report have uncovered an ongoing commitment by the company to total client satisfaction. This means that clients can expect that the company will work towards finding a mutually satisfactory resolution to any complaints or concerns. Dr. Sherri Worth listens carefully to client concerns and sees them as an opportunity to learn from past mistakes and become more efficient as a company in the services offered and the support for those services. Our experienced team specializes in aesthetic and reconstructive dentistry, dental implants, and general dental services. Since 1995, we have been providing excellence in dental care, technology innovation, and expert results to celebrities, full-time moms, professional athletes, business professionals and models...The information provided in this report was based on comments made by Dr. Sherri Worth and her staff during an On-Site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases towards the Center for Reconstructive Dentistry. . 
Dr. Sherri Worth and the Center for Reconstructive Dentistry specialize in Veneers, Invisalign, Teeth Whitening, Crowns, Bridges, Inlays, Onlays, and Bonding. During the On-Site Business verification, Dr. Worth and her staff stated they work with individual patients to address their concerns, needs, and phobias in order to create an appropriate solution for services desired. They do this by asking questions throughout the appointment with the patient and always allow ample time to educate them about their oral health. Additionally, they feel their staff is equipped to provide feedback to their patients and continually have an open line of communication. Dental Hygienists work to show patients areas of concern throughout their appointment through the use of an oral camera. Furthermore, if a patient has a question, the hygienist will stop the procedure and address it immediately to ensure they are getting the best care possible. 
Before a major dental procedure, Dr. Sherri Worth explained that she goes through a comprehensive dental care plan which involves consultation with the patient to determine their needs, a history of the patients dental concerns, a comprehensive exam, and x-rays. Dr. Worth states that she will bring in specialists to meet all of the needs the patient might have in order to provide additional options. They try to present all options to the patient; however, if the patient is looking for something that is not in their best interest Dr. Worth always informs them of her concerns. Overall, they have found that an effective way to eliminate confusion is to explain procedures several times before treatment and then again after it has been completed.
After a patient has had a procedure done, their office manager commented that she is persistent in following up to address any concerns by phone as they feel it is more personal. Additionally, they send thank you cards and make an effort to follow up with them more than once to ensure they do not have additional concerns that have come up. After major procedures, Dr. Sherri Worth stated that she will personally follow up with patients through phone calls, emails, and text messages depending on the patients contact preference. If an issue does come up, they work to give it attention immediately and provide additional consultation for the next steps. 
The Center for Reconstructive Dentistrys office manager is generally the first to hear a complaint. Since the Corporate Advocacy Program through Ripoff Report she stated that she makes sure to make immediate contact with the patient and talk with them personally while walking them through possible solutions until they are satisfied.  They believe that the level of care that patients receive is top quality. If someone is dissatisfied with anything they work to discover the reason, correct it and apply that towards future situations. Dr. Sherri Worth mentioned that she is especially concerned with doing whatever it takes by providing patients the opportunity to have extensive consultation with all parties concerned, exams, and diagnosis. Additionally, they are concerned with follow up and have patients come back for further consultation appointments after procedures. Furthermore, Dr. Worth believes that the CAP program is good resource for assessing businesses on behalf of potential consumers.

This time, Ripoff Report tried to call the authors by phone. All the numbers we called turned out to be bogus. Fortunately, this is not the norm, as most complaints posted on Ripoff Report are real.

										I contacted Encore Dental tonight based off of a flier I received in the mail. The customer service representative put me on speaker-phone immediate, yelling in my ear the entire time, even once he took me off of speaker-phone. I sat there politely listening to his sales pitch, although I'm not the type to be impressed by such posturing. I am more practical than that. OK. He says, ""so let's get you signed up."" I responded that I didn't think it was in my best interest since the amount per month equaled more than what I am currently paying without insurance. His (valid) argument was ""what if?"" What if you need further dental care that is out of the ordinary? I understand that chance, however paying an extra $100+ year guaranteed through this program v. the unlikelihood that I will need something extra done over the next year doesn't balance out. When I was half way through this sentence, he told me to have a nice night and hung up on me. Wow.

										I went to this Dentist last week. After my x-rays where done. The Dentist went into the X-Ray room and said to me ""Oh wow every tooth has a cavity"" Then he proceeded to use some laser to detect cavities. Durning the exam it was almost as if he was drooling and seeing dollar signs. He also stated that I need 3 root canels in which he would only make around a hundred dollars and said it wasn't worth his time to do them so I need to see a endodontist, and stated ""let him do it for that kind of money."" So red flags started to rise. By the end of the exam I needed 10 crowns mind you at $620.00 a piece and 3 fillings at $100.00 a piece and deep scale cleaning at $300.00. So I ended up with a estimate of 6900.00. Really? To top it off his wife whom works in the office called me the next day to set up treatment. I told her I was going for a second opinion.

										Coast Dental employs an outrageous scam on all its patients. They advertise that they take your insurance. That is why I went there. Was I wrong. The rip off is providing only procedures and products not covered in the insurance contract.
My dental insurance is United Healthcare and they have negotiated good prices for the policy holders.
Coast Dental wants the big bucks so they make it mandatory for you to have a procedure or product not covered by the insurance contract. Does this mean that the dentist is willing do anything to the patient including harming the patient to
adhere to this protcol? I think so. Now comes the insurance fraud. In order to get your insurance benefit they fraudulently bill the insurance
company for something that is covered but not done. Dr Perkins and there band of high pressure assistants insist that you must have the expensive non covered procedure or product or they will not treat you. 
Latter I learned they what they insisted on was a bad alternative, this very hard material used in the expensive bridge biting down on a natural tooth will destroy the natural tooth.  I will have to wait at least two and half months for the bridge. They had my money on day one and are in no hurry to complete my bridge. Mean while the egg shell temporary bridge fell apart and they want another $150 to repair or replace the temporary. So here I am toothless and the mercy of these vultures.

										This is the second report I have filed on this product.  The first one dealt with the ordering and charges associated with the product.  This one deals with the return policy.  
I received a second shipment of BellaBrite and was charged $84 and some change for it.  I called the company to find out what I needed to return the product and get my money back.  I talked with 2 different people there.  I was told that I needed to return the product, and I would be reinbursed for $78.  (They would not return the money for the shipping and handling.) 
I returned the product by having it stamped return to sender by the post office.  Ten days later, i found they had not returned my money.
I called the company and talked with the supervisior.  I was informed that I would not be getting the refund because the box did not have an RMA (returned merchandise authorization number).  I explained to the person that I was not given one when I asked how to return it.  She stated that I needed to read read the return policy rule on their web site.  I explained that I was not informed that I needed to read that policy, and I had asked what I needed to do to return it.  
She told me that all the conversations are recorded, and I said listen to the recording and you will hear that I was not informed that.  She stated that because I asked to speak to a supervisior is the reason I did not get told that. (A supervisior was not available at that time.)  I also told her that I had called 2 different occasions to request information on how to get my money back, and neither time was I told that an RMA was needed.
She continued to repeat that I needed an RMA and that I should have read the return policy.  I admit that I got someone irate with her, and did begin yelling at her, but I was polite while yelling.  
I even suggested that she sent the product back to me and give me an RMA and I would put it on the box and send it back.  She stated that they were unable to do that.  (Seemed like a solution to me.)  I was informed that I could be reimbursed $45.  I stated that was not an acceptable solution. She ended up hanging up on me.
I called back and spoke with another person.  He offered to let me speak to the supervisior. Which I declined because she was the one who hung up on me.  I stayed calm talking to this man and did not yell at him.  He told me the same thing that I could be reimbursed $45.  After all the run around (Which by the way, their return policy is advertised as a No Hassle Return Policy.) I opted to go this route.

										I was a patient for about 4 years, had a lot of  work done and the price was more expensive than the previous dentists I had. I thought she was doing a good job till I had the bridge work done. The root canal she insisted I have to have redone got infected as soon as the bridge was put on it. When I came with an infection, she told me everything was done properly and that happens regardless... She told me the only way to fix it was to remove the bridge, extract the infected tooth and put implants or a 4-tooth bridge... oh and that cost about $10,000 total, after I just wasted half of that - on now worthless bridge and root canal. She did not want to do a tooth extraction to clean the infection and put it back as it is practiced by holistic dentists, she told me it's not going to work,  and no, she would not even give me a discount, even if I chose to fix it with her knowing her advice resulted in a lot of wasted time, pain and money to say the least. Needless to say, I was very VERY upset. It took me some time to even go to another dentist.After, I have consulted 5 other dentists thus far and had full mouth x-rays, I got another shocker -- the bridge was not even properly fitted, which likely caused the root of the tooth to split. The material used in the bridge was poor grade since it has caved, and all, ALL of the crowns she has done within 6 years need to be replaced!!!  Now I am simply furious!I saw her last time about 3 years ago, she did not have oral camera, digital X-rays, or proper procedure to remove mercury fillings. She will not do cubic zirconium implant either. She is also one of those ""lawyer"" type of dentists who charge you for consultation, not like she doesn't charge you enough for the shady work... Thinking back I did have a suspicion that I did not need all that work she did done at that time, and that something maybe off (she crowned a tooth on which she replaced a filling a year prior to that) but unfortunately, I trusted her.Do not do the same expensive mistake!

										I came to Dr Igor German in December, 2011 for an initial visit and emergency work for a broken front tooth.  Several thousand dollars later, a root canal, and a temporary bridge in place, I left with an appointment for January.  I had the appointment  January14, which resulted in another temporary bridge and hundreds more dollars.  I got an appointment for February to be fitted with my permanent bridge.  As I was leaving, I asked Shane, the receptionist, if I could submit a picture so that the finished bridge would be a somewhat accurate representation of what my original teeth looked like.  She said I could email it or drop it by.  I sent the email to their website address and thought the matter was taken care of.I got a call from Shane about a week before my appointment in February saying she did not receive the pictures and that they had not started making the bridge.  I tried again, had someone else try again to send the pictures.  They were not received.  After several phone calls, Shane said the address was dentaldiscovery@gmail.com--1st time it had been mentioned that there is another email address.  No mention of this address is listed on their website, nor anywhere else.  Shane was very rude, said it was my own fault that I could not possibly keep my original February appointment to get my permanent bridge as it hadn't been started.  She said she had the pictures, which of course were received after getting the correct email address.  She said she would give me a call when the bridge was ready.  This was mid-February.A month goes by, no call.  My temporary bridge broke in 2 pieces on a Friday, March 17.  I called @ 10 AM, got voice mail, which didn't mention office hours.  I went to the office at 1 PM, which was closed.  I called the phone number, got a recording to call their other office on the other side of town.  I got another recording with yet another number which said to leave a message and someone would get back to me right away.   I waited in the area until after 5:30 PM, still no response.  I went home.  Saturday morning, March 18th,  I got a call from a woman who asked who I was and which office I normally visit. I told her ""the Silver Springs office"".  Her response was ""Oh"".  No further calls.  Still no response from Shane or anyone else in the Silver Springs office.I went to work that night and the next 3 nights with a broken temporary bridge that kept falling out if I bent over.  I did not receive a call back until after noon on Tuesday the 20th from Shane, telling me that both offices are closed on Fridays, that I should have known that, and that is was my own fault that it was taking so long to get my permanent bridge.  She said it was done, had been in their office waiting for ME to call them to schedule an appointment.  She also said that she had called numerous times, had others call numerous times, but got no answer.  I replied that she had my home number, my cell number, and my email address.  NO attempts were made to contact me.  She even had my friend's email address who sent her a picture of me!  She yelled at me and told me I had no reason to be upset because they don't offer after hours emergency care and it was my own fault that I was kept waiting.  She told me that if I could not be in their office by 9AM the following morning, it would be another week before they could accommodate me, saying,""It's not our fault that you work nights and can't make it here by that time.  I don't know what to tell you.""  I am working a nursing contract over 100 miles away from Ocala, 7PM to 7:30 or 8 AM.  She was aware of this.I called the other office, told them about my broken bridge and the way I was treated by Shane.  They put a girl on the phone who works both offices.  She said she would be there the following day and would work me in.  She assured me that I would not have to have any contact with Shane.I came in straight from work after working a 13-hour shift, got there before 10 AM.  No apology was made for the delay in getting my permanent bridge, none for ignoring my emergency, nor did Shane apologize for her rude behavior.  Dr Igor's comment was, ""I know it has taken awhile to get your permanent bridge, but at least it's over now.""It was my front teeth that were being replaced.  I work with the public, have to lean over patients in bed, with my temporary bridge falling out on the bed!  It was humiliating, not to mention having to disinfect them to keep from catching something!  I couldn't eat anything that had to be bitten in front, nor could I tolerate cold or hot without great pain.  Their recording says ""someone will get right back to you"", which is a lie.  Their website talks about how friendly and courteous they are, how they cultivate trust and friendship, how they take care of emergencies.  BEWARE!  Once they have your money, you no longer matter to them!

										I have had Liberty Dental Insurance for several years and they advertised both Rocky Ridge Dental and Lincoln Hills Dental as offices that accepted Liberty Dental Insurance.When I went to Rocky Ridge, they recommended a filling and / or crown several years ago. When they gave me the price, they refused to honor the insurance pricing. Art, the office manager, said, ""This is the price and if you want service you have to pay our price.""I just got mad and walked out.
I called Liberty Dental Insurance several times and talked to at least 4 people and all confirmed that I was right...I was to pay the co-pay, plus an upgrade fee only...They offered to change me to another dentist. I did that and found Lincoln Hills Dental...little did I know it was the same company! I also upgraded my plan.
When I got pricing from Lincoln Hills Dental, Art, the same office manager appeared. Again, he refused to explain the costs, and refused to discuss the insurance. I e-mailed 3 times and got no answer.
This morning, when I called Liberty Dental Insurance, I talked to a man named Hugo who claimed that I was to pay a co-pay, an upgrade, plus the cost of gold. He claimed that the dentist can set the price of the material at whatever they want. This was the first time anyone ever said this! He agreed to call Art at Lincoln Hills Dental and get an answer.
In the mean time, Art called me and claimed that the dentist had decided that they did not want me as a client. He claimed they sent a letter to me and to the insurance company in January and this is why he had not answered me in March.
He said the reason was because of a comment I made while in the office...when the dentist said I may need a root canal. She said that she would not know until she took off a crown and looked. (I said, ""Oh yes...the root canal is a very popular money maker these days I guess."")Art was ready to schedule the crown and the root canal immediately.He claimed that they had a ""little thingy that can go between the teeth and gum and that it was all squishy under there."" 
I decided to get a second opinion and was told that I did not need a root canal.  If I did, he would be able to see it on the X rays OR I would be in terrible pain...neither was true! As for the crown...he said it looked fine as well.
As for the letter that Art claimed to have sent: Neither the insurance company nor I have received any letter.  When I called back to get the date of the letter, the receptionist claimed that Art was the only one who had access to my file and that he would call me back tomorrow.
When I called Liberty Dental Insurance back, I talked to Kimmey. She reconfirmed that my original understanding of pricing was correct and that Hugo was mistaken. She said that  Liberty Dental Insurance did not get any letter from Lincoln Hills Dental.  She suggested that they change me to another dentist...(Is this the game?  They just shuffle you to another dentist?)I can only conclude that Art just decided today that they did not want to work with me because I was forcing them to abide by their legal agreement with the insurance company and the lower pricing that would entail.
Further, as for the root canal...I have no idea...but it seems suspicious that they would make such a claim when another dentist saw no problem. ",  Dental Services

I told her ""the Silver Springs office"".  Her response was ""Oh"".  No further calls.  Still no response from Shane or anyone else in the Silver Springs office.I went to work that night and the next 3 nights with a broken temporary bridge that kept falling out if I bent over.  I did not receive a call back until after noon on Tuesday the 20th from Shane, telling me that both offices are closed on Fridays, that I should have known that, and that is was my own fault that it was taking so long to get my permanent bridge.  She said it was done, had been in their office waiting for ME to call them to schedule an appointment.  She also said that she had called numerous times, had others call numerous times, but got no answer.  I replied that she had my home number, my cell number, and my email address.  NO attempts were made to contact me.  She even had my friend's email address who sent her a picture of me!  She yelled at me and told me I had no reason to be upset because they don't offer after hours emergency care and it was my own fault that I was kept waiting.  She told me that if I could not be in their office by 9AM the following morning, it would be another week before they could accommodate me, saying,""It's not our fault that you work nights and can't make it here by that time.  I don't know what to tell you.""  I am working a nursing contract over 100 miles away from Ocala, 7PM to 7:30 or 8 AM.  She was aware of this.I called the other office, told them about my broken bridge and the way I was treated by Shane.  They put a girl on the phone who works both offices.  She said she would be there the following day and would work me in.  She assured me that I would not have to have any contact with Shane.I came in straight from work after working a 13-hour shift, got there before 10 AM.  No apology was made for the delay in getting my permanent bridge, none for ignoring my emergency, nor did Shane apologize for her rude behavior.  Dr Igor's comment was, ""I know it has taken awhile to get your permanent bridge, but at least it's over now.""It was my front teeth that were being replaced.  I work with the public, have to lean over patients in bed, with my temporary bridge falling out on the bed!  It was humiliating, not to mention having to disinfect them to keep from catching something!  I couldn't eat anything that had to be bitten in front, nor could I tolerate cold or hot without great pain.  Their recording says ""someone will get right back to you"", which is a lie.  Their website talks about how friendly and courteous they are, how they cultivate trust and friendship, how they take care of emergencies.  BEWARE!  Once they have your money, you no longer matter to them!

										I have had Liberty Dental Insurance for several years and they advertised both Rocky Ridge Dental and Lincoln Hills Dental as offices that accepted Liberty Dental Insurance.When I went to Rocky Ridge, they recommended a filling and / or crown several years ago. When they gave me the price, they refused to honor the insurance pricing. Art, the office manager, said, ""This is the price and if you want service you have to pay our price.""I just got mad and walked out.
I called Liberty Dental Insurance several times and talked to at least 4 people and all confirmed that I was right...I was to pay the co-pay, plus an upgrade fee only...They offered to change me to another dentist. I did that and found Lincoln Hills Dental...little did I know it was the same company! I also upgraded my plan.
When I got pricing from Lincoln Hills Dental, Art, the same office manager appeared. Again, he refused to explain the costs, and refused to discuss the insurance. I e-mailed 3 times and got no answer.
This morning, when I called Liberty Dental Insurance, I talked to a man named Hugo who claimed that I was to pay a co-pay, an upgrade, plus the cost of gold. He claimed that the dentist can set the price of the material at whatever they want. This was the first time anyone ever said this! He agreed to call Art at Lincoln Hills Dental and get an answer.
In the mean time, Art called me and claimed that the dentist had decided that they did not want me as a client. He claimed they sent a letter to me and to the insurance company in January and this is why he had not answered me in March.
He said the reason was because of a comment I made while in the office...when the dentist said I may need a root canal. She said that she would not know until she took off a crown and looked. (I said, ""Oh yes...the root canal is a very popular money maker these days I guess."")Art was ready to schedule the crown and the root canal immediately.He claimed that they had a ""little thingy that can go between the teeth and gum and that it was all squishy under there."" 
I decided to get a second opinion and was told that I did not need a root canal.  If I did, he would be able to see it on the X rays OR I would be in terrible pain...neither was true! As for the crown...he said it looked fine as well.
As for the letter that Art claimed to have sent: Neither the insurance company nor I have received any letter.  When I called back to get the date of the letter, the receptionist claimed that Art was the only one who had access to my file and that he would call me back tomorrow.
When I called Liberty Dental Insurance back, I talked to Kimmey. She reconfirmed that my original understanding of pricing was correct and that Hugo was mistaken. She said that  Liberty Dental Insurance did not get any letter from Lincoln Hills Dental.  She suggested that they change me to another dentist...(Is this the game?  They just shuffle you to another dentist?)I can only conclude that Art just decided today that they did not want to work with me because I was forcing them to abide by their legal agreement with the insurance company and the lower pricing that would entail.
Further, as for the root canal...I have no idea...but it seems suspicious that they would make such a claim when another dentist saw no problem. ",  Dental Services

										My girlfriend went for cleaning and exam at Dossett Dental in 2011.  The dentist, a Korean lady named Susan Koo, said my girlfriend needed deep cleaning, a crown, and a bridge. She then sent my girlfriend out to talk with the office manager about the cost.
The office manager, a lady named Fariba Dadgostar, told her the deep cleaning would be $900.  She then went on to tell her that she needed the deep cleaning because she had a gum infection and that her lower jaw would rot away if she did not get the deep cleaning.  The dentist never mentioned she had a gum infection or anything about her lower jaw rotting away. 
My girlfriend told her she just wanted the regular cleaning and exam and that was all.   Fariba told her they would not do regular cleaning, only the deep cleaning for $900.  
I could not believe what I was hearing; the office manager was making decisions regarding her medical treatment. [continued below]....
									
										.....   This middle-eastern lady was not a dentist, not even a dental assistant, and here she was making medical decisions. 
I then became very irritated at what I was hearing and asked Fariba if I could speak to the dentist.  She said that I could not.  I told her my girlfriend wanted just the regular cleaning.   Fariba said they would only do the deep cleaning and refused to do the regular cleaning.  We left the place in disgust.
About a week later we went to another dentist and this dentist told her she did not need deep cleaning at all and that she did not have a gum infection.  They did the regular cleaning and exam and everything was fine.
I also spoke to my dentist about deep cleaning and he said it was rarely needed.  I believe something should be done to stop this unethical practice and hope the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners does something.
I was really angry about what we had experienced at Dossett Dental as they were just trying to rip us off.  I filed a compliant with the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners.  A lady from their office called me and said she could not believe that they refused to do a regular cleaning.  
They are investigating the matter at the time of this posting and apparently they have had numerous complaints against Dossett Dental.  I would recommend everyone to avoid Dossett Dental.
I found this on the Better Business Bureau website:
On April 17, 2009 the State Board of Dental Examiners found that Kenneth Dossett, DDS, with license number 9584, improperly billed patients and issued a reprimand.

										I have been going to Dr Ching at Southwest Family Dentistry for the last 15 years.  In the last 3-4 years I have had nothing but bad billing issues with them.First, they would have you pay your co-pay and any outstanding balance before they work on the pre authorized claim.  Then after a month later they would bill you again stating the insurance company didnt pay the full authorized amount.  This made me furious, I called them on several occasions about their bad billing practice.  At some points they even cleared the balance.They did the same thing to my daughter, even though she is over 18, out of the house and on her own I still have her under my insurance plan because she doesnt make that much money and they did the same thing to her and was hit with a $950 bill.  If she knew that it was going to be that high she wouldnt have had the work done.  They told her that her services were pre authorized by the insurance company.This last month me and my wife went in, she had her work done and her co-pay and balance after pre auth paid as well.   I had a paid my co-pay and pre auth balance paid as well.  When Dr Ching came in, I mentioned to him about the billing issues that I have been experiencing.  He said that sometimes when they get pre authorizations that the insurance doesnt pay the full amount that they received.  He then started to examine my tooth for a filling.  After viewing the x-rays he said that I needed a crown and shouldnt do the filling, he would then have to get a pre authorization on the crown.  I then said ok, but then he said he wanted to drill it out to make sure Make sure, he all ready told me that I needed a crown.  He then drilled it out and said yes you need a crown. Ok, so in the middle of me being in the chair the assistant came in and had me sign that they needed to do a temp filling and that its going to cost me 80$ and that insurance was covering the rest, I then would have had a credit of 80$ towards my crown.  Right then I was bummed as Dr Ching knew before he drilled out my tooth that I needed  crown so he wanted to drill it out and make a few extra bucks until actually doing the crown.I called them two weeks ago to ask for my credit balance, they said they would call me in two weeks since I am going to start using another dentist.  I then called them again last week and Janet told me that they would have someone call me on Saturday to discuss the credit balance and not to come in because she can tell I was not happy.  Saturday came and no call, she lied to me like the others that work there.I received my bill last weekend, not only did the insurance not pay the full authorized amount that the Dr Chings assistant stated but I owed even more!  I received a bill that had my daughters balance added as well when in fact she is not my dependent any longer.  I called my insurance which in fact stated they did not receive any authorization for my temp filling so now I have to pay the full amount.Southwest Family Dentist has been practicing this shady billing for the past 3-4 years with me.  I did not receive any paperwork that I signed stating my billing.  So the paper I sign is blank and they just put any amount after that as I dont see anything and am sure that is not right either.",  Dental Services

After about an hour of trying to sell me different services, I said if needed the tooth pulled. I was informed at that time their Dentist could not be using the gas because she was pregnant. Why did they waste a days pay and an extra day in pain. I found a real Dentist that was opened on Saturday's at an extra charge and told he could save the tooth with out pulling it out. He performed a root canal. I was exposed to a lot of  x-rays that should not have to take. I will be putting this on the Internet to be careful about this Dentist office. I will also be reporting this with the local BBB, Rip of Reports, and all over the Internet telling them about my experience.

I found a Dentist that open on Saturdays and he was very surprised that the any Dentist would tell me that this tooth had to be pulled and he was able to do a simple root canal and saved the tooth in question.

										In Dec of 2011 I went to Sunwest Dental Center to have my upper plate repaired. The plate was craked down the center.The denture tech, Dan said he could repair my denture for free if I bought a new set of dentures. He told me there were 3 different options I could choose from: good, better and best. I decided to buy the mid range denture for $1400.00The very first thing I told the tech, Dan was that I was tired of bitting myself on my lips. The reason I have always bit myself was because my current dentures were slightly too big and the upper teeth were prjected outward. I told him if I agreed to buy new dentures I wanted that problem fixed, that I wanted my teeth to be slightly angled inward so I wouldn't bite myself so easily.Dan assured me that that would be no problem and I would be more than happy with my new teeth.Then, during the fitting of the wax teeth he told me there would be a slight gap between the 2 front teeth, but I wouldn't be biting myself with these teeth. He told me to be sure I was happy with the way they fit because once he made them into real, permanent teeth he couldn't change them.On Dec 23 I received my new permanent teeth. Dan made some adjustments to the bite and told me if I needed any more adjustments to just come back and he would be happy to do it.When I got home and looked in the mirror I realized my teeth were not aligned correctly. I had a tooth right in the very center. The upper right center tooth was so far to the left that it was exactly in the center. The lower set was centered correctly.I went straight back to their office and I told the tech, Dan that this was unacceptable. I said look at my teeth. I have a tooth right in the middle of my mouth.Dan agreed that it was too far to the left but said that I had authorized that setting. I told him that I did not. He said I 'OKed' the wax fitting. I told him that I thought I was 'OKing the way they fit in my mouth. Ultimately, Dan agreed to remake the dentures because the upper was misaligned. We had to go through the whole process of taking imprints of my mouth again and fitting the wax teeth in order to make the permenant set.Finally, on Jan 13 my new teeth were delivered. I sat in the chair and Dan handed my the teeth and said, ""there ya go!""I put them in my mouth and he handed me a mirror. He asked me if that was better. I said the alignment was good but now there was an overbite and I had specificlly asked him to correct that issue.He said that there wasn't anything he could do about that and that was how they should be made anyway. He did not check the bite or ask me how they fit. He just told me I could come back if I needed any adjustments. I got home and looked in the mirror and instantly could see that the overbite was even worse than I thought. I tried to eat with them and bit myself numerous times in numerous places. The bite was so far off that I could not chew anything good enought to swallow it.So I went back to have the bite adjusted. Dan made some adjustment to the bite and said if you need any more adjustments just come on back. I asked him, ""what about this overbite. I bite myself and I am completely unhappy with the way they look."" He just looked at me and smiled and shook his head and said, ""na I can't do anything about that.""",  Dental Services

 Aspen Dental ,"  Aspen Dental    
Nationwide United States of America ",www.aspendental.com, ,"Aspen Dental  Dentists Must Avoid Working With This Organization! United States, Nationwide","
										Dear Fellow Dentists & Patients,
I'm a general dentist with about 10-years work experience in my field.  Recently, I was unfortunate enough to accept a position as an employee dentist with Aspen Dental location(s) in Florida.  I learned this organization is nationwide, and is set-up in the same ""cookie cutter"" style; therefore, each office nationwide is run according to the same management style, same proprietary software, same interior decoration, same exterior decoration, and same goals... That is: To pound the dentist's pride, and to pound the patient's wallet! Funny thing is, they do this all while proposing a common vision of: ""Helping patients get the care they need."" More like, ""Helping themselves get the money they want!""
Dentists, (especially new grads), be very careful about this company!!! Aspen Dental is openly boasting about its unique market advantage of having an ever-increasing cache of upside-down dentists chained to accelerating student loan debt, and/or bad debts from past failed businesses... Aspen Dental is clinging to this philosophy of ample cheap talent, and in turn are spreading their clinics across the country like wildfire. They openly boast about opening 10 new clinics every month because they claim there's no end in site for dentists willing to prostitute themselves for the unilateral benefit of Aspen Dental...  But, from what I've seen in Florida, most of their clinics are without dentists, and they have to hire staffing companies like Dental Power International to find temporary dentists to fill-in where they can. I noticed that many of the ""permanent dentists"" that were there before I was only lasted a few months, and were then gone with the wind. Nobody ever had a clue about where they went, either.     
I graduated from dental school back in May 2002.  My first job was working as an associate in a private practice by August 2002... Right about the same time as that huge Tech-Bubble recession.  At that time, (10-years ago), I was being compensated the greater of $500/Day (or) 30% of my collections for my services.  This was considered the average market rate back in those days. Guess what, today Aspen Dental is offering their new associate dentists a flat rate of $400/Day, even though its common knowledge that the dollar's value is about half of what it was 10-years ago!  In addition, there's another class of dentists in the Aspen Dental ranks call an ""MCD,"" (Managing Clinical Director).  Here, the MCD is typically paid the greater of $500/Day (or) 20% of their clinic's ""profit margin,"" (which is typically about 8% of the clinic's collections). Initially, when I was being hired by Aspen Dental, they convinced me to try Aspen's business practice for 90-days to see their ""business advantages"" for myself... But after serious reflection, I discovered Aspen Dental has diminished the value of a dentist's services by (2 - 4) times of what it used to be back in 2002... And they think they can do this because there's so many dentists out there that are willing to prostitute themselves for these diminished wages.  As an educated professional who takes pride in my work, I find this to be offensive and a big ripoff!!! In order to break-through that measly $500/Day draw, an MCD dentist would have to produce an average of +$5,000/Day over 21-days per month on a predominantly PPO + DHMO fee schedule... Fellow dentists, we all know that's working our fingers to the bone!!!  Its nearly impossible to do with conventional dentistry. 
As far as the title ""MCD"" goes, Aspen Dental recruiters would like their new dentists believe that they will be ""co-managers"" of their clinic, where the office manager runs to front of the clinic, and the MCD runs the back of the clinic... Well, I can honestly say that this hiring tactic is a classic bait & switch, because both the MCD & Associate dentist(s) are considered to be highly expendable and very insignificant within the Aspen Dental clinic... Especially when it comes to any kind of management decisions throughout the clinic.  In fact, the office manager seemed to treat the hygienist as more of an ""MCD"" than the dentist that was supposedly hired for that position. Bottom Line: Either the dentist does what they're told to do by the office manager & regional manager, or they'll be fired without notice... That's exactly what happened to me when I offered my periodic written concerns to the office manager and the regional manager.  Funny thing was, these concerns were totally legitimate, and all were geared in the best interest of Aspen Dental. Remember, I'm an educated professional who takes pride in my work, not just trying to be a ""squeaky wheel"" for no reason at all.
As it turned-out, my office manager was very unprofessional and immature, as I've learned most Aspen Dental managers are, simply because of Aspen's rapid expansion, tight manager salaries, and lack of ability to find quality help at all the right times.  Bottom line, my office manager was fraternizing with subordinate staff members after-hours, and then developed personal friendships with them, and then basically gave them free reign of the clinic.  The sub-ordinates became the super-ordinates, and they were completely immune from any company policy, as well as their unprofessional treatment of the dentist(s) and patient(s). Somehow, their rogue behavior would always find its way back to the MCD, although the MCD had no management authority inside Aspen Dental, nor could MCD initiate any disciplinary actions to help control bad behavior. The staff would come to blame the MCD for their own poor performance on any given day because they claimed the MCD would ""belittle"" them, or make them ""feel stupid.""  They made these claims even though they wouldn't produce any clear evidence to support their claims, and even though the MCD had no idea what they were talking about... They just said it, and expected that to be enough... And, surprisingly, in the end it was enough for the management to be convinced into terminating the MCD without notice. LOL! Now, it would seem both the MCD and the MCD's patients feel ""belittled"" and ""stupid"" for having ever been associated with a crappy organization like Aspen Dental.
If cutting into the dentist's wallet and sense of professionalism aren't enough, there's always the Aspen Dental office manager who openly admits disrespect for any dentist, and thinks they have the freedom to change and/or omit the dentists' recommendations for prescribing medication to patients, as well as changing and/or omitting certain procedures the dentist plans in a patient's chart. In fact, the office manager I worked with had no problem jeopardizing the dentist's license to practice dentistry on any given day, and would invalidate any objection the dentist would give for these secondary decisions ultimately being the dentist's responsibility when things would go wrong for the patients.  In fact, such objections by the dentist would be viewed as contempt for the office manager's decisions, and would warrant spiteful reactions from the office manager soon thereafter.  In hindsight, I noticed this frank disrespect and contempt for the dentist increased over time from the staff and office manager... Until the dentist was finally fired without notice one day.
If all this isn't enough, there's the crazy schedule Aspen Dental has... Monday: (9-6); Tuesday: (11-8); Wednesday: (9-6); Thursday: (9-6); Friday: (8-5); and Saturday: (8-5).  Yes, that's right, night hours and 6-day weeks are the norm in this organization.  Dentists outside Aspen Dental are typically accostomed to working 4-day weeks, and only during ""regular"" business hours.  So, bottom line, Aspen Dental's schedule is full-time only, and really designed to wear-out even the most eager dentist over time.
When it comes to MOST patients, they can expect to be diagnosed with gum disease, have a team of ""professionals"" each remind them about the severity of their gum disease, and then be given no alternatives other than undergoing super-expensive ""gum therapy"" to get it under control.  True, some patients fall into this category, but NOT the majority of them as I've seen happen so many times and been encouraged to go along with for my ""stamp of approval.""  Even so, these patients that really need the gum disease help should ALSO be referred to a specialist called a ""Periodontist,"" rather than JUST being indefinitely cycled through an Aspen Dental hygienist's chair for topical and non-surgical treatment techniques.  The regional manager admitted to us that ""hygiene services"" is the hardest thing to sell in dentistry, so we must work together as a team to increase to urgency of this department to the patients... 
Also, as a consumer rights activist, I'm inclined to admit that Aspen Dental views each one of their clinics as ""profit centers,"" rather than as community oral health centers... They have universal software that produces a bunch of business numbers called ""Metrics,"" and from these numbers they focus on daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly sales performances from clinic to clinic... Then, they take it a step further by conducting behind-the-scenes competitions with other clinics to see who can produce the most from their own unsuspecting patients, and then reward the dentists, hygienists, and staff for doing so... Patients who are supposed to trust and honor the professional judgment and recommendations of their Aspen Dental healthcare providers are in many cases being way oversold.  Fact: The average treatment plan for any given patient is usually about $4,000!!!  With all the cheesy advertising Aspen Dental does on TV, and all the insurance participation they force dentists to do, they usually attract about 10 new patients a day... Then they have a ""Metric"" that shows how much treatment was planned, versus how much was accepted in dollar amounts. LOL! Quite greedy, indeed...  Obviously, there's no ""Metric"" to see if a patient's primary concern was address and resolved on any given day. Such irrelevant details are of no importance to Aspen Dental.
Finally, there's the Chinese dental lab in Beijing that's producing ALL of Aspen Dental's crowns, bridges, and partial denture metal frameworks... Funny thing here is, any given Aspen clinic will try and be sneaky by sending their cases in the mail to their central lab in Syracuse, NY... Then, Aspen's QC will check the impression(s) there... Assuming the impression looks OK, they will forward the impression(s) to Beijing, China for final prosthesis construction.  The finished prosthesis is eventually returned to the Aspen clinic in reverse fashion from above in about 2.5-weeks. As a U.S. dentist, I must admit this is pretty sketchy, since the FDA has no over-site or authority on actual materials being used in these prosthetics, which Aspen Dental patients are expected to wear in their mouths for many years on end.    
Dear patients, as a former Aspen Dental dentist, I must admit these truths to you.  Likewise, for current and future Aspen Dental dentists & hygienists, I can only beg you to stand for your integrity and good clinical judgment to benefit the patient's interests longterm, rather than compromising your ethics and morals just to turn a higher short-term profit for Aspen Dental corporate executives who really don't care about you or your professional license. This is especially true for Dentists, (AKA: ""Doc"").
Well, I hope this information helps anyone reading this think twice about doing business with this rogue organization.  After witnessing their tactics from the inside, I certainly wouldn't put my career in their hands, and moreover my health in their hands!  Good luck!

Concerned Dentist

A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business.  Ripoff Report Verified Business. Newport Beach California "," Ripoff Report Verified REVIEW:
EDitors UPDATE: Positive rating and recognition has been given to  Dr. Sherri Worth, Center for Reconstructive Dentistry  for its commitment to excellence in customer service.
Dr. Sherri Worth discussions with Ripoff Report have uncovered an ongoing commitment by the company to total client satisfaction. This means that clients can expect that the company will work towards finding a mutually satisfactory resolution to any complaints or concerns. Dr. Sherri Worth listens carefully to client concerns and sees them as an opportunity to learn from past mistakes and become more efficient as a company in the services offered and the support for those services. Our experienced team specializes in aesthetic and reconstructive dentistry, dental implants, and general dental services. Since 1995, we have been providing excellence in dental care, technology innovation, and expert results to celebrities, full-time moms, professional athletes, business professionals and models...The information provided in this report was based on comments made by Dr. Sherri Worth and her staff during an On-Site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases towards the Center for Reconstructive Dentistry. . 
Dr. Sherri Worth and the Center for Reconstructive Dentistry specialize in Veneers, Invisalign, Teeth Whitening, Crowns, Bridges, Inlays, Onlays, and Bonding. During the On-Site Business verification, Dr. Worth and her staff stated they work with individual patients to address their concerns, needs, and phobias in order to create an appropriate solution for services desired. They do this by asking questions throughout the appointment with the patient and always allow ample time to educate them about their oral health. Additionally, they feel their staff is equipped to provide feedback to their patients and continually have an open line of communication. Dental Hygienists work to show patients areas of concern throughout their appointment through the use of an oral camera. Furthermore, if a patient has a question, the hygienist will stop the procedure and address it immediately to ensure they are getting the best care possible. 
Before a major dental procedure, Dr. Sherri Worth explained that she goes through a comprehensive dental care plan which involves consultation with the patient to determine their needs, a history of the patients dental concerns, a comprehensive exam, and x-rays. Dr. Worth states that she will bring in specialists to meet all of the needs the patient might have in order to provide additional options. They try to present all options to the patient; however, if the patient is looking for something that is not in their best interest Dr. Worth always informs them of her concerns. Overall, they have found that an effective way to eliminate confusion is to explain procedures several times before treatment and then again after it has been completed.
After a patient has had a procedure done, their office manager commented that she is persistent in following up to address any concerns by phone as they feel it is more personal. Additionally, they send thank you cards and make an effort to follow up with them more than once to ensure they do not have additional concerns that have come up. After major procedures, Dr. Sherri Worth stated that she will personally follow up with patients through phone calls, emails, and text messages depending on the patients contact preference. If an issue does come up, they work to give it attention immediately and provide additional consultation for the next steps. 
The Center for Reconstructive Dentistrys office manager is generally the first to hear a complaint. Since the Corporate Advocacy Program through Ripoff Report she stated that she makes sure to make immediate contact with the patient and talk with them personally while walking them through possible solutions until they are satisfied.  They believe that the level of care that patients receive is top quality. If someone is dissatisfied with anything they work to discover the reason, correct it and apply that towards future situations. Dr. Sherri Worth mentioned that she is especially concerned with doing whatever it takes by providing patients the opportunity to have extensive consultation with all parties concerned, exams, and diagnosis. Additionally, they are concerned with follow up and have patients come back for further consultation appointments after procedures. Furthermore, Dr. Worth believes that the CAP program is good resource for assessing businesses on behalf of potential consumers.

										This dental office was the worst experience.  The oral surgeon and his staff were laughing and talking about the bad breath of his other patient and did not care that I was in pain from his rough tugging of my wisdom tooth. I was shaking with anxiety and very nervous when he made a comment to me that I like to be in control and he hope that I never have to have another tooth pulled. I went in to get a wisdom tooth pulled and a piece of another wisdom tooth pulled.  It was very painful and the oral surgeon was annoyed that I was in so much pain.  He pulled the piece of tooth and sent me home with antibiotics stating that the full tooth had an infection which is why it was so painful to pull.  I came back the following week for the second extraction to encounter rude comments and unprofessional treatment from the staff.   I felt very unsafe after the rude comments and the oral surgeon was very rough and tugging so hard on my tooth until the inside of my mouth was very ripped up.  It was so obvious that I was still in pain and he and his staff were rude and very unsympathetic.  I was still in pain as he made another negative comment while pulling very hard to do the stitches.  The nurse suggested vicodin and the surgeon gave a very rude ""No""!

										I was looking into getting a dental retainer to replace one that was lost.  My biggest mistake was contacting this company.  First of all, the website is misleading.  There is a specific retainer I wanted with a particular function.  After reading the description on the website, I clicked the buy it button, expecting the product to do what it  said in the description.  I purchased both an upper and lower retainer from this company.  Here is what is on the website.
""When using this dental retainer, a metal wire shows, unlike the Essix retainer (which is clear or 'Invisible').  When one smiles others are able to see the dental retainer wire; retainers with the wire across the front teeth are used mostly to keep teeth from shifting, but can also be used to move teeth; That type is called a 'Hawley with Finger Springs'. Finger Springs are small clasps that add pressure to one side of the tooth, ""moving"" it along the retaining wire. 
BUY HAWLEY RETAINERS  HERE  
I assumed the retainer would help shift my teeth after reading the description. When I received the product, the upper did not fit properly.  The lower fit, but it did not move my teeth like I assumed from reading the description.  
Right around this time, I lost access to my email, and had to use a different email.  I explained this several times to the merchant, to clarify why my emails were being sent from a different address.  I told him my concerns and he promised a replacement.  Every time I would send this person an email, he would take weeks before ever replying. 
 When he did reply, he would pretend that he did not know what I was talking about.  I explained the situation to him several times, and he promised replacements.  At one time, he told me he would be sending a new retainer in the mail with a tracking number.  This never happened.   What he did do was demand more money from me. 
  After over a month of trying to get this matter resolved, I contacted my credit card company with a dispute.  The response I got from the merchant was that if I returned the product, I would get a refund.  I returned the product but never received a refund.  The merchant is a liar and a fraud.  He does not have clear policies about his services.  How can you tell a client that you will provide a refund and then after you receive the product, change our mind?  I have all of the emails that were sent to me as well as the form where he gives a written instruction for me to return the product.
In one of my emails, he rudely tells me to ""Have a nice life.""   This is after I told him that it was ridiculous for me to pay more money when he had already promised me free replacements at no extra cost.  Now I am stuck with this charge and no product to speak of.  The merchant does not wish to further communicate with me.  He pretends to not know what I am talking about eveytime I try to contact him.  After promising a refund, he then tells me that he cannot give me one.",  Dental Services

										My adult daughter did not have insurance and she had to have a restorative crown for her front tooth, as the old one was falling off.   Being a single mother, I sought out affordable dental work to help her out, like any honest person would.   The clinic  made me pay up front, and the nightmare began.    I would tell anyone thinking of going to this clinic that it is a big mistake, and a costly one.    The letter below was sent to the clinic and is a perfect account of what happend.      There are more expensive but affordable dentist who are honest and allow you to pay as the work is being completed, none of this up front stuff.    I had to threaten to sue... that got me some money back but not all of it.   For your reading pleasure. 
 
Dear Grandpa's Dental
My daughter was given a consultation on 2/02/2012, at that time your dentist gave her an estimate of costs.   I was told by telephone, that I needed to pay upfront for the services rendered.   I trusted your 25 years of service advertizement, which I have attached.    I gave your dental office $400.00 which was charged to two credit cards ($200.00 each) on Feb 2nd.     My daughter scheduled an appointment for today February 8th    for a cleaning and lab impressions.   Her appointment was for 11:15, and she arrived at 11:00.    At approximately 2:00 I got a call from my daughter telling me that your office cleaned off the old site under the current temporary, and no cleaning was going to be done today?   Your office roughed up the old area, and took impressions and then tried to put the OLD temporary back over the crown area that was previously already crowned.   I paid for a new temporary which your clinic never intended on doing, yet you charged me $35.00, when she challeged your dentist they said they had no idea that one was paid for?   Do you not have a chart and the plan in front of the dentist?   Does your clinic not have a clear plan when a patient sits down?   I clearly dont understand why you can charge me for something you did not do?   The dentist stated to my daughter that it would take an hour to make the temporary?   An hour?  This is not standard practice, and she had been there for 2 hours already?    She walked across the street to the mall and waited for the temporary to be completed.    By the way I was told by your manager Sandy, that there was more than one temporary made?   Not true only one temporary was made, and it was unacceptable work, and she refused to wear it out in public.    My daughter became very hostile when she realized that your clinc ruined the old temporary and the new one looked in her words. like a wad of gum on the front tooth.    Her temper rose, and your employee was very non responsive to the crisis, instead of fixing it, they just kept telling her pretty much too bad.     Yes I can see how reputable your dental office is.  I called the clinic and encounter employee #1) Teresa, myself.   Teresa was rude, apeared not to know what I as talking about and began to act as thow she had no idea what was going on.    She would not answer my questions, was evasive and after arguing with her for at least 10 minutes, I was referred to Sandy.   Sandy called me and the arguing continued, she tried to tell me that she will only refund $300.00 of my $400.00 which is obsurd.     My daughter sat in your clinic for 4 hours, for what?   Impressions and a temporary tooth, this should take approximately 30 minutes?   She got impressions but no temporary.    My daughter finally ended up walking out of your clinic with the destroyed original temporary back on her tooth (which by the way is a front tooth the first thing you see).    No cleaning and no crown, and your management wants me to pay you for what?     When asked about your dental hygenist, we are told they come in twice a month?   Twice a month for a clinic with over 3000 patients this is what I am told from your management.    None of this was disclosed to my daughter or me when YOU took the payment of $400.00.        Because of the service today, we are not confident your clinic is cabalbe of doing acceptable dental work.    I am asking that you refund, me the entire $400.00 since really nothing was even done.    You wasted 4 hours of my daughters time, 2 hours of a family friend who took her, and over an hour and a half of my time calling and writing this letter.     If I were to bill you for my time, you would owe me $65.00 that does not include gas and frustration.     The crown is not ordered, your dentistry is less than standard, and your practices are unethical we walked away with nothing, so that is what you should be paid, nothing.   You prey upon people with no money and individuals without insurance who have no one to turn to  and then you hold them hostage, while you sit on the money they paid you.  You make excuses for your sub-standard work, and then try to collect a $100.00 for services that are not rendered?  NOT ACCEPTABLE    I believe even $50.00 is more than your service is worth, but I will settle for it.     I am asking Grandpas dental to refund, the $350.00 immediately to my account.   I will be expecting a call ASAP, regarding the refund.   If this is not done quickly and with the same speed you so greedily took my money, I will seek further action in court, with the licensing board, and any other agency who will listen.    ",  Dental Services

										So I just got home from the most traumatic dental experience in my life. I've had one wisdom tooth extracted at another oral surgeon in Manhattan, NY and it went perfectly ok. Healed nicely too. So after I went to the dentist yesterday, he suggested I get the other three removed since I was having pain in my other lower wisdom teeth and that one of my top one was growing horizontal.
I scheduled a consultation and was thinking that this would be a standard procedure and that I'd done it all before. I checked online, just to make sure that this place wasn't a dump and was pleasantly surprised that some people did their consultation and extraction the same day. So of course I called ahead and scheduled it all today.
When I got there, the place - was disgusting. Very old looking, ripped sofas, dirty windows in rooms! The receptionists were nasty and demanded payment upfront, which normally isnt a big deal for me but in this instance I should have followed my instincts. ""Your insurance doesn't cover going under,
just local anesthesia"" she said. Ok, no big deal...I have a high pain tolerance and I didn't go under for the last one.
Once Dr. Jules Roberts came in, he said ""Wait, you're not going under?"", and I said ""no, insurance doesn't cover it."" ""You don't have anyone who will help cover it?"" - wait, what? I asked how much
it was. $650. Ok, so I work for the City and I'm not ballin' but really? He asked me FIVE times....Yes, FIVE times. Come on! I don't want to spend that kind of money on a 20 minute procedure! And please, I'm too old to be asking my parents for money for dental procedures...
Anyways, he gets started on anesthesia. Wait...what happened to the consultation? Well, I guess he knows what he's doing so I just let him do it. The procedure goes well, the usual push and pull and awkward pressure...but imagine the ABSOLUTE HORROR on my face when he asks for the Suture. Ok, my knowledge of medicine is minimal and probably came from playing that surgical
game on the DS, but I know that Suture means Stitches. WHY are you putting STITCHES in my mouth?! He chuckles at the horrified expression on my face - ""Oh, I had to cut your gum and break some bone to get it out"". -First of all, that might be regular procedure, but you totally FAILED to
mention this to me before you started. I think I was in shock for a few moments, but he cleaned up and said ""follow me"" - and out the door.
They gave me some vicodin and showed me out the door. This place is disgusting and I dont recommend anyone to go to North Shore Oral Maxillofacial Surgery PC in Plainview unless you want to experience what I went through.  I was not even given a fair consultation, especially when they knew that there was a difficult extraction. To top this all off I received a collections letter from them demanding I pay for the anesthesia that I didnt even want in the first place.

										When I lost a tooth and a couple of years ago I thought that I may want to have it replaced, so I had an implant put in.  I recently decieded to have a crown put in because my teeth were moving.  I was under the under the impression my dental plan states that it pays just under half on a crown.  They had covered my crown before.  After having the crown put in I then received a notice from Delta Dental stating that they will not pay for anything.  When I contacted them they simply stated that since it was a crown on an implant it was not covered.  I then asked if it was a regular crown if they would cover it and they said yes.  But because I had an implant I they don't pay anything.  I asked them if this was fair and they simply said that they do not cover this.  I then asked if there was any recourse I had to try and get them to cover it and they kept telling me that it was not covered.  What a scam.  I had this crown put in under the assumption that they would cover part of it.  They told me that if it was a normal crown they would pay for it but because it was over am implant they would not pay anything.  Now they say that I can't do anything  about it because it is not covered.   Don't sign up for Delta Dental.  They are dental insurance Nazi's.  They don't care about you one bit.   									",  Dental Services

 I called back  a couple days later to see if just a regular cleaning could be done, the receptionist stated that with the dentist diagnosis that he could just do the regular cleaning.  I went back to talk the dentist face to face. I explained I just wanted th regular cleaning, that the extensive cleaning was not in my budget, my teeth were cavity free, felt great and I did not want the procedure done.
 The dentist stated the he could not do this and ""feel' good about it, that it was like going to your  medical doctor and being told you had lung cancer! Really!!! I said, "" This disease is like lung cancer!!!!!""OMG! He back off on this as he realized he overstated the obvious.I asked if my teeth would fall out, no. 
 
Outcome of this is, Coast Dental provides dental care at marketing prices. They are a franchise. They deal in add-ons, not the basic routine stuff, but money makers. Not totally bad but you are not given any options. I believe I should have a choice in the matter and I do. I cancelled my appointment and went with another dentist who will perform the treatment according to my choice, not the dentist. 
Should have checked this company before, shame on me.									",  Dental Services

										Top Gum Dental in Lane Cove used to be good when Dr. Caroline Nguyen was there, but when she left I got big disasters each time I deal with Dr. Michael Ho. The first time I saw him was when I needed to get a crown. I went there because they have my dental records. I had to wait for Dr. Ho for half an hour. While in the middle of my treatment, their machine overheated so they could not give me my crown that day. I tried to negotiate schedule with Michael Ho but he could not do it til after a week because it's Chinese New Year. I never learned the first time, and I went back there to have my retainers done. They were the only one available when I got a day off so I took my chance again. Another drama happened. They said I that don't have to pay anything because my health fund covered it. After a week, I found out that they charged my health fund double and they told me that there's no way that they can reverse the payment. I will never go back there again.

The advertisement said that, if I call within 20 minutes, I will get various things included (INCLUDING FREE DELIVERY) FOR A TOTAL OF $59.95 AND NO MORE.When I called, it was a FULLY AUTOMATED order desk, and it became obvious that they were not going to credit me for having called within 20 minutes, and the bill kept rising. It rose to $117.34This amounts to fraudulent advertising.
I hung up the phone and immediately went online to see if I could cancel immediately. All I could get was an online chat room agent, who said there was no way that the order could be cancelled by her, and I would have to phone the office when it opened. I phoned at just after 10 a.m. December 24 when the office opened and tried to cancel the order, but they would not let me. I was quite obviously dealing with India.I immediately phoned Visa and they said I would have to receive the parcel and then ship it back, retaining proof. This I did, but still I had to fight with them for the refund. For reasons best known to themselves, they had charged me $75.78 on December 24, and had plans to charge me the other $44 or so on January 23. I don't know why.Despite proof of return, they kept dragging out the refund, and then finally they said they had refunded me $55.68, saying they were keeping the tax. This is quite simply ILLEGAL. I cannot pay tax on goods that I do not have. If we take something back to a store, they refund us the full amount and do not hold back tax.This company is operating outside the law. It has a warehouse at 5130 Halford Drive, Windsor, Ontario, N9A 6J3. Its head office is in Ontario California but it operates out of India.They are running a fraudulent advertising campaign and right from the beginning, according to British Columbia law, I had the right to cancel within seven days. I tried within seven minutes and they would not allow it. It cost me $17.44 to receive the item and send it back to them, and they have no right to charge taxes for goods that I have not had. This is simply illegal. Furthermore, the item should never have been shipped to me in the first place as I attempted to cancel the order within minutes, and they simply refused to cancel the order. I should not have had to pay any delivery charges.
They should have been refunded in light of their refusal to cancel.   I spoke with an agent at Revenue Canada 1-800-959-5525 regarding returned goods, and he told me that I am entitled to receive the full taxes back because I had returned the goods. They have simply pocketed the tax.

										On August 12 of this year I had a crown fall off (I believe the dentist actually called what I had an onlay). I disclosed with my dentist the crown was fairly new, and I was frustrated it would fall off. He had two suggestions for me:
1. Go back to my old dentist to discuss how to fix the broken crown. 
2. Have a new root canal performed, and crown put on by your office. 
Going back to my old dentist was not a choice I was going to make willingly as I felt extremely taken advantage of by him. Upon hearing my dentist from Coast tell me he didnt believe the onlay should have been performed, and there was little chance of it being affective, my mind was made up. I would be getting my procedure taken care of by their office. 
I had my charges explained to me, we agreed on our price, and I had the procedures done. Almost 4 months later, I received a bill for $190 because the tooth wouldn't be covered by my insurance as they only cover the same tooth to be worked on every 5 years. I had disclosed to my dentist the tooth was only two years old. (Coincidentally this bill came 2 weeks after I informed my dentist I was switching insurance companies, and would no longer be going to their office.) Had I been explained the insurance wouldnt pay for my tooth, I would have gone to the old dentist one last time to get the work fixed. I was cutting my losses for what I believed to be an acceptable price. I was told it is my responsibility to understand what my insurance will cover. I can understand that to a point, but I don't believe I should need  to call my insurance while sitting in the dentist's chair waiting for the procedure to be done.  
I don't understand how this office is allowed to take no responsibility for their failure to communicate with the insurance company with what is and is not covered. What stops this company from misrepresenting the true costs of a procedure to the client? It's not as if, after I have the procedure done, I can have it reversed due to their negligence.
Because of this, I will never be able to trust what my doctor says. I will be forced to call the insurance, and have a three-way conversation with the dentist office, the insurance company, and myself.									",  Dental Services

										This Waterford MI Dentist engages in illegal and abusive collection tactics. His office has sent my mother, an elderly woman, to collections for payment of services that her DAUGHTER received. 
My mother isn't even a patient of Dr. Warr and has NEVER been a patient!!  I find it absolutely deplorable that anyone could stoop to the level of harassing a senior citizen for payment of services he provided for her daughter.  
This dentist sent several threatening collection letters attempting to enforce some sort of verbal arrangement, and then proceeded to assign my sister's account to a collection agency in MY MOTHER'S NAME, so that the collection agency could  continue harassing my mother (a senior citizen) by illegally extort money from her.  Well, following collection laws, the collection agency was notified to ""validate"" this alleged debt, and of course,  they were unable to provide proof that this is a valid debt. [continued below]....
									
										..... 
This deplorable and abusive tactic needs to be known by all who may consider this dentist. It is pathetically sad that a professional would attempt to extort money from a vulnerable elderly woman simply because he feels he cannot receive payment from his patient.
He was even notified in writing that he should cease all attempts to collect from my mother, and to please contact the actual patient.  The least he could do is send the patient to collections, and not her elderly mother who has NOTHING to do with the services received. But no, he is obviously attempting to collect from whomever he believes will be easiest to collect from.

										Scheduled appointment to get my teeth cleaned.  I have great dental insurance that I pay about $700 a year for family coverage.  Unfortunately they have a monopoly and are the only dentist office in town that takes dental insurance.
As soon as I sat down, they put a document in my lap saying that I was going to be charged $55.00 beyond what my insurance pays. $5 for office visit and $50 for oral cancer screening.  Playing this off as if it is a typical/required service.  They haven't even looked in my mouth yet!  I am a non-smoker, nor do I use tobacco.  I am at very low risk for oral cancer.  I refused this added service.  They were very rude.  They told me I had to sign a document stating that I refused the service, which I did.
Then they took a bunch of xrays and looked at my teeth and gums calling out numbers for each tooth.  I once again told them that all I wanted was a regular teeth cleaning.
Then finally the dentist came in.  The first thing she asked was where I worked (I guess she was sizing me up for how much she would try to scam me out of).   She looked in my mouth and said that I needed deep cleaning and it would cost $98 out of pocket for me.  I told her that all I wanted was the regular dental cleaning that was free with my insurance.  She said that she would not allow that because she would be liable and her license would be at risk.  I told her that I would sign whatever release/waiver that they needed, just as I had done on the cancer screening that I had refused that all I wanted done was a regular dental cleaning.  She refused.  So now I've got $700 a year dental insurance and I can't even get my teeth cleaned.  My teeth are fine.
I contacted my dental insurance company and they told me that if I could find another dentist in town that is not a provider on my plan that I would have to pay the full amount out of my pocket and then submit the bill to the insurance company as a grievance.  I have an appointment with a dentist for March 1 to get this done.  It only cost $69 for the cleaning.  I think I will not take out the dental insurance in the future.
Also....I asked the dentist how I was better off in her opinion by not getting my teeth cleaned at all over having the regular cleaning.  She didn't have an answer, because there isn't one.  She is unprofessional and more interested in padding her wallet than to providing me the dental services that I deserved.  I called them back and told them that I felt that I was being discriminated against by them because they were not providing me a service that they offer.
Anyway....Stay away from Coast Dental in Lake City....You will be glad that you did.

										I went into this office several months ago to get a tooth fixed.  The filing fell out.  They told me I needed full xrays because it had been over 1 year since the last ones.  Then, I needed a full scale cleaning.  Then, the dentist spent 5 minutes replacing the filling in my tooth.  He said it was, ""any easy one"".   It was a top, front tooth, no pain killer was necessary - very simple.
While sitting in the chair waiting for the dentist, the finance girl came in needing my signature.  I am fortunate to have insurance and was told that my ONLY out of pocket expense would be $35, which I paid when I was there.
Several weeks later I received a notice from my insurance company that they were billed $2,000 and was only paying about $300.  This leaves an overhang of about $1,700.   Looking at the charges they submitted to the insurance company, it looks like they are inflated with multiple charges for the same thing.
If I had been told by the staff that the Insurance company may not pay or that I might get stuck with a bill for $1,700, I would have passed on the xrays and cleaning.  I just wanted to get my tooth fixed!!!  Most of my top teeth are capped anyway and I don't think I really needed the xrays and cleaning - especially if it's going to cost me $1,700!!!  I do not have an extra $1,700 laying around to pay for something THEY told me the insurance would pay.
I was not provided with accurate information so that I could make a informed decision concerning which services to agree to.  I don't know if they are incompetent or unethical but the bottom line is that you can not rely or trust what they tell concerning the cost of their services, especially if you have insurance.

										My dentist referred me to Dr. Abdel Fattah in Boca Raton, FL after having a root canal in their offices over 2 1/2 months ago. They told me that he was a dentist who ""specialized"" in pain disorders. They said they believe I had TMJ becuz I was in excruciating pain after the root canal. So I made an appt. to see him on 11/23/11. After a series of tests, he indicated that I had TMJ Disorder, which stands for Temporomandibular Joint in your jaw/skull. I explained to him I was in excruciating, throbbing pain which seemed to be coming from my upper molar (which I had the root canal on). He suggested I go get a 2nd root canal. Since this was the day before Thanksgiving, my endodontist was booked. So Dr. Fattah ""referred"" me to someone he knew (which I'm SURE he got a kick-back from!). So, I went to see this Endodontist which performed a 2nd root canal next to the other tooth. A week passed, two weeks - I was STILL in pain. The endodontist couldn't explain it since all nerves were removed from both teeth!A month later (now December) I finished both root canals & had temporary fillings put in. I was STILL having throbbing, excruciating pain! I called Dr. Fattah's office again out of desperation! Dr. Fattah was not only inconsiderate & rude in his bedside manner but uncompassionate towards the pain I was in. Right away, he said I would need different shots to ""determine where the pain was coming from"". As hesitant as I was, I was desperate for some kind of relief. So I let him give me the most HORRIFIC, PAINFUL shots to the outer side of my face! There was no anesthesia..just a cold spray prior to the shots! I screamed at how PAINFUL the shots were. He had the AUDACITY to tell me to ""BE QUIET BECUZ I WAS GOING TO SCARE THE OTHER PATIENTS THAT WERE THERE"" and I replied, ""I DON'T CARE..THIS HURT!"" And he replied rudely, ""WELL I DO CARE!"" I couldn't believe the way I was getting treated. The shots relieved the pain..yes temporarily! Each shot was a whopping $125.00! Then he told me he wanted me to go get an CT-Scan at one of his ""fellow friend's"" office (another dentist next door) which I'm sure he got a kick-back for that too! My dental insurance was maxxed out for the year so I had to pay $150.00 for that CT-Scan! Dr. Fattah told me to go back to his office after I got the CT-Scan so he could ""INTERPRET"" it. I went back there and he said I had ""bone loss"" in my jaw joint (which now it turns out another dentist who READ the REPORT says it is nothing significant!). Then he said to go get an MRI!! I drove far away to an MRI center & had to pay $250.00 co-pay for an MRI! After going through 1 hr. of different, painful tests in my mouth inside the MRI tunnel, I had to go back to Dr. Fattah!Dr. Fattah looked at the MRI disc & said I had ""inflammation of the facial muscle"" which was causing this pain. (I was charged for him looking at the MRI disc also!).  I did not know any better, so everything he was telling me I believed & we went along with! He said I would need an Ultrasound treatment & that I may see relief from it. So, I went along and accepted what he said. He charged me another $100.00 for an ultrasound treatment that lasted LESS than 1/2 HOUR! He then prescribed ""Soma"" which is a muscle relaxant and said to take it for several weeks..which I did. It didn't do anything. He said to take Ibuprofen 600 mg. which also DIDN'T do anything! That entire office visit that day ended up costing me $570.00. He charged me for the office consultation $110.00, $250.00 for the shots, another $110.00 to ""read"" the reports, and another $100.00 for the useless ultrasound!!! I couldn't believe it. I tried explaining to the girl at the front desk (who is also rude!) that I had Blue Cross Blue Shield, but she said they DON'T accept any insurance. That is was ""up to me"" to file it with them - which I tried doing but they said I had a huge deductible that I had not met..so I was ultimately responsible for this bill!   So, one week passes, two weeks, three weeks pass & I'm STILL in pain, the throbbing is there every minute of the day. So I decided to make an appt. with my primary care physician a couple of weeks ago. After reviewing my MRI & CT-Scan reports, he said he did not believe it was TMJ that could be causing this pain. He said to go get a 2nd opinion from another doctor! So I did. I decided to go see my mother's dentist in Miami, FL last week who is very good. He read every report, looked at the MRI disc & CT-Scan, read what this other scam artist did to me...and he disagreed that the TMJ was what was causing this pain. He said he believed it was being caused by the Trigeminal Nerve in my face...thus called ""Trigeminal Nerve Disorder"". So he said I needed to see a Neurologist to put me on some Tegretol (which is an anticonvulsant but also used to treat this condition). I called my M.D. and he was nice enough to call in a prescription for it. But said I do need to go see a Neurologist when it runs out in order to increase the dosage & get labwork. I am still in pain but I just started taking the medication and I was told it could be a week or two before I see relief.I am filing this report to WARN people NOT to be scammed by this dentist. He robbed me of almost $600.00 in one visit - not to mention the MRI & CT-Scan I had to get done! He has a fancy office, in an affluent community of Boca Raton so you think he is trustworthy. He is rude, cold and ruthless! He doesn't care about his patient's pain & how much they are suffering - on the contrary, he takes advantage of this to be able to rip them off. When you are desperately in pain, you are willing to do anything, pay anything to get relief - and that's what he does. He takes advantage of poor people like me that went to see him!But I am disputing the charges with my Visa credit card in hopes of being able to reverse the charges. I hope that anyone who reads this doesn't go see him! You have been warned!!   									",  Dental Services

This was the absolute worst experience I've ever had in dealing with a dentist and felt it was necessary to warn anyone even thinking about having treatment at this office. I can't believe that these type of scam artists are still in business. I tried resolving the issue with them, but they will not budge and have threatened to send me to a collection agency. Another thing in the FINE print that you rush you to sign before treatment states that they have the right to charge you an upsurd finance charge that begins from the start of the treatment. This office is a disgrace to the profession of dentistry.									",  Dental Services

Cartersville, Georgia United States of America ", , ,"Affordable Dentures  Poor quality dentures, do not stand behind their work! Cartersville, Georgia","
										Let me start by saying I have worn both a top and bottom partial denture made by Dr. Lowry from Cartersville, Ga for over 10 years with absolutely no problems what so ever. In July of 2010 I had to have another tooth added to my lower partial and since Dr. Lowry has retired I went to the Affordable Denture company here in Cartersville. They advised me they could not add another tooth to the partial I had and would have to purchase a new one from them, which I did so in July 2010. At that time they had 3 different grades of dentures: Economy, Custom, Premium. Instead of paying the lowest price I paid more for the ""Custom"" partial because I thought it would be better made and last longer. When they finished my plate I noticed that the gum in it was very thin. At this time I expressed my concern but was told it was a new type of material than the one I had before but was assured it was just as strong and would last for years. In November of 2011 I was simply drying my plate with a soft hand towel and it just broke in half in my hand. I made and appointment and took the plate in for repair. At that time I was told I would have to pay $145 (1/3 of the new price) to have the repair done. After expressing my disagreement with the fee I told them to fix it because at that time I had no other options.... I paid them the $145.00 and two days later on Monday received my partial. Within a couple hours the partial starting cutting into my mouth and of course I am unable to wear it. I called and was told it would be 2 more days before I can get an appointment to fix it. I am still going without my bottom partial at this time.  I would absolutely NOT RECOMMEND anyone use this company or at least the Cartersville office... They do very poor work and have even worse attitude when you try to get them to correct it... Not to mention the RIP OFF prices to repair something they didn't do correct to begin with....

										DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I bought the 30 second Smile from their website. At first I enjoyed this product, although I agree that the charges are ridiculous, my teeth seemed much cleaner. However, after only a few days I noticed that because my mouth is so small I was beginning to form sores at the back and sides of my mouth. Because I have a very small mouth, to clean those back teeth the product kept banging into my jaw. Also, the battery cap kept flying off mid-brush. So, the 30secs it was supposed to take turned into longer when I had to put not only the cap but the batteries that fell out back in again. I therefore decided to return the product. I took the risk and it failed so that's my fault. But what really made me angry is that I sent numerous customer service emails that were not returned. I waited a week and then I called but was told I had to call back in 15min for someone else to handle my issues. Strange and frustrating but I called back in 15mins. Then I'm told that not only do I have to pay for the product to be shipped back myself but that they will not refund $29.90 of my order... for what reason I do not know because the calling center is in India. It was not only hard to understand them but they only respond with pre-written answers. So when I asked a question not related to those responses they just responded with the same line over and over again. I know it is not the costumer service people's fault but this company has really horrible business model and does not care about the people using their products. I would have given them an okay review if it wasn't for their blatant disregard of the customer. Do not get sucked into this. It is not worth the hassle or the shipping charges. I would never recommend this product to anyone even on a trial basis. You will pay more money to just get rid of it.									",  Dental Services

										As we can see on the photo attached the ridge defect is still there and abutments were implanted into my upper jaw inaccurately with different angle and too close in relation to each other.  That simply means the upper bone was not
regenerated as we agreed at the beginning and abutments should be implanted to beging with. I would not suffer a pain and financial loss.But, Dr Cha decided to go ahead and put the abutments. And instead separate crowns as we agreed, she installed the bridge. Since abutments were at different angles, these caused the bouncing effect on the bridge covering the gap and it kept falling down when I was eating. Besides, the absolutely unnecessary bone regeneration surgery was performed after the abutments were implanted which resulted in the cut down of my upper lip and eliminating the frenulum

After that Dr. Chas treatments I was afraid to put myself into her hands again and demanded the money back.  And, when Dr. Cha refused saying that this was the right way to do the procedure I had to suffer expenses paying different doctors to look for another opinion and find the right answer.

On nine visits to the office from October 20th through November 18th I experienced extreme malpractice and negligence from both Dr. Joseph Gaeta and Dr. Devo.  On October 20th I came in to the office of Celebrity Smiles with a bad toothache and was seen by Dr. Devo to begin a root canal.  The root canal was completed October 27th and on that same day the dentist began to file down my perfect tooth for an abutment and bridgework. After repeated visits and confirmations that the root canal was very good I became worried that indeed something was wrong because the pain was so bad. So I took the matter into my own hands and went to get a second opinion. I went to Dr. Moitoso and he took an xray and discovered the problem.  The root canals were not filled up to the apex and are about 2mm short of being properly sealed, therefore your infection will get worse. He referred me to an endodontist and I went the next day. He took another xray and said the canals are not filled enough, and to do another root canal with that infection would most likely fail.  I then proceeded to get in to have the tooth extracted immediately. Dr. Ballentine had to surgically elevate and section the tooth carefully to be sure it was completely out, which he then had to stitch the gums. Celebrity Smiles damaged a perfect tooth with a painful abutment which now needs a crown. I paid Celebrity Smiles $2,100.00 for ruining my teeth!  His practice is unethical and cruel. This dentist needs disciplinary action now! His records show an order of probation for a similiar case such as mine. The state of Florida Board of Dentistry show many sanctions and unethical practice. I also want to mention that Dr. Devo also began temporary bridgework the same day the root canal was done. He used my good tooth as an abutment and ruined a perfect tooth! ",  Dental Services

Dr. Joseph Gaeta is my assigned dentist, however unavailable at the time so I am told to see Dr. Devo who also practices with Dr. Gaeta.  I was told immediatly that I needed a root canal so he began the procedure to relieve the pain I was in.  The canals were infected, so he drained them awhile and placed files to measure them. He then placed a temporary filling and sealed the tooth. We talked about possibly doing a bridge later on.  The next day October 21st I called and came in to the office still in pain. Dr. Gaeta saw me after waiting two hours to speak to him in the dentist chair. I said the tooth still hurts fix it now while its still fresh. He then said I don't want to go in and irritate that again just wait a few days for the inflamation to calm down. I will be out of town this weekend and you can come in next week to see Dr. Devo again. So then I waited for my next available apt. on Monday October 24th. Dr. Devo said wait until the 27th when I can finish the root canal.  When I came in the 27th he finished the root canal.  Then I noticed he began to file both my teeth down right away without even explaining to me what he was doing. His assistant began to make the impressions for a temporary bridge and very quickly made them up and glued it on my newly finished root canal(which turns out that it was done wrong anyway). I was in pain until a post opt check on November 8th, they looked at the xrays of the finished root canal and said it was very well done and it will soon feel better.  It felt so much worse I thought they were intentionally torturing me so I took the matter into my own hands. I contacted another dentist quickly on november 16th for a second opinion. Dr Moitoso took an xray and immediately noticed something wrong.  The canals are about 2mm short of reaching the apex and your infection is propagating fast. He referred me to Endodontist Associates for an apt. the next day on november 17th, and the endodontist on staff there took another xray and discovered that the root canals were not filled enough therefore not reaching the apex causing severe infection and pain. Immediately I went home and called my other dentist who extracted my other two failed root canals by Dr. Geary Yamashita of Coast Dental. Dr. Ballentine had made it clear to me after calling him that he would take care of me right away. So today November 21st. I went to see him for an emergency extraction of the infected failed root canal. The tooth was a difficult extraction that required special tools to elevate the tooth out in sections,and then needed to surgically stitch the opening. The relief was felt right away.

										Here is my opinion of Dr. Julie Holloway.  First of all she never worked on my mouth.  Here is what happened... I was in treatment at the clinic she worked at.  I was sent to her so as to have restorative work done.  Without examining me properly she gave me two treatment options.  I took her advice on which option to proceed with.  I then spent the next year having a great deal of preparatory work done on my mouth in keeping with Dr. Holloway's treatment plan.  I spent $6000.00, endured about 45 trips to the dentist, sometimes all day visits, endured about 150 of those painful shots, and had to drive a total of 4500 miles since my house is 100 miles rountrip from the clinic.  And after all of this, they informed me that they couldn't do the treatment plan they had proposed.  So instead of telling me they had made a mistake and working out the problem, Dr. Holloway, who was in charge of my treatment had everyone involved deceive me.  They made a slick attempt to get me to agree to another treatment plan that was far inferior to the one I had worked toward for over a year.  When I wouldn't agree to this inferior plan, Dr. Holloway dismissed me as a patient.  Now I have to have all of the dental work torn off and start the whole thing over again!!!  I tried to work out the situation without litigation but Dr. Holloway would have nothing to do with it.  So I sued the clinic for malpractice and because Dr. Holloway was the person in charge of my treatment, she was deposed under oath.  She didn't just stretch the truth.  She lied under oath dozens of times!  I think it's disturbing how someone in such a position of responsibility can so flagrantly lie under oath.  Not to mention violating the Hippocratic oath she took when she became a doctor, when she swore not to ""misrepresent"".  It is also noteable that this woman spent her life in Ohio and spent her whole career at Ohio State.  Shortly after the clinic was sued however, she resigned and moved out of state to the University of Iowa.  Did they pressure her to leave?  To sum up, I don't know how good of a dentist this woman is, but I do know that if she ever makes a mistake, she will lie about it; even under oath...  There is no question about that.  If you have another prosthodontist you can go to, I would do it.  Stay away from Dr. Julie Holloway.  She is dishonest and unethical.   									",  Dental Services

										Here is my opinion of Dr. Landry,
First and foremost this guy's dental skills are not even average.  They are sub par at best.  He doesn't seem to care if he inflicts pain while he is working on you.  He is painfully slow and once took over 10 hours to put a crown on my tooth.  I have 4 crowns in my mouth that he put on and they all have to be re done.
Another time I had a huge bubble of puss on the upper part of my mouth.  I told Dr. Landry about it and he said ""Oh that will go away once we put your crown on"".  Well he didn't explore the reason for the bubble of puss and weeks went by and eventually that tooth by the bubble just broke off.  I then had to have a root canal, and then they had to amputate one of the roots of my tooth.  All because this guy ignored my symptoms.
He is not a good dentist.
That is not this guy's worst quality however.  I was his patient at a clinic he worked at and during the course of my treatment the clinic made a terrible mistake.  They put me in a treatment plan that required I have a great deal of preparatory work done on my back teeth before proceeding with additional treatment.  A year and a half of treatment, I spent 6000$, endured 45 total days in the dental chair(about 30 with this guy), had to endure about 150 of those painful shots, and drive a total of 4500 miles for treatment since my house is 100 miles roundtrip from the clinic.  After enduring all of this, the clinic informed me that they couldn't do the original treatment plan I had agreed to and they tried to pass off this inferior treatment plan on me.  I objected and refused to agree to the inferior treatment plan.  I eventually had to sue the clinic.  Dr. Landry was very involved in my treatment and so he was deposed under oath.  Under aoth he didn't just distort the truth.  He blatantly lied dozens of times!
To sum it up, in my opinion this guy is a terrible dentist.  He is dishonest and unethical.  If you need a dentist, look elsewhere.  You'll regret it if you go to him. 									",  Dental Services

I continued to keep the conversation respectful.I explained again I have been informed by other dentists that I should not have been charged those fees that I went over all of the codes and charges with the other dentists and they said I should not have been charged the fees they charged me above and beyond what they submitted to the insurance.Her final response to me was that I do not even have the etiquette to talk to people and her conversation with me was done a long time ago.I hope this post along with the many many other complaints I have come across will help so that others will be aware of the dentists business practices and not have to go through the same treatment I did.Also there  are lists and lists of complaints about coast dental in every state and at least 57 listed for this office on the Better Business Bureau. They currently have a rating of C- and I'm surprised they even got that much.Any suggestions that may be of help to me in recovering the fees I was overcharged would be greatly appreciated. So far talking to them has gotten me nowhere but to be informed that I am not in my right mind and I don't even have the etiquette to talk to people. Being told that by a manager of a health services provider after paying a significant amount of money for their services only to find that you have been overcharged fees which other dentists in the area is completely unacceptable.

										On Saturday, 8/6/11 I had a 3pm appointment to see an oral surgeon to have a wisdom tooth extracted. This was a followup appointment for a procedure I already had an existing contract for. 
I arrived at 2:45pm and signed in on the electronic monitor screen. When I arrived, no one was at the front desk. 5 mins later someone did appear, but they did not approach me and worked on something else behind the counter, completely ignoring me. Finally, about 5 mins after that, someone else appeared and confirmed my appointment. Please note that all the person did was confirm my appointment and then asked me to have a seat. 
At 3:15pm one of the attendants at the counter asked me to come back up to the counter and said there was a problem with the original contract I signed from my original visit a few weeks ago. Elizabeth and another lady at the counter told me that the price for the tooth extraction on the contract needed to be increased because they put down the wrong procedure name for the extraction. On the original contract they put down Partial Bony Extraction and they said they needed to change it to Full Bony Extraction, which would thereby increase the price because the specialist told them to. I told them that that was not the original contract I signed and that they could not just arbitrarily increase the price. When they were discussing with me the reason I had to pay more money, they were very short and curt with me and not at all personable. They then asked me to have a seat and said they would need to talk with a Specialist. 
I sat back down and noticed that another person in the waiting room was on his cell phone complaining about a similar issue--that Western Dental just arbitrarily increased the price on an item on his signed contract and was expecting him to pay the increased price. I also noticed during his cell phone conversation that he said he had already been waiting 2 hours to be seen and was thinking of ""telling them to forget the whole thing and just walk out."" While I was waiting I also noticed that some of the clerks behind the counter were discussing how much they should charge me instead--as if they could just simply change the price of anything on the contract and charge me extra for any of the payments. 
I waited an hour and fifteen minutes in the waiting room until Elizabeth at the counter decided that she was going to ask what was taking so long. Claudia, the supervisor, then came in and told me it was going to be another 30 to 45 minutes before the surgeon could see me. When I asked Claudia why Western Dental did not notify they were running behind schedule and why no phone call was made to me to notify me she simply said, ""Sorry we did not do so."" 
Several minutes later Dr. Collins came back to the counter to speak with me. What surprised me right away was his tone of voice--it had an angry tone to it and was patronizing and became more angry during the course of his conversation with me. I asked Dr. Collins the following questions: 
1. If Western Dental has the right to just arbitrarily change the price on any item on a contract after it is signed, why was I not explicitly told this when I signed the contract? 
2. Why did Western Dental wait to tell me until the day I walked in for the appointment that they were going to increase the price for something on a contract that I had already signed? 
Dr. Collins responded by pointing out the small title at the top of the contract. Dr. Collins told me that the small font title says, ""Patient Estimator Worksheet"". Dr. Collins told me that because the contract is called a Patient Estimator Worksheet all the prices on the sheet are estimates. Dr. Collins told me it was not his problem that I did not ""notice the fine print."" As I attempted to ask him further questions, he interrupted me and then interjected that if I did not like it, I could just leave. I then asked him why he was suddenly changing his voice tone and he rebuffed me and said he wasn't and then turned his back on me and walked out of the room before I could say anything else. 
Elizabeth then asked me if I wanted to have the procedure done or not. I told her I didn't have a choice and needed it done. I then told Elizabeth that I was unhappy with Western Dental's treatment towards me and told her that I was cancelling my follow up appointment (which would have been a follow up appointment for a deep teeth cleaning Western Dental had done previously) and I would not be doing further business with Western Dental. She then printed up a new contract and had me sign it. After I was done signing it, Dr. Collins casually walked back into the room and 
pretended that he had never been angry at all and pretended to act happy towards me as he smiled and asked if everything was fixed up with the new contract. After Dr. Collins left the room, it was then that Elizabeth told me that some part of the equipment in the back room had a failure and that was why everything was running behind schedule that day. 
I was not taken back to begin my procedure until 5pm (my appointment was at 3pm). I waited in the waiting room for 2 hours and 15 minutes. It was not until after my procedure was complete and I returned to the waiting room that the front desk attendants started acting personable towards me. 
Here is where Western Dental failed on 8/6/11 and where I question the company's professional integrity: 
1. If they knew there was an equipment failure, why did they not inform me of this beforehand? 
2. If they knew they were running behind schedule, why did they not inform me earlier in the day? (A phone call to the cell phone they have for me on file would have been a good gesture.) 
3. If they knew they were running behind schedule, why did they wait an hour and fifteen minutes before they decided to tell me that in the waiting room? 
4. Why did they not explicitly tell me that their company arbitrarily can and does change the prices on all items on a contract, regardless of whether the contract has already been signed or not? 
5. Do they consider Dr. Collins's behavior towards me on 8/6/11 to be professional? 
6. Do they consider their business' behavior toward me on 8/6/11 to be professional? 
As a result of the above, Western Dental sent me a letter in September 2011 and claimed to have issued me a $60 credit on my account.  I called in to their corporate office on 10/4/11 to confirm that this credit was added and that I did not owe them any additional money (since I was making my final payment to their company on that day over the phone).  They confirmed this, and confirmed the credit had been added, and said the only additional money owed was by my insurance company.  Two weeks later I began receiving phone calls, about 4 times a day, sometimes as late as 7 or 8 at night, and sometimes within 10 minutes of each other.  The messages they left were just for me to, ""Call WesternDental.""  None of the messages stated what the matter was concerning.
On 10/27/11, I spent my entire lunch hour on my cell phone with Western Dental.  The person I spoke with told me several things that did not make sense:
1. That I only paid about 80 something dollars when I last called the company to make a payment and that because I did not pay the remainder at that time (which was the amount that their company claimed to have credited my account on that day)  I was being assessed a late fee in addition to the 60 dollars the company claimed that I owed (this should have been for the 60 dollars that Western Dental originally told me was applied as credit on my account on the same day I made my last payment).
2. That I was responsible for this remaining amount and the late fee (and the customer service representative told me during the call that she confirmed this with her supervisor).
3.  That any issues with this amount had to actually be taken up with the local office, not the corporate office. 
I told the customer service rep with that none of that made sense and asked to speak with a supervisor.  She then put me on hold for 45 minutes (until I finally was forced to hang up because my lunch hour ended) and nothing was resolved.  At no point did she pick up the phone again after she claimed she was transferring me to her supervisor.  At the very least, she could have picked up the line again and asked me if I wanted to call back at a different time.
 
It is apparent to me that Western Dental, even at the corporate level, likes to lie to its customers.  This is evidenced by the fact that even though they claimed they were applying a credit to my account on the same day that I made my last payment (in order to make my balance on that day a $0 balance and the remaining amount would be paid by my insurance company), they actually decided to lie to me instead and not apply that credit.  
They furthermore felt it was appropriate to assess a late fee to their own negligence and attempt to bill me an additional 20 something dollars for an amount that should have already been credited to my account.  In addition, they love to harass their customersthis is evidenced by the fact that they decided to call me up to 4 times a day (sometimes as late as 7pm or 8pm and sometimes with calls that were within 10 minutes of each other) to attempt to claim this amount of money that I did not owe them.
And on 10/28/11, Western Dental sent me an email reminding me of an appointment they claimed I had made for February.  I had explicitly told the Western Dental clerk back in August that all my appointments with the company should be cancelled, but I guess they decided to ignore me. 
Western Dental sent me a separate email on 10/28/11 stating that the my account was being audited as a result of the email I had sent them. 									",  Dental Services

Don't go see Dr. (if you can call him that) Kirk Kimmerling unless you enjoy pain and being laughed at. I went to Dr. Kimmerling's office to see about having a tooth pulled. This was about 4:00 in the afternoon and the receptionist said there was a good chance he could do it right away, That should have been a clue that although he's been there a lot of years (I believe they said 10) he must not be able to keep many patients. I know he doesn't if he treats them like he did me. He pulled my tooth and decided not to give me any pain medication since I told them I could not have Ibuprofen or Aspirin due to stomach problems. I really wasn't worried about it I really didn't expect a lot of pain but I was wrong. About an hour after I got home it started hurting and swelling and just got worse and worse. I called Dr. kimmerling who told me to come to his office the next day. I did and was taken back to a chair and he came in laughing at me shouting  Well you had a tooth pulled yesterday of course your going to have pain ha ha! I felt stupid and embarrassed in front of several nurses and my mother. I said its swollen and it hurts a lot he looked at it and said it was infected. Then I told him it wasn't funny that it hurt so much I couldn't sleep. He said when I called him I had slurred my words, and I told him I had the gauze in my mouth he had given me. He ask if I wanted something for pain, I said yes and he left the room and did not return, I would not go back to see him if he were the last dentist on earth. His lack of caring or compassion is unprofessional and has certainly lost him mine and my families business, not to mention a neighbor who we were about to refer to him.

This seem ridiculous so I recently went for a second opinion. A new dentist I found off of Angie's list, who was also on several ""best dentist"" lists only found 3 small cavities.

 I already paid Dr Moon for my sons braces with my income tax and now I was going to have to pay another doctor for the last four months.  At the time I had just started a new job so my dental benefits hadn't started yet, not for 90 days so I didn't have the money to pay this new dentist. By the time my benefits started and open enrollment to add my son on came around it had already been almost a year since he was last seen.  The new orthodontist told me that he would have to continue wearing his braces for another year and a half to two years and it would cost $2000.00!  He informed me that Dr Moon was not an orthodontist but he was and that's why it was going to cost more. 
The day I found out all of this there were a lot of other patients there for their appointments that were outraged which surprises me that there were no other reports on this.  Dr Moon is still apart of the new office because his name hasn't been removed.  The office is called Westwind Dental Moon Family Dentistry.  I of course did't and don't have the money to hire a lawyer or I would have done something about this when it happened.  Is there anything that can be done?  Can Dr Moon just walk out on his patients just like that without informing them that he was leaving?

Let me first state that Dr Stevens and staff sent me to the emergency room by not reading my chart and caused several other dental problems I didnt have before due to using possibly unsanitary needles and several injections with NO DENTAL work being performed. I clearly stated I have bad reactions to Novocain in my application for services and explained to the dental technician I was allergic and never got completely numb on it. The alternative is readily available and common but he gave me the wrong medicine.  He prescribed the wrong anti-biotic as well.
I paid in advance for several extractions, x-ray, and denture totaling over $1600. Half was in check and half on GE Credit Care card. I was given an impression for denture and told to come back in two hours for the extractions. When I came back and was in the chair with bad allergic reactions and unable to numb he said Go someplace else and left the room. Nothing more.
The lady at the desk informed me my check had already been deposited and I would have to wait for a refund. I immediately called my bank and killed the check because the upper denture was only $500 and said to bill my card for
the amount old which they already had. She didnt have the denture and said it would be ready later, that was on September 7, 2011. I was told over the phone I had to come in person and it is a 200 mile trip one way to talk to them and did so and on another occasion they told me to come and closed the office all day without contacting me to let me know.
We came to an agreement on the phone that I would only pay for the $500 denture about 30 days ago. It was to be delivered to another dentist by mail and it never arrived. I got the bill from GE Care Credit $775!

										I had my first appointment with Smilecare. I was examined and a list of dental procedures and material was formulated with a itemized cost of all procedures and materials. Included in this list was a denture, cost of over $2000.00. All fees were paid prior to completion of work.When I was fitted for the denture it was apparent that this device was not what I had been led to believe it to be. The device spanned across the inside lower teeth. I informed the dentist at this time that this is not going to be practical. She insisted that I try it out. I did...When biting into food the partial teeth dislodged from their sockets causing one to use both index fingers to reinsert them into their sockets with food still in ones mouth. When the denture moved it chewed into my gums causing sores. Not exactly a smooth operation. I told the dentist that the denture was not useable in the form it was designed. She offered no alternative.I asked for a refund at that time. The office manager required that I return the denture which I did at the time he submitted a refund request to the main office in Santa Ana, Ca. This wasover six months ago.. To this date there has been no refund or confirmation from the main office. I have contacted the local office numerous times to no avail. When I contact the main office I am put on hold or referred to the local office...This guys know what they're doing!In summation: This Dental operation is a shade tree operation at best and a total ""ripoff"".

Toms River, New Jersey United States of America ", , ,"Dr. Michael DiPietro, DMD  Coercive and belligerent billing tactics Toms River, New Jersey","
										1) Although I provided my insurance information 2 weeks in advance, the doctor's office had not contacted them before the day of treatment.2) After my treatment, which was only $100.00, the asked for full payment on the spot, and then asked me to sign a promissory note for full payment on my next vist. The promissory note was a ""balance billing"" contract stating that I was fully responsible for anything my insurance did not pay. When I asked if they were ""in plan"" with my insurance, they responded that they did not know.3) I refused to sign and insisted that they contact my insurance while I sat there. After some belligerent push back they finally did. They told me that I was liable for a $25 co-pay and a $50 deductible.  I paid the $75 on the spot with a credit card. I did not sign any promissory notes, which evoked even more belligerence from the staff. When I got home I independently called my insurance, and they said that I had no co-pay or deductible. Hmmmm. 4) As it turns out, the insurance company paid the $100 in full. That meant that the office owed me $75.00 in overcharges. When I called and spoke to the billing clerk, she refused to discuss the issue, and then refused access to the office manager. A month of phone tag did not result in a call back from the office manager. I finally had to contact my credit card company to dispute the charges. 5) That finally got the office manager on the phone with me, who, by the way, had never looked at my account before. In fact, it was only half way through the conversation that she realized that the office actually owed me money and they had disputed my credit-card charge reversal. And this was fifteen minutes into the argument, already. 6) When I asked why I had been refused service, I was told that I was a ""racist"", and that I had cursed at the billing the clerk, who is indeed a black person. Now, that totally amazed me, as I had not expected slander to be part of the billing experience. Apparantly a billing dispute with a black clerk makes me racist? And I had never used foul or racial language in discussing this matter. 7) As far as I can figure, the slander came about when the office manager asked the clerk who she was arguing with on the phone. In retailiation for my complaints, the clerk had lied about the content of our conversation. Having successfully blocked my access to the office manager, no other side of the story was given, or in fact solicited. The office manager should have called me at that point, but instead told the billing clerk to refuse service. 8) At this point, not only do they still owe me $75.00, which they extorted from me, they are now refusing to address the matter because of a bogus racial issue. My head is now reeling from just how dysfunctional this office really is. In speaking with the office manager, I hear the voice of the billing clerk in the background. It turns out that the office manager has me on speaker phone with the billing clerk in attendence. At first this is denied, then affirmed by the office manager. Again, simply amazing. 9) Now I am forced to get my credit card company to do a three way conference call with yet another person in the office, as the billing clerk and office manager are refusing to deal with me. They neither affirm nor deny the fact that they owe me money. They want to know how long they legally have to answer the question. The answer is thirty-days. That ends the conversation and the call. 10) I am still without the $75. The office has not responded officially, in writting, to any of my claims, or to the reversal of charges from my insurance company.  I do not even have an itemized bill of services rendered by the dentist. I do have and EOB from my insurance company stating the made 100% payment in full of their entire bill. 11) Throughout all of this, I was treated like a criminal for asking questions about insurance that seemed perfectly normal and legitimate, and for not accepting unusual and coercive billing practices. As icing on the cake, I was personally slandered. And through all of this, I never owed them a dime. They owed me a refund. 12) Beware. Particularly seniors. If these practices are not illegal in the state of NJ, they certainly should be. ",  Dental Services

										Dr.  Hung Le, Le & Luu Dental Group (Stonelake Dental) has poor service. They charged me about $300.00 for a service and later when I called my insurance, I found out that insurance paid much of the cost and my co-pay was only about $100.00. It was a hassle to get the dental office to correct their mistake. Then another time they wanted to charge me for examination and regular cleaning because they said that insurance doesnt cover it. Again I had to call my insurance and they said that the insurance is paying 100% of the examination. If I had not called the insurance, the dental office would have again over charged me. Then that same day dental office said that I needed deep cleaning. They said that the insurance is paying for the deep cleaning but they are not paying for the other add-on services worth about $300.00 they wanted to sell me. When I said that I will get only the deep cleaning done but I do not wish to get the other $300.00 add-on services they are trying to sell me since insurance doesnt cover the extras, they said that I cant get deep cleaning done at their office. They said that if I wanted the deep cleaning done, I have to pay $300.00 for the add-on extra services but if I choose not to get the add-on extra services, then they wont do the cleaning. I had to switch dentist and my new dentist gladly did the deep cleaning without forcing me to buy the add-on extra services. The new dentist was very understanding and said that the add-on extra services are offered as extra benefits but its not a mandatory requirement for deep cleaning.I very strongly suggest if anyone is looking to go to DDS Hung Le, to seriously consider against going there otherwise, you may have same experience as me. They have high sales pitch to sell you fluoride treatment every time you go in, and will sell you other unnecessary services. If you dont check with your insurance, they will overcharge you for the services even though the insurance pays most, if not all of the services. They are very nice to you if you keep agreeing with them and keep buying their services but the moment to decline their sales pitch, they get rude to you and call you cheap.

										I was new in Paso Robles CA & needed a dentist when my insurance co referred me to Dr. Krill  (he is at 1920 Creston Road #B).  I went in for a consult and met him - that was the ONLY TIME I saw the guy in the +/- 2 years I was a patient, although I went in at least every 6 months.  In the fall of 2009 I chipped a crown and went in, telling them I was unemployed & could not afford a new crown.  I asked if they could just sand down the rough spot that was cutting my tongue. They did that.  I was billed $4 which I thought was them being nice for me being off work and considering I was in & out of the chair in 5 minutes.  In January 2010 I went in for a cleaning and was shocked when they not only billed me $25 for the cleaning but $21 for the crown-sanding they had done in October 2009. When I protested it was clear they did not care - all they said was I had been undercharged in October.  They had no excuse for why I had never been sent a bill. They handed me an appointment card for 6 months in the future but I gave it no thought - I was too preoccupied with how ripped off I felt. I moved for employment, canceled the insurance and turned off the phone # they would have had on my account.Then 6 months later I got a ""missed appointment"" bill for from them for $20.A reasonable dentist office would have realized that if they send an cleaning appointment reminder that gets returned with a forwarding address 200 miles away that the person will not be there for the cleaning.  And if they call someone with an appointment reminder and the person's phone is turned off that person is not getting reminded.  That if they were unemployed on their last visit then maybe they moved.  And if that person has changed insurance companies they probably will change dentists.  And if they got ripped off on their last visit they probably WANT to forget about the dentist in question.So Dr. Krill's office had every reason to know I would not be there for an appointment THEY set up for me 6 months before.  For them to NOT know means they are either (1) stupid, (2) looking for ways to exploit patients, or (3) both stupid & exploitive.When I got the missed appointment bill I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  Dr. Krill's office never responded to me or the BBB.  Then they sent ANOTHER bill - this time with account detail that made me realize that when they spent 5 minutes sanding my crown down in October (that they billed me twice for) they ALSO billed my insurance company $155 - for 5 minutes work!!!!  I forwarded that bill with this whole story to the insurance co and explained how we both got ripped off by Dr Krill's office - and cc'd Dr. Krill.Dr. Krill's office then sent ANOTHER bill telling me they would send me to collections for the $20 missed appointment bill.That's when I got an attorney.The happy ending is they stopped billing me and I will never again have to deal with a dentist who is never there in an office full of people with corrupt business practices.Forwarned is forarmed . . .PS: I knew I needed a crown but was shocked when my new dentist told me just how much dental work I needed - work that Dr. Krill's office had never informed me off.  If the abusive billing of Dr. Krill's office doesn't scare you off from Dr. Krill's office the bad dentistry should.  And I keep talking about ""his office"" because I don't think he is even there anymore, considering I never saw the guy after my initial consult.  Maybe people who don't know what they are doing just rent his name & license.

										I am so happy being a customer of Beaming White's that I feel the whole world should know about them. I have been using their products for over 2 years and their gel really does give the best results I have seen. I have tried many other products, some before theirs and some after I started using them and I cant find anything that works better. If you have ever seen their Futura whitening light you know its really nice looking and feels and looks real solid. So for my money, they do have the best teeth whitening products in the industry. As they told me the first time I talked to them, try their product and compare it with everything else out there and then decide for yourself. 
I have actually visited their headquarters a few times because I live in Portland and I always go there to pick up my product. The first time I went my sales rep gave me a tour of the entire company, including the offices, the production area, the lab and the warehouse. I have even met the chemist twice and he seems to know his stuff. The lab might not be the most high tech, but its a real lab with real lab equipment and they have a few machines to make the gel and  a few to fill the pens and syringes. Every time I have gone in the production area they are filling something in very large quantities and they have barrels full of raw hydrogen peroxide and other chemicals and all kinds things you would expect in a real production or research lab. They definitely make the gel and I think that even though its not at the level of Pfizer, I doubt that anyone else making teeth whitening gel would have a more sophisticated lab. You would probably have to be big pharma to have a lab that was much better. Im comfortable that the product is good and safe and made in a proper fashion so I definitely can vouch for them. 
I also saw an area that I can't remember what they call it but where 2 people were assembling the Futura light. It's really great to watch American companies still manufacturing product in the US, especially in the teeth whitening industry where everyone seems to get all their stuff from China. I urge anyone who is planning to get into the teeth whitening business in a big way to visit the suppliers they are considering buying product from. It's an important decision, and I'm glad I finally came across them because they really add a lot of value besides just having really good products. I wish other companies knew how to give that level of customer service. I don't know how Luis, who I think is the owner, manages to run such a tight ship, but kudos to him. ",  Dental Services

She was extremely rough handling her physically and verbally while I was in the room present.
I asked for referral to a pedodentist who works with kids. They refused. The staff were extremely rude specially the woman called Jocelyn. I changed my general HMO from them to another. They told me she only has 1 cavity on her baby tooth which was a baby root canal and all other teeth were perfect. they refered me to a pedodentist and he said the same thing and he worked on 1 tooth only. 
It is so sad that this office wanted to drill the permanent teeth of a 8 year old which just came out a year ago for money. When I complained the manager ""April"" said they don't do this for money since they work for free and they don't get any money!!! 
I will do everything in my power to stop this for the sake of other innocent patients ... (the sad thing is that the tooth that needed a baby root canal, they wanted to do a normal filling so they would get paid once now and once in few months when she would suffer pain again because they failed to do proper job and get paid again !!!)
Also, I had an appointment with a Orthodentist in the same office. I called and wanted to make sure I don't have to deal with the same staff. They assured me that the staff is separate.

On 6/28/2011 I was told to come into the office because the dentures were ready when I got there after waiting 5mont appose to 4 weeks the dentures was to small they were tight in my mouth with no suction at all to hold them in place. I could not even open my mouth talk eat or even drink water with them as soon as I open my mouth they would fall out. The dentist was aware of the problem but he insisted that I take it home and try to put some sea-bond on them to see if it would work over the weekend. I did that but I could not really do anything with it.The dentist try to do some adjustment on the dentures but because of the material that was use to make the dentures u can only remove from it but not add to it so by him trying to adjust it that just made thing worse, he then turn and tell me that there is nothing he can do, so at that point I requested a refund he told me to speak with the front desk so they can request the refund.It has been several weeks now and they are refusing to give me back a full refund saying I have to pay for the lab work. I don't feel I should pay for any lab work when the dentist was told by the lab that there was no way the dentures could be made with the type of material he was requesting which was Val-pas and I was not told about it. I call the lab they agree to work with the dentist to try and fix the dentures but up to this day the dentist still refuse to see me.

										Hi,
After seeing an ad on Facebook for teeth whitening, I decided to click it to find out more about the offer. I was very cautious due to the low price, almost unbelievable for laser teeth whitening.
I called the number provided, was asked several questions by a very friendly staff member and booked my appointment.
1 week later I went to my appointment. The Dentist office was very clean, nicely decorated. I have to say I am very pleased with the results of my procedure! I have received several compliments on my smile. I really feel better about myself. This is a good deal, and it is legit. These are good people. I have told all my family and friends about them. Not all deals are too good to be true, this deal has really good value!
By the way, it looks like I am not alone:

This is going on my 2nd week.  I have been to another dentist.  There is a caivity visible by xray on my tooth that he refilled and was abscessed.  So I am having the new dentist do the work.

										I was ripped off by Dr. Alan M. Meltzer in Voorhees, New Jersey.08043 he charged me 650.00 for an abatement I never was casted for or considered getting from him. An abatement is a tooth platform that screws into his biomet implant or prosthetic root in the jaw. I made the mistake of getting an Implant from him and paid 1995.00 supposed to be with all inclusive services. I asked him after I was done with my implant and follow up appointments if he does digital scanning for an abatement and crown, or the tooth platform and prosthetic tooth. He said he would have to make up his mind about that, intimating that he could do both. Upon coming up on my last appointment I called and asked his staff if he did the digital scanning they informed me they do the old fashioned casting and wouldn't get digital until next year some time. I cancelled my last appointment and was called back by staff to keep my appointment to get a Torque Test for his lifetime warranty. I said OK because this was a follow up appointment that I was not to be charged for and I was told every implant has a lifetime warranty if you came back once a year to have a checkup by the doctor.I came in for my appt. he did a three minute Torque Test on my Implant asked me if I wanted an old fashioned casting and I told him No I had my teeth scanned and ordered a abatement (tooth platform) and crown (prosthetic tooth) from Dr. Tau in Northeast Philadelphia. He said He hoped Dr. Tau could do it right, as soon as he said that I knew I was in for trouble! He then had two follow up X-rays taken and never read and gave me no results for my Torque Test,a double header! I get to check out where I was told I owed 650.00 for a Torgue Test, a follow up, supposed to be inclued for my 1995.00 which he backed up with a Flow sheet saying a 3minute Torguw Test was 650.00. He had never ever mentioned a torque test to me at any time. What happened to my Warranty I don't know I never received anything in writing and now realized that if he could supersede his verbal policies with a flow sheet, you were surely in trouble. I told him I did not want his warranty which I knew I would never get anyway. I was charged 650.00 for a Torque Test for 3 minutes and he put down he gave me an abatement which was total fraud as he never cast it, made a model of my teeth,never sent it to a lab, and never had an abatement made, which is a custom piece. I guess if he charged me for a Torgue Test it woud have come up no charge as this is follow up for my Implant and an abatement is 650.00 which I got from Dr. Tau and not Alan Meltzer.Dr. Meltzer teachs dentistry and is very donnish and pedantic but he is a plain theft, liar,and grifter if you can go to someone else for your Implant do it as Dr. Meltzer's policies change with every flow sheet he types up and his favorite customer is an unfamiliar one. I wasted a day to be ripped off for his lies and deceit and now have had to file a dispute with my credit card and go through a lot of aggravation I should have never returned for my follow up appt but I didn't know! 									",  Dental Services

I needed my front tooth fixed or an implant in my front of my mouth .  I seen an advertisment by television for Ferber Dental Group. I made an appointment.  I got to meet a man named Brian Ferber, who told me that I could get the implant done for $2500.00.  Well according to the television the implant was $499.00.  he also told me that he would make me a deal and throw in a second one for my back molar which would cost me $3200.00.  I declined the second tooth. and said I would have the front one fixed.  I questioned the $499.00 price, of which I never did get an answer, it was just blown off .  ""right there I should of realized that this place was bad news. ""  I scheduled the implant and gave them my credit card for the $2500.00.  I had to go thru several visits.  The first visit was to pull the old tooth out, of which to this day. I have a chip in my other front tooth I believe from the dentist pulling out the tooth. I am now going to go to the first dentist to confirm this, this went fine, except for the normal pain you get from a pulled tooth. Then I was directed to make another appointment to come in , with no explanation as to why, so they made all of these appointments, me I am not a dentist, nor did I ever have an implant. I had no idea why they were making so many appointments.   I had to come back to have my teeth cleaned and to check the healing of the tooth. I went back for that, that appointment went fine also. Now I have to go back for a third visit, of which I go back and this is where it starts to get wierd. I went into this visit not knowing what I was going for, they told me it was bone addition.  I never knew the pain I was about to face. I had to go into a room with two people. One was a Doctor and the other seemed to be a nurse.  Well they numbed a partial part of my mouth but the other part of my mouth was not numb. I was pulled and protted by this nurse like that part of my face was numb, it was not , all the while this girl was singing and dancing in the office while she is suppose to be working on my mouth.  She was pinching my cheeked and the doctor was pulling on the other side of my face.  He was telling me to look one way while she was pulling me another way.  The were continuing to pinch my face. It then pissed me off and I told them lets get this over with.  but of course I might of used some bad words cause this was the most unprofessional visit I ever had in a dentist office.  This was painful, and they cut my upper gum and deep into my tooth and around it to add bone.  This of course I still do not have a tooth in my mouth. and I am still dealing with a missing tooth.  They tell  not wear this appliance they made me to hide it, so it will heal.  I do all things that they tell me to do.  I continue on with the visits, but I made an additional one because I lost the molar and the tooth that they chipped now is starting to bother me.  and now another molar that when they moved the other molar away, is now starting to bother me.  I have to go back because they tell me to use sensadyne.  I do this for a week or two and I go back.  When I go back I mention that the visit I just had with the doctor and nurse who implanted the bone tell me that they do not think my mouth can handle an implant.  But in the beginning I was measured and all for the implant and also had xrays done.   I mention this to another dentist each time I am seeing a new dentist. I have to wait and wait for her to get back to me something like an hour.  when she comes back into the room she tells me that she has to speak to Dr. Ferber because she can not give me any prices and it was looking like a price of a car to fix my mouth.   I have been to dentists all my life and keep my teeth clean and do the normal 6 month cleanings and stuff, but now I am looking a spending a mere price of a car to fix my mouth??? What happened to the 2500.00 I already gave them??   I missed an appointment because my back is bad.  I then make another appointment to go back to speak to Mr. Ferber about what it is exactly going to cost me to keep my teeth.    I do this yesterday. I go to this office visit yesterday, of which the man does not even try to hear me out, I started off telling him about this tooth he storms away and goes to his office manager, I told him I wanted refunded for the implant, because I am told they can not proceed with it and this is why he storms away?  I meet up with this lady and I only get a mere $800.00 back.  They now take off all of these things for this and that leaving me almost nothing. After paying 2500.00 to a dentist. I am appauled at this?  AND I STILL DO NOT HAVE A TOOTH IN THE SPOT!!!   I leave there and this is where I am now , letting people know do not go to Ferber Dental , there advertisements are for $500. but it is now $2500.00 for one tooth, after you get there?   They claim they can do the implant but after several visits they claim they can not do the implant, and I need several things fixed in my mouth, of which the first day be able to do this before you even sit in the chair.  Not make you waste your money on something that your body can not handle.  I do not have money to throw around and I do not think other people have it either at this time.  So buyers beware...............

										In April 2011, I contacted this dentist to inquire if he able to treat me. I required several extractions due to chemotherapy that I had undergone ruining my teeth in addition to some filling that had fallen out during my treatment. I would also need to have partial denture placed and had heard that he was a ""one stop shop"" rather than having to be referred to multiple specialties. I spoke with him directly over the phone and discussed clearly my needs and my insurance coverage which I might add is very good insurance from the State. I had already reviewed my copay per partial which was $365 per partial so I knew what the ball park cost should be. He told me that 4 extractions and the partials could be done along with the fillings in 2 visit and in less than a month from start to finish. He told me ""bring your checkbook it's gonna be expensive"". I then asked him what ""expensive"" was. He replied ""oh about $1000"". This being in the ""ballpark"" of what I had figured, I agreed. 
I arrived at my appointment and he was an hour late. By the time that he got to me, I had to leave to pick up my son from school so he merely peeked in my mouth (his assistant had already taken the xrays and made the impression) and wrote down on a piece of paper the sum of $1600. I told him that I was not required to pay that amount because I had insurance and it was much less than that. He told me then to just write a check for $800 and his insurance lady, who was out sick, would be in the next day and make the necessary insurance adjustments and call me with the total. I quickly wrote the check because I was already late picking my son up and left thinking that the $800 would cover the entire expense once his billing specialist followed up with my insurance company. I did not hear from his office until I called them a week later. I assumed that his insurance employee had been out longer than anticipated but I was getting anxious so I called. At that time, I was told that they would require an additional $1100. I told them absolutely not. They told me that the partials had been ordered and they were not the ones that my insurance company paid for. I told them that they had better order the one's that my insurance company pays for they told me just to wait a little longer and they would try to sort it out with my insurance company. Over the next 2 months, I received 3 nasty letter from Dr. Larrick informing me that he was giving me SUCH a deal that I have neglected my teeth and essentially should be greatful for the price. I had to get my insurance company involved to get him to agree to do the work for what I had already paid. I would never have let him touch me after all of this if he hadn't already cashed my check and the possibility of getting a dime back from him was nil. In addition, in the process of dealing with my insurance company, I found out that he had billed them for a cleaning on my initial visit which never occurred so he defrauded my insurance company as well. It gets worse:3 months after my initial visit, I arrived back to his office to have the extractions. He numbed me with many shots then brought a new bill to me while sitting in the chair numb. The bill asked for an additional $800. Fortunately, I had printed off the explanation of benefits from my insurance company and brought my benefits book. After all was said and done, he still made me pay an addition $373 which according to my insurance company and my booklet, I should not have paid. During the extractions, he brutalized my gums. I had a post crown that had to be extracted so he removed the crown then used his tool to push deep into the remaining natural tooth. He slipped with his tool but I was numb so I did not feel what he did to my gum. The day after this appointment, I looked like a cabbage patch doll with all of the swelling (I was not swollen at all prior to the procedur). It was only days later when I took the partial out of my mouth that I saw what he did: The gum by that tooth that had the crown on it had a gash on the outside of the gum all the way up to my lip. Right now, the good and natural tooth that was next to the extracted tooth now has the roots completely exposed due to his methods. Now, this tooth needs to be extracted as well and my partial added a tooth. He kept saying during the extraction ""oh this crown is making me nervous""....now I know why. The gash on the outside of my gum is about 7mm's in width so cannot be put back together unless surgically and extends upward to where my lip meets my gum. This man should be sued!

It's now going to collections Reading, Pennsylvania","
										The aspen dental office administration needs a major lesson on ethics and proper business practices. The last time I was in (2007), I had to wait 2 hours in the dental chair (after Novocaine was administered and I had shivers shortly after - which was not done anything about till I got up and complained) and was then told that the person who is qualified to do the procedure is not in and that I would have to go to a different dental office. After that nightmare I never returned to this office, again end of 2007. 
Last week, on my visit back to Reading, PA from my current residence in NYC, I noticed a letter under my former step mothers name that was sent from Aspen Dental. It showed a past due balance of 216.60. The bill was sent out 4 years after the procedure and under a different name so it was not forwarded to my new address. 
My initial call to the staff was last week and I was told Megan would call me back within an hour so she can get to the bottom of this since she didn't see why I was getting a bill either. I missed her call - literally by 20 seconds and called right back. Somewhere in those 20 seconds she was at lunch so I had to speak to a VERY rude lady (which I'm assuming works in the front desk) and was told Megan would call me back after lunch - never happened. The next day, I call back and was told Megan was not in and to expect a call first thing on Monday (8/29) morning. Today (8/29) I was told that the bill was from a x-ray and filling back in 2007 and that I have been sent bills in the past few years. Complete lies unless the mailman decided to skip delivering my mail. After speaking to the manager, I was told that the bills were all sent out this year. Again, 4 years later, to an address I no longer lived in (didn't think I'd have to change my address with them because of being a former patient), to a person who I have had no contact with (former step-mother) so the mail wasn't forwarded to my new address and now, magically - it's my fault and it's going to go to collections. While looking for my legal action possibilities, I called back to see if I can get the 25% off your past due balance offer that was listed on my bill (which once again, I didn't get till 6 days ago) and was told that I no longer qualified since it was past my offer date (8/18).
If I hadn't come down to visit my old friends and apt, I would have never gotten this bill and it would have gone to collections. My old roommate didn't recognize the bill since it was under my ex-step mothers name. Resolving this problem via the local Aspen Dental office has been useless and the number listed for the main company complaint center is not working (shocker) and I'm not holding my breath for a response to my email. This is unacceptable and needs to be fixed ASAP. If this goes to the collections agency, I will be forced to take legal action. 
Due to the massive amount of complaints listed here, if anyone is aware of class action cases, please let me know. This is not the first time they have screwed me over so although the amount seems small, there is absolutely no reason to let them get away with such a horrible practice. ",  Dental Services

I have not received her e-mail yet. She said Nutra Foods could not give me a credit my account, Alpine White would have to do that.     May of 2010 I dealt with Alpine White about this same issue. I had to cancel a membership with them that I never requested. At that time they had charged my credit card account $62.90. When I tallked them they said they would cancel my unwanted membership and I would receive a credit to my account within about 15 days and the woman said I was suppose to send the free sample (free sample with no obligations) back to Alpine White. I did not send the free sample back that I had to pay the shipping on for them to send it to me. That's how they got my credit card number.   They didn't credit my account and my credit card had to dispute the original charge. Now they will be disputing Alpine Whites fraudulent charges again.  I believe this is a scam! I hope this will be finished with this scamming company soon and for the last time.

										I was new to the area and my regular dentist had passed away so I went to see Dr. Weiner for cosmetic veneers. The office was clean and the staff very friendly; however, each office visit was 2+ hours long.  My first set of veneers broke in her hands as she was placing them.  I had to wait additional two weeks only to get veneers that looked way worse than my real teeth.  I had no choice but to get them because I could not longer handle the pain my gums were swollen so much that I had to take a pain killer every day.  At the end, I was told that I could not even bite bread or eat anything without cutting in small pieces.  Why not tell me this before?   One of my veneers broke within 2 days of placement.  When I went back she said that your grind your teeth and should not get veneers???  Was she for real?  Long be hold now I am stuck with these horrific veneers I can't eat, my teeth feel uncomfortable, my insurance will not pay for anything for another 4 years.  I am not sure how she sleeps at night,  they were so quick to collect money yet the survice was HORRIBLE.  If you read this please don't use their office go somewhere else.

										Hi, I went to q clinic and post initial free consultation with Dr tapesh I signed up immediately paying a full amount of 1900 on the spot. At time of signing I was told that the cost breakup was 520 for initial examination including x-rays and impressions and cost of 1380 for the treatment. I was unsure about the kind of improvement I would see with invisalign as I have a significant overbite. I was told by the treatment coordinator that I could decide whether to proceed or not after the results from the impressions came back, at which point if I decide not to proceed, I would lose the 520, but would be refunded the remaining amount. This was a risk I was willing to take. I went for the initial examination at which I was told that a past root canal I had, needing to be redone, and invisalign could only proceed once this root canal issue was fixed. I then decided that I did not want to proceed with invialign at all. When I then asked for a refund of the remaining amount, I was told that they could not rfund anything, I.e. I would lose the entire 1900. I am extremely shocked and don't know what to do . Please note that at this point I have not even had my impressions taken and only had one 30 minute appointment where the dentist ( not dr tapesh) conducted an examination and did a couple of x-rays. I am at loss as to what to do and wondering if anyone else has had a similar issue with q clinic and if there is any legal recourse I can take to get my hard earned money back. Q clinic are going back on their word. I had confirmed the point about what happenes if I decide not to proceed multiple times during the free consultation and was assured that I would be refunded the 1900 less the 520, and now they have gone back on their word !!!

I paid 50 bucks or maybe a few dollars less to start this service. I called the dentist to make an appointment and they are only open on Mondays (which wouldnt be a major deal, but they didnt have an opening for 3 months). Then when I called to inform Humana of the lies I was told, they informed me that I could drive 3 hours away to see a dentist and when I asked the lady if she would do that and she stated If I needed to see one yes. I told her she was lying and she later agreed she wouldnt. Its not the money spent, I mean yes 50 bucks could go for other items, but its the principle of the matter.

He said he had no prescription pads but that he would call in for some penicillin and hydrocodone for me. I said I did not need the pain medicine but just the antibiotic. He charged us $80.00 which he made change out of his wallet. We were in the office maybe five minutes.

										I had gotten two wisdom teeth out by my dentist and had started to feel extreme pain in my jaw
after the 3rd day. I was pretty sure I had gotten dry socket on my lower left jaw. Finally on the 5th day I could no longer wait (I wasn't able to take time off work earlier) and my dentist wasnt open on Sunday. I called a hotline for emergency dentist in Florida and I was referred to Dr. Oswicks office. I called the number and was happy that someone answered the phone. I really thought it was strange that the Dr. Oswick answered his own phone but thought that he must keep a small staff on the weekends.
He told me the initial cost of the visit would be 42 dollars and anything else he did would be
extra. How much extra he could not say. I drove an hour to get to his office and was feeling confident that he could pack the dry socket for me so the throbbing pain would end.
His receptionist was really nice and then told me that my visit would be 199. I was really surprised
at the price and before I could ask why it was so high Dr. Oswick came out of now where and told me to open my mouth. I pointed to the spot where the socket was and he said he needed x-rays. I told him I just got my wisdom teeth extracted and I had a dry socket. He strongly insisted that I get x-rays done and to pay the 199. I was already in tears from the intense pain and eager to get everything over with I unfortunately paid the 199.
Dr. Oswick was very rude. He demanded that I take out all my piercings (I have lip ones with plastic
retainers in) there was no need for me to remove my piercings when my normal dentist doesnt have a problem with it and does x-rays without the removal of them. He talked to me like I was stupid when doing the x-ray. Everything he said was in a derogatory tone.
After the x-ray I was told to fill out my information and he asked if I had insurance. When I replied
no he said of course not rudely and walked away from me. Still, desperate to ease my pain, I filled out the paperwork and waited for him to return. When he did, he pushed me down in the chair and started to examine my mouth. Not once did he ask about my pain level. He only asked who my normal dentist was and what day I had the extractions. He was VERY ROUGH with my mouth. He spent more time looking at my other teeth than at the dry socket. He then handed me a mirror and proceeded to lecture me about how bad my teeth were. He made me look at every little thing
he deemed to be wrong with them. Dr. Oswick stressed that a lot of work needed to be done. If I had such impending bad teeth that needed immediate attention Im sure my own dentist whom Ive been seeing for years would have mentioned it to me.
He then told me that he didnt think it was a dry socket (he barely looked at it). He told me that
I had tons of bacteria in the hole and judging by the rest of my mouth he was not surprised. By this point I was shaking so hard from anger. He humiliated me. He spoke down to me in every way possible.  As if it couldnt get any worse he handed me this lamented sheet with pictures of people with oral cancer and started his lectured all over again, telling me to take note, that if I didnt get my teeth taken care of I would get oral cancer. Im 26, not a child. My teeth are not bad. Even without insurance I still go regularly to my dentist.
I felt like he was trying to sell me his service. I was in even more pain when I left because of
his rough handling and treatment, I broke down in the hallway as soon as I got out of his office. I will report him to the BBB. I want to try to get my money back but judging from other reviews this would probably be impossible. I went to my normal dentist as soon as he opened and he was angry that I was treated in such a way. I HAD dry socket and he packed my mouth for me. It took him less
than 2 minutes to assess the situation and pack the socket. I find it hard to believe that Dr. Oswick, who has been in business for years, would fail to tell the difference between an infection and dry socket.

										I first became a patient of Leamington Spa Orthodontics in 2005 when they took dental impressions, made bleaching trays and sold me some bleach of varying strengths. I have also used their dental hygienist and since having clear (ceramic) braces fitted in America, gone there for emergency treatment, eg loose brackets and broken wires.
 
I was diagnosed with MS in 1997 and since 2006 have had a mobility problem in my right leg which doesn't lift or bend when I try to walk. I also have a dropped right foot which makes it very difficult to lift the leg + loss of balance and strength in my legs. This problem has got worse over the last 5 years and it means I can''t walk alone. I also have to use a wheelchair to go distances.
 
In January of this year I called Leamington Spa Orthodontics and asked them if they would give me a quote to remove my braces as my treatment was now finished and it would save me a difficult trip back to Boston USA. I talked to their receptionist Loretta who informed me that the owner, Richard Cure, was no longer prepared to offer me any further treatment, either orthodontic or with their dental hygienist, because of my disability. I asked her if she would just ask him about the removal of the braces, but she said there was no point because she already knew the answer - he had made his position clear after my last visit and instructed his office not to allow me to book any further appointments. Her reason was because I ""struggled with the stairs"". She told me that I could attend for treatment again ""if my leg got better"".
 
Richard Cure & LSO are in violation of the law - they are in breach of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995: PART III Discrimination in Other Areas re goods, facilities and services, points 19 & 21 which states that businesses are not allowed to discriminate in relation to provision of their goods, facilities & services and that providers of services have a duty to make adjustments. Leamington Spa Orthodontics have wheelchair access at the back and a downstairs room which they refuse to let me use. Regardless of this, I was prepared - and able albeit with a struggle - to enter via the usual entrance that has an outside step and use their upstairs treatment rooms. I am able to do this with their help, which they have now refused.
 
Richard Cure has tried to defend his decision to refuse me further treatment on the basis that he feels that I never required orthodontic work in the first place. However, neither my request to have the braces removed, nor to make an appointment with LSO's dental hygienist have anything whatsoever to do with Richard Cure's opinion with regard to my need for orthodontic treatment. He is clearly evading the real issue and in fact, one would assume that if he was so opposed to me being fitted with braces, that he would be only too happy to remove them!
In a letter dated 4th February 2011 Richard Cure stated that he was not familiar with my orthodontic appliance and tried to use this as another excuse. However, the evidence from the UK distributor of the GAC Mystique brackets used clearly proves that this is a lie. Moreover, removal of the braces does actually not require any knowledge of or familiarity with the particular make of brackets. There is one tool/appliance for the removal of metal brackets and one for the removal of ceramic brackets, and every orthodontist including Richard Cure carries and can do both. The type of brackets is therefore completely irrelevant.
 
In addition, their ongoing refusal to make me another appointment with their dental hygienist says it all.
 
Furthermore, whenever I made an appointment with the dental hygienist and/or for emergency orthodontic treatment I requested but was repeatedly refused the use of the downstairs room. LSO protest that this room is available to patients with a mobility problem, but I was always told that it was rented out to another company and that the tools/machinery needed could not be transferred from the upstairs rooms. I therefore had no option but to struggle with the stairs which got harder as my mobility problem got worse + they often made me struggle up 2 flights of stairs right up to the top of the building, even though there are treatment rooms on a lower level than this. I also had to use the women's toilet upstairs. I could not go to another dental hygienist elsewhere as I needed one that used a technique that was compatible with braces and wouldn't dislodge them, ie manual v. electric + going elsewhere would require me to go through an expensive registration process with another dentist.
 
When I registered with LSO in 2005 I did not declare the MS diagnosis. My mobility was not an issue and I therefore felt that the diagnosis was irrelevant to the care of my teeth + I also felt that disclosing it was an unnecessary invasion of privacy. I was never asked about my medical history again on subsequent visits + by 2006 the diagnosis was in question and other causes had been suggested such as a slipped disc, heavy metal toxicity and spinal/vertebral misalignments from a bad car accident I had in December 2005.
 
Mr Cure is not only unfit to practise due to his discriminatory attitude towards me which breaches the law, specifically the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, but he is also a totally incompetent orthodontist. When I first presented to LSO in 2005 my 2 top front teeth were very big; they were also too low as were the teeth either side of them + one of these teeth was much higher than the other, ie they were all out of proportion to each other and I had a very gummy smile. In addition, my 2 top canines were way too high + my bottom teeth were overcrowded, causing some of these to have twisted considerably. My bite was so wrong that my top R/H front tooth was becoming transparent at the bottom and had lost 2 layers of its enamel!
 
I desired an aesthetic improvement in that I wanted my 2 top front teeth made smaller + the 4 top front ones pushed up and the 2 top canines pulled down so that the teeth were proportionately sized, straight and even, and I no longer had a gummy smile. I also wanted my lower teeth to have the curve they used to (I understand that as you get older, your jaw contracts which often causes the lower teeth to crowd.) Richard Cure denied that this would ever be possible. However, IN ACTUAL FACT, NOT ONLY DID I GET THE AESTHETIC RESULT I DESIRED AND A HUGE COSMETIC IMPROVEMENT, BUT IT WAS A NECESSARY & INTEGRAL PART OF THE ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT! In order to achieve the correct orthodontic result and make room for the required changes, my 2 top front teeth were slenderised and the ones next to them evened up both size and position wise. The 2 top canines were pulled down and the bottom 4 front teeth were also slenderised to make room so that the overcrowding could be rectified without the need to extract a tooth which would have been considerably more drastic. As I understand it, orthodontics is all about the smile line and the position of the teeth in relation to the lips, ie the edges of each should touch when you smile without gum showing; this is certainly what Arch Orthodontics who treated me in Boston maintain and provided. It is also about rectifying overcrowding such as I had. Cosmetic and aesthetic improvements are an integral part of this as when the teeth are improved orthodontically, they also look better as a result. In addition, my bite is now perfect, preventing further uneven wear and tear to the teeth.
 
Last year I had to go to Portland Oregon for 3 months for treatment for my mobility problem that was unavailable in the UK and I attended North Portland Orthodontics there for intermediate orthodontic treatment to save me flying back and forth to Boston. AO forwarded them copies of all my dental records and Dr Jennifer Crowe, who treated me there, confirms the huge improvement that orthodontic treatment made to my teeth. I quote from one of her recent e-mails to me dated 19th July.... ""I think the outcome is positive and your orthodontists have greatly improved your bite and the appearance of your teeth.""
 
Richard Cure's constant assertion throughout his submission that orthodontic treatment was not only unnecessary in my case, but could potentially make my teeth worse, is total incompetence and nothing less than insanity. There is not a single person, orthodontically trained or otherwise, who would or could deny the huge improvement that orthodontic treatment has made to my teeth. Interestingly enough, LSO is the only orthodontist who has ever said that orthodontic treatment was unnecessary. In actual fact, I originally planned to have veneers, but was informed by 2 dentists in Coventry in 2005 that orthodontic treatment was a far better option for my teeth and could improve them immensely.
 
Richard Cure is therefore unfit to practise due to his lack of orthodontic ability, as well as his discrimination against me and refusal to provide emergency treatment (removal of the brackets) and dental hygienist services to me on the basis of my disability. DO NOT USE THIS ORTHODONTIST!
 
TO SUM UP: 
Richard Cure suddenly withdrew the emergency orthodontic treatment and dental hygienist services he had offered me, and the reason I was given for this by his receptionist Loretta was that it was because of my disability which ""had been mentioned and was an issue"". I was told that he wanted nothing further to do with me or my case because of it.
 
Removal of the braces was a half hour emergency orthodontic procedure no different to the one he had already provided when he replaced broken wires and brackets in February 2009. He lied about not being familiar with the brackets used (obviously an excuse) and clearly has had experience of removing these before, although as already stated, the make of brackets is irrelevant to the ability to remove them.
 
If he is so adamant about the lack of need for orthodontic treatment in my case and his disapproval of it, then why did he offer me emergency treatment in the first place - and then why suddenly change his mind and refuse it?
 
He continues to refuse me dental hygienist services and the use of the downstairs room.
 
In addition, his constant and emphatic assertion that orthodontic treatment was not only unnecessary in my case but could even make matters worse, + his statement that I could not get the aesthetic result I desired was not only contrary to what he told me in 2005 before the onset of my mobility problem, but is another lie + total incompetence and utter insanity on his part. The before and after photos of my teeth speak for themselves, as does Dr Crowe's comment.

I also have to use a wheelchair to go distances. In January of this year I called Leamington Spa Orthodontics and asked them if they would give me a quote to remove my braces as my treatment was now finished and it would save me a difficult trip back to Boston USA. I talked to their receptionist Loretta who informed me that the owner, Richard Cure, was no longer prepared to offer me any further treatment, either orthodontic or with their dental hygienist, because of my disability. I asked her if she would just ask him about the removal of the braces, but she said there was no point because she already knew the answer - he had made his position clear after my last visit and instructed his office not to allow me to book any further appointments. Her reason was because I ""struggled with the stairs"". She told me that I could attend for treatment again ""if my leg got better"". Richard Cure & LSO are in violation of the law - they are in breach of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995: PART III Discrimination in Other Areas re goods, facilities and services, points 19 & 21 which states that businesses are not allowed to discriminate in relation to provision of their goods, facilities & services and that providers of services have a duty to make adjustments. Leamington Spa Orthodontics have wheelchair access at the back and a downstairs room which they refuse to let me use. Regardless of this, I was prepared - and able albeit with a struggle - to enter via the usual entrance that has an outside step and use their upstairs treatment rooms. I am able to do this with their help, which they have now refused. Richard Cure has tried to defend his decision to refuse me further treatment on the basis that he feels that I never required orthodontic treatment in the first place. However, neither my request to have the braces removed, nor to make an appointment with LSO's dental hygienist have anything whatsoever to do with Richard Cure's opinion with regard to my need for orthodontic treatment. He is clearly evading the real issue and in fact, one would assume that if he was so opposed to me being fitted with braces, that he would be only too happy to remove them!In a letter dated 4th February 2011 Richard Cure stated that he was not familiar with my orthodontic appliance and tried to use this as another excuse. However, the evidence from the UK distributor of the GAC Mystique brackets used clearly proves that this is a lie. Moreover, removal of the braces does actually not require any knowledge of or familiarity with the particular make of brackets. There is one tool/appliance for the removal of metal brackets and one for the removal of ceramic brackets, and every orthodontist including Richard Cure carries and can do both. The type of brackets is therefore completely irrelevant. In addition, their ongoing refusal to make me another appointment with their dental hygienist says it all. Furthermore, whenever I made an appointment with the dental hygienist and/or for emergency orthodontic treatment I requested but was repeatedly refused the use of the downstairs room. LSO protest that this room is available to patients with a mobility problem, but I was always told that it was rented out to another company and that the tools/machinery needed could not be transferred from the upstairs rooms. I therefore had no option but to struggle with the stairs which got harder as my mobility problem got worse + they often made me struggle up 2 flights of stairs right up to the top of the building, even though there are treatment rooms on a lower level than this. I also had to use the women's toilet upstairs. I could not go to another dental hygienist elsewhere as I needed one that used a technique that was compatible with braces and wouldn't dislodge them, ie manual v. electric + going elsewhere would require me to go through an expensive registration process with another dentist. When I registered with LSO in 2005 I did not declare the MS diagnosis. My mobility was not an issue and I therefore felt that the diagnosis was irrelevant to the care of my teeth + I also felt that disclosing it was an unnecessary invasion of privacy. I was never asked about my medical history again on subsequent visits + by 2006 the diagnosis was in question and other causes had been suggested such as a slipped disc, heavy metal toxicity and spinal/vertebral misalignments from a bad car accident I had in December 2005. Mr Cure is not only unfit to practise due to his discriminatory attitude towards me which breaches the law, specifically the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, but he is also a totally incompetent orthodontist. When I first presented to LSO in 2005 my 2 top front teeth were very big; they were also too low as were the teeth either side of them + one of these teeth was much higher than the other, ie they were all out of proportion to each other and I had a very gummy smile. In addition, my 2 top canines were way too high + my bottom teeth were overcrowded, causing some of these to have twisted considerably. My bite was so wrong that my top R/H front tooth was becoming transparent at the bottom and had lost 2 layers of its enamel! I desired an aesthetic improvement in that I wanted my 2 top front teeth made smaller + the 4 top front ones pushed up and the 2 top canines pulled down so that the teeth were proportionately sized, straight and even, and I no longer had a gummy smile. I also wanted my lower teeth to have the curve they used to (I understand that as you get older, your jaw contracts which often causes the lower teeth to crowd.) Richard Cure denied that this would ever be possible. However, IN ACTUAL FACT, NOT ONLY DID I GET THE AESTHETIC REQUIREMENT I DESIRED AND A HUGE COSMETIC IMPROVEMENT, BUT IT WAS A NECESSARY & INTEGRAL PART OF THE ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT! In order to achieve the correct orthodontic result and make room for the required changes, my 2 top front teeth were slenderised and the ones next to them evened up both size and position wise. The 2 top canines were pulled down and the bottom 4 front teeth were also slenderised to make room so that the overcrowding could be rectified without the need to extract a tooth which would have been considerably more drastic. As I understand it, orthodontics is all about the smile line and the position of the teeth in relation to the lips, ie the edges of each should touch when you smile without gum showing; this is certainly what Arch Orthodontics who treated me in Boston maintain and provided. It is also about rectifying overcrowding such as I had. Cosmetic and aesthetic improvements are an integral part of this as when the teeth are improved orthodontically, they also look better as a result. In addition, my bite is now perfect, preventing further uneven wear and tear to the teeth. Last year I had to go to Portland Oregon for 3 months for treatment for my mobility problem that was unavailable in the UK and I attended North Portland Orthodontics there for intermediate orthodontic treatment to save me flying back and forth to Boston. AO forwarded them copies of all my dental records and Dr Jennifer Crowe, who treated me there, confirms the huge improvement that orthodontic treatment made to my teeth. I quote from one of her recent e-mails to me dated 19th July.... ""I think the outcome is positive and your orthodontists have greatly improved your bite and the appearance of your teeth."" Richard Cure's constant assertion throughout his submission that orthodontic treatment was not only unnecessary in my case, but could potentially make my teeth worse, is total incompetence and nothing less than insanity. There is not a single person, orthodontically trained or otherwise, who would or could deny the huge improvement that orthodontic treatment has made to my teeth. Interestingly enough, LSO is the only orthodontist who has ever said that orthodontic treatment was unnecessary. In actual fact, I originally planned to have veneers, but was informed by 2 dentists in Coventry in 2005 that orthodontic treatment was a far better option for my teeth and could improve them immensely. Richard Cure is therefore unfit to practise due to his lack of orthodontic ability, as well as his discrimination against me and refusal to provide emergency treatment (removal of the brackets) and dental hygienist services to me on the basis of my disability. DO NOT USE THIS ORTHODONTIST! TO SUM UP: Richard Cure suddenly withdrew the emergency orthodontic treatment and dental hygienist services he had offered me, and the reason I was given for this by his receptionist Loretta was that it was because of my disability which ""had been mentioned and was an issue"". I was told that he wanted nothing further to do with me or my case because of it. Removal of the braces was a half hour emergency orthodontic procedure no different to the one he had already provided when he replaced broken wires and brackets in February 2009. He lied about not being familiar with the brackets used (obviously an excuse) and clearly has had experience of removing these before, although as already stated, the make of brackets is irrelevant to the ability to remove them. If he is so adamant about the lack of need for orthodontic treatment in my case and his disapproval of it, then why did he offer me emergency treatment in the first place - and then why suddenly change his mind and refuse it? He continues to refuse me dental hygienist services and the use of the downstairs room. In addition, his constant and emphatic assertion that orthodontic treatment was not only unnecessary in my case but could even make matters worse, + his statement that I could not get the aesthetic result I desired was not only contrary to what he told me in 2005 before the onset of my mobility problem, but is another lie + total incompetence and utter insanity on his part. The before and after photos of my teeth speak for themselves, as does Dr Crowe's comment. CONSUMERS - there are way better and more competent orthodontists around, I urge you to GO ELSEWHERE!!

										Staff at rocking your smile is very inconsiderate, rude and all they care about is money. I was very surprised to see few good reviews about this place on google.com but quickly realized that they were all fake reviews written by same person, prob the doctor himself. 
I was being told different things by the assistants and the doctor. After my exam, they tried to sell me on services that I didnt need. Dr Brad Jennings, without explaining anything to me kept recommending different procedures worth thousands. I was skeptical after my first appointment so I contacted my old dentist back in California who recommended that I talk to another doctor so I scheduled an appointment with another clinic. After talking to that doctor I quickly realized that everything Dr Brad Jennings was recommending was just a way for him to make thousands off of me and I did not need any of the recommended procedures done. 
When I contacted their office about it the assistant on the phone was very rude and told me that if you cant afford our services you shouldnt have come to our clinic.

Apparently this is the same company, operating under both names. I urged her to please cancel any additional shipments. That is when she informed me that I had to ship the product back to the company, otherwise I would be charged an amount over $119.00.  I informed her that it did not make sense due to me having used some of the product, but that I would do so anyway. I marked the box return to sender. After two weeks, I received the box with a label claiming that I was to pay for the additional shipping. I knew that by this time, i had surpassed the amount of days to return, but assumed that since the company had returned my product, that some notations had been made to their system. I went to UPS got a tracking number and still I have received no credit. It has been over a month and I called the company. I spoke to an employee and a manager who both were very ugly stating that if I could not follow the directions of ther terms and conditions, that is why they were keeping my money. They stated that I had the burden of proof of showing I had sent the package back. However they had not received my box. I told them that was convenient. How did I know that they did not just throw my box away in the warehouse. This manager responded by saying well how convenient that you do not have the tracking number on hand. I stated I would look for it, and that I had no convenience out of paying for something that I did not benefit from. Eventually the manager was so rude, and knowing that I would get nowhere with this,  I hung up the phone.  I have e-mailed them my tracking number with a plea for some type of credit and hope to get a response. However, they really stuck to their guns about the 30 days.

Johnson and his staff requested all necessary approval from my insurance Principal Life Insurance Co phone 1-800-247-4695 and told me that everything it is covered and I DO NOT NEED to pay anything out of my pocket.. They made the necessary arrangements for the surgery and they send me on my way.. On the date of 05/12/2011 early morning they performed the surgery, and after that assure me that after the surgery they scheduled me for a free out of pocket a week later visit in order to inspect the surgery.. However, this surgeon office staff lied me and mislead me in order to get me through the surgery procedure, charge my insurance company and bill me later or scam me after.. They mentioned zero out of pocket before the procedure and after that they pretend $ 531.00 which represent a balance after whole charges.. So, they change their mind and told me that my dental insurance company didnt pay for the anesthesia.. How in the world someone can have removed this 4 wisdom tooth without anesthesia..?? Lets say that my dental insurance company didnt want to pay for, and that become a different litigation anyway since Im NOT going to let it go and pay this balance, but in the mean time Dr Brendan G Johnson staff Mike from his billing department told me over the phone, conversation occurred on 06/13/2011  quote : We DONT TELL patients that the insurance company usually does not want to pay for anesthesia before any surgery procedure because the patients in this bad economy will never pay for and do not want to have any procedure anymore.. Unquote.. WOW!!!  How in the world one business lied or hide all this details in order to get the patient through their doors and charge the patient insurance for their scam behavior in order to get more clients or patients and after that they threaten me with Collection Agency in order to get the difference.. IF I KNEW of this scam and mislead intention, THEN I would never ever like to get in that office for any surgical procedure.. I told them over the phone that they SHOULD have told me in the beginning, or upfront, since they admitted over the phone that they have this issue in the past, and make me aware of some charges that might be necessary to pay after the procedure.. Instead, they lie me that my insurance approved whole balance required for this surgery and I dont have to pay anything in order to get me in this trap.. Now they threaten me with collection IF I refuse to pay the difference of $ 531.00 which represents the remaining balance.. I do consider this tactic a misled, lie, scam and unfair practices.. They should have informed me immediately of this issue and at that point I would of pick the right option, or be aware of some balance.. They added on my bill 2 different anesthesia, as follow : one for $ 325.00 for 30 minutes, and the second for other 15 minutes which cost $ 220.00.. They put me to sleep, and how do I know that there was necessary the second anesthesia or NOT.. It was added anyway just to scam me or my insurance company, but since my dental plan didnt pay for, then they decided to send me a bill with $ 531.00.. They also told me that I sign and agree for any remaining balance, which in the end IT WAS NEVER EVER EXPLAINED TO ME THE REAL MEANING OF THEIR REAL INTENTION.. I will address whole this issue to the Nevada State Board of Dental Examiners, Nevada Federal Trade Commission, General Attorney of Nevada, Consumer Protection Agency, B.B.B. and RipOff.com..

										6 Day Dental and Orthodontics is the worst place to get your braces done and even for a mere cleaning. The employees are rude and the company is only driven by money. They do not care about their customers only about the money they want to get from you. SO BEWARE! Make sure you visit other places and let 6 Day be your last resort so you do not end up regretting like i am right now. 
Ever since i started my treatment, I have been unhappy with this company. They drag their feet, they do not give you information about your treatment; they stare rudely at you when you come in for your appointment, when you ask a question, no one ever has an answer except you are giving them your credit/ debit card to swipe. At that point they will have a big smile on their faces and gladly tell you were to sign. 
DAWN, the supposed manager who I have spoken to at the Coppell and Flower Mound branches is the worst of all her employees. I asked her for the record of my treatment and she said "" I will have it for you in 10 days only at the Coppell branch and I will not stress myself to get it available for you before then and even though, there is no assurance that your records will be available after 10 days. You have to call me to find out if it is available"" - Her exact words. I paid for the services but she can not stress herself to provide me with my records. Interesting! 
Corrine another employee at 6 day who i spoke to at the Flower Mound branch, could not answer my question instead she said "" I will have my manager call you back"" and before I could respond, she hung up on me. There have been more instances of rudeness and greed shown by this company than I can put down on paper. If i finally get around to putting it on paper, I would be the best selling author for the Book titled "" 6 DAY DENTAL AND ORTHODONTICS - THE GREEDIEST & RUDEST DENTAL AND ORTHODONTIC PRACTICE IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. CUSTOMERS BEWARE! They never want to bill your insurance company but rather bill you first and then bill your insurance and reimburse you months months later. A tale thievery. 
They are never upfront with you about costs until a day before your appointment or on the day of your appointment so that you do not have enough time to change your mind. Again, I stress beware of this company. So many mistakes were made during my treatment, the doctor leaves the placement of the wires and power chain in the hands of the assistants, which is fine BUT he never ever checks to ensure they placed them correctly. When I return a month later for my appointment, I am usually told at that point that the assistants made an error and yet the Doctor is still too lazy to check that everything is fine before I leave. *Shaking my head* What a company!

										I went to Dental Dreams today with my girlfriend and her son and decided to have a tooth looked at that has been bothering me. I informed the lady at check in that I was self employed and had to pay cash so she said they give a 40% discount for cash customers.
    The service she offered me was for 63.00 I would get a basic exam wich included x-rays and the doctor doing a check up and for 85.00 I would get x-rays a cleaning and a polish as well as a exam. Well I went with the 85.00 exam and had to pay before services were rendered.  They took all 3 of us into the same room. The lady took x-rays for all three of us in a row and never changed her gloves. Then she used the same oral equipment on my 5 year old step son as she did me without changing the heads. I was last and when the Dentist looked at my x-rays he said my pain was related to a cavity that was down to the nerve causing the discomfort and it either needed extracted for an additional 111.00 or a root canal for about 600.00 and was finished. When I said what about my polish and cleaning he said that wasnt included and I said yes it was. The Dentist went and got the office manager by the name of Amy Caldwell and she told me that I was wrong and the receptionist didnt tell me that wich is a lie and I have a witness to the fact. I told her that I expected to have some of my money refunded and she said we will only charge you for the x-rays and that bill totaled 75.60 wich made no sence. She never gave me the difference and my bill shows 75.60 paid but when I finally got thru to the main office it showed my bill was 85.00 and was paid in full never showing the 75.80.The assistant in the room with us was upset with the company and told me to go to Lancaster to a Dentist that does work pro bono and will help me and told me to call the main office because of how I was treated. I made several attempts to find out who the regional manager was and finally found out who he was but nobody would give me his number so I called the main office in Chicago and got no response.

										I found this dentist on 12/17/11 and as of 1/17/11 I have terminated my relationship as her Patient.  It begins with my visit in January 2011.  While te dentist thought I was out on the gas - she jumped her assistant telling her to ""just look at this, there is drule and I'm sitting here and I do have the right of way with the drill, do you hear me?""  I think if you are having issues with your assistant you should put the suction in before you start & keep it in & take this up when the patient is not in the office.  Stress now days on all of us should not also be passed along by my medical provider when I am paying them to work & not talk.  I called the office re: a tooth that partially broke off and the office staff 1) asked me if it was hurting & if not no need to come in 2) that they would re-verify this with the Dr & call me back.  I waited a couple of days & called them back and same thing, they would get w/ the Dr & call me back.  Again I waited a couple of days & called back & same thing.  I gave up at this point.  Another day I called re: a crown they put on came out & we started the same routine of if it doesn't hurt (w/ a rod in it sticking up in my mouth) then there is no need to come in.  We will set up an appointment down the road.  I asked them what i owed them in April 2011 at this point & was told ""OH! your account is in a major audit and we will have to get back with you.""  Now you want to call me don't you?????????  So, I find another dentist who I LOVE and he fixes their mess.  Yesterday I get my final bill from them.  (which is over $350 cheaper than what they told me I would owe them back in April - since I called my insurance company & got them involved with what I would owe them after the claims have been filed / paid.  I am mailing them their final check with a letter to let the Dr know that her staff & her attitude with me in the chair is unacceptable.  They only work a few days a week and on Fridays you can forget getting someone to work on an emergency situation.  They really don't seem to care if you EVER come back to them.  They will quote work that needs to be done on more teeth than you have in your head.  Every dentists work you have ever had done is no good any more.  It all needs to be done with their work.  Well, within 1 1/2 months your Porcelin crown fell out & I'm real lucky I didn't swallow it or break it in the middle of eating a meal.  Also, I had to pay the other dentist to put it back in since there is NO WAY I would want you to work on my mouth again.  This dentist wants you to go to her College cronies for surgery.  It seems she has just made a mess.  Her staff is very low educated in just speaking to you.  Their sales pitch to sell you everything under the sun is not working.  I would not recommend this Dentist or Office Staff to any one.

										I had my braces originally handled by another doctor before
Dr. Lamboy took over.  During the time he
treated me, most everything was fairly satisfactory, however, at the end of the
treatment there were some horrible issues.
 
Dr. Lamboy placed a shunt on one of my teeth causing it to
die toward the end of the treatment, and did not remove the dental cement on
the teeth and under the gumline when time came to remove the braces. I was,
however, unaware of this and only later found out through another dentist after
the dental cement began to cause infections from trapped food particles. 
 
Attempts to seek recompense for the dental cement removal
and my dead tooth but discussions with Dr. Lamboy were not at all amicable,
even though I was simply attempted to get a relatively small amount to cover my
out of pocket expenses and complete the repair of these issues. 
 
After a few attempts of trying to negotiate with him, he
refused to talk to me, and instead arranged for what I thought was a legal
arbitrator to handle the case. I later found out after consulting with an
attorney that this company had no legal powers and wanted me to sign documents
which would have ended any chance of resolving this matter in court, leaving
the decision of compensation up to them(which obviously would not be in my
favor). Thankfully I did not sign them.
 
For some reason Dr. Lamboy is no longer practicing dentistry
in my area, having left the state. It would not surprise me if he caused
similar issues with other patients and subsequently had to leave because of
reputation, because the dentists who took over his practice are doing very well
in the area. Not being here has caused problems for court proceedings, but
luckily my attorney is very good and has arranged to subpoena him soon. 
Hopefully I can get some type of recompense soon for all the
issues this guy has caused me.									",  Dental Services

Michael McCown4755 Highway A1AVero Beach, FL. 32963LIC# DN14339NPI# 1407836612On or about 10/19/10 I went to see Dr, Michael McCown a dentist in vero beach fl. that I've been seeing for many years,. we discussed my dental condition and he suggested I have a partial made that I could have teeth added as time goes by, do to my extensive bone loss and I will loose teeth over time. I agreed to having a partial made and as time went by i got a heck of a surprise .so McCown begain the making of the oral molds to be sent out so the partial could be made , McCown informed me that he was using a new place to have the partial made that was better then the one he was using. when the partial came in i went to McCowns office for a fitting, the partial bridge did not come close to fitting,,some adjustments were made and another oral mold was made and they were sent back for more adjustments. a week later I was called back to McCowns office for another fitting, which the partial was still not close to fitting. again McCown made some adjustments and made notes and sent the partial back for more adjustments. a week after im back in the office for a fitting and still the partial did not fit right. the bite was wrong and the partial would rock from side to side when i bit down. so with that McCown did some adjustments and a lot of grinding and McCown went so far as to grind my real bottom tooth to make the partial fit better, he did all this to try to get the bite right, I wore the partial home to try it out. well while eating dinner the bite was still way off and the partial was rocking from side to side while chewing. I relayed this the the dentist and was told to come back in for more adjustments. when I was at McCowns office I informed him that I've had a few partials made in the past and never did I have the kind of problems and never did I have a partial that rocked. I maybe I had a simple adjustment and I was good to go!!! Never did I have this kind of problems. well McCown did some more grinding to try to correct the bite,, and he tightened the clips in hopes to stop the rocking. again I wore the partial home and again while eating dinner the bite was still way off and now by him tightening the clips my teeth were aching, do to too much pressure on my teeth. again back to the office and more adjustments and grinding were done. again I wore it home and when I was chewing the partial was rocking and not just a little but was rocking like a see-saw. as far as I can tell the partial bridge was not formed to my mouth. I called McCowns office the relay the problem I was told by the receptionist that McCown said that the rocking of the bridge falls into the parameter. now im not a stupid person when i chew the partial should not almost come completely off of the other side. I was also told the I can go find another dentist and see if they can make me a better partial at mhttp://horoscopes.mydaily.com/y own expense! for him to say that was not very professional and not very responsible, and he does not stand behind his work. all told I must have made 7 to 8 or more- 45 min. each way trips for fittings!

										I came to Dr Igor German in December, 2011 for an initial visit and emergency work for a broken front tooth.  Several thousand dollars later, a root canal, and a temporary bridge in place, I left with an appointment for January.  I had the appointment  January14, which resulted in another temporary bridge and hundreds more dollars.  I got an appointment for February to be fitted with my permanent bridge.  As I was leaving, I asked Shane, the receptionist, if I could submit a picture so that the finished bridge would be a somewhat accurate representation of what my original teeth looked like.  She said I could email it or drop it by.  I sent the email to their website address and thought the matter was taken care of.I got a call from Shane about a week before my appointment in February saying she did not receive the pictures and that they had not started making the bridge.  I tried again, had someone else try again to send the pictures.  They were not received.  After several phone calls, Shane said the address was dentaldiscovery@gmail.com--1st time it had been mentioned that there is another email address.  No mention of this address is listed on their website, nor anywhere else.  Shane was very rude, said it was my own fault that I could not possibly keep my original February appointment to get my permanent bridge as it hadn't been started.  She said she had the pictures, which of course were received after getting the correct email address.  She said she would give me a call when the bridge was ready.  This was mid-February.A month goes by, no call.  My temporary bridge broke in 2 pieces on a Friday, March 17.  I called @ 10 AM, got voice mail, which didn't mention office hours.  I went to the office at 1 PM, which was closed.  I called the phone number, got a recording to call their other office on the other side of town.  I got another recording with yet another number which said to leave a message and someone would get back to me right away.   I waited in the area until after 5:30 PM, still no response.  I went home.  Saturday morning, March 18th,  I got a call from a woman who asked who I was and which office I normally visit. I told her ""the Silver Springs office"".  Her response was ""Oh"".  No further calls.  Still no response from Shane or anyone else in the Silver Springs office.I went to work that night and the next 3 nights with a broken temporary bridge that kept falling out if I bent over.  I did not receive a call back until after noon on Tuesday the 20th from Shane, telling me that both offices are closed on Fridays, that I should have known that, and that is was my own fault that it was taking so long to get my permanent bridge.  She said it was done, had been in their office waiting for ME to call them to schedule an appointment.  She also said that she had called numerous times, had others call numerous times, but got no answer.  I replied that she had my home number, my cell number, and my email address.  NO attempts were made to contact me.  She even had my friend's email address who sent her a picture of me!  She yelled at me and told me I had no reason to be upset because they don't offer after hours emergency care and it was my own fault that I was kept waiting.  She told me that if I could not be in their office by 9AM the following morning, it would be another week before they could accommodate me, saying,""It's not our fault that you work nights and can't make it here by that time.  I don't know what to tell you.""  I am working a nursing contract over 100 miles away from Ocala, 7PM to 7:30 or 8 AM.  She was aware of this.I called the other office, told them about my broken bridge and the way I was treated by Shane.  They put a girl on the phone who works both offices.  She said she would be there the following day and would work me in.  She assured me that I would not have to have any contact with Shane.I came in straight from work after working a 13-hour shift, got there before 10 AM.  No apology was made for the delay in getting my permanent bridge, none for ignoring my emergency, nor did Shane apologize for her rude behavior.  Dr Igor's comment was, ""I know it has taken awhile to get your permanent bridge, but at least it's over now.""It was my front teeth that were being replaced.  I work with the public, have to lean over patients in bed, with my temporary bridge falling out on the bed!  It was humiliating, not to mention having to disinfect them to keep from catching something!  I couldn't eat anything that had to be bitten in front, nor could I tolerate cold or hot without great pain.  Their recording says ""someone will get right back to you"", which is a lie.  Their website talks about how friendly and courteous they are, how they cultivate trust and friendship, how they take care of emergencies.  BEWARE!  Once they have your money, you no longer matter to them!

										I have had Liberty Dental Insurance for several years and they advertised both Rocky Ridge Dental and Lincoln Hills Dental as offices that accepted Liberty Dental Insurance.When I went to Rocky Ridge, they recommended a filling and / or crown several years ago. When they gave me the price, they refused to honor the insurance pricing. Art, the office manager, said, ""This is the price and if you want service you have to pay our price.""I just got mad and walked out.
I called Liberty Dental Insurance several times and talked to at least 4 people and all confirmed that I was right...I was to pay the co-pay, plus an upgrade fee only...They offered to change me to another dentist. I did that and found Lincoln Hills Dental...little did I know it was the same company! I also upgraded my plan.
When I got pricing from Lincoln Hills Dental, Art, the same office manager appeared. Again, he refused to explain the costs, and refused to discuss the insurance. I e-mailed 3 times and got no answer.
This morning, when I called Liberty Dental Insurance, I talked to a man named Hugo who claimed that I was to pay a co-pay, an upgrade, plus the cost of gold. He claimed that the dentist can set the price of the material at whatever they want. This was the first time anyone ever said this! He agreed to call Art at Lincoln Hills Dental and get an answer.
In the mean time, Art called me and claimed that the dentist had decided that they did not want me as a client. He claimed they sent a letter to me and to the insurance company in January and this is why he had not answered me in March.
He said the reason was because of a comment I made while in the office...when the dentist said I may need a root canal. She said that she would not know until she took off a crown and looked. (I said, ""Oh yes...the root canal is a very popular money maker these days I guess."")Art was ready to schedule the crown and the root canal immediately.He claimed that they had a ""little thingy that can go between the teeth and gum and that it was all squishy under there."" 
I decided to get a second opinion and was told that I did not need a root canal.  If I did, he would be able to see it on the X rays OR I would be in terrible pain...neither was true! As for the crown...he said it looked fine as well.
As for the letter that Art claimed to have sent: Neither the insurance company nor I have received any letter.  When I called back to get the date of the letter, the receptionist claimed that Art was the only one who had access to my file and that he would call me back tomorrow.
When I called Liberty Dental Insurance back, I talked to Kimmey. She reconfirmed that my original understanding of pricing was correct and that Hugo was mistaken. She said that  Liberty Dental Insurance did not get any letter from Lincoln Hills Dental.  She suggested that they change me to another dentist...(Is this the game?  They just shuffle you to another dentist?)I can only conclude that Art just decided today that they did not want to work with me because I was forcing them to abide by their legal agreement with the insurance company and the lower pricing that would entail.
Further, as for the root canal...I have no idea...but it seems suspicious that they would make such a claim when another dentist saw no problem. ",  Dental Services

										My girlfriend went for cleaning and exam at Dossett Dental in 2011.  The dentist, a Korean lady named Susan Koo, said my girlfriend needed deep cleaning, a crown, and a bridge. She then sent my girlfriend out to talk with the office manager about the cost.
The office manager, a lady named Fariba Dadgostar, told her the deep cleaning would be $900.  She then went on to tell her that she needed the deep cleaning because she had a gum infection and that her lower jaw would rot away if she did not get the deep cleaning.  The dentist never mentioned she had a gum infection or anything about her lower jaw rotting away. 
My girlfriend told her she just wanted the regular cleaning and exam and that was all.   Fariba told her they would not do regular cleaning, only the deep cleaning for $900.  
I could not believe what I was hearing; the office manager was making decisions regarding her medical treatment. [continued below]....
									
										.....   This middle-eastern lady was not a dentist, not even a dental assistant, and here she was making medical decisions. 
I then became very irritated at what I was hearing and asked Fariba if I could speak to the dentist.  She said that I could not.  I told her my girlfriend wanted just the regular cleaning.   Fariba said they would only do the deep cleaning and refused to do the regular cleaning.  We left the place in disgust.
About a week later we went to another dentist and this dentist told her she did not need deep cleaning at all and that she did not have a gum infection.  They did the regular cleaning and exam and everything was fine.
I also spoke to my dentist about deep cleaning and he said it was rarely needed.  I believe something should be done to stop this unethical practice and hope the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners does something.
I was really angry about what we had experienced at Dossett Dental as they were just trying to rip us off.  I filed a compliant with the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners.  A lady from their office called me and said she could not believe that they refused to do a regular cleaning.  
They are investigating the matter at the time of this posting and apparently they have had numerous complaints against Dossett Dental.  I would recommend everyone to avoid Dossett Dental.
I found this on the Better Business Bureau website:
On April 17, 2009 the State Board of Dental Examiners found that Kenneth Dossett, DDS, with license number 9584, improperly billed patients and issued a reprimand.

										I came to Dr Igor German in December, 2011 for an initial visit and emergency work for a broken front tooth.  Several thousand dollars later, a root canal, and a temporary bridge in place, I left with an appointment for January.  I had the appointment  January14, which resulted in another temporary bridge and hundreds more dollars.  I got an appointment for February to be fitted with my permanent bridge.  As I was leaving, I asked Shane, the receptionist, if I could submit a picture so that the finished bridge would be a somewhat accurate representation of what my original teeth looked like.  She said I could email it or drop it by.  I sent the email to their website address and thought the matter was taken care of.I got a call from Shane about a week before my appointment in February saying she did not receive the pictures and that they had not started making the bridge.  I tried again, had someone else try again to send the pictures.  They were not received.  After several phone calls, Shane said the address was dentaldiscovery@gmail.com--1st time it had been mentioned that there is another email address.  No mention of this address is listed on their website, nor anywhere else.  Shane was very rude, said it was my own fault that I could not possibly keep my original February appointment to get my permanent bridge as it hadn't been started.  She said she had the pictures, which of course were received after getting the correct email address.  She said she would give me a call when the bridge was ready.  This was mid-February.A month goes by, no call.  My temporary bridge broke in 2 pieces on a Friday, March 17.  I called @ 10 AM, got voice mail, which didn't mention office hours.  I went to the office at 1 PM, which was closed.  I called the phone number, got a recording to call their other office on the other side of town.  I got another recording with yet another number which said to leave a message and someone would get back to me right away.   I waited in the area until after 5:30 PM, still no response.  I went home.  Saturday morning, March 18th,  I got a call from a woman who asked who I was and which office I normally visit. I told her ""the Silver Springs office"".  Her response was ""Oh"".  No further calls.  Still no response from Shane or anyone else in the Silver Springs office.I went to work that night and the next 3 nights with a broken temporary bridge that kept falling out if I bent over.  I did not receive a call back until after noon on Tuesday the 20th from Shane, telling me that both offices are closed on Fridays, that I should have known that, and that is was my own fault that it was taking so long to get my permanent bridge.  She said it was done, had been in their office waiting for ME to call them to schedule an appointment.  She also said that she had called numerous times, had others call numerous times, but got no answer.  I replied that she had my home number, my cell number, and my email address.  NO attempts were made to contact me.  She even had my friend's email address who sent her a picture of me!  She yelled at me and told me I had no reason to be upset because they don't offer after hours emergency care and it was my own fault that I was kept waiting.  She told me that if I could not be in their office by 9AM the following morning, it would be another week before they could accommodate me, saying,""It's not our fault that you work nights and can't make it here by that time.  I don't know what to tell you.""  I am working a nursing contract over 100 miles away from Ocala, 7PM to 7:30 or 8 AM.  She was aware of this.I called the other office, told them about my broken bridge and the way I was treated by Shane.  They put a girl on the phone who works both offices.  She said she would be there the following day and would work me in.  She assured me that I would not have to have any contact with Shane.I came in straight from work after working a 13-hour shift, got there before 10 AM.  No apology was made for the delay in getting my permanent bridge, none for ignoring my emergency, nor did Shane apologize for her rude behavior.  Dr Igor's comment was, ""I know it has taken awhile to get your permanent bridge, but at least it's over now.""It was my front teeth that were being replaced.  I work with the public, have to lean over patients in bed, with my temporary bridge falling out on the bed!  It was humiliating, not to mention having to disinfect them to keep from catching something!  I couldn't eat anything that had to be bitten in front, nor could I tolerate cold or hot without great pain.  Their recording says ""someone will get right back to you"", which is a lie.  Their website talks about how friendly and courteous they are, how they cultivate trust and friendship, how they take care of emergencies.  BEWARE!  Once they have your money, you no longer matter to them!

										I have had Liberty Dental Insurance for several years and they advertised both Rocky Ridge Dental and Lincoln Hills Dental as offices that accepted Liberty Dental Insurance.When I went to Rocky Ridge, they recommended a filling and / or crown several years ago. When they gave me the price, they refused to honor the insurance pricing. Art, the office manager, said, ""This is the price and if you want service you have to pay our price.""I just got mad and walked out.
I called Liberty Dental Insurance several times and talked to at least 4 people and all confirmed that I was right...I was to pay the co-pay, plus an upgrade fee only...They offered to change me to another dentist. I did that and found Lincoln Hills Dental...little did I know it was the same company! I also upgraded my plan.
When I got pricing from Lincoln Hills Dental, Art, the same office manager appeared. Again, he refused to explain the costs, and refused to discuss the insurance. I e-mailed 3 times and got no answer.
This morning, when I called Liberty Dental Insurance, I talked to a man named Hugo who claimed that I was to pay a co-pay, an upgrade, plus the cost of gold. He claimed that the dentist can set the price of the material at whatever they want. This was the first time anyone ever said this! He agreed to call Art at Lincoln Hills Dental and get an answer.
In the mean time, Art called me and claimed that the dentist had decided that they did not want me as a client. He claimed they sent a letter to me and to the insurance company in January and this is why he had not answered me in March.
He said the reason was because of a comment I made while in the office...when the dentist said I may need a root canal. She said that she would not know until she took off a crown and looked. (I said, ""Oh yes...the root canal is a very popular money maker these days I guess."")Art was ready to schedule the crown and the root canal immediately.He claimed that they had a ""little thingy that can go between the teeth and gum and that it was all squishy under there."" 
I decided to get a second opinion and was told that I did not need a root canal.  If I did, he would be able to see it on the X rays OR I would be in terrible pain...neither was true! As for the crown...he said it looked fine as well.
As for the letter that Art claimed to have sent: Neither the insurance company nor I have received any letter.  When I called back to get the date of the letter, the receptionist claimed that Art was the only one who had access to my file and that he would call me back tomorrow.
When I called Liberty Dental Insurance back, I talked to Kimmey. She reconfirmed that my original understanding of pricing was correct and that Hugo was mistaken. She said that  Liberty Dental Insurance did not get any letter from Lincoln Hills Dental.  She suggested that they change me to another dentist...(Is this the game?  They just shuffle you to another dentist?)I can only conclude that Art just decided today that they did not want to work with me because I was forcing them to abide by their legal agreement with the insurance company and the lower pricing that would entail.
Further, as for the root canal...I have no idea...but it seems suspicious that they would make such a claim when another dentist saw no problem. ",  Dental Services

										My girlfriend went for cleaning and exam at Dossett Dental in 2011.  The dentist, a Korean lady named Susan Koo, said my girlfriend needed deep cleaning, a crown, and a bridge. She then sent my girlfriend out to talk with the office manager about the cost.
The office manager, a lady named Fariba Dadgostar, told her the deep cleaning would be $900.  She then went on to tell her that she needed the deep cleaning because she had a gum infection and that her lower jaw would rot away if she did not get the deep cleaning.  The dentist never mentioned she had a gum infection or anything about her lower jaw rotting away. 
My girlfriend told her she just wanted the regular cleaning and exam and that was all.   Fariba told her they would not do regular cleaning, only the deep cleaning for $900.  
I could not believe what I was hearing; the office manager was making decisions regarding her medical treatment. [continued below]....
									
										.....   This middle-eastern lady was not a dentist, not even a dental assistant, and here she was making medical decisions. 
I then became very irritated at what I was hearing and asked Fariba if I could speak to the dentist.  She said that I could not.  I told her my girlfriend wanted just the regular cleaning.   Fariba said they would only do the deep cleaning and refused to do the regular cleaning.  We left the place in disgust.
About a week later we went to another dentist and this dentist told her she did not need deep cleaning at all and that she did not have a gum infection.  They did the regular cleaning and exam and everything was fine.
I also spoke to my dentist about deep cleaning and he said it was rarely needed.  I believe something should be done to stop this unethical practice and hope the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners does something.
I was really angry about what we had experienced at Dossett Dental as they were just trying to rip us off.  I filed a compliant with the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners.  A lady from their office called me and said she could not believe that they refused to do a regular cleaning.  
They are investigating the matter at the time of this posting and apparently they have had numerous complaints against Dossett Dental.  I would recommend everyone to avoid Dossett Dental.
I found this on the Better Business Bureau website:
On April 17, 2009 the State Board of Dental Examiners found that Kenneth Dossett, DDS, with license number 9584, improperly billed patients and issued a reprimand.

That never happened so I called them back and went in and come to find out the doctor that was their is no longer working in their office...

On 11/6/11 I ordered one toothbrush from 30second smile company.  The total cost should have been 2 payments of $37.42 +s/h.  On 11/8/2011 I received a charge on my account of $134.70 from 30 second smile co, this was much more than the first payment of $37.42 that I had expected.  I called the company and they said I ordered three tooth brushes.  They told me to wait to recieve them, ship them back and they would credit me for the difference.  I told them I felt they were a dishonest co and I wanted to just end the transaction.  They would not agree to this so I disputed the charge of $134.70 with my bank and closed my debit card so they would not bill me for any more.  On 11/15/2011 my bank returned the $134.70 to my account and told me to refuse the package when I received it in the mail.  On 11/24/11 I received the package in the mail and returned it unopened to the sender.  I thought this matter was closed but the 30 second smile company attempted to charge my account for another $89.85.  Since I closed my Debit card this payment did not go through so now they have turned this over to Monterey Collections Oceanside, Ca.

										On February 24th, 2012 I went in for a free consultation with Dr. Davis. As I was sitting in the dentist chair the assistance starting doing x-rays and I said, I am not paying for the x-rays because I was told when I did the appointment it would be free. Both Dr. Davis and her 2 assistance agreed that this was all free. I did not get a copy of the x-rays. I did not like the estimate for the work on I needed on my teeth. I thought it was very high compared to other places I have gone to. So Itold Dr. Davis this and left. On February 29th, I receive a charge bill in the amount of 23.00 for x-rays and InfectionControl (what ever that means). I immediately called and spoke to Ivy in billing and explained that I did not sign anything to agree to pay for x-rays and I was told I was getting a free consultation, and no for x-rays. I also advised Ivy to call me back within 24 hours so this we can resolve issue. To this day Ivy never called me back. I called the dentist office again the very next day and spoke to Jennifer Gentry (Office Manager) and explained that I was not responsible for this bill of $23.00 and I would like a full credit. I also wanted proof that I agreed to pay this amount. She told me you would call me back within 24 hours. As of today, I have not heard from her.On March 5th I emailed Jennifer Gentry and advised her in an email that if I do not receive a credit for the amount of $23.00 I will file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and Consumer Affairs, and the Florida Dental Board, I will also voice my opinion on consumer website like Angie's List, Healthgrades.com, Doctoroogle.com for misleading your patient, telling them it is free consultation and x-rays and then you send them a bill.

										I came to Dr Igor German in December, 2011 for an initial visit and emergency work for a broken front tooth.  Several thousand dollars later, a root canal, and a temporary bridge in place, I left with an appointment for January.  I had the appointment  January14, which resulted in another temporary bridge and hundreds more dollars.  I got an appointment for February to be fitted with my permanent bridge.  As I was leaving, I asked Shane, the receptionist, if I could submit a picture so that the finished bridge would be a somewhat accurate representation of what my original teeth looked like.  She said I could email it or drop it by.  I sent the email to their website address and thought the matter was taken care of.I got a call from Shane about a week before my appointment in February saying she did not receive the pictures and that they had not started making the bridge.  I tried again, had someone else try again to send the pictures.  They were not received.  After several phone calls, Shane said the address was dentaldiscovery@gmail.com--1st time it had been mentioned that there is another email address.  No mention of this address is listed on their website, nor anywhere else.  Shane was very rude, said it was my own fault that I could not possibly keep my original February appointment to get my permanent bridge as it hadn't been started.  She said she had the pictures, which of course were received after getting the correct email address.  She said she would give me a call when the bridge was ready.  This was mid-February.A month goes by, no call.  My temporary bridge broke in 2 pieces on a Friday, March 17.  I called @ 10 AM, got voice mail, which didn't mention office hours.  I went to the office at 1 PM, which was closed.  I called the phone number, got a recording to call their other office on the other side of town.  I got another recording with yet another number which said to leave a message and someone would get back to me right away.   I waited in the area until after 5:30 PM, still no response.  I went home.  Saturday morning, March 18th,  I got a call from a woman who asked who I was and which office I normally visit. I told her ""the Silver Springs office"".  Her response was ""Oh"".  No further calls.  Still no response from Shane or anyone else in the Silver Springs office.I went to work that night and the next 3 nights with a broken temporary bridge that kept falling out if I bent over.  I did not receive a call back until after noon on Tuesday the 20th from Shane, telling me that both offices are closed on Fridays, that I should have known that, and that is was my own fault that it was taking so long to get my permanent bridge.  She said it was done, had been in their office waiting for ME to call them to schedule an appointment.  She also said that she had called numerous times, had others call numerous times, but got no answer.  I replied that she had my home number, my cell number, and my email address.  NO attempts were made to contact me.  She even had my friend's email address who sent her a picture of me!  She yelled at me and told me I had no reason to be upset because they don't offer after hours emergency care and it was my own fault that I was kept waiting.  She told me that if I could not be in their office by 9AM the following morning, it would be another week before they could accommodate me, saying,""It's not our fault that you work nights and can't make it here by that time.  I don't know what to tell you.""  I am working a nursing contract over 100 miles away from Ocala, 7PM to 7:30 or 8 AM.  She was aware of this.I called the other office, told them about my broken bridge and the way I was treated by Shane.  They put a girl on the phone who works both offices.  She said she would be there the following day and would work me in.  She assured me that I would not have to have any contact with Shane.I came in straight from work after working a 13-hour shift, got there before 10 AM.  No apology was made for the delay in getting my permanent bridge, none for ignoring my emergency, nor did Shane apologize for her rude behavior.  Dr Igor's comment was, ""I know it has taken awhile to get your permanent bridge, but at least it's over now.""It was my front teeth that were being replaced.  I work with the public, have to lean over patients in bed, with my temporary bridge falling out on the bed!  It was humiliating, not to mention having to disinfect them to keep from catching something!  I couldn't eat anything that had to be bitten in front, nor could I tolerate cold or hot without great pain.  Their recording says ""someone will get right back to you"", which is a lie.  Their website talks about how friendly and courteous they are, how they cultivate trust and friendship, how they take care of emergencies.  BEWARE!  Once they have your money, you no longer matter to them!

										I have had Liberty Dental Insurance for several years and they advertised both Rocky Ridge Dental and Lincoln Hills Dental as offices that accepted Liberty Dental Insurance.When I went to Rocky Ridge, they recommended a filling and / or crown several years ago. When they gave me the price, they refused to honor the insurance pricing. Art, the office manager, said, ""This is the price and if you want service you have to pay our price.""I just got mad and walked out.
I called Liberty Dental Insurance several times and talked to at least 4 people and all confirmed that I was right...I was to pay the co-pay, plus an upgrade fee only...They offered to change me to another dentist. I did that and found Lincoln Hills Dental...little did I know it was the same company! I also upgraded my plan.
When I got pricing from Lincoln Hills Dental, Art, the same office manager appeared. Again, he refused to explain the costs, and refused to discuss the insurance. I e-mailed 3 times and got no answer.
This morning, when I called Liberty Dental Insurance, I talked to a man named Hugo who claimed that I was to pay a co-pay, an upgrade, plus the cost of gold. He claimed that the dentist can set the price of the material at whatever they want. This was the first time anyone ever said this! He agreed to call Art at Lincoln Hills Dental and get an answer.
In the mean time, Art called me and claimed that the dentist had decided that they did not want me as a client. He claimed they sent a letter to me and to the insurance company in January and this is why he had not answered me in March.
He said the reason was because of a comment I made while in the office...when the dentist said I may need a root canal. She said that she would not know until she took off a crown and looked. (I said, ""Oh yes...the root canal is a very popular money maker these days I guess."")Art was ready to schedule the crown and the root canal immediately.He claimed that they had a ""little thingy that can go between the teeth and gum and that it was all squishy under there."" 
I decided to get a second opinion and was told that I did not need a root canal.  If I did, he would be able to see it on the X rays OR I would be in terrible pain...neither was true! As for the crown...he said it looked fine as well.
As for the letter that Art claimed to have sent: Neither the insurance company nor I have received any letter.  When I called back to get the date of the letter, the receptionist claimed that Art was the only one who had access to my file and that he would call me back tomorrow.
When I called Liberty Dental Insurance back, I talked to Kimmey. She reconfirmed that my original understanding of pricing was correct and that Hugo was mistaken. She said that  Liberty Dental Insurance did not get any letter from Lincoln Hills Dental.  She suggested that they change me to another dentist...(Is this the game?  They just shuffle you to another dentist?)I can only conclude that Art just decided today that they did not want to work with me because I was forcing them to abide by their legal agreement with the insurance company and the lower pricing that would entail.
Further, as for the root canal...I have no idea...but it seems suspicious that they would make such a claim when another dentist saw no problem. ",  Dental Services

										My girlfriend went for cleaning and exam at Dossett Dental in 2011.  The dentist, a Korean lady named Susan Koo, said my girlfriend needed deep cleaning, a crown, and a bridge. She then sent my girlfriend out to talk with the office manager about the cost.
The office manager, a lady named Fariba Dadgostar, told her the deep cleaning would be $900.  She then went on to tell her that she needed the deep cleaning because she had a gum infection and that her lower jaw would rot away if she did not get the deep cleaning.  The dentist never mentioned she had a gum infection or anything about her lower jaw rotting away. 
My girlfriend told her she just wanted the regular cleaning and exam and that was all.   Fariba told her they would not do regular cleaning, only the deep cleaning for $900.  
I could not believe what I was hearing; the office manager was making decisions regarding her medical treatment. [continued below]....
									
										.....   This middle-eastern lady was not a dentist, not even a dental assistant, and here she was making medical decisions. 
I then became very irritated at what I was hearing and asked Fariba if I could speak to the dentist.  She said that I could not.  I told her my girlfriend wanted just the regular cleaning.   Fariba said they would only do the deep cleaning and refused to do the regular cleaning.  We left the place in disgust.
About a week later we went to another dentist and this dentist told her she did not need deep cleaning at all and that she did not have a gum infection.  They did the regular cleaning and exam and everything was fine.
I also spoke to my dentist about deep cleaning and he said it was rarely needed.  I believe something should be done to stop this unethical practice and hope the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners does something.
I was really angry about what we had experienced at Dossett Dental as they were just trying to rip us off.  I filed a compliant with the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners.  A lady from their office called me and said she could not believe that they refused to do a regular cleaning.  
They are investigating the matter at the time of this posting and apparently they have had numerous complaints against Dossett Dental.  I would recommend everyone to avoid Dossett Dental.
I found this on the Better Business Bureau website:
On April 17, 2009 the State Board of Dental Examiners found that Kenneth Dossett, DDS, with license number 9584, improperly billed patients and issued a reprimand.

That never happened so I called them back and went in and come to find out the doctor that was their is no longer working in their office...

										This is a copy of letter I sent to BBB regarding this company.  Stay away from them...very hard to deal with.  very confusing marketing practices
On 11/6/11 I ordered one toothbrush from 30second smile company.  The total cost should have been 2 payments of $37.42 +s/h.  On 11/8/2011 I received a charge on my account of $134.70 from 30 second smile co, this was much more than the first payment of $37.42 that I had expected.  I called the company and they said I ordered three tooth brushes.  They told me to wait to recieve them, ship them back and they would credit me for the difference.  I told them I felt they were a dishonest co and I wanted to just end the transaction.  They would not agree to this so I disputed the charge of $134.70 with my bank and closed my debit card so they would not bill me for any more.  On 11/15/2011 my bank returned the $134.70 to my account and told me to refuse the package when I received it in the mail.  On 11/24/11 I received the package in the mail and returned it unopened to the sender.  I thought this matter was closed but the 30 second smile company attempted to charge my account for another $89.85.  Since I closed my Debit card this payment did not go through so now they have turned this over to Monterey Collections Oceanside, Ca. Resolution Sought: 30 second smile co turned my account over to collection for $89.85.  I want them to consider this transaction complete and not attempt to collect any money from me because I refused package and had it sent back to them

										I have been going to Dr Ching at Southwest Family Dentistry for the last 15 years.  In the last 3-4 years I have had nothing but bad billing issues with them.First, they would have you pay your co-pay and any outstanding balance before they work on the pre authorized claim.  Then after a month later they would bill you again stating the insurance company didnt pay the full authorized amount.  This made me furious, I called them on several occasions about their bad billing practice.  At some points they even cleared the balance.They did the same thing to my daughter, even though she is over 18, out of the house and on her own I still have her under my insurance plan because she doesnt make that much money and they did the same thing to her and was hit with a $950 bill.  If she knew that it was going to be that high she wouldnt have had the work done.  They told her that her services were pre authorized by the insurance company.This last month me and my wife went in, she had her work done and her co-pay and balance after pre auth paid as well.   I had a paid my co-pay and pre auth balance paid as well.  When Dr Ching came in, I mentioned to him about the billing issues that I have been experiencing.  He said that sometimes when they get pre authorizations that the insurance doesnt pay the full amount that they received.  He then started to examine my tooth for a filling.  After viewing the x-rays he said that I needed a crown and shouldnt do the filling, he would then have to get a pre authorization on the crown.  I then said ok, but then he said he wanted to drill it out to make sure Make sure, he all ready told me that I needed a crown.  He then drilled it out and said yes you need a crown. Ok, so in the middle of me being in the chair the assistant came in and had me sign that they needed to do a temp filling and that its going to cost me 80$ and that insurance was covering the rest, I then would have had a credit of 80$ towards my crown.  Right then I was bummed as Dr Ching knew before he drilled out my tooth that I needed  crown so he wanted to drill it out and make a few extra bucks until actually doing the crown.I called them two weeks ago to ask for my credit balance, they said they would call me in two weeks since I am going to start using another dentist.  I then called them again last week and Janet told me that they would have someone call me on Saturday to discuss the credit balance and not to come in because she can tell I was not happy.  Saturday came and no call, she lied to me like the others that work there.I received my bill last weekend, not only did the insurance not pay the full authorized amount that the Dr Chings assistant stated but I owed even more!  I received a bill that had my daughters balance added as well when in fact she is not my dependent any longer.  I called my insurance which in fact stated they did not receive any authorization for my temp filling so now I have to pay the full amount.Southwest Family Dentist has been practicing this shady billing for the past 3-4 years with me.  I did not receive any paperwork that I signed stating my billing.  So the paper I sign is blank and they just put any amount after that as I dont see anything and am sure that is not right either.",  Dental Services

After about an hour of trying to sell me different services, I said if needed the tooth pulled. I was informed at that time their Dentist could not be using the gas because she was pregnant. Why did they waste a days pay and an extra day in pain. I found a real Dentist that was opened on Saturday's at an extra charge and told he could save the tooth with out pulling it out. He performed a root canal. I was exposed to a lot of  x-rays that should not have to take. I will be putting this on the Internet to be careful about this Dentist office. I will also be reporting this with the local BBB, Rip of Reports, and all over the Internet telling them about my experience.

After they tried to sell me other things that they said were needed at about the cost of all their treatments would be about $1800.00. They told me that tooth in question had to be pulled. Than told be me the gas could not be used because the Dentist was pregnant. That would have been OK if they had handed me off to another dentist. I had to take the day off work and left in pain. I found a Dentist that open on Saturdays and he was very surprised that the any Dentist would tell me that this tooth had to be pulled and he was able to do a simple root canal and saved the tooth in question. I am also looking to find the owner of this shopping center and I will see if they are interested in selling the center to me. Money is not the issue. I have plenty of money.

										In Dec of 2011 I went to Sunwest Dental Center to have my upper plate repaired. The plate was craked down the center.The denture tech, Dan said he could repair my denture for free if I bought a new set of dentures. He told me there were 3 different options I could choose from: good, better and best. I decided to buy the mid range denture for $1400.00The very first thing I told the tech, Dan was that I was tired of bitting myself on my lips. The reason I have always bit myself was because my current dentures were slightly too big and the upper teeth were prjected outward. I told him if I agreed to buy new dentures I wanted that problem fixed, that I wanted my teeth to be slightly angled inward so I wouldn't bite myself so easily.Dan assured me that that would be no problem and I would be more than happy with my new teeth.Then, during the fitting of the wax teeth he told me there would be a slight gap between the 2 front teeth, but I wouldn't be biting myself with these teeth. He told me to be sure I was happy with the way they fit because once he made them into real, permanent teeth he couldn't change them.On Dec 23 I received my new permanent teeth. Dan made some adjustments to the bite and told me if I needed any more adjustments to just come back and he would be happy to do it.When I got home and looked in the mirror I realized my teeth were not aligned correctly. I had a tooth right in the very center. The upper right center tooth was so far to the left that it was exactly in the center. The lower set was centered correctly.I went straight back to their office and I told the tech, Dan that this was unacceptable. I said look at my teeth. I have a tooth right in the middle of my mouth.Dan agreed that it was too far to the left but said that I had authorized that setting. I told him that I did not. He said I 'OKed' the wax fitting. I told him that I thought I was 'OKing the way they fit in my mouth. Ultimately, Dan agreed to remake the dentures because the upper was misaligned. We had to go through the whole process of taking imprints of my mouth again and fitting the wax teeth in order to make the permenant set.Finally, on Jan 13 my new teeth were delivered. I sat in the chair and Dan handed my the teeth and said, ""there ya go!""I put them in my mouth and he handed me a mirror. He asked me if that was better. I said the alignment was good but now there was an overbite and I had specificlly asked him to correct that issue.He said that there wasn't anything he could do about that and that was how they should be made anyway. He did not check the bite or ask me how they fit. He just told me I could come back if I needed any adjustments. I got home and looked in the mirror and instantly could see that the overbite was even worse than I thought. I tried to eat with them and bit myself numerous times in numerous places. The bite was so far off that I could not chew anything good enought to swallow it.So I went back to have the bite adjusted. Dan made some adjustment to the bite and said if you need any more adjustments just come on back. I asked him, ""what about this overbite. I bite myself and I am completely unhappy with the way they look."" He just looked at me and smiled and shook his head and said, ""na I can't do anything about that.""",  Dental Services

 Aspen Dental ,"  Aspen Dental    
Nationwide United States of America ",www.aspendental.com, ,"Aspen Dental  Dentists Must Avoid Working With This Organization! United States, Nationwide","
										Dear Fellow Dentists & Patients,
I'm a general dentist with about 10-years work experience in my field.  Recently, I was unfortunate enough to accept a position as an employee dentist with Aspen Dental location(s) in Florida.  I learned this organization is nationwide, and is set-up in the same ""cookie cutter"" style; therefore, each office nationwide is run according to the same management style, same proprietary software, same interior decoration, same exterior decoration, and same goals... That is: To pound the dentist's pride, and to pound the patient's wallet! Funny thing is, they do this all while proposing a common vision of: ""Helping patients get the care they need."" More like, ""Helping themselves get the money they want!""
Dentists, (especially new grads), be very careful about this company!!! Aspen Dental is openly boasting about its unique market advantage of having an ever-increasing cache of upside-down dentists chained to accelerating student loan debt, and/or bad debts from past failed businesses... Aspen Dental is clinging to this philosophy of ample cheap talent, and in turn are spreading their clinics across the country like wildfire. They openly boast about opening 10 new clinics every month because they claim there's no end in site for dentists willing to prostitute themselves for the unilateral benefit of Aspen Dental...  But, from what I've seen in Florida, most of their clinics are without dentists, and they have to hire staffing companies like Dental Power International to find temporary dentists to fill-in where they can. I noticed that many of the ""permanent dentists"" that were there before I was only lasted a few months, and were then gone with the wind. Nobody ever had a clue about where they went, either.     
I graduated from dental school back in May 2002.  My first job was working as an associate in a private practice by August 2002... Right about the same time as that huge Tech-Bubble recession.  At that time, (10-years ago), I was being compensated the greater of $500/Day (or) 30% of my collections for my services.  This was considered the average market rate back in those days. Guess what, today Aspen Dental is offering their new associate dentists a flat rate of $400/Day, even though its common knowledge that the dollar's value is about half of what it was 10-years ago!  In addition, there's another class of dentists in the Aspen Dental ranks call an ""MCD,"" (Managing Clinical Director).  Here, the MCD is typically paid the greater of $500/Day (or) 20% of their clinic's ""profit margin,"" (which is typically about 8% of the clinic's collections). Initially, when I was being hired by Aspen Dental, they convinced me to try Aspen's business practice for 90-days to see their ""business advantages"" for myself... But after serious reflection, I discovered Aspen Dental has diminished the value of a dentist's services by (2 - 4) times of what it used to be back in 2002... And they think they can do this because there's so many dentists out there that are willing to prostitute themselves for these diminished wages.  As an educated professional who takes pride in my work, I find this to be offensive and a big ripoff!!! In order to break-through that measly $500/Day draw, an MCD dentist would have to produce an average of +$5,000/Day over 21-days per month on a predominantly PPO + DHMO fee schedule... Fellow dentists, we all know that's working our fingers to the bone!!!  Its nearly impossible to do with conventional dentistry. 
As far as the title ""MCD"" goes, Aspen Dental recruiters would like their new dentists believe that they will be ""co-managers"" of their clinic, where the office manager runs to front of the clinic, and the MCD runs the back of the clinic... Well, I can honestly say that this hiring tactic is a classic bait & switch, because both the MCD & Associate dentist(s) are considered to be highly expendable and very insignificant within the Aspen Dental clinic... Especially when it comes to any kind of management decisions throughout the clinic.  In fact, the office manager seemed to treat the hygienist as more of an ""MCD"" than the dentist that was supposedly hired for that position. Bottom Line: Either the dentist does what they're told to do by the office manager & regional manager, or they'll be fired without notice... That's exactly what happened to me when I offered my periodic written concerns to the office manager and the regional manager.  Funny thing was, these concerns were totally legitimate, and all were geared in the best interest of Aspen Dental. Remember, I'm an educated professional who takes pride in my work, not just trying to be a ""squeaky wheel"" for no reason at all.
As it turned-out, my office manager was very unprofessional and immature, as I've learned most Aspen Dental managers are, simply because of Aspen's rapid expansion, tight manager salaries, and lack of ability to find quality help at all the right times.  Bottom line, my office manager was fraternizing with subordinate staff members after-hours, and then developed personal friendships with them, and then basically gave them free reign of the clinic.  The sub-ordinates became the super-ordinates, and they were completely immune from any company policy, as well as their unprofessional treatment of the dentist(s) and patient(s). Somehow, their rogue behavior would always find its way back to the MCD, although the MCD had no management authority inside Aspen Dental, nor could MCD initiate any disciplinary actions to help control bad behavior. The staff would come to blame the MCD for their own poor performance on any given day because they claimed the MCD would ""belittle"" them, or make them ""feel stupid.""  They made these claims even though they wouldn't produce any clear evidence to support their claims, and even though the MCD had no idea what they were talking about... They just said it, and expected that to be enough... And, surprisingly, in the end it was enough for the management to be convinced into terminating the MCD without notice. LOL! Now, it would seem both the MCD and the MCD's patients feel ""belittled"" and ""stupid"" for having ever been associated with a crappy organization like Aspen Dental.
If cutting into the dentist's wallet and sense of professionalism aren't enough, there's always the Aspen Dental office manager who openly admits disrespect for any dentist, and thinks they have the freedom to change and/or omit the dentists' recommendations for prescribing medication to patients, as well as changing and/or omitting certain procedures the dentist plans in a patient's chart. In fact, the office manager I worked with had no problem jeopardizing the dentist's license to practice dentistry on any given day, and would invalidate any objection the dentist would give for these secondary decisions ultimately being the dentist's responsibility when things would go wrong for the patients.  In fact, such objections by the dentist would be viewed as contempt for the office manager's decisions, and would warrant spiteful reactions from the office manager soon thereafter.  In hindsight, I noticed this frank disrespect and contempt for the dentist increased over time from the staff and office manager... Until the dentist was finally fired without notice one day.
If all this isn't enough, there's the crazy schedule Aspen Dental has... Monday: (9-6); Tuesday: (11-8); Wednesday: (9-6); Thursday: (9-6); Friday: (8-5); and Saturday: (8-5).  Yes, that's right, night hours and 6-day weeks are the norm in this organization.  Dentists outside Aspen Dental are typically accostomed to working 4-day weeks, and only during ""regular"" business hours.  So, bottom line, Aspen Dental's schedule is full-time only, and really designed to wear-out even the most eager dentist over time.
When it comes to MOST patients, they can expect to be diagnosed with gum disease, have a team of ""professionals"" each remind them about the severity of their gum disease, and then be given no alternatives other than undergoing super-expensive ""gum therapy"" to get it under control.  True, some patients fall into this category, but NOT the majority of them as I've seen happen so many times and been encouraged to go along with for my ""stamp of approval.""  Even so, these patients that really need the gum disease help should ALSO be referred to a specialist called a ""Periodontist,"" rather than JUST being indefinitely cycled through an Aspen Dental hygienist's chair for topical and non-surgical treatment techniques.  The regional manager admitted to us that ""hygiene services"" is the hardest thing to sell in dentistry, so we must work together as a team to increase to urgency of this department to the patients... 
Also, as a consumer rights activist, I'm inclined to admit that Aspen Dental views each one of their clinics as ""profit centers,"" rather than as community oral health centers... They have universal software that produces a bunch of business numbers called ""Metrics,"" and from these numbers they focus on daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly sales performances from clinic to clinic... Then, they take it a step further by conducting behind-the-scenes competitions with other clinics to see who can produce the most from their own unsuspecting patients, and then reward the dentists, hygienists, and staff for doing so... Patients who are supposed to trust and honor the professional judgment and recommendations of their Aspen Dental healthcare providers are in many cases being way oversold.  Fact: The average treatment plan for any given patient is usually about $4,000!!!  With all the cheesy advertising Aspen Dental does on TV, and all the insurance participation they force dentists to do, they usually attract about 10 new patients a day... Then they have a ""Metric"" that shows how much treatment was planned, versus how much was accepted in dollar amounts. LOL! Quite greedy, indeed...  Obviously, there's no ""Metric"" to see if a patient's primary concern was address and resolved on any given day. Such irrelevant details are of no importance to Aspen Dental.
Finally, there's the Chinese dental lab in Beijing that's producing ALL of Aspen Dental's crowns, bridges, and partial denture metal frameworks... Funny thing here is, any given Aspen clinic will try and be sneaky by sending their cases in the mail to their central lab in Syracuse, NY... Then, Aspen's QC will check the impression(s) there... Assuming the impression looks OK, they will forward the impression(s) to Beijing, China for final prosthesis construction.  The finished prosthesis is eventually returned to the Aspen clinic in reverse fashion from above in about 2.5-weeks. As a U.S. dentist, I must admit this is pretty sketchy, since the FDA has no over-site or authority on actual materials being used in these prosthetics, which Aspen Dental patients are expected to wear in their mouths for many years on end.    
Dear patients, as a former Aspen Dental dentist, I must admit these truths to you.  Likewise, for current and future Aspen Dental dentists & hygienists, I can only beg you to stand for your integrity and good clinical judgment to benefit the patient's interests longterm, rather than compromising your ethics and morals just to turn a higher short-term profit for Aspen Dental corporate executives who really don't care about you or your professional license. This is especially true for Dentists, (AKA: ""Doc"").
Well, I hope this information helps anyone reading this think twice about doing business with this rogue organization.  After witnessing their tactics from the inside, I certainly wouldn't put my career in their hands, and moreover my health in their hands!  Good luck!

Concerned Dentist

A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business.  Ripoff Report Verified Business. Newport Beach California "," Ripoff Report Verified REVIEW:
EDitors UPDATE: Positive rating and recognition has been given to  Dr. Sherri Worth, Center for Reconstructive Dentistry  for its commitment to excellence in customer service.
Dr. Sherri Worth discussions with Ripoff Report have uncovered an ongoing commitment by the company to total client satisfaction. This means that clients can expect that the company will work towards finding a mutually satisfactory resolution to any complaints or concerns. Dr. Sherri Worth listens carefully to client concerns and sees them as an opportunity to learn from past mistakes and become more efficient as a company in the services offered and the support for those services. Our experienced team specializes in aesthetic and reconstructive dentistry, dental implants, and general dental services. Since 1995, we have been providing excellence in dental care, technology innovation, and expert results to celebrities, full-time moms, professional athletes, business professionals and models...The information provided in this report was based on comments made by Dr. Sherri Worth and her staff during an On-Site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases towards the Center for Reconstructive Dentistry. . 
Dr. Sherri Worth and the Center for Reconstructive Dentistry specialize in Veneers, Invisalign, Teeth Whitening, Crowns, Bridges, Inlays, Onlays, and Bonding. During the On-Site Business verification, Dr. Worth and her staff stated they work with individual patients to address their concerns, needs, and phobias in order to create an appropriate solution for services desired. They do this by asking questions throughout the appointment with the patient and always allow ample time to educate them about their oral health. Additionally, they feel their staff is equipped to provide feedback to their patients and continually have an open line of communication. Dental Hygienists work to show patients areas of concern throughout their appointment through the use of an oral camera. Furthermore, if a patient has a question, the hygienist will stop the procedure and address it immediately to ensure they are getting the best care possible. 
Before a major dental procedure, Dr. Sherri Worth explained that she goes through a comprehensive dental care plan which involves consultation with the patient to determine their needs, a history of the patients dental concerns, a comprehensive exam, and x-rays. Dr. Worth states that she will bring in specialists to meet all of the needs the patient might have in order to provide additional options. They try to present all options to the patient; however, if the patient is looking for something that is not in their best interest Dr. Worth always informs them of her concerns. Overall, they have found that an effective way to eliminate confusion is to explain procedures several times before treatment and then again after it has been completed.
After a patient has had a procedure done, their office manager commented that she is persistent in following up to address any concerns by phone as they feel it is more personal. Additionally, they send thank you cards and make an effort to follow up with them more than once to ensure they do not have additional concerns that have come up. After major procedures, Dr. Sherri Worth stated that she will personally follow up with patients through phone calls, emails, and text messages depending on the patients contact preference. If an issue does come up, they work to give it attention immediately and provide additional consultation for the next steps. 
The Center for Reconstructive Dentistrys office manager is generally the first to hear a complaint. Since the Corporate Advocacy Program through Ripoff Report she stated that she makes sure to make immediate contact with the patient and talk with them personally while walking them through possible solutions until they are satisfied.  They believe that the level of care that patients receive is top quality. If someone is dissatisfied with anything they work to discover the reason, correct it and apply that towards future situations. Dr. Sherri Worth mentioned that she is especially concerned with doing whatever it takes by providing patients the opportunity to have extensive consultation with all parties concerned, exams, and diagnosis. Additionally, they are concerned with follow up and have patients come back for further consultation appointments after procedures. Furthermore, Dr. Worth believes that the CAP program is good resource for assessing businesses on behalf of potential consumers.

										This dental office was the worst experience.  The oral surgeon and his staff were laughing and talking about the bad breath of his other patient and did not care that I was in pain from his rough tugging of my wisdom tooth. I was shaking with anxiety and very nervous when he made a comment to me that I like to be in control and he hope that I never have to have another tooth pulled. I went in to get a wisdom tooth pulled and a piece of another wisdom tooth pulled.  It was very painful and the oral surgeon was annoyed that I was in so much pain.  He pulled the piece of tooth and sent me home with antibiotics stating that the full tooth had an infection which is why it was so painful to pull.  I came back the following week for the second extraction to encounter rude comments and unprofessional treatment from the staff.   I felt very unsafe after the rude comments and the oral surgeon was very rough and tugging so hard on my tooth until the inside of my mouth was very ripped up.  It was so obvious that I was still in pain and he and his staff were rude and very unsympathetic.  I was still in pain as he made another negative comment while pulling very hard to do the stitches.  The nurse suggested vicodin and the surgeon gave a very rude ""No""!

										I was looking into getting a dental retainer to replace one that was lost.  My biggest mistake was contacting this company.  First of all, the website is misleading.  There is a specific retainer I wanted with a particular function.  After reading the description on the website, I clicked the buy it button, expecting the product to do what it  said in the description.  I purchased both an upper and lower retainer from this company.  Here is what is on the website.
""When using this dental retainer, a metal wire shows, unlike the Essix retainer (which is clear or 'Invisible').  When one smiles others are able to see the dental retainer wire; retainers with the wire across the front teeth are used mostly to keep teeth from shifting, but can also be used to move teeth; That type is called a 'Hawley with Finger Springs'. Finger Springs are small clasps that add pressure to one side of the tooth, ""moving"" it along the retaining wire. 
BUY HAWLEY RETAINERS  HERE  
I assumed the retainer would help shift my teeth after reading the description. When I received the product, the upper did not fit properly.  The lower fit, but it did not move my teeth like I assumed from reading the description.  
Right around this time, I lost access to my email, and had to use a different email.  I explained this several times to the merchant, to clarify why my emails were being sent from a different address.  I told him my concerns and he promised a replacement.  Every time I would send this person an email, he would take weeks before ever replying. 
 When he did reply, he would pretend that he did not know what I was talking about.  I explained the situation to him several times, and he promised replacements.  At one time, he told me he would be sending a new retainer in the mail with a tracking number.  This never happened.   What he did do was demand more money from me. 
  After over a month of trying to get this matter resolved, I contacted my credit card company with a dispute.  The response I got from the merchant was that if I returned the product, I would get a refund.  I returned the product but never received a refund.  The merchant is a liar and a fraud.  He does not have clear policies about his services.  How can you tell a client that you will provide a refund and then after you receive the product, change our mind?  I have all of the emails that were sent to me as well as the form where he gives a written instruction for me to return the product.
In one of my emails, he rudely tells me to ""Have a nice life.""   This is after I told him that it was ridiculous for me to pay more money when he had already promised me free replacements at no extra cost.  Now I am stuck with this charge and no product to speak of.  The merchant does not wish to further communicate with me.  He pretends to not know what I am talking about eveytime I try to contact him.  After promising a refund, he then tells me that he cannot give me one.",  Dental Services

										My adult daughter did not have insurance and she had to have a restorative crown for her front tooth, as the old one was falling off.   Being a single mother, I sought out affordable dental work to help her out, like any honest person would.   The clinic  made me pay up front, and the nightmare began.    I would tell anyone thinking of going to this clinic that it is a big mistake, and a costly one.    The letter below was sent to the clinic and is a perfect account of what happend.      There are more expensive but affordable dentist who are honest and allow you to pay as the work is being completed, none of this up front stuff.    I had to threaten to sue... that got me some money back but not all of it.   For your reading pleasure. 
 
Dear Grandpa's Dental
My daughter was given a consultation on 2/02/2012, at that time your dentist gave her an estimate of costs.   I was told by telephone, that I needed to pay upfront for the services rendered.   I trusted your 25 years of service advertizement, which I have attached.    I gave your dental office $400.00 which was charged to two credit cards ($200.00 each) on Feb 2nd.     My daughter scheduled an appointment for today February 8th    for a cleaning and lab impressions.   Her appointment was for 11:15, and she arrived at 11:00.    At approximately 2:00 I got a call from my daughter telling me that your office cleaned off the old site under the current temporary, and no cleaning was going to be done today?   Your office roughed up the old area, and took impressions and then tried to put the OLD temporary back over the crown area that was previously already crowned.   I paid for a new temporary which your clinic never intended on doing, yet you charged me $35.00, when she challeged your dentist they said they had no idea that one was paid for?   Do you not have a chart and the plan in front of the dentist?   Does your clinic not have a clear plan when a patient sits down?   I clearly dont understand why you can charge me for something you did not do?   The dentist stated to my daughter that it would take an hour to make the temporary?   An hour?  This is not standard practice, and she had been there for 2 hours already?    She walked across the street to the mall and waited for the temporary to be completed.    By the way I was told by your manager Sandy, that there was more than one temporary made?   Not true only one temporary was made, and it was unacceptable work, and she refused to wear it out in public.    My daughter became very hostile when she realized that your clinc ruined the old temporary and the new one looked in her words. like a wad of gum on the front tooth.    Her temper rose, and your employee was very non responsive to the crisis, instead of fixing it, they just kept telling her pretty much too bad.     Yes I can see how reputable your dental office is.  I called the clinic and encounter employee #1) Teresa, myself.   Teresa was rude, apeared not to know what I as talking about and began to act as thow she had no idea what was going on.    She would not answer my questions, was evasive and after arguing with her for at least 10 minutes, I was referred to Sandy.   Sandy called me and the arguing continued, she tried to tell me that she will only refund $300.00 of my $400.00 which is obsurd.     My daughter sat in your clinic for 4 hours, for what?   Impressions and a temporary tooth, this should take approximately 30 minutes?   She got impressions but no temporary.    My daughter finally ended up walking out of your clinic with the destroyed original temporary back on her tooth (which by the way is a front tooth the first thing you see).    No cleaning and no crown, and your management wants me to pay you for what?     When asked about your dental hygenist, we are told they come in twice a month?   Twice a month for a clinic with over 3000 patients this is what I am told from your management.    None of this was disclosed to my daughter or me when YOU took the payment of $400.00.        Because of the service today, we are not confident your clinic is cabalbe of doing acceptable dental work.    I am asking that you refund, me the entire $400.00 since really nothing was even done.    You wasted 4 hours of my daughters time, 2 hours of a family friend who took her, and over an hour and a half of my time calling and writing this letter.     If I were to bill you for my time, you would owe me $65.00 that does not include gas and frustration.     The crown is not ordered, your dentistry is less than standard, and your practices are unethical we walked away with nothing, so that is what you should be paid, nothing.   You prey upon people with no money and individuals without insurance who have no one to turn to  and then you hold them hostage, while you sit on the money they paid you.  You make excuses for your sub-standard work, and then try to collect a $100.00 for services that are not rendered?  NOT ACCEPTABLE    I believe even $50.00 is more than your service is worth, but I will settle for it.     I am asking Grandpas dental to refund, the $350.00 immediately to my account.   I will be expecting a call ASAP, regarding the refund.   If this is not done quickly and with the same speed you so greedily took my money, I will seek further action in court, with the licensing board, and any other agency who will listen.    ",  Dental Services

										So I just got home from the most traumatic dental experience in my life. I've had one wisdom tooth extracted at another oral surgeon in Manhattan, NY and it went perfectly ok. Healed nicely too. So after I went to the dentist yesterday, he suggested I get the other three removed since I was having pain in my other lower wisdom teeth and that one of my top one was growing horizontal.
I scheduled a consultation and was thinking that this would be a standard procedure and that I'd done it all before. I checked online, just to make sure that this place wasn't a dump and was pleasantly surprised that some people did their consultation and extraction the same day. So of course I called ahead and scheduled it all today.
When I got there, the place - was disgusting. Very old looking, ripped sofas, dirty windows in rooms! The receptionists were nasty and demanded payment upfront, which normally isnt a big deal for me but in this instance I should have followed my instincts. ""Your insurance doesn't cover going under,
just local anesthesia"" she said. Ok, no big deal...I have a high pain tolerance and I didn't go under for the last one.
Once Dr. Jules Roberts came in, he said ""Wait, you're not going under?"", and I said ""no, insurance doesn't cover it."" ""You don't have anyone who will help cover it?"" - wait, what? I asked how much
it was. $650. Ok, so I work for the City and I'm not ballin' but really? He asked me FIVE times....Yes, FIVE times. Come on! I don't want to spend that kind of money on a 20 minute procedure! And please, I'm too old to be asking my parents for money for dental procedures...
Anyways, he gets started on anesthesia. Wait...what happened to the consultation? Well, I guess he knows what he's doing so I just let him do it. The procedure goes well, the usual push and pull and awkward pressure...but imagine the ABSOLUTE HORROR on my face when he asks for the Suture. Ok, my knowledge of medicine is minimal and probably came from playing that surgical
game on the DS, but I know that Suture means Stitches. WHY are you putting STITCHES in my mouth?! He chuckles at the horrified expression on my face - ""Oh, I had to cut your gum and break some bone to get it out"". -First of all, that might be regular procedure, but you totally FAILED to
mention this to me before you started. I think I was in shock for a few moments, but he cleaned up and said ""follow me"" - and out the door.
They gave me some vicodin and showed me out the door. This place is disgusting and I dont recommend anyone to go to North Shore Oral Maxillofacial Surgery PC in Plainview unless you want to experience what I went through.  I was not even given a fair consultation, especially when they knew that there was a difficult extraction. To top this all off I received a collections letter from them demanding I pay for the anesthesia that I didnt even want in the first place.

Because all of the complaints that you will read about other locations are all connected to every location as they are all taught to use the same play book.Also note that newbie dentists will make mistakes. It would just be nice to know when I've become one of the ""first five year test chimps"" in advance. As long as there is REALLY some true dental mentor with a back ground of teaching that is really watching over them. That would be one thing. But SADLY, it appears that this is not the case.But the problems go far beyond just failure to diagnosis or misdiagnosis. And lean more towards the overt actions of the administrative staff of the Corporation (both on-site and at the Corporate level.) Go head and take your chances. But for the sake of your children. DON'T TAKE any chances.I understand that my warning may seem EXTREME based upon only what I have disclosed here. There are many other reason to avoid this entire chain that relate to the seriousness of what I have not been able to disclosed here at this time. Answers will come later (rest assured). But for now, STEER CLEAR OF THE ENTIRE CHAIN OF THIS CORPORATION AND ITS INSURANCE (REDUCED MEMBERSHIP PLAN) for the sake of you, your sisters, brothers, parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, but most of all, for the young children that look at these Dr's as a authority figures that we as parents have taught our children to obey.Last but not least.. No matter what type of Dr. it is that asks you to ever step out of your child's area where they are being treated. DON'T LEAVE. DON'T GET MAD AT THE SUGGESTION, BUT DON'T LEAVE THAT ROOM UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES. You as a parent / relative or even escort have an absolute RIGHT to remain with that child and DON'T LET THEM TELL YOU OTHERWISE. ",  Dental Services

										With a change of careers came a change of medical insurance. With that my primary dentist of many years was not in the network of my new insurance. I chose Coast Dental because it was close to home. I was given a complete check-up on my first visit, x-rays, probing, offered oral cancer screening($59.95) which I refused. Not required. 
Was informed I had moderate periodondtitis disease which according to Wkikpedia, up to 50% of the people have this disease. I was informed the treatment would cost out of pocket $1675 with follow up treatments every 3 months at $120.00 out of pocket expense.
 I called back  a couple days later to see if just a regular cleaning could be done, the receptionist stated that with the dentist diagnosis that he could just do the regular cleaning.  I went back to talk the dentist face to face. I explained I just wanted th regular cleaning, that the extensive cleaning was not in my budget, my teeth were cavity free, felt great and I did not want the procedure done.
 The dentist stated the he could not do this and ""feel' good about it, that it was like going to your  medical doctor and being told you had lung cancer! Really!!! I said, "" This disease is like lung cancer!!!!!""OMG! He back off on this as he realized he overstated the obvious.I asked if my teeth would fall out, no. 
 
Outcome of this is, Coast Dental provides dental care at marketing prices. They are a franchise. They deal in add-ons, not the basic routine stuff, but money makers. Not totally bad but you are not given any options. I believe I should have a choice in the matter and I do. I cancelled my appointment and went with another dentist who will perform the treatment according to my choice, not the dentist.

While in the middle of my treatment, their machine overheated so they could not give me my crown that day. I tried to negotiate schedule with Michael Ho but he could not do it til after a week because it's Chinese New Year. I never learned the first time, and I went back there to have my retainers done. They were the only one available when I got a day off so I took my chance again. Another drama happened. They said I that don't have to pay anything because my health fund covered it. After a week, I found out that they charged my health fund double and they told me that there's no way that they can reverse the payment. I will never go back there again.

The advertisement said that, if I call within 20 minutes, I will get various things included (INCLUDING FREE DELIVERY) FOR A TOTAL OF $59.95 AND NO MORE.When I called, it was a FULLY AUTOMATED order desk, and it became obvious that they were not going to credit me for having called within 20 minutes, and the bill kept rising. It rose to $117.34This amounts to fraudulent advertising.
I hung up the phone and immediately went online to see if I could cancel immediately. All I could get was an online chat room agent, who said there was no way that the order could be cancelled by her, and I would have to phone the office when it opened. I phoned at just after 10 a.m. December 24 when the office opened and tried to cancel the order, but they would not let me. I was quite obviously dealing with India.I immediately phoned Visa and they said I would have to receive the parcel and then ship it back, retaining proof. This I did, but still I had to fight with them for the refund. For reasons best known to themselves, they had charged me $75.78 on December 24, and had plans to charge me the other $44 or so on January 23. I don't know why.Despite proof of return, they kept dragging out the refund, and then finally they said they had refunded me $55.68, saying they were keeping the tax. This is quite simply ILLEGAL. I cannot pay tax on goods that I do not have. If we take something back to a store, they refund us the full amount and do not hold back tax.This company is operating outside the law. It has a warehouse at 5130 Halford Drive, Windsor, Ontario, N9A 6J3. Its head office is in Ontario California but it operates out of India.They are running a fraudulent advertising campaign and right from the beginning, according to British Columbia law, I had the right to cancel within seven days. I tried within seven minutes and they would not allow it. It cost me $17.44 to receive the item and send it back to them, and they have no right to charge taxes for goods that I have not had. This is simply illegal. Furthermore, the item should never have been shipped to me in the first place as I attempted to cancel the order within minutes, and they simply refused to cancel the order. I should not have had to pay any delivery charges.
They should have been refunded in light of their refusal to cancel.   I spoke with an agent at Revenue Canada 1-800-959-5525 regarding returned goods, and he told me that I am entitled to receive the full taxes back because I had returned the goods. They have simply pocketed the tax.

										On August 12 of this year I had a crown fall off (I believe the dentist actually called what I had an onlay). I disclosed with my dentist the crown was fairly new, and I was frustrated it would fall off. He had two suggestions for me:
1. Go back to my old dentist to discuss how to fix the broken crown. 
2. Have a new root canal performed, and crown put on by your office. 
Going back to my old dentist was not a choice I was going to make willingly as I felt extremely taken advantage of by him. Upon hearing my dentist from Coast tell me he didnt believe the onlay should have been performed, and there was little chance of it being affective, my mind was made up. I would be getting my procedure taken care of by their office. 
I had my charges explained to me, we agreed on our price, and I had the procedures done. Almost 4 months later, I received a bill for $190 because the tooth wouldn't be covered by my insurance as they only cover the same tooth to be worked on every 5 years. I had disclosed to my dentist the tooth was only two years old. (Coincidentally this bill came 2 weeks after I informed my dentist I was switching insurance companies, and would no longer be going to their office.) Had I been explained the insurance wouldnt pay for my tooth, I would have gone to the old dentist one last time to get the work fixed. I was cutting my losses for what I believed to be an acceptable price. I was told it is my responsibility to understand what my insurance will cover. I can understand that to a point, but I don't believe I should need  to call my insurance while sitting in the dentist's chair waiting for the procedure to be done.  
I don't understand how this office is allowed to take no responsibility for their failure to communicate with the insurance company with what is and is not covered. What stops this company from misrepresenting the true costs of a procedure to the client? It's not as if, after I have the procedure done, I can have it reversed due to their negligence.
Because of this, I will never be able to trust what my doctor says. I will be forced to call the insurance, and have a three-way conversation with the dentist office, the insurance company, and myself.									",  Dental Services

										This Waterford MI Dentist engages in illegal and abusive collection tactics. His office has sent my mother, an elderly woman, to collections for payment of services that her DAUGHTER received. 
My mother isn't even a patient of Dr. Warr and has NEVER been a patient!!  I find it absolutely deplorable that anyone could stoop to the level of harassing a senior citizen for payment of services he provided for her daughter.  
This dentist sent several threatening collection letters attempting to enforce some sort of verbal arrangement, and then proceeded to assign my sister's account to a collection agency in MY MOTHER'S NAME, so that the collection agency could  continue harassing my mother (a senior citizen) by illegally extort money from her.  Well, following collection laws, the collection agency was notified to ""validate"" this alleged debt, and of course,  they were unable to provide proof that this is a valid debt. [continued below]....
									
										..... 
This deplorable and abusive tactic needs to be known by all who may consider this dentist. It is pathetically sad that a professional would attempt to extort money from a vulnerable elderly woman simply because he feels he cannot receive payment from his patient.
He was even notified in writing that he should cease all attempts to collect from my mother, and to please contact the actual patient.  The least he could do is send the patient to collections, and not her elderly mother who has NOTHING to do with the services received. But no, he is obviously attempting to collect from whomever he believes will be easiest to collect from.

										Scheduled appointment to get my teeth cleaned.  I have great dental insurance that I pay about $700 a year for family coverage.  Unfortunately they have a monopoly and are the only dentist office in town that takes dental insurance.
As soon as I sat down, they put a document in my lap saying that I was going to be charged $55.00 beyond what my insurance pays. $5 for office visit and $50 for oral cancer screening.  Playing this off as if it is a typical/required service.  They haven't even looked in my mouth yet!  I am a non-smoker, nor do I use tobacco.  I am at very low risk for oral cancer.  I refused this added service.  They were very rude.  They told me I had to sign a document stating that I refused the service, which I did.
Then they took a bunch of xrays and looked at my teeth and gums calling out numbers for each tooth.  I once again told them that all I wanted was a regular teeth cleaning.
Then finally the dentist came in.  The first thing she asked was where I worked (I guess she was sizing me up for how much she would try to scam me out of).   She looked in my mouth and said that I needed deep cleaning and it would cost $98 out of pocket for me.  I told her that all I wanted was the regular dental cleaning that was free with my insurance.  She said that she would not allow that because she would be liable and her license would be at risk.  I told her that I would sign whatever release/waiver that they needed, just as I had done on the cancer screening that I had refused that all I wanted done was a regular dental cleaning.  She refused.  So now I've got $700 a year dental insurance and I can't even get my teeth cleaned.  My teeth are fine.
I contacted my dental insurance company and they told me that if I could find another dentist in town that is not a provider on my plan that I would have to pay the full amount out of my pocket and then submit the bill to the insurance company as a grievance.  I have an appointment with a dentist for March 1 to get this done.  It only cost $69 for the cleaning.  I think I will not take out the dental insurance in the future.
Also....I asked the dentist how I was better off in her opinion by not getting my teeth cleaned at all over having the regular cleaning.  She didn't have an answer, because there isn't one.  She is unprofessional and more interested in padding her wallet than to providing me the dental services that I deserved.  I called them back and told them that I felt that I was being discriminated against by them because they were not providing me a service that they offer.
Anyway....Stay away from Coast Dental in Lake City....You will be glad that you did.

										I went into this office several months ago to get a tooth fixed.  The filing fell out.  They told me I needed full xrays because it had been over 1 year since the last ones.  Then, I needed a full scale cleaning.  Then, the dentist spent 5 minutes replacing the filling in my tooth.  He said it was, ""any easy one"".   It was a top, front tooth, no pain killer was necessary - very simple.
While sitting in the chair waiting for the dentist, the finance girl came in needing my signature.  I am fortunate to have insurance and was told that my ONLY out of pocket expense would be $35, which I paid when I was there.
Several weeks later I received a notice from my insurance company that they were billed $2,000 and was only paying about $300.  This leaves an overhang of about $1,700.   Looking at the charges they submitted to the insurance company, it looks like they are inflated with multiple charges for the same thing.
If I had been told by the staff that the Insurance company may not pay or that I might get stuck with a bill for $1,700, I would have passed on the xrays and cleaning.  I just wanted to get my tooth fixed!!!  Most of my top teeth are capped anyway and I don't think I really needed the xrays and cleaning - especially if it's going to cost me $1,700!!!  I do not have an extra $1,700 laying around to pay for something THEY told me the insurance would pay.
I was not provided with accurate information so that I could make a informed decision concerning which services to agree to.  I don't know if they are incompetent or unethical but the bottom line is that you can not rely or trust what they tell concerning the cost of their services, especially if you have insurance.

										My dentist referred me to Dr. Abdel Fattah in Boca Raton, FL after having a root canal in their offices over 2 1/2 months ago. They told me that he was a dentist who ""specialized"" in pain disorders. They said they believe I had TMJ becuz I was in excruciating pain after the root canal. So I made an appt. to see him on 11/23/11. After a series of tests, he indicated that I had TMJ Disorder, which stands for Temporomandibular Joint in your jaw/skull. I explained to him I was in excruciating, throbbing pain which seemed to be coming from my upper molar (which I had the root canal on). He suggested I go get a 2nd root canal. Since this was the day before Thanksgiving, my endodontist was booked. So Dr. Fattah ""referred"" me to someone he knew (which I'm SURE he got a kick-back from!). So, I went to see this Endodontist which performed a 2nd root canal next to the other tooth. A week passed, two weeks - I was STILL in pain. The endodontist couldn't explain it since all nerves were removed from both teeth!A month later (now December) I finished both root canals & had temporary fillings put in. I was STILL having throbbing, excruciating pain! I called Dr. Fattah's office again out of desperation! Dr. Fattah was not only inconsiderate & rude in his bedside manner but uncompassionate towards the pain I was in. Right away, he said I would need different shots to ""determine where the pain was coming from"". As hesitant as I was, I was desperate for some kind of relief. So I let him give me the most HORRIFIC, PAINFUL shots to the outer side of my face! There was no anesthesia..just a cold spray prior to the shots! I screamed at how PAINFUL the shots were. He had the AUDACITY to tell me to ""BE QUIET BECUZ I WAS GOING TO SCARE THE OTHER PATIENTS THAT WERE THERE"" and I replied, ""I DON'T CARE..THIS HURT!"" And he replied rudely, ""WELL I DO CARE!"" I couldn't believe the way I was getting treated. The shots relieved the pain..yes temporarily! Each shot was a whopping $125.00! Then he told me he wanted me to go get an CT-Scan at one of his ""fellow friend's"" office (another dentist next door) which I'm sure he got a kick-back for that too! My dental insurance was maxxed out for the year so I had to pay $150.00 for that CT-Scan! Dr. Fattah told me to go back to his office after I got the CT-Scan so he could ""INTERPRET"" it. I went back there and he said I had ""bone loss"" in my jaw joint (which now it turns out another dentist who READ the REPORT says it is nothing significant!). Then he said to go get an MRI!! I drove far away to an MRI center & had to pay $250.00 co-pay for an MRI! After going through 1 hr. of different, painful tests in my mouth inside the MRI tunnel, I had to go back to Dr. Fattah!Dr. Fattah looked at the MRI disc & said I had ""inflammation of the facial muscle"" which was causing this pain. (I was charged for him looking at the MRI disc also!).  I did not know any better, so everything he was telling me I believed & we went along with! He said I would need an Ultrasound treatment & that I may see relief from it. So, I went along and accepted what he said. He charged me another $100.00 for an ultrasound treatment that lasted LESS than 1/2 HOUR! He then prescribed ""Soma"" which is a muscle relaxant and said to take it for several weeks..which I did. It didn't do anything. He said to take Ibuprofen 600 mg. which also DIDN'T do anything! That entire office visit that day ended up costing me $570.00. He charged me for the office consultation $110.00, $250.00 for the shots, another $110.00 to ""read"" the reports, and another $100.00 for the useless ultrasound!!! I couldn't believe it. I tried explaining to the girl at the front desk (who is also rude!) that I had Blue Cross Blue Shield, but she said they DON'T accept any insurance. That is was ""up to me"" to file it with them - which I tried doing but they said I had a huge deductible that I had not met..so I was ultimately responsible for this bill!   So, one week passes, two weeks, three weeks pass & I'm STILL in pain, the throbbing is there every minute of the day. So I decided to make an appt. with my primary care physician a couple of weeks ago. After reviewing my MRI & CT-Scan reports, he said he did not believe it was TMJ that could be causing this pain. He said to go get a 2nd opinion from another doctor! So I did. I decided to go see my mother's dentist in Miami, FL last week who is very good. He read every report, looked at the MRI disc & CT-Scan, read what this other scam artist did to me...and he disagreed that the TMJ was what was causing this pain. He said he believed it was being caused by the Trigeminal Nerve in my face...thus called ""Trigeminal Nerve Disorder"". So he said I needed to see a Neurologist to put me on some Tegretol (which is an anticonvulsant but also used to treat this condition). I called my M.D. and he was nice enough to call in a prescription for it. But said I do need to go see a Neurologist when it runs out in order to increase the dosage & get labwork. I am still in pain but I just started taking the medication and I was told it could be a week or two before I see relief.I am filing this report to WARN people NOT to be scammed by this dentist. He robbed me of almost $600.00 in one visit - not to mention the MRI & CT-Scan I had to get done! He has a fancy office, in an affluent community of Boca Raton so you think he is trustworthy. He is rude, cold and ruthless! He doesn't care about his patient's pain & how much they are suffering - on the contrary, he takes advantage of this to be able to rip them off. When you are desperately in pain, you are willing to do anything, pay anything to get relief - and that's what he does. He takes advantage of poor people like me that went to see him!But I am disputing the charges with my Visa credit card in hopes of being able to reverse the charges. I hope that anyone who reads this doesn't go see him! You have been warned!!   									",  Dental Services

They over billed me and my wife. We have excellent insurance, and we paid out of pocket expenses per each procedure. They then billed us hundreds of dollars of supplementals. They even over charged my wife in the office for white fillings coverage we have on our insurance, they lady at the counter told her she didn't have that coverage, my wife paid, then my wife checked and found we had the coverage, contacted their office, and the lady confirmed we had the coverage and said we would be given a credit, and instead were billed more. Now while we've been trying to get it squared away they have sent us to collections. We both have perfect credit, and this is beyond infuriating... never get dental work here EVER. It wasn't very clean anyways.

										Let me start by saying I have worn both a top and bottom partial denture made by Dr. Lowry from Cartersville, Ga for over 10 years with absolutely no problems what so ever. In July of 2010 I had to have another tooth added to my lower partial and since Dr. Lowry has retired I went to the Affordable Denture company here in Cartersville. They advised me they could not add another tooth to the partial I had and would have to purchase a new one from them, which I did so in July 2010. At that time they had 3 different grades of dentures: Economy, Custom, Premium. Instead of paying the lowest price I paid more for the ""Custom"" partial because I thought it would be better made and last longer. When they finished my plate I noticed that the gum in it was very thin. At this time I expressed my concern but was told it was a new type of material than the one I had before but was assured it was just as strong and would last for years. In November of 2011 I was simply drying my plate with a soft hand towel and it just broke in half in my hand. I made and appointment and took the plate in for repair. At that time I was told I would have to pay $145 (1/3 of the new price) to have the repair done. After expressing my disagreement with the fee I told them to fix it because at that time I had no other options.... I paid them the $145.00 and two days later on Monday received my partial. Within a couple hours the partial starting cutting into my mouth and of course I am unable to wear it. I called and was told it would be 2 more days before I can get an appointment to fix it. I am still going without my bottom partial at this time.  I would absolutely NOT RECOMMEND anyone use this company or at least the Cartersville office... They do very poor work and have even worse attitude when you try to get them to correct it... Not to mention the RIP OFF prices to repair something they didn't do correct to begin with....

										DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I bought the 30 second Smile from their website. At first I enjoyed this product, although I agree that the charges are ridiculous, my teeth seemed much cleaner. However, after only a few days I noticed that because my mouth is so small I was beginning to form sores at the back and sides of my mouth. Because I have a very small mouth, to clean those back teeth the product kept banging into my jaw. Also, the battery cap kept flying off mid-brush. So, the 30secs it was supposed to take turned into longer when I had to put not only the cap but the batteries that fell out back in again. I therefore decided to return the product. I took the risk and it failed so that's my fault. But what really made me angry is that I sent numerous customer service emails that were not returned. I waited a week and then I called but was told I had to call back in 15min for someone else to handle my issues. Strange and frustrating but I called back in 15mins. Then I'm told that not only do I have to pay for the product to be shipped back myself but that they will not refund $29.90 of my order... for what reason I do not know because the calling center is in India. It was not only hard to understand them but they only respond with pre-written answers. So when I asked a question not related to those responses they just responded with the same line over and over again. I know it is not the costumer service people's fault but this company has really horrible business model and does not care about the people using their products. I would have given them an okay review if it wasn't for their blatant disregard of the customer. Do not get sucked into this. It is not worth the hassle or the shipping charges.

regenerated as we agreed at the beginning and abutments should be implanted to beging with. I would not suffer a pain and financial loss.But, Dr Cha decided to go ahead and put the abutments. And instead separate crowns as we agreed, she installed the bridge. Since abutments were at different angles, these caused the bouncing effect on the bridge covering the gap and it kept falling down when I was eating.

After that Dr. Chas treatments I was afraid to put myself into her hands again and demanded the money back.  And, when Dr. Cha refused saying that this was the right way to do the procedure I had to suffer expenses paying different doctors to look for another opinion and find the right answer.

On nine visits to the office from October 20th through November 18th I experienced extreme malpractice and negligence from both Dr. Joseph Gaeta and Dr. Devo.  On October 20th I came in to the office of Celebrity Smiles with a bad toothache and was seen by Dr. Devo to begin a root canal.  The root canal was completed October 27th and on that same day the dentist began to file down my perfect tooth for an abutment and bridgework. After repeated visits and confirmations that the root canal was very good I became worried that indeed something was wrong because the pain was so bad. So I took the matter into my own hands and went to get a second opinion. I went to Dr. Moitoso and he took an xray and discovered the problem.  The root canals were not filled up to the apex and are about 2mm short of being properly sealed, therefore your infection will get worse. He referred me to an endodontist and I went the next day. He took another xray and said the canals are not filled enough, and to do another root canal with that infection would most likely fail.  I then proceeded to get in to have the tooth extracted immediately. Dr. Ballentine had to surgically elevate and section the tooth carefully to be sure it was completely out, which he then had to stitch the gums. Celebrity Smiles damaged a perfect tooth with a painful abutment which now needs a crown. I paid Celebrity Smiles $2,100.00 for ruining my teeth!  His practice is unethical and cruel. This dentist needs disciplinary action now! His records show an order of probation for a similiar case such as mine. The state of Florida Board of Dentistry show many sanctions and unethical practice. I also want to mention that Dr. Devo also began temporary bridgework the same day the root canal was done.

Dr. Joseph Gaeta is my assigned dentist, however unavailable at the time so I am told to see Dr. Devo who also practices with Dr. Gaeta.  I was told immediatly that I needed a root canal so he began the procedure to relieve the pain I was in.  The canals were infected, so he drained them awhile and placed files to measure them. He then placed a temporary filling and sealed the tooth. We talked about possibly doing a bridge later on.  The next day October 21st I called and came in to the office still in pain. Dr. Gaeta saw me after waiting two hours to speak to him in the dentist chair. I said the tooth still hurts fix it now while its still fresh. He then said I don't want to go in and irritate that again just wait a few days for the inflamation to calm down. I will be out of town this weekend and you can come in next week to see Dr. Devo again. So then I waited for my next available apt. on Monday October 24th. Dr. Devo said wait until the 27th when I can finish the root canal.  When I came in the 27th he finished the root canal.  Then I noticed he began to file both my teeth down right away without even explaining to me what he was doing. His assistant began to make the impressions for a temporary bridge and very quickly made them up and glued it on my newly finished root canal(which turns out that it was done wrong anyway). I was in pain until a post opt check on November 8th, they looked at the xrays of the finished root canal and said it was very well done and it will soon feel better.  It felt so much worse I thought they were intentionally torturing me so I took the matter into my own hands. I contacted another dentist quickly on november 16th for a second opinion. Dr Moitoso took an xray and immediately noticed something wrong.  The canals are about 2mm short of reaching the apex and your infection is propagating fast. He referred me to Endodontist Associates for an apt. the next day on november 17th, and the endodontist on staff there took another xray and discovered that the root canals were not filled enough therefore not reaching the apex causing severe infection and pain. Immediately I went home and called my other dentist who extracted my other two failed root canals by Dr. Geary Yamashita of Coast Dental. Dr. Ballentine had made it clear to me after calling him that he would take care of me right away. So today November 21st. I went to see him for an emergency extraction of the infected failed root canal. The tooth was a difficult extraction that required special tools to elevate the tooth out in sections,and then needed to surgically stitch the opening. The relief was felt right away.

										Here is my opinion of Dr. Julie Holloway.  First of all she never worked on my mouth.  Here is what happened... I was in treatment at the clinic she worked at.  I was sent to her so as to have restorative work done.  Without examining me properly she gave me two treatment options.  I took her advice on which option to proceed with.  I then spent the next year having a great deal of preparatory work done on my mouth in keeping with Dr. Holloway's treatment plan.  I spent $6000.00, endured about 45 trips to the dentist, sometimes all day visits, endured about 150 of those painful shots, and had to drive a total of 4500 miles since my house is 100 miles rountrip from the clinic.  And after all of this, they informed me that they couldn't do the treatment plan they had proposed.  So instead of telling me they had made a mistake and working out the problem, Dr. Holloway, who was in charge of my treatment had everyone involved deceive me.  They made a slick attempt to get me to agree to another treatment plan that was far inferior to the one I had worked toward for over a year.  When I wouldn't agree to this inferior plan, Dr. Holloway dismissed me as a patient.  Now I have to have all of the dental work torn off and start the whole thing over again!!!  I tried to work out the situation without litigation but Dr. Holloway would have nothing to do with it.  So I sued the clinic for malpractice and because Dr. Holloway was the person in charge of my treatment, she was deposed under oath.  She didn't just stretch the truth.  She lied under oath dozens of times!  I think it's disturbing how someone in such a position of responsibility can so flagrantly lie under oath.  Not to mention violating the Hippocratic oath she took when she became a doctor, when she swore not to ""misrepresent"".  It is also noteable that this woman spent her life in Ohio and spent her whole career at Ohio State.  Shortly after the clinic was sued however, she resigned and moved out of state to the University of Iowa.  Did they pressure her to leave?  To sum up, I don't know how good of a dentist this woman is, but I do know that if she ever makes a mistake, she will lie about it; even under oath...  There is no question about that.  If you have another prosthodontist you can go to, I would do it.  Stay away from Dr. Julie Holloway.  She is dishonest and unethical.   									",  Dental Services

										Here is my opinion of Dr. Landry,
First and foremost this guy's dental skills are not even average.  They are sub par at best.  He doesn't seem to care if he inflicts pain while he is working on you.  He is painfully slow and once took over 10 hours to put a crown on my tooth.  I have 4 crowns in my mouth that he put on and they all have to be re done.
Another time I had a huge bubble of puss on the upper part of my mouth.  I told Dr. Landry about it and he said ""Oh that will go away once we put your crown on"".  Well he didn't explore the reason for the bubble of puss and weeks went by and eventually that tooth by the bubble just broke off.  I then had to have a root canal, and then they had to amputate one of the roots of my tooth.  All because this guy ignored my symptoms.
He is not a good dentist.
That is not this guy's worst quality however.  I was his patient at a clinic he worked at and during the course of my treatment the clinic made a terrible mistake.  They put me in a treatment plan that required I have a great deal of preparatory work done on my back teeth before proceeding with additional treatment.  A year and a half of treatment, I spent 6000$, endured 45 total days in the dental chair(about 30 with this guy), had to endure about 150 of those painful shots, and drive a total of 4500 miles for treatment since my house is 100 miles roundtrip from the clinic.  After enduring all of this, the clinic informed me that they couldn't do the original treatment plan I had agreed to and they tried to pass off this inferior treatment plan on me.  I objected and refused to agree to the inferior treatment plan.  I eventually had to sue the clinic.  Dr. Landry was very involved in my treatment and so he was deposed under oath.  Under aoth he didn't just distort the truth.  He blatantly lied dozens of times!
To sum it up, in my opinion this guy is a terrible dentist.  He is dishonest and unethical.  If you need a dentist, look elsewhere.  You'll regret it if you go to him. 									",  Dental Services

										This dentist office charged me fees related to a cleaning which cost me $170.00 , after speaking to other dentists in the area about the fees , I found that I should not have been charged the fees and would not have been charged had I visited their office instead. I tried working with the office manager Cindy about being reimbursed for the fees and I was spoken to very rudely. She constantly raised her voice and talked over me when I tried asking her why the fees were not submitted to the insurance company for review.I was then told that a patient care worksheet had been signed the charges were valid and I would not be reimbursed any of the fees. I then told her I was not happy with that and would need to be referred to her supervisor. She said the problem was not that I have been overcharged it was that I am not in my right mind and even after being insulted by her, and being hung up on by her. I continued to keep the conversation respectful.I explained again I have been informed by other dentists that I should not have been charged those fees that I went over all of the codes and charges with the other dentists and they said I should not have been charged the fees they charged me above and beyond what they submitted to the insurance.Her final response to me was that I do not even have the etiquette to talk to people and her conversation with me was done a long time ago.I hope this post along with the many many other complaints I have come across will help so that others will be aware of the dentists business practices and not have to go through the same treatment I did.Also there  are lists and lists of complaints about coast dental in every state and at least 57 listed for this office on the Better Business Bureau. They currently have a rating of C- and I'm surprised they even got that much.Any suggestions that may be of help to me in recovering the fees I was overcharged would be greatly appreciated. So far talking to them has gotten me nowhere but to be informed that I am not in my right mind and I don't even have the etiquette to talk to people. Being told that by a manager of a health services provider after paying a significant amount of money for their services only to find that you have been overcharged fees which other dentists in the area is completely unacceptable.

										On Saturday, 8/6/11 I had a 3pm appointment to see an oral surgeon to have a wisdom tooth extracted. This was a followup appointment for a procedure I already had an existing contract for. 
I arrived at 2:45pm and signed in on the electronic monitor screen. When I arrived, no one was at the front desk. 5 mins later someone did appear, but they did not approach me and worked on something else behind the counter, completely ignoring me. Finally, about 5 mins after that, someone else appeared and confirmed my appointment. Please note that all the person did was confirm my appointment and then asked me to have a seat. 
At 3:15pm one of the attendants at the counter asked me to come back up to the counter and said there was a problem with the original contract I signed from my original visit a few weeks ago. Elizabeth and another lady at the counter told me that the price for the tooth extraction on the contract needed to be increased because they put down the wrong procedure name for the extraction. On the original contract they put down Partial Bony Extraction and they said they needed to change it to Full Bony Extraction, which would thereby increase the price because the specialist told them to. I told them that that was not the original contract I signed and that they could not just arbitrarily increase the price. When they were discussing with me the reason I had to pay more money, they were very short and curt with me and not at all personable. They then asked me to have a seat and said they would need to talk with a Specialist. 
I sat back down and noticed that another person in the waiting room was on his cell phone complaining about a similar issue--that Western Dental just arbitrarily increased the price on an item on his signed contract and was expecting him to pay the increased price. I also noticed during his cell phone conversation that he said he had already been waiting 2 hours to be seen and was thinking of ""telling them to forget the whole thing and just walk out."" While I was waiting I also noticed that some of the clerks behind the counter were discussing how much they should charge me instead--as if they could just simply change the price of anything on the contract and charge me extra for any of the payments. 
I waited an hour and fifteen minutes in the waiting room until Elizabeth at the counter decided that she was going to ask what was taking so long. Claudia, the supervisor, then came in and told me it was going to be another 30 to 45 minutes before the surgeon could see me. When I asked Claudia why Western Dental did not notify they were running behind schedule and why no phone call was made to me to notify me she simply said, ""Sorry we did not do so."" 
Several minutes later Dr. Collins came back to the counter to speak with me. What surprised me right away was his tone of voice--it had an angry tone to it and was patronizing and became more angry during the course of his conversation with me. I asked Dr. Collins the following questions: 
1. If Western Dental has the right to just arbitrarily change the price on any item on a contract after it is signed, why was I not explicitly told this when I signed the contract? 
2. Why did Western Dental wait to tell me until the day I walked in for the appointment that they were going to increase the price for something on a contract that I had already signed? 
Dr. Collins responded by pointing out the small title at the top of the contract. Dr. Collins told me that the small font title says, ""Patient Estimator Worksheet"". Dr. Collins told me that because the contract is called a Patient Estimator Worksheet all the prices on the sheet are estimates. Dr. Collins told me it was not his problem that I did not ""notice the fine print."" As I attempted to ask him further questions, he interrupted me and then interjected that if I did not like it, I could just leave. I then asked him why he was suddenly changing his voice tone and he rebuffed me and said he wasn't and then turned his back on me and walked out of the room before I could say anything else. 
Elizabeth then asked me if I wanted to have the procedure done or not. I told her I didn't have a choice and needed it done. I then told Elizabeth that I was unhappy with Western Dental's treatment towards me and told her that I was cancelling my follow up appointment (which would have been a follow up appointment for a deep teeth cleaning Western Dental had done previously) and I would not be doing further business with Western Dental. She then printed up a new contract and had me sign it. After I was done signing it, Dr. Collins casually walked back into the room and 
pretended that he had never been angry at all and pretended to act happy towards me as he smiled and asked if everything was fixed up with the new contract. After Dr. Collins left the room, it was then that Elizabeth told me that some part of the equipment in the back room had a failure and that was why everything was running behind schedule that day. 
I was not taken back to begin my procedure until 5pm (my appointment was at 3pm). I waited in the waiting room for 2 hours and 15 minutes. It was not until after my procedure was complete and I returned to the waiting room that the front desk attendants started acting personable towards me. 
Here is where Western Dental failed on 8/6/11 and where I question the company's professional integrity: 
1. If they knew there was an equipment failure, why did they not inform me of this beforehand? 
2. If they knew they were running behind schedule, why did they not inform me earlier in the day? (A phone call to the cell phone they have for me on file would have been a good gesture.) 
3. If they knew they were running behind schedule, why did they wait an hour and fifteen minutes before they decided to tell me that in the waiting room? 
4. Why did they not explicitly tell me that their company arbitrarily can and does change the prices on all items on a contract, regardless of whether the contract has already been signed or not? 
5. Do they consider Dr. Collins's behavior towards me on 8/6/11 to be professional? 
6. Do they consider their business' behavior toward me on 8/6/11 to be professional? 
As a result of the above, Western Dental sent me a letter in September 2011 and claimed to have issued me a $60 credit on my account.  I called in to their corporate office on 10/4/11 to confirm that this credit was added and that I did not owe them any additional money (since I was making my final payment to their company on that day over the phone).  They confirmed this, and confirmed the credit had been added, and said the only additional money owed was by my insurance company.  Two weeks later I began receiving phone calls, about 4 times a day, sometimes as late as 7 or 8 at night, and sometimes within 10 minutes of each other.  The messages they left were just for me to, ""Call WesternDental.""  None of the messages stated what the matter was concerning.
On 10/27/11, I spent my entire lunch hour on my cell phone with Western Dental.  The person I spoke with told me several things that did not make sense:
1. That I only paid about 80 something dollars when I last called the company to make a payment and that because I did not pay the remainder at that time (which was the amount that their company claimed to have credited my account on that day)  I was being assessed a late fee in addition to the 60 dollars the company claimed that I owed (this should have been for the 60 dollars that Western Dental originally told me was applied as credit on my account on the same day I made my last payment).
2. That I was responsible for this remaining amount and the late fee (and the customer service representative told me during the call that she confirmed this with her supervisor).
3.  That any issues with this amount had to actually be taken up with the local office, not the corporate office. 
I told the customer service rep with that none of that made sense and asked to speak with a supervisor.  She then put me on hold for 45 minutes (until I finally was forced to hang up because my lunch hour ended) and nothing was resolved.  At no point did she pick up the phone again after she claimed she was transferring me to her supervisor.  At the very least, she could have picked up the line again and asked me if I wanted to call back at a different time.
 
It is apparent to me that Western Dental, even at the corporate level, likes to lie to its customers.  This is evidenced by the fact that even though they claimed they were applying a credit to my account on the same day that I made my last payment (in order to make my balance on that day a $0 balance and the remaining amount would be paid by my insurance company), they actually decided to lie to me instead and not apply that credit.  
They furthermore felt it was appropriate to assess a late fee to their own negligence and attempt to bill me an additional 20 something dollars for an amount that should have already been credited to my account.  In addition, they love to harass their customersthis is evidenced by the fact that they decided to call me up to 4 times a day (sometimes as late as 7pm or 8pm and sometimes with calls that were within 10 minutes of each other) to attempt to claim this amount of money that I did not owe them.
And on 10/28/11, Western Dental sent me an email reminding me of an appointment they claimed I had made for February.  I had explicitly told the Western Dental clerk back in August that all my appointments with the company should be cancelled, but I guess they decided to ignore me. 
Western Dental sent me a separate email on 10/28/11 stating that the my account was being audited as a result of the email I had sent them. 									",  Dental Services

Don't go see Dr. (if you can call him that) Kirk Kimmerling unless you enjoy pain and being laughed at. I went to Dr. Kimmerling's office to see about having a tooth pulled. This was about 4:00 in the afternoon and the receptionist said there was a good chance he could do it right away, That should have been a clue that although he's been there a lot of years (I believe they said 10) he must not be able to keep many patients. I know he doesn't if he treats them like he did me. He pulled my tooth and decided not to give me any pain medication since I told them I could not have Ibuprofen or Aspirin due to stomach problems. I really wasn't worried about it I really didn't expect a lot of pain but I was wrong. About an hour after I got home it started hurting and swelling and just got worse and worse. I called Dr. kimmerling who told me to come to his office the next day. I did and was taken back to a chair and he came in laughing at me shouting  Well you had a tooth pulled yesterday of course your going to have pain ha ha! I felt stupid and embarrassed in front of several nurses and my mother. I said its swollen and it hurts a lot he looked at it and said it was infected. Then I told him it wasn't funny that it hurt so much I couldn't sleep. He said when I called him I had slurred my words, and I told him I had the gauze in my mouth he had given me. He ask if I wanted something for pain, I said yes and he left the room and did not return, I would not go back to see him if he were the last dentist on earth. His lack of caring or compassion is unprofessional and has certainly lost him mine and my families business, not to mention a neighbor who we were about to refer to him.

 I already paid Dr Moon for my sons braces with my income tax and now I was going to have to pay another doctor for the last four months.  At the time I had just started a new job so my dental benefits hadn't started yet, not for 90 days so I didn't have the money to pay this new dentist. By the time my benefits started and open enrollment to add my son on came around it had already been almost a year since he was last seen.  The new orthodontist told me that he would have to continue wearing his braces for another year and a half to two years and it would cost $2000.00!  He informed me that Dr Moon was not an orthodontist but he was and that's why it was going to cost more. 
The day I found out all of this there were a lot of other patients there for their appointments that were outraged which surprises me that there were no other reports on this.  Dr Moon is still apart of the new office because his name hasn't been removed.  The office is called Westwind Dental Moon Family Dentistry.  I of course did't and don't have the money to hire a lawyer or I would have done something about this when it happened.  Is there anything that can be done?  Can Dr Moon just walk out on his patients just like that without informing them that he was leaving?

Let me first state that Dr Stevens and staff sent me to the emergency room by not reading my chart and caused several other dental problems I didnt have before due to using possibly unsanitary needles and several injections with NO DENTAL work being performed. I clearly stated I have bad reactions to Novocain in my application for services and explained to the dental technician I was allergic and never got completely numb on it. The alternative is readily available and common but he gave me the wrong medicine.  He prescribed the wrong anti-biotic as well.
I paid in advance for several extractions, x-ray, and denture totaling over $1600. Half was in check and half on GE Credit Care card. I was given an impression for denture and told to come back in two hours for the extractions. When I came back and was in the chair with bad allergic reactions and unable to numb he said Go someplace else and left the room. Nothing more.
The lady at the desk informed me my check had already been deposited and I would have to wait for a refund. I immediately called my bank and killed the check because the upper denture was only $500 and said to bill my card for
the amount old which they already had. She didnt have the denture and said it would be ready later, that was on September 7, 2011. I was told over the phone I had to come in person and it is a 200 mile trip one way to talk to them and did so and on another occasion they told me to come and closed the office all day without contacting me to let me know.
We came to an agreement on the phone that I would only pay for the $500 denture about 30 days ago. It was to be delivered to another dentist by mail and it never arrived. I got the bill from GE Care Credit $775! All I got from these people was a trip to the emergency room and over a $1,000 in losses so far in missed work, ER visit, 400 mile round trips to talk, and because of the butchers needles my $700 to $1400 procedure is going to cost $2000 because of infections and he broke some worn teeth forcing the needle creating complicated extractions.
The Denture was only $500 and it never arrived and was promised to be same day. It is Day 35 and it is still a no-show. GE Care Credit is doing an investigation now because I protested charges; they even listed extractions never provided in the $775 bill.  I have been in pain for nearly a month now. I am filing a complaint with the state board of dentistry over the Novocain and wouldnt have if they had been honest and forthcoming in other dealings. To beat it all I cant have the dental problem fixed until I settle with GE Care Credit because my card is frozen until the dispute is resolved. Stay away from this place. It is assembly line dentistry. ",  Dental Services

										I had my first appointment with Smilecare. I was examined and a list of dental procedures and material was formulated with a itemized cost of all procedures and materials. Included in this list was a denture, cost of over $2000.00. All fees were paid prior to completion of work.When I was fitted for the denture it was apparent that this device was not what I had been led to believe it to be. The device spanned across the inside lower teeth. I informed the dentist at this time that this is not going to be practical. She insisted that I try it out. I did...When biting into food the partial teeth dislodged from their sockets causing one to use both index fingers to reinsert them into their sockets with food still in ones mouth. When the denture moved it chewed into my gums causing sores. Not exactly a smooth operation. I told the dentist that the denture was not useable in the form it was designed. She offered no alternative.I asked for a refund at that time. The office manager required that I return the denture which I did at the time he submitted a refund request to the main office in Santa Ana, Ca. This wasover six months ago.. To this date there has been no refund or confirmation from the main office. I have contacted the local office numerous times to no avail. When I contact the main office I am put on hold or referred to the local office...This guys know what they're doing!In summation: This Dental operation is a shade tree operation at best and a total ""ripoff"".

Toms River, New Jersey United States of America ", , ,"Dr. Michael DiPietro, DMD  Coercive and belligerent billing tactics Toms River, New Jersey","
										1) Although I provided my insurance information 2 weeks in advance, the doctor's office had not contacted them before the day of treatment.2) After my treatment, which was only $100.00, the asked for full payment on the spot, and then asked me to sign a promissory note for full payment on my next vist. The promissory note was a ""balance billing"" contract stating that I was fully responsible for anything my insurance did not pay. When I asked if they were ""in plan"" with my insurance, they responded that they did not know.3) I refused to sign and insisted that they contact my insurance while I sat there. After some belligerent push back they finally did. They told me that I was liable for a $25 co-pay and a $50 deductible.  I paid the $75 on the spot with a credit card. I did not sign any promissory notes, which evoked even more belligerence from the staff. When I got home I independently called my insurance, and they said that I had no co-pay or deductible. Hmmmm. 4) As it turns out, the insurance company paid the $100 in full. That meant that the office owed me $75.00 in overcharges. When I called and spoke to the billing clerk, she refused to discuss the issue, and then refused access to the office manager. A month of phone tag did not result in a call back from the office manager. I finally had to contact my credit card company to dispute the charges. 5) That finally got the office manager on the phone with me, who, by the way, had never looked at my account before. In fact, it was only half way through the conversation that she realized that the office actually owed me money and they had disputed my credit-card charge reversal. And this was fifteen minutes into the argument, already. 6) When I asked why I had been refused service, I was told that I was a ""racist"", and that I had cursed at the billing the clerk, who is indeed a black person. Now, that totally amazed me, as I had not expected slander to be part of the billing experience. Apparantly a billing dispute with a black clerk makes me racist? And I had never used foul or racial language in discussing this matter. 7) As far as I can figure, the slander came about when the office manager asked the clerk who she was arguing with on the phone. In retailiation for my complaints, the clerk had lied about the content of our conversation. Having successfully blocked my access to the office manager, no other side of the story was given, or in fact solicited. The office manager should have called me at that point, but instead told the billing clerk to refuse service. 8) At this point, not only do they still owe me $75.00, which they extorted from me, they are now refusing to address the matter because of a bogus racial issue. My head is now reeling from just how dysfunctional this office really is. In speaking with the office manager, I hear the voice of the billing clerk in the background. It turns out that the office manager has me on speaker phone with the billing clerk in attendence. At first this is denied, then affirmed by the office manager. Again, simply amazing. 9) Now I am forced to get my credit card company to do a three way conference call with yet another person in the office, as the billing clerk and office manager are refusing to deal with me. They neither affirm nor deny the fact that they owe me money. They want to know how long they legally have to answer the question. The answer is thirty-days. That ends the conversation and the call. 10) I am still without the $75. The office has not responded officially, in writting, to any of my claims, or to the reversal of charges from my insurance company.  I do not even have an itemized bill of services rendered by the dentist. I do have and EOB from my insurance company stating the made 100% payment in full of their entire bill. 11) Throughout all of this, I was treated like a criminal for asking questions about insurance that seemed perfectly normal and legitimate, and for not accepting unusual and coercive billing practices. As icing on the cake, I was personally slandered. And through all of this, I never owed them a dime. They owed me a refund. 12) Beware. Particularly seniors. If these practices are not illegal in the state of NJ, they certainly should be. ",  Dental Services

										Dr.  Hung Le, Le & Luu Dental Group (Stonelake Dental) has poor service. They charged me about $300.00 for a service and later when I called my insurance, I found out that insurance paid much of the cost and my co-pay was only about $100.00. It was a hassle to get the dental office to correct their mistake. Then another time they wanted to charge me for examination and regular cleaning because they said that insurance doesnt cover it. Again I had to call my insurance and they said that the insurance is paying 100% of the examination. If I had not called the insurance, the dental office would have again over charged me. Then that same day dental office said that I needed deep cleaning. They said that the insurance is paying for the deep cleaning but they are not paying for the other add-on services worth about $300.00 they wanted to sell me. When I said that I will get only the deep cleaning done but I do not wish to get the other $300.00 add-on services they are trying to sell me since insurance doesnt cover the extras, they said that I cant get deep cleaning done at their office. They said that if I wanted the deep cleaning done, I have to pay $300.00 for the add-on extra services but if I choose not to get the add-on extra services, then they wont do the cleaning. I had to switch dentist and my new dentist gladly did the deep cleaning without forcing me to buy the add-on extra services. The new dentist was very understanding and said that the add-on extra services are offered as extra benefits but its not a mandatory requirement for deep cleaning.I very strongly suggest if anyone is looking to go to DDS Hung Le, to seriously consider against going there otherwise, you may have same experience as me. They have high sales pitch to sell you fluoride treatment every time you go in, and will sell you other unnecessary services. If you dont check with your insurance, they will overcharge you for the services even though the insurance pays most, if not all of the services. They are very nice to you if you keep agreeing with them and keep buying their services but the moment to decline their sales pitch, they get rude to you and call you cheap.

										I was new in Paso Robles CA & needed a dentist when my insurance co referred me to Dr. Krill  (he is at 1920 Creston Road #B).  I went in for a consult and met him - that was the ONLY TIME I saw the guy in the +/- 2 years I was a patient, although I went in at least every 6 months.  In the fall of 2009 I chipped a crown and went in, telling them I was unemployed & could not afford a new crown.  I asked if they could just sand down the rough spot that was cutting my tongue. They did that.  I was billed $4 which I thought was them being nice for me being off work and considering I was in & out of the chair in 5 minutes.  In January 2010 I went in for a cleaning and was shocked when they not only billed me $25 for the cleaning but $21 for the crown-sanding they had done in October 2009. When I protested it was clear they did not care - all they said was I had been undercharged in October.  They had no excuse for why I had never been sent a bill. They handed me an appointment card for 6 months in the future but I gave it no thought - I was too preoccupied with how ripped off I felt. I moved for employment, canceled the insurance and turned off the phone # they would have had on my account.Then 6 months later I got a ""missed appointment"" bill for from them for $20.A reasonable dentist office would have realized that if they send an cleaning appointment reminder that gets returned with a forwarding address 200 miles away that the person will not be there for the cleaning.  And if they call someone with an appointment reminder and the person's phone is turned off that person is not getting reminded.  That if they were unemployed on their last visit then maybe they moved.  And if that person has changed insurance companies they probably will change dentists.  And if they got ripped off on their last visit they probably WANT to forget about the dentist in question.So Dr. Krill's office had every reason to know I would not be there for an appointment THEY set up for me 6 months before.  For them to NOT know means they are either (1) stupid, (2) looking for ways to exploit patients, or (3) both stupid & exploitive.When I got the missed appointment bill I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  Dr. Krill's office never responded to me or the BBB.  Then they sent ANOTHER bill - this time with account detail that made me realize that when they spent 5 minutes sanding my crown down in October (that they billed me twice for) they ALSO billed my insurance company $155 - for 5 minutes work!!!!  I forwarded that bill with this whole story to the insurance co and explained how we both got ripped off by Dr Krill's office - and cc'd Dr. Krill.Dr. Krill's office then sent ANOTHER bill telling me they would send me to collections for the $20 missed appointment bill.That's when I got an attorney.The happy ending is they stopped billing me and I will never again have to deal with a dentist who is never there in an office full of people with corrupt business practices.Forwarned is forarmed . . .PS: I knew I needed a crown but was shocked when my new dentist told me just how much dental work I needed - work that Dr. Krill's office had never informed me off.  If the abusive billing of Dr. Krill's office doesn't scare you off from Dr. Krill's office the bad dentistry should.  And I keep talking about ""his office"" because I don't think he is even there anymore, considering I never saw the guy after my initial consult.  Maybe people who don't know what they are doing just rent his name & license.

										I am so happy being a customer of Beaming White's that I feel the whole world should know about them. I have been using their products for over 2 years and their gel really does give the best results I have seen. I have tried many other products, some before theirs and some after I started using them and I cant find anything that works better. If you have ever seen their Futura whitening light you know its really nice looking and feels and looks real solid. So for my money, they do have the best teeth whitening products in the industry. As they told me the first time I talked to them, try their product and compare it with everything else out there and then decide for yourself. 
I have actually visited their headquarters a few times because I live in Portland and I always go there to pick up my product. The first time I went my sales rep gave me a tour of the entire company, including the offices, the production area, the lab and the warehouse. I have even met the chemist twice and he seems to know his stuff. The lab might not be the most high tech, but its a real lab with real lab equipment and they have a few machines to make the gel and  a few to fill the pens and syringes. Every time I have gone in the production area they are filling something in very large quantities and they have barrels full of raw hydrogen peroxide and other chemicals and all kinds things you would expect in a real production or research lab. They definitely make the gel and I think that even though its not at the level of Pfizer, I doubt that anyone else making teeth whitening gel would have a more sophisticated lab. You would probably have to be big pharma to have a lab that was much better. Im comfortable that the product is good and safe and made in a proper fashion so I definitely can vouch for them. 
I also saw an area that I can't remember what they call it but where 2 people were assembling the Futura light. It's really great to watch American companies still manufacturing product in the US, especially in the teeth whitening industry where everyone seems to get all their stuff from China. I urge anyone who is planning to get into the teeth whitening business in a big way to visit the suppliers they are considering buying product from. It's an important decision, and I'm glad I finally came across them because they really add a lot of value besides just having really good products. I wish other companies knew how to give that level of customer service. I don't know how Luis, who I think is the owner, manages to run such a tight ship, but kudos to him. ",  Dental Services

She was extremely rough handling her physically and verbally while I was in the room present.
I asked for referral to a pedodentist who works with kids. They refused. The staff were extremely rude specially the woman called Jocelyn. I changed my general HMO from them to another. They told me she only has 1 cavity on her baby tooth which was a baby root canal and all other teeth were perfect. they refered me to a pedodentist and he said the same thing and he worked on 1 tooth only. 
It is so sad that this office wanted to drill the permanent teeth of a 8 year old which just came out a year ago for money. When I complained the manager ""April"" said they don't do this for money since they work for free and they don't get any money!!! 
I will do everything in my power to stop this for the sake of other innocent patients ... (the sad thing is that the tooth that needed a baby root canal, they wanted to do a normal filling so they would get paid once now and once in few months when she would suffer pain again because they failed to do proper job and get paid again !!!)
Also, I had an appointment with a Orthodentist in the same office. I called and wanted to make sure I don't have to deal with the same staff. They assured me that the staff is separate.

										On February 21, 2011 I went to coast dental to have a new set of dentures made, I was told that it would cost me $1149.00 and it would take 4 weeks. This new dentures took them 5 months with several office visits for try on fitting. I visited the Dr office about 10-14 visit for try-on. On 6/28/2011 I was told to come into the office because the dentures were ready when I got there after waiting 5mont appose to 4 weeks the dentures was to small they were tight in my mouth with no suction at all to hold them in place. I could not even open my mouth talk eat or even drink water with them as soon as I open my mouth they would fall out. The dentist was aware of the problem but he insisted that I take it home and try to put some sea-bond on them to see if it would work over the weekend. I did that but I could not really do anything with it.The dentist try to do some adjustment on the dentures but because of the material that was use to make the dentures u can only remove from it but not add to it so by him trying to adjust it that just made thing worse, he then turn and tell me that there is nothing he can do, so at that point I requested a refund he told me to speak with the front desk so they can request the refund.It has been several weeks now and they are refusing to give me back a full refund saying I have to pay for the lab work. I don't feel I should pay for any lab work when the dentist was told by the lab that there was no way the dentures could be made with the type of material he was requesting which was Val-pas and I was not told about it. I call the lab they agree to work with the dentist to try and fix the dentures but up to this day the dentist still refuse to see me. I do not have the dentures nor do I have my funds back. $1149.00 may not seem like a lot of money but I do not feel like I should be responsible for the lab fee.Coast Dental only wants to give me only $229.00 out of the $1149.00 and refuse to accept that amount I will appreciate very much if i could get some help.

										Hi,
After seeing an ad on Facebook for teeth whitening, I decided to click it to find out more about the offer. I was very cautious due to the low price, almost unbelievable for laser teeth whitening.
I called the number provided, was asked several questions by a very friendly staff member and booked my appointment.
1 week later I went to my appointment. The Dentist office was very clean, nicely decorated. I have to say I am very pleased with the results of my procedure! I have received several compliments on my smile. I really feel better about myself. This is a good deal, and it is legit. These are good people. I have told all my family and friends about them. Not all deals are too good to be true, this deal has really good value!

This is going on my 2nd week.  I have been to another dentist.  There is a caivity visible by xray on my tooth that he refilled and was abscessed.  So I am having the new dentist do the work.

										I was ripped off by Dr. Alan M. Meltzer in Voorhees, New Jersey.08043 he charged me 650.00 for an abatement I never was casted for or considered getting from him. An abatement is a tooth platform that screws into his biomet implant or prosthetic root in the jaw. I made the mistake of getting an Implant from him and paid 1995.00 supposed to be with all inclusive services. I asked him after I was done with my implant and follow up appointments if he does digital scanning for an abatement and crown, or the tooth platform and prosthetic tooth. He said he would have to make up his mind about that, intimating that he could do both. Upon coming up on my last appointment I called and asked his staff if he did the digital scanning they informed me they do the old fashioned casting and wouldn't get digital until next year some time. I cancelled my last appointment and was called back by staff to keep my appointment to get a Torque Test for his lifetime warranty. I said OK because this was a follow up appointment that I was not to be charged for and I was told every implant has a lifetime warranty if you came back once a year to have a checkup by the doctor.I came in for my appt. he did a three minute Torque Test on my Implant asked me if I wanted an old fashioned casting and I told him No I had my teeth scanned and ordered a abatement (tooth platform) and crown (prosthetic tooth) from Dr. Tau in Northeast Philadelphia. He said He hoped Dr. Tau could do it right, as soon as he said that I knew I was in for trouble! He then had two follow up X-rays taken and never read and gave me no results for my Torque Test,a double header! I get to check out where I was told I owed 650.00 for a Torgue Test, a follow up, supposed to be inclued for my 1995.00 which he backed up with a Flow sheet saying a 3minute Torguw Test was 650.00. He had never ever mentioned a torque test to me at any time. What happened to my Warranty I don't know I never received anything in writing and now realized that if he could supersede his verbal policies with a flow sheet, you were surely in trouble. I told him I did not want his warranty which I knew I would never get anyway. I was charged 650.00 for a Torque Test for 3 minutes and he put down he gave me an abatement which was total fraud as he never cast it, made a model of my teeth,never sent it to a lab, and never had an abatement made, which is a custom piece. I guess if he charged me for a Torgue Test it woud have come up no charge as this is follow up for my Implant and an abatement is 650.00 which I got from Dr. Tau and not Alan Meltzer.Dr. Meltzer teachs dentistry and is very donnish and pedantic but he is a plain theft, liar,and grifter if you can go to someone else for your Implant do it as Dr. Meltzer's policies change with every flow sheet he types up and his favorite customer is an unfamiliar one. I wasted a day to be ripped off for his lies and deceit and now have had to file a dispute with my credit card and go through a lot of aggravation I should have never returned for my follow up appt but I didn't know! 									",  Dental Services

I made an appointment.  I got to meet a man named Brian Ferber, who told me that I could get the implant done for $2500.00.  Well according to the television the implant was $499.00.  he also told me that he would make me a deal and throw in a second one for my back molar which would cost me $3200.00.  I declined the second tooth. and said I would have the front one fixed.  I questioned the $499.00 price, of which I never did get an answer, it was just blown off .  ""right there I should of realized that this place was bad news. ""  I scheduled the implant and gave them my credit card for the $2500.00.  I had to go thru several visits.  The first visit was to pull the old tooth out, of which to this day. I have a chip in my other front tooth I believe from the dentist pulling out the tooth. I am now going to go to the first dentist to confirm this, this went fine, except for the normal pain you get from a pulled tooth. Then I was directed to make another appointment to come in , with no explanation as to why, so they made all of these appointments, me I am not a dentist, nor did I ever have an implant. I had no idea why they were making so many appointments.   I had to come back to have my teeth cleaned and to check the healing of the tooth. I went back for that, that appointment went fine also. Now I have to go back for a third visit, of which I go back and this is where it starts to get wierd. I went into this visit not knowing what I was going for, they told me it was bone addition.  I never knew the pain I was about to face. I had to go into a room with two people. One was a Doctor and the other seemed to be a nurse.  Well they numbed a partial part of my mouth but the other part of my mouth was not numb. I was pulled and protted by this nurse like that part of my face was numb, it was not , all the while this girl was singing and dancing in the office while she is suppose to be working on my mouth.  She was pinching my cheeked and the doctor was pulling on the other side of my face.  He was telling me to look one way while she was pulling me another way.  The were continuing to pinch my face. It then pissed me off and I told them lets get this over with.  but of course I might of used some bad words cause this was the most unprofessional visit I ever had in a dentist office.  This was painful, and they cut my upper gum and deep into my tooth and around it to add bone.  This of course I still do not have a tooth in my mouth. and I am still dealing with a missing tooth.  They tell  not wear this appliance they made me to hide it, so it will heal.  I do all things that they tell me to do.  I continue on with the visits, but I made an additional one because I lost the molar and the tooth that they chipped now is starting to bother me.  and now another molar that when they moved the other molar away, is now starting to bother me.  I have to go back because they tell me to use sensadyne.  I do this for a week or two and I go back.  When I go back I mention that the visit I just had with the doctor and nurse who implanted the bone tell me that they do not think my mouth can handle an implant.  But in the beginning I was measured and all for the implant and also had xrays done.   I mention this to another dentist each time I am seeing a new dentist. I have to wait and wait for her to get back to me something like an hour.  when she comes back into the room she tells me that she has to speak to Dr. Ferber because she can not give me any prices and it was looking like a price of a car to fix my mouth.   I have been to dentists all my life and keep my teeth clean and do the normal 6 month cleanings and stuff, but now I am looking a spending a mere price of a car to fix my mouth??? What happened to the 2500.00 I already gave them??   I missed an appointment because my back is bad.  I then make another appointment to go back to speak to Mr. Ferber about what it is exactly going to cost me to keep my teeth.    I do this yesterday. I go to this office visit yesterday, of which the man does not even try to hear me out, I started off telling him about this tooth he storms away and goes to his office manager, I told him I wanted refunded for the implant, because I am told they can not proceed with it and this is why he storms away?  I meet up with this lady and I only get a mere $800.00 back.  They now take off all of these things for this and that leaving me almost nothing. After paying 2500.00 to a dentist. I am appauled at this?  AND I STILL DO NOT HAVE A TOOTH IN THE SPOT!!!   I leave there and this is where I am now , letting people know do not go to Ferber Dental , there advertisements are for $500. but it is now $2500.00 for one tooth, after you get there?   They claim they can do the implant but after several visits they claim they can not do the implant, and I need several things fixed in my mouth, of which the first day be able to do this before you even sit in the chair.  Not make you waste your money on something that your body can not handle.  I do not have money to throw around and I do not think other people have it either at this time.  So buyers beware...............

										In April 2011, I contacted this dentist to inquire if he able to treat me. I required several extractions due to chemotherapy that I had undergone ruining my teeth in addition to some filling that had fallen out during my treatment. I would also need to have partial denture placed and had heard that he was a ""one stop shop"" rather than having to be referred to multiple specialties. I spoke with him directly over the phone and discussed clearly my needs and my insurance coverage which I might add is very good insurance from the State. I had already reviewed my copay per partial which was $365 per partial so I knew what the ball park cost should be. He told me that 4 extractions and the partials could be done along with the fillings in 2 visit and in less than a month from start to finish. He told me ""bring your checkbook it's gonna be expensive"". I then asked him what ""expensive"" was. He replied ""oh about $1000"". This being in the ""ballpark"" of what I had figured, I agreed. 
I arrived at my appointment and he was an hour late. By the time that he got to me, I had to leave to pick up my son from school so he merely peeked in my mouth (his assistant had already taken the xrays and made the impression) and wrote down on a piece of paper the sum of $1600. I told him that I was not required to pay that amount because I had insurance and it was much less than that. He told me then to just write a check for $800 and his insurance lady, who was out sick, would be in the next day and make the necessary insurance adjustments and call me with the total. I quickly wrote the check because I was already late picking my son up and left thinking that the $800 would cover the entire expense once his billing specialist followed up with my insurance company. I did not hear from his office until I called them a week later. I assumed that his insurance employee had been out longer than anticipated but I was getting anxious so I called. At that time, I was told that they would require an additional $1100. I told them absolutely not. They told me that the partials had been ordered and they were not the ones that my insurance company paid for. I told them that they had better order the one's that my insurance company pays for they told me just to wait a little longer and they would try to sort it out with my insurance company. Over the next 2 months, I received 3 nasty letter from Dr. Larrick informing me that he was giving me SUCH a deal that I have neglected my teeth and essentially should be greatful for the price. I had to get my insurance company involved to get him to agree to do the work for what I had already paid. I would never have let him touch me after all of this if he hadn't already cashed my check and the possibility of getting a dime back from him was nil. In addition, in the process of dealing with my insurance company, I found out that he had billed them for a cleaning on my initial visit which never occurred so he defrauded my insurance company as well. It gets worse:3 months after my initial visit, I arrived back to his office to have the extractions. He numbed me with many shots then brought a new bill to me while sitting in the chair numb. The bill asked for an additional $800. Fortunately, I had printed off the explanation of benefits from my insurance company and brought my benefits book. After all was said and done, he still made me pay an addition $373 which according to my insurance company and my booklet, I should not have paid. During the extractions, he brutalized my gums. I had a post crown that had to be extracted so he removed the crown then used his tool to push deep into the remaining natural tooth. He slipped with his tool but I was numb so I did not feel what he did to my gum. The day after this appointment, I looked like a cabbage patch doll with all of the swelling (I was not swollen at all prior to the procedur). It was only days later when I took the partial out of my mouth that I saw what he did: The gum by that tooth that had the crown on it had a gash on the outside of the gum all the way up to my lip. Right now, the good and natural tooth that was next to the extracted tooth now has the roots completely exposed due to his methods. Now, this tooth needs to be extracted as well and my partial added a tooth. He kept saying during the extraction ""oh this crown is making me nervous""....now I know why. The gash on the outside of my gum is about 7mm's in width so cannot be put back together unless surgically and extends upward to where my lip meets my gum. This man should be sued!

It's now going to collections Reading, Pennsylvania","
										The aspen dental office administration needs a major lesson on ethics and proper business practices. The last time I was in (2007), I had to wait 2 hours in the dental chair (after Novocaine was administered and I had shivers shortly after - which was not done anything about till I got up and complained) and was then told that the person who is qualified to do the procedure is not in and that I would have to go to a different dental office. After that nightmare I never returned to this office, again end of 2007. 
Last week, on my visit back to Reading, PA from my current residence in NYC, I noticed a letter under my former step mothers name that was sent from Aspen Dental. It showed a past due balance of 216.60. The bill was sent out 4 years after the procedure and under a different name so it was not forwarded to my new address. 
My initial call to the staff was last week and I was told Megan would call me back within an hour so she can get to the bottom of this since she didn't see why I was getting a bill either. I missed her call - literally by 20 seconds and called right back. Somewhere in those 20 seconds she was at lunch so I had to speak to a VERY rude lady (which I'm assuming works in the front desk) and was told Megan would call me back after lunch - never happened. The next day, I call back and was told Megan was not in and to expect a call first thing on Monday (8/29) morning. Today (8/29) I was told that the bill was from a x-ray and filling back in 2007 and that I have been sent bills in the past few years. Complete lies unless the mailman decided to skip delivering my mail. After speaking to the manager, I was told that the bills were all sent out this year. Again, 4 years later, to an address I no longer lived in (didn't think I'd have to change my address with them because of being a former patient), to a person who I have had no contact with (former step-mother) so the mail wasn't forwarded to my new address and now, magically - it's my fault and it's going to go to collections. While looking for my legal action possibilities, I called back to see if I can get the 25% off your past due balance offer that was listed on my bill (which once again, I didn't get till 6 days ago) and was told that I no longer qualified since it was past my offer date (8/18).
If I hadn't come down to visit my old friends and apt, I would have never gotten this bill and it would have gone to collections. My old roommate didn't recognize the bill since it was under my ex-step mothers name. Resolving this problem via the local Aspen Dental office has been useless and the number listed for the main company complaint center is not working (shocker) and I'm not holding my breath for a response to my email. This is unacceptable and needs to be fixed ASAP. If this goes to the collections agency, I will be forced to take legal action. 
Due to the massive amount of complaints listed here, if anyone is aware of class action cases, please let me know. This is not the first time they have screwed me over so although the amount seems small, there is absolutely no reason to let them get away with such a horrible practice. ",  Dental Services

I called emailed first and never received an email acknowledgement as promised on their ""easy cancel"" webpage so then I called their 1-800-964-4593 number that also does not function properly -- obviously, they design it so that their ""easy cancel"" button is anything but easy. The rep told me that the time had expired for me to cancel my subscription and receive a refund (which is not what they purport on their website/emails). He also refused to allow me to speak to a supervisor, saying that no supervisors were available. I told him that I would be filing reports with the BBB and other consumer reporting agencies as well as social media because in my view they are operating dishonestly and fraudulently.

The company's name is Nutra Foods, Ph. 1 866-9550878 UT.  When I finally got hold of someone at this number I talked to Heather in customer service. She informed me that Alpine White had me listed as an active member. I asked her to cancel my membership and she gave me a confirmation number and said she would also e-mail it to me. I have not received her e-mail yet. She said Nutra Foods could not give me a credit my account, Alpine White would have to do that.     May of 2010 I dealt with Alpine White about this same issue. I had to cancel a membership with them that I never requested. At that time they had charged my credit card account $62.90. When I tallked them they said they would cancel my unwanted membership and I would receive a credit to my account within about 15 days and the woman said I was suppose to send the free sample (free sample with no obligations) back to Alpine White. I did not send the free sample back that I had to pay the shipping on for them to send it to me. That's how they got my credit card number.   They didn't credit my account and my credit card had to dispute the original charge. Now they will be disputing Alpine Whites fraudulent charges again.  I believe this is a scam! I hope this will be finished with this scamming company soon and for the last time.

										Hi, I went to q clinic and post initial free consultation with Dr tapesh I signed up immediately paying a full amount of 1900 on the spot. At time of signing I was told that the cost breakup was 520 for initial examination including x-rays and impressions and cost of 1380 for the treatment. I was unsure about the kind of improvement I would see with invisalign as I have a significant overbite. I was told by the treatment coordinator that I could decide whether to proceed or not after the results from the impressions came back, at which point if I decide not to proceed, I would lose the 520, but would be refunded the remaining amount. This was a risk I was willing to take. I went for the initial examination at which I was told that a past root canal I had, needing to be redone, and invisalign could only proceed once this root canal issue was fixed. I then decided that I did not want to proceed with invialign at all. When I then asked for a refund of the remaining amount, I was told that they could not rfund anything, I.e. I would lose the entire 1900. I am extremely shocked and don't know what to do . Please note that at this point I have not even had my impressions taken and only had one 30 minute appointment where the dentist ( not dr tapesh) conducted an examination and did a couple of x-rays. I am at loss as to what to do and wondering if anyone else has had a similar issue with q clinic and if there is any legal recourse I can take to get my hard earned money back. Q clinic are going back on their word. I had confirmed the point about what happenes if I decide not to proceed multiple times during the free consultation and was assured that I would be refunded the 1900 less the 520, and now they have gone back on their word !!!

										I had gotten two wisdom teeth out by my dentist and had started to feel extreme pain in my jaw
after the 3rd day. I was pretty sure I had gotten dry socket on my lower left jaw. Finally on the 5th day I could no longer wait (I wasn't able to take time off work earlier) and my dentist wasnt open on Sunday. I called a hotline for emergency dentist in Florida and I was referred to Dr. Oswicks office. I called the number and was happy that someone answered the phone. I really thought it was strange that the Dr. Oswick answered his own phone but thought that he must keep a small staff on the weekends.
He told me the initial cost of the visit would be 42 dollars and anything else he did would be
extra. How much extra he could not say. I drove an hour to get to his office and was feeling confident that he could pack the dry socket for me so the throbbing pain would end.
His receptionist was really nice and then told me that my visit would be 199. I was really surprised
at the price and before I could ask why it was so high Dr. Oswick came out of now where and told me to open my mouth. I pointed to the spot where the socket was and he said he needed x-rays. I told him I just got my wisdom teeth extracted and I had a dry socket. He strongly insisted that I get x-rays done and to pay the 199. I was already in tears from the intense pain and eager to get everything over with I unfortunately paid the 199.
Dr. Oswick was very rude. He demanded that I take out all my piercings (I have lip ones with plastic
retainers in) there was no need for me to remove my piercings when my normal dentist doesnt have a problem with it and does x-rays without the removal of them. He talked to me like I was stupid when doing the x-ray. Everything he said was in a derogatory tone.
After the x-ray I was told to fill out my information and he asked if I had insurance. When I replied
no he said of course not rudely and walked away from me. Still, desperate to ease my pain, I filled out the paperwork and waited for him to return. When he did, he pushed me down in the chair and started to examine my mouth. Not once did he ask about my pain level. He only asked who my normal dentist was and what day I had the extractions. He was VERY ROUGH with my mouth. He spent more time looking at my other teeth than at the dry socket. He then handed me a mirror and proceeded to lecture me about how bad my teeth were. He made me look at every little thing
he deemed to be wrong with them. Dr. Oswick stressed that a lot of work needed to be done. If I had such impending bad teeth that needed immediate attention Im sure my own dentist whom Ive been seeing for years would have mentioned it to me.
He then told me that he didnt think it was a dry socket (he barely looked at it). He told me that
I had tons of bacteria in the hole and judging by the rest of my mouth he was not surprised. By this point I was shaking so hard from anger. He humiliated me. He spoke down to me in every way possible.  As if it couldnt get any worse he handed me this lamented sheet with pictures of people with oral cancer and started his lectured all over again, telling me to take note, that if I didnt get my teeth taken care of I would get oral cancer. Im 26, not a child. My teeth are not bad. Even without insurance I still go regularly to my dentist.
I felt like he was trying to sell me his service. I was in even more pain when I left because of
his rough handling and treatment, I broke down in the hallway as soon as I got out of his office. I will report him to the BBB. I want to try to get my money back but judging from other reviews this would probably be impossible. I went to my normal dentist as soon as he opened and he was angry that I was treated in such a way. I HAD dry socket and he packed my mouth for me. It took him less
than 2 minutes to assess the situation and pack the socket. I find it hard to believe that Dr. Oswick, who has been in business for years, would fail to tell the difference between an infection and dry socket.

Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, Select State/Province United Kingdom ",www.leamingtonspaorthodontics.com, 01926 883476,"Richard Cure & Leamington Spa Orthodontics  DO NOT use LSO, Richard Cure is incompetent and unfit to practise due to his lack of orthodontic ability and is in breach of the law: the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, United kingdom","
										I first became a patient of Leamington Spa Orthodontics in 2005 when they took dental impressions, made bleaching trays and sold me some bleach of varying strengths. I have also used their dental hygienist and since having clear (ceramic) braces fitted in America, gone there for emergency treatment, eg loose brackets and broken wires.
 
I was diagnosed with MS in 1997 and since 2006 have had a mobility problem in my right leg which doesn't lift or bend when I try to walk. I also have a dropped right foot which makes it very difficult to lift the leg + loss of balance and strength in my legs. This problem has got worse over the last 5 years and it means I can''t walk alone. I also have to use a wheelchair to go distances.
 
In January of this year I called Leamington Spa Orthodontics and asked them if they would give me a quote to remove my braces as my treatment was now finished and it would save me a difficult trip back to Boston USA. I talked to their receptionist Loretta who informed me that the owner, Richard Cure, was no longer prepared to offer me any further treatment, either orthodontic or with their dental hygienist, because of my disability. I asked her if she would just ask him about the removal of the braces, but she said there was no point because she already knew the answer - he had made his position clear after my last visit and instructed his office not to allow me to book any further appointments. Her reason was because I ""struggled with the stairs"". She told me that I could attend for treatment again ""if my leg got better"".
 
Richard Cure & LSO are in violation of the law - they are in breach of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995: PART III Discrimination in Other Areas re goods, facilities and services, points 19 & 21 which states that businesses are not allowed to discriminate in relation to provision of their goods, facilities & services and that providers of services have a duty to make adjustments. Leamington Spa Orthodontics have wheelchair access at the back and a downstairs room which they refuse to let me use. Regardless of this, I was prepared - and able albeit with a struggle - to enter via the usual entrance that has an outside step and use their upstairs treatment rooms. I am able to do this with their help, which they have now refused.
 
Richard Cure has tried to defend his decision to refuse me further treatment on the basis that he feels that I never required orthodontic work in the first place. However, neither my request to have the braces removed, nor to make an appointment with LSO's dental hygienist have anything whatsoever to do with Richard Cure's opinion with regard to my need for orthodontic treatment. He is clearly evading the real issue and in fact, one would assume that if he was so opposed to me being fitted with braces, that he would be only too happy to remove them!
In a letter dated 4th February 2011 Richard Cure stated that he was not familiar with my orthodontic appliance and tried to use this as another excuse. However, the evidence from the UK distributor of the GAC Mystique brackets used clearly proves that this is a lie. Moreover, removal of the braces does actually not require any knowledge of or familiarity with the particular make of brackets. There is one tool/appliance for the removal of metal brackets and one for the removal of ceramic brackets, and every orthodontist including Richard Cure carries and can do both. The type of brackets is therefore completely irrelevant.
 
In addition, their ongoing refusal to make me another appointment with their dental hygienist says it all.
 
Furthermore, whenever I made an appointment with the dental hygienist and/or for emergency orthodontic treatment I requested but was repeatedly refused the use of the downstairs room. LSO protest that this room is available to patients with a mobility problem, but I was always told that it was rented out to another company and that the tools/machinery needed could not be transferred from the upstairs rooms. I therefore had no option but to struggle with the stairs which got harder as my mobility problem got worse + they often made me struggle up 2 flights of stairs right up to the top of the building, even though there are treatment rooms on a lower level than this. I also had to use the women's toilet upstairs. I could not go to another dental hygienist elsewhere as I needed one that used a technique that was compatible with braces and wouldn't dislodge them, ie manual v. electric + going elsewhere would require me to go through an expensive registration process with another dentist.
 
When I registered with LSO in 2005 I did not declare the MS diagnosis. My mobility was not an issue and I therefore felt that the diagnosis was irrelevant to the care of my teeth + I also felt that disclosing it was an unnecessary invasion of privacy. I was never asked about my medical history again on subsequent visits + by 2006 the diagnosis was in question and other causes had been suggested such as a slipped disc, heavy metal toxicity and spinal/vertebral misalignments from a bad car accident I had in December 2005.
 
Mr Cure is not only unfit to practise due to his discriminatory attitude towards me which breaches the law, specifically the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, but he is also a totally incompetent orthodontist. When I first presented to LSO in 2005 my 2 top front teeth were very big; they were also too low as were the teeth either side of them + one of these teeth was much higher than the other, ie they were all out of proportion to each other and I had a very gummy smile. In addition, my 2 top canines were way too high + my bottom teeth were overcrowded, causing some of these to have twisted considerably. My bite was so wrong that my top R/H front tooth was becoming transparent at the bottom and had lost 2 layers of its enamel!
 
I desired an aesthetic improvement in that I wanted my 2 top front teeth made smaller + the 4 top front ones pushed up and the 2 top canines pulled down so that the teeth were proportionately sized, straight and even, and I no longer had a gummy smile. I also wanted my lower teeth to have the curve they used to (I understand that as you get older, your jaw contracts which often causes the lower teeth to crowd.) Richard Cure denied that this would ever be possible. However, IN ACTUAL FACT, NOT ONLY DID I GET THE AESTHETIC RESULT I DESIRED AND A HUGE COSMETIC IMPROVEMENT, BUT IT WAS A NECESSARY & INTEGRAL PART OF THE ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT! In order to achieve the correct orthodontic result and make room for the required changes, my 2 top front teeth were slenderised and the ones next to them evened up both size and position wise. The 2 top canines were pulled down and the bottom 4 front teeth were also slenderised to make room so that the overcrowding could be rectified without the need to extract a tooth which would have been considerably more drastic. As I understand it, orthodontics is all about the smile line and the position of the teeth in relation to the lips, ie the edges of each should touch when you smile without gum showing; this is certainly what Arch Orthodontics who treated me in Boston maintain and provided. It is also about rectifying overcrowding such as I had. Cosmetic and aesthetic improvements are an integral part of this as when the teeth are improved orthodontically, they also look better as a result. In addition, my bite is now perfect, preventing further uneven wear and tear to the teeth.
 
Last year I had to go to Portland Oregon for 3 months for treatment for my mobility problem that was unavailable in the UK and I attended North Portland Orthodontics there for intermediate orthodontic treatment to save me flying back and forth to Boston. AO forwarded them copies of all my dental records and Dr Jennifer Crowe, who treated me there, confirms the huge improvement that orthodontic treatment made to my teeth. I quote from one of her recent e-mails to me dated 19th July.... ""I think the outcome is positive and your orthodontists have greatly improved your bite and the appearance of your teeth.""
 
Richard Cure's constant assertion throughout his submission that orthodontic treatment was not only unnecessary in my case, but could potentially make my teeth worse, is total incompetence and nothing less than insanity. There is not a single person, orthodontically trained or otherwise, who would or could deny the huge improvement that orthodontic treatment has made to my teeth. Interestingly enough, LSO is the only orthodontist who has ever said that orthodontic treatment was unnecessary. In actual fact, I originally planned to have veneers, but was informed by 2 dentists in Coventry in 2005 that orthodontic treatment was a far better option for my teeth and could improve them immensely.
 
Richard Cure is therefore unfit to practise due to his lack of orthodontic ability, as well as his discrimination against me and refusal to provide emergency treatment (removal of the brackets) and dental hygienist services to me on the basis of my disability. DO NOT USE THIS ORTHODONTIST!

Richard Cure suddenly withdrew the emergency orthodontic treatment and dental hygienist services he had offered me, and the reason I was given for this by his receptionist Loretta was that it was because of my disability which ""had been mentioned and was an issue"". I was told that he wanted nothing further to do with me or my case because of it.
 
Removal of the braces was a half hour emergency orthodontic procedure no different to the one he had already provided when he replaced broken wires and brackets in February 2009. He lied about not being familiar with the brackets used (obviously an excuse) and clearly has had experience of removing these before, although as already stated, the make of brackets is irrelevant to the ability to remove them.
 
If he is so adamant about the lack of need for orthodontic treatment in my case and his disapproval of it, then why did he offer me emergency treatment in the first place - and then why suddenly change his mind and refuse it?
 
He continues to refuse me dental hygienist services and the use of the downstairs room.
 
In addition, his constant and emphatic assertion that orthodontic treatment was not only unnecessary in my case but could even make matters worse, + his statement that I could not get the aesthetic result I desired was not only contrary to what he told me in 2005 before the onset of my mobility problem, but is another lie + total incompetence and utter insanity on his part. The before and after photos of my teeth speak for themselves, as does Dr Crowe's comment.

Leamington Spa, Select State/Province United States of America ",www.leamingtonspaorthodontics.com, 01926 883476,"Richard Cure & Leamington Spa Orthodontics  DO NOT use LSO, Richard Cure is incompetent and unfit to practise due to his lack of orthodontic ability and is in breach of the law: the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 Leamington Spa, Internet","
										I first became a patient of Leamington Spa Orthodontics in 2005 when they took dental impressions, made bleaching trays and sold me some bleach of varying strengths. I have also used their dental hygienist and since having clear (ceramic) braces fitted in America, gone there for emergency treatment, eg loose brackets and broken wires. I was diagnosed with MS in 1997 and since 2006 have had a mobility problem in my right leg which doesn't lift or bend when I try to walk. I also have a dropped right foot which makes it very difficult to lift the leg + loss of balance and strength in my legs. This problem has got worse over the last 5 years and it means I can''t walk alone. I also have to use a wheelchair to go distances. In January of this year I called Leamington Spa Orthodontics and asked them if they would give me a quote to remove my braces as my treatment was now finished and it would save me a difficult trip back to Boston USA. I talked to their receptionist Loretta who informed me that the owner, Richard Cure, was no longer prepared to offer me any further treatment, either orthodontic or with their dental hygienist, because of my disability. I asked her if she would just ask him about the removal of the braces, but she said there was no point because she already knew the answer - he had made his position clear after my last visit and instructed his office not to allow me to book any further appointments. Her reason was because I ""struggled with the stairs"". She told me that I could attend for treatment again ""if my leg got better"". Richard Cure & LSO are in violation of the law - they are in breach of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995: PART III Discrimination in Other Areas re goods, facilities and services, points 19 & 21 which states that businesses are not allowed to discriminate in relation to provision of their goods, facilities & services and that providers of services have a duty to make adjustments. Leamington Spa Orthodontics have wheelchair access at the back and a downstairs room which they refuse to let me use. Regardless of this, I was prepared - and able albeit with a struggle - to enter via the usual entrance that has an outside step and use their upstairs treatment rooms. I am able to do this with their help, which they have now refused. Richard Cure has tried to defend his decision to refuse me further treatment on the basis that he feels that I never required orthodontic treatment in the first place. However, neither my request to have the braces removed, nor to make an appointment with LSO's dental hygienist have anything whatsoever to do with Richard Cure's opinion with regard to my need for orthodontic treatment. He is clearly evading the real issue and in fact, one would assume that if he was so opposed to me being fitted with braces, that he would be only too happy to remove them!In a letter dated 4th February 2011 Richard Cure stated that he was not familiar with my orthodontic appliance and tried to use this as another excuse. However, the evidence from the UK distributor of the GAC Mystique brackets used clearly proves that this is a lie. Moreover, removal of the braces does actually not require any knowledge of or familiarity with the particular make of brackets. There is one tool/appliance for the removal of metal brackets and one for the removal of ceramic brackets, and every orthodontist including Richard Cure carries and can do both. The type of brackets is therefore completely irrelevant. In addition, their ongoing refusal to make me another appointment with their dental hygienist says it all. Furthermore, whenever I made an appointment with the dental hygienist and/or for emergency orthodontic treatment I requested but was repeatedly refused the use of the downstairs room. LSO protest that this room is available to patients with a mobility problem, but I was always told that it was rented out to another company and that the tools/machinery needed could not be transferred from the upstairs rooms. I therefore had no option but to struggle with the stairs which got harder as my mobility problem got worse + they often made me struggle up 2 flights of stairs right up to the top of the building, even though there are treatment rooms on a lower level than this. I also had to use the women's toilet upstairs. I could not go to another dental hygienist elsewhere as I needed one that used a technique that was compatible with braces and wouldn't dislodge them, ie manual v. electric + going elsewhere would require me to go through an expensive registration process with another dentist. When I registered with LSO in 2005 I did not declare the MS diagnosis. My mobility was not an issue and I therefore felt that the diagnosis was irrelevant to the care of my teeth + I also felt that disclosing it was an unnecessary invasion of privacy. I was never asked about my medical history again on subsequent visits + by 2006 the diagnosis was in question and other causes had been suggested such as a slipped disc, heavy metal toxicity and spinal/vertebral misalignments from a bad car accident I had in December 2005. Mr Cure is not only unfit to practise due to his discriminatory attitude towards me which breaches the law, specifically the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, but he is also a totally incompetent orthodontist. When I first presented to LSO in 2005 my 2 top front teeth were very big; they were also too low as were the teeth either side of them + one of these teeth was much higher than the other, ie they were all out of proportion to each other and I had a very gummy smile. In addition, my 2 top canines were way too high + my bottom teeth were overcrowded, causing some of these to have twisted considerably. My bite was so wrong that my top R/H front tooth was becoming transparent at the bottom and had lost 2 layers of its enamel! I desired an aesthetic improvement in that I wanted my 2 top front teeth made smaller + the 4 top front ones pushed up and the 2 top canines pulled down so that the teeth were proportionately sized, straight and even, and I no longer had a gummy smile. I also wanted my lower teeth to have the curve they used to (I understand that as you get older, your jaw contracts which often causes the lower teeth to crowd.) Richard Cure denied that this would ever be possible. However, IN ACTUAL FACT, NOT ONLY DID I GET THE AESTHETIC REQUIREMENT I DESIRED AND A HUGE COSMETIC IMPROVEMENT, BUT IT WAS A NECESSARY & INTEGRAL PART OF THE ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT! In order to achieve the correct orthodontic result and make room for the required changes, my 2 top front teeth were slenderised and the ones next to them evened up both size and position wise. The 2 top canines were pulled down and the bottom 4 front teeth were also slenderised to make room so that the overcrowding could be rectified without the need to extract a tooth which would have been considerably more drastic. As I understand it, orthodontics is all about the smile line and the position of the teeth in relation to the lips, ie the edges of each should touch when you smile without gum showing; this is certainly what Arch Orthodontics who treated me in Boston maintain and provided. It is also about rectifying overcrowding such as I had. Cosmetic and aesthetic improvements are an integral part of this as when the teeth are improved orthodontically, they also look better as a result. In addition, my bite is now perfect, preventing further uneven wear and tear to the teeth. Last year I had to go to Portland Oregon for 3 months for treatment for my mobility problem that was unavailable in the UK and I attended North Portland Orthodontics there for intermediate orthodontic treatment to save me flying back and forth to Boston. AO forwarded them copies of all my dental records and Dr Jennifer Crowe, who treated me there, confirms the huge improvement that orthodontic treatment made to my teeth. I quote from one of her recent e-mails to me dated 19th July.... ""I think the outcome is positive and your orthodontists have greatly improved your bite and the appearance of your teeth."" Richard Cure's constant assertion throughout his submission that orthodontic treatment was not only unnecessary in my case, but could potentially make my teeth worse, is total incompetence and nothing less than insanity. There is not a single person, orthodontically trained or otherwise, who would or could deny the huge improvement that orthodontic treatment has made to my teeth. Interestingly enough, LSO is the only orthodontist who has ever said that orthodontic treatment was unnecessary. In actual fact, I originally planned to have veneers, but was informed by 2 dentists in Coventry in 2005 that orthodontic treatment was a far better option for my teeth and could improve them immensely. Richard Cure is therefore unfit to practise due to his lack of orthodontic ability, as well as his discrimination against me and refusal to provide emergency treatment (removal of the brackets) and dental hygienist services to me on the basis of my disability. DO NOT USE THIS ORTHODONTIST! TO SUM UP: Richard Cure suddenly withdrew the emergency orthodontic treatment and dental hygienist services he had offered me, and the reason I was given for this by his receptionist Loretta was that it was because of my disability which ""had been mentioned and was an issue"".

										Staff at rocking your smile is very inconsiderate, rude and all they care about is money. I was very surprised to see few good reviews about this place on google.com but quickly realized that they were all fake reviews written by same person, prob the doctor himself. 
I was being told different things by the assistants and the doctor. After my exam, they tried to sell me on services that I didnt need. Dr Brad Jennings, without explaining anything to me kept recommending different procedures worth thousands. I was skeptical after my first appointment so I contacted my old dentist back in California who recommended that I talk to another doctor so I scheduled an appointment with another clinic. After talking to that doctor I quickly realized that everything Dr Brad Jennings was recommending was just a way for him to make thousands off of me and I did not need any of the recommended procedures done. 
When I contacted their office about it the assistant on the phone was very rude and told me that if you cant afford our services you shouldnt have come to our clinic.

										After thinking that this great deal was only for $1.95 for the vitality smile teeth whitening tray and $3.95 for teeth whitening pens from lucky brite. I decided to return due to burning sensation in gums. I called both companies a few days later. It turned out that the same operator answered both times and she worked for both companies. Apparently this is the same company, operating under both names. I urged her to please cancel any additional shipments. That is when she informed me that I had to ship the product back to the company, otherwise I would be charged an amount over $119.00.  I informed her that it did not make sense due to me having used some of the product, but that I would do so anyway. I marked the box return to sender. After two weeks, I received the box with a label claiming that I was to pay for the additional shipping. I knew that by this time, i had surpassed the amount of days to return, but assumed that since the company had returned my product, that some notations had been made to their system. I went to UPS got a tracking number and still I have received no credit. It has been over a month and I called the company. I spoke to an employee and a manager who both were very ugly stating that if I could not follow the directions of ther terms and conditions, that is why they were keeping my money. They stated that I had the burden of proof of showing I had sent the package back. However they had not received my box. I told them that was convenient. How did I know that they did not just throw my box away in the warehouse. This manager responded by saying well how convenient that you do not have the tracking number on hand. I stated I would look for it, and that I had no convenience out of paying for something that I did not benefit from. Eventually the manager was so rude, and knowing that I would get nowhere with this,  I hung up the phone.  I have e-mailed them my tracking number with a plea for some type of credit and hope to get a response. However, they really stuck to their guns about the 30 days. They make is so complicated to return the product and in such a timely manner that it is merely impossible to get your money back, especially since they don't track product that comes into their office/warehouse.

Johnson and his staff requested all necessary approval from my insurance Principal Life Insurance Co phone 1-800-247-4695 and told me that everything it is covered and I DO NOT NEED to pay anything out of my pocket.. They made the necessary arrangements for the surgery and they send me on my way.. On the date of 05/12/2011 early morning they performed the surgery, and after that assure me that after the surgery they scheduled me for a free out of pocket a week later visit in order to inspect the surgery.. However, this surgeon office staff lied me and mislead me in order to get me through the surgery procedure, charge my insurance company and bill me later or scam me after.. They mentioned zero out of pocket before the procedure and after that they pretend $ 531.00 which represent a balance after whole charges.. So, they change their mind and told me that my dental insurance company didnt pay for the anesthesia.. How in the world someone can have removed this 4 wisdom tooth without anesthesia..?? Lets say that my dental insurance company didnt want to pay for, and that become a different litigation anyway since Im NOT going to let it go and pay this balance, but in the mean time Dr Brendan G Johnson staff Mike from his billing department told me over the phone, conversation occurred on 06/13/2011  quote : We DONT TELL patients that the insurance company usually does not want to pay for anesthesia before any surgery procedure because the patients in this bad economy will never pay for and do not want to have any procedure anymore.. Unquote.. WOW!!!  How in the world one business lied or hide all this details in order to get the patient through their doors and charge the patient insurance for their scam behavior in order to get more clients or patients and after that they threaten me with Collection Agency in order to get the difference.. IF I KNEW of this scam and mislead intention, THEN I would never ever like to get in that office for any surgical procedure.. I told them over the phone that they SHOULD have told me in the beginning, or upfront, since they admitted over the phone that they have this issue in the past, and make me aware of some charges that might be necessary to pay after the procedure.. Instead, they lie me that my insurance approved whole balance required for this surgery and I dont have to pay anything in order to get me in this trap.. Now they threaten me with collection IF I refuse to pay the difference of $ 531.00 which represents the remaining balance.. I do consider this tactic a misled, lie, scam and unfair practices.. They should have informed me immediately of this issue and at that point I would of pick the right option, or be aware of some balance.. They added on my bill 2 different anesthesia, as follow : one for $ 325.00 for 30 minutes, and the second for other 15 minutes which cost $ 220.00.. They put me to sleep, and how do I know that there was necessary the second anesthesia or NOT.. It was added anyway just to scam me or my insurance company, but since my dental plan didnt pay for, then they decided to send me a bill with $ 531.00.. They also told me that I sign and agree for any remaining balance, which in the end IT WAS NEVER EVER EXPLAINED TO ME THE REAL MEANING OF THEIR REAL INTENTION.. I will address whole this issue to the Nevada State Board of Dental Examiners, Nevada Federal Trade Commission, General Attorney of Nevada, Consumer Protection Agency, B.B.B. and RipOff.com..

We both declined to accept these charges as our insurance company was paying for the visit, which was only to be a cleaning.
After a visit from the hygienist and then the dentist my wife was presented with a list of dental services which she was told were absolutely necessary for her health. The total was for $2853.30. The next surprise was when I was presented with a list of things that they said needed to be done which totaled $5847.95. And we only went in for a cleaning which, by the way, we never got because they needed to do some of this work first. 
This outfit is the most outrageous bunch of gangsters since Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

										6 Day Dental and Orthodontics is the worst place to get your braces done and even for a mere cleaning. The employees are rude and the company is only driven by money. They do not care about their customers only about the money they want to get from you. SO BEWARE! Make sure you visit other places and let 6 Day be your last resort so you do not end up regretting like i am right now. 
Ever since i started my treatment, I have been unhappy with this company. They drag their feet, they do not give you information about your treatment; they stare rudely at you when you come in for your appointment, when you ask a question, no one ever has an answer except you are giving them your credit/ debit card to swipe. At that point they will have a big smile on their faces and gladly tell you were to sign. 
DAWN, the supposed manager who I have spoken to at the Coppell and Flower Mound branches is the worst of all her employees. I asked her for the record of my treatment and she said "" I will have it for you in 10 days only at the Coppell branch and I will not stress myself to get it available for you before then and even though, there is no assurance that your records will be available after 10 days. You have to call me to find out if it is available"" - Her exact words. I paid for the services but she can not stress herself to provide me with my records. Interesting! 
Corrine another employee at 6 day who i spoke to at the Flower Mound branch, could not answer my question instead she said "" I will have my manager call you back"" and before I could respond, she hung up on me. There have been more instances of rudeness and greed shown by this company than I can put down on paper. If i finally get around to putting it on paper, I would be the best selling author for the Book titled "" 6 DAY DENTAL AND ORTHODONTICS - THE GREEDIEST & RUDEST DENTAL AND ORTHODONTIC PRACTICE IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. CUSTOMERS BEWARE! They never want to bill your insurance company but rather bill you first and then bill your insurance and reimburse you months months later. A tale thievery. 
They are never upfront with you about costs until a day before your appointment or on the day of your appointment so that you do not have enough time to change your mind. Again, I stress beware of this company. So many mistakes were made during my treatment, the doctor leaves the placement of the wires and power chain in the hands of the assistants, which is fine BUT he never ever checks to ensure they placed them correctly. When I return a month later for my appointment, I am usually told at that point that the assistants made an error and yet the Doctor is still too lazy to check that everything is fine before I leave. *Shaking my head* What a company!

										I went to Dental Dreams today with my girlfriend and her son and decided to have a tooth looked at that has been bothering me. I informed the lady at check in that I was self employed and had to pay cash so she said they give a 40% discount for cash customers.
    The service she offered me was for 63.00 I would get a basic exam wich included x-rays and the doctor doing a check up and for 85.00 I would get x-rays a cleaning and a polish as well as a exam. Well I went with the 85.00 exam and had to pay before services were rendered.  They took all 3 of us into the same room. The lady took x-rays for all three of us in a row and never changed her gloves. Then she used the same oral equipment on my 5 year old step son as she did me without changing the heads. I was last and when the Dentist looked at my x-rays he said my pain was related to a cavity that was down to the nerve causing the discomfort and it either needed extracted for an additional 111.00 or a root canal for about 600.00 and was finished. When I said what about my polish and cleaning he said that wasnt included and I said yes it was. The Dentist went and got the office manager by the name of Amy Caldwell and she told me that I was wrong and the receptionist didnt tell me that wich is a lie and I have a witness to the fact. I told her that I expected to have some of my money refunded and she said we will only charge you for the x-rays and that bill totaled 75.60 wich made no sence. She never gave me the difference and my bill shows 75.60 paid but when I finally got thru to the main office it showed my bill was 85.00 and was paid in full never showing the 75.80.The assistant in the room with us was upset with the company and told me to go to Lancaster to a Dentist that does work pro bono and will help me and told me to call the main office because of how I was treated. I made several attempts to find out who the regional manager was and finally found out who he was but nobody would give me his number so I called the main office in Chicago and got no response.

										I found this dentist on 12/17/11 and as of 1/17/11 I have terminated my relationship as her Patient.  It begins with my visit in January 2011.  While te dentist thought I was out on the gas - she jumped her assistant telling her to ""just look at this, there is drule and I'm sitting here and I do have the right of way with the drill, do you hear me?""  I think if you are having issues with your assistant you should put the suction in before you start & keep it in & take this up when the patient is not in the office.  Stress now days on all of us should not also be passed along by my medical provider when I am paying them to work & not talk.  I called the office re: a tooth that partially broke off and the office staff 1) asked me if it was hurting & if not no need to come in 2) that they would re-verify this with the Dr & call me back.  I waited a couple of days & called them back and same thing, they would get w/ the Dr & call me back.  Again I waited a couple of days & called back & same thing.  I gave up at this point.  Another day I called re: a crown they put on came out & we started the same routine of if it doesn't hurt (w/ a rod in it sticking up in my mouth) then there is no need to come in.  We will set up an appointment down the road.  I asked them what i owed them in April 2011 at this point & was told ""OH! your account is in a major audit and we will have to get back with you.""  Now you want to call me don't you?????????  So, I find another dentist who I LOVE and he fixes their mess.  Yesterday I get my final bill from them.  (which is over $350 cheaper than what they told me I would owe them back in April - since I called my insurance company & got them involved with what I would owe them after the claims have been filed / paid.  I am mailing them their final check with a letter to let the Dr know that her staff & her attitude with me in the chair is unacceptable.  They only work a few days a week and on Fridays you can forget getting someone to work on an emergency situation.  They really don't seem to care if you EVER come back to them.  They will quote work that needs to be done on more teeth than you have in your head.  Every dentists work you have ever had done is no good any more.  It all needs to be done with their work.  Well, within 1 1/2 months your Porcelin crown fell out & I'm real lucky I didn't swallow it or break it in the middle of eating a meal.  Also, I had to pay the other dentist to put it back in since there is NO WAY I would want you to work on my mouth again.  This dentist wants you to go to her College cronies for surgery.  It seems she has just made a mess.  Her staff is very low educated in just speaking to you.  Their sales pitch to sell you everything under the sun is not working.  I would not recommend this Dentist or Office Staff to any one.

										I had my braces originally handled by another doctor before
Dr. Lamboy took over.  During the time he
treated me, most everything was fairly satisfactory, however, at the end of the
treatment there were some horrible issues.
 
Dr. Lamboy placed a shunt on one of my teeth causing it to
die toward the end of the treatment, and did not remove the dental cement on
the teeth and under the gumline when time came to remove the braces. I was,
however, unaware of this and only later found out through another dentist after
the dental cement began to cause infections from trapped food particles. 
 
Attempts to seek recompense for the dental cement removal
and my dead tooth but discussions with Dr. Lamboy were not at all amicable,
even though I was simply attempted to get a relatively small amount to cover my
out of pocket expenses and complete the repair of these issues. 
 
After a few attempts of trying to negotiate with him, he
refused to talk to me, and instead arranged for what I thought was a legal
arbitrator to handle the case. I later found out after consulting with an
attorney that this company had no legal powers and wanted me to sign documents
which would have ended any chance of resolving this matter in court, leaving
the decision of compensation up to them(which obviously would not be in my
favor). Thankfully I did not sign them.
 
For some reason Dr. Lamboy is no longer practicing dentistry
in my area, having left the state. It would not surprise me if he caused
similar issues with other patients and subsequently had to leave because of
reputation, because the dentists who took over his practice are doing very well
in the area. Not being here has caused problems for court proceedings, but
luckily my attorney is very good and has arranged to subpoena him soon. 
Hopefully I can get some type of recompense soon for all the
issues this guy has caused me.									",  Dental Services

										Dr Robert Schoenberg is proving to display a repeated trend of dishonesty and bullying in his follow up to doing business. I eneterd into a sale transaction with him and ever since doing so, he has madee every effort to extort money from me. He relies on twisting an interpretation or understanding as the tool to manipulating and blackmailing to get ""after-sales"" financial benefits. He cannot be trusted and anyone doing business with him should be very careful in choosing to do so. I wish I could reverse my transaction with him and even though I have tried he has refused every offer to do so but instead seems to want to continue making claims against me with the hope that I will settle something to make him ""go away"". He wants his cake and to eat it too! I think he is frightful to deal with. He operates as a dentist out of Brewster New York and after having carried out some research on him and his practice, it appears his ""strange ways"" also exist within his medical world. This man can not be trusted and I simply recommend anyone entering into any transaction with him to think twice about doing so.									",  Dental Services

										This was an offer for a free teeth whitening system. It cost $1.95 for shipping and handling. Two weeks after my order I was charged $99 and $78 from these two companies. When I called them I was told that there was trial terms printed on the website under another tab (hidden from plain view). These terms stated that you had 14 days to notify them if you didn't want the full purchase price (a monthly price) debited from your account. It took 10 days for me to receive the product and I now can not find a way to get my money reimbursed. The company will not do it, despite their ""terms"" being hidden and unclear.",  Dental Services

Michael McCown4755 Highway A1AVero Beach, FL. 32963LIC# DN14339NPI# 1407836612On or about 10/19/10 I went to see Dr, Michael McCown a dentist in vero beach fl. that I've been seeing for many years,. we discussed my dental condition and he suggested I have a partial made that I could have teeth added as time goes by, do to my extensive bone loss and I will loose teeth over time. I agreed to having a partial made and as time went by i got a heck of a surprise .so McCown begain the making of the oral molds to be sent out so the partial could be made , McCown informed me that he was using a new place to have the partial made that was better then the one he was using. when the partial came in i went to McCowns office for a fitting, the partial bridge did not come close to fitting,,some adjustments were made and another oral mold was made and they were sent back for more adjustments. a week later I was called back to McCowns office for another fitting, which the partial was still not close to fitting. again McCown made some adjustments and made notes and sent the partial back for more adjustments. a week after im back in the office for a fitting and still the partial did not fit right. the bite was wrong and the partial would rock from side to side when i bit down. so with that McCown did some adjustments and a lot of grinding and McCown went so far as to grind my real bottom tooth to make the partial fit better, he did all this to try to get the bite right, I wore the partial home to try it out. well while eating dinner the bite was still way off and the partial was rocking from side to side while chewing. I relayed this the the dentist and was told to come back in for more adjustments. when I was at McCowns office I informed him that I've had a few partials made in the past and never did I have the kind of problems and never did I have a partial that rocked. I maybe I had a simple adjustment and I was good to go!!! Never did I have this kind of problems. well McCown did some more grinding to try to correct the bite,, and he tightened the clips in hopes to stop the rocking. again I wore the partial home and again while eating dinner the bite was still way off and now by him tightening the clips my teeth were aching, do to too much pressure on my teeth. again back to the office and more adjustments and grinding were done. again I wore it home and when I was chewing the partial was rocking and not just a little but was rocking like a see-saw. as far as I can tell the partial bridge was not formed to my mouth. I called McCowns office the relay the problem I was told by the receptionist that McCown said that the rocking of the bridge falls into the parameter. now im not a stupid person when i chew the partial should not almost come completely off of the other side. I was also told the I can go find another dentist and see if they can make me a better partial at mhttp://horoscopes.mydaily.com/y own expense! for him to say that was not very professional and not very responsible, and he does not stand behind his work. all told I must have made 7 to 8 or more- 45 min. each way trips for fittings!

Toledo, Ohio"," I came home from Iraq for a 2 week R & R to get my dental work done. At Allcare Dental I paid in advance, using their Care Credit / GE Money credit card,  which I have paid off in full.
 
They assured me there would be no problem getting the work done in the 2 week time period. However, they were unable to complete $2200.00 of the work, and took 'temporary' short cuts to hold me over until I was able to return home again. 
They assured me and my wife, that there would be no problem getting the work completed next time.  However, my wife called ahead to schedule my appointment for my net R & R, she was told they (again) would not be able to complete it, and there would be not problem getting a refund.  
Since I desperately needed my teeth permanently fixed, I had no choice but to go elsewhere, knowng my refund from Allcare Dental would help pay the bill.  
After personally making trips to their office, and numerous phone conversations, they sent me a check for $800.00,  still owing me that balance of $1400.00.  Shortly thereafter, the business was closed, and I feel as though I have no options left.   ",  Dental Services

										I can not give medical details. but I suffered pain and loss getting involved with this dentist. You may want to check twice first. Including possible the loss of a good tooth. Dr. only want to generate profits, and will recommend or perform only services with high profits, even when they are more invasive and risky.

										I went to get a basic teeth cleaning which is fully covered by my insurance company.  They told me that I had to do a gum check which will cost 65.00 and not be covered by my insurance.  They informed me that I had to do this so they could determine whether to give me a basic cleaning or a deep cleaning (both of which my insurance would pay for).  At that point I told them that I did not want to pay this gum check fee and to let me just get the basic cleaning.  They told me that they would not do that unless I agreed to pay the 65.00.  Basically what they have done is taken something that is standard when you get a cleaning, namely checking your gums, they have then created a ""new"" service in which they can generate an additional fee on top of what the insurance company is paying.  The reason the insurance doesn't cover it is because it is bogus and unnecessary.  They are basically double dipping and the patient is having to take the hit.  And if you don't allow them to price gouge you then they will refuse all service to you.  ",  Dental Services

										I just want to let everyone know about the bad dental experience I had at Stetic Implant & Dental Centers in Cancun. If you are researching dentists around the area and if by any chance you decide to visit this clinic, please be aware that you will be attended by a Doctor Called Antonio or Paulo who are highly unskilled (you will NOT be seen by the ""hot shots"" you can see advertised on their web page, not to mention we had a very difficult time trying to reach a proper communication since they barely speak English.
The decision was easy since I was called by Manny who sounded more than helpful and convinced me in a heartbeat, The reality is that this clinic is a total scam. I had several crowns done and later on I discovered my crowns were a total waste of my money. They were poor quality crowns, not to mention they were all ill fitted, ALL EIGHT!!, also I got an infection where I had a root canal and I had to take 10 days of antibiotics and of course my root canal had to be redone. You name it, a total nightmare. The clinic looks dirty as well, believe me when I tell you I was super brave when I decided to get my dental work with them, now I realized I was incredibly stupid. 
A dentist here in the States told me it was the worst work he has ever seen and had to be redone due to the ill fitted crowns and the infection. So I guess I just wasted my money. I requested a full refund and I never received a reply. Please be careful about who you choose to do your dental work in Cancun, and please stay away from Stetic Implant & Dental Centers. Those guys were a total waste of my time and money.									",  Dental Services

										In summary, I ordered two toothbrushes with two whitening kits.  After i ordered, i got very concerned that i never rec'd confirmation or an invoice.  To this day i still have not - i was charged $214 for these two toothbrushes - i 'guesstimated' approx $125-$130 for the total as i chose to pay in one payment.  Being concerned, i began researching the company and discovered all the bad reviews with same complaint (wish i had done this before i ordered!).  I then emailed and called several times over several days to customer service to cancel my order altogether.  They stated they could not find my order yet my account (to keep calling back in 24-48 hours) had already been charged! The packages did arrive on two separate days and i took immediately to the post office refusing and return to sender.  I ordered in beginning of march and by Mar 16 had returned both packages.  I have been requesting and demanding my full refund since and they indicate that they have not received my returns.  What kind of business can't track returns?  They have a full money back guarantee if not satisfied?  All i want is to receive my refund and never deal with this company again! 									",  Dental Services
