This Temporary Import Bond which was issued on our behalf which we never saw a copy of or even signed was issued by Roanoke Inssurance Group. Roanoke Insurance Group retained Bob Labuda as their Attorney to handle this matter. Bob Labuda is a very threatening and unethical individual who represented himself to me as an Illinois Attorney and he stated to me that Roanoke Insurance Group paid him a retailer to represent them in this case and after my last conversation with him, I called and spoke with the Illinois Registration and Disciplinary Commission in Illinois and neither Bob Labuda or Brown & Jacobs LTD are registered lawyers in the State of Illinois. Bob Labuda is a very threatening individual and during several of the conversations he threatened me and my family members. I asked Bob Labuda to send me a copy of this Temporary Import Bond (TIB) and he refused to send it and told me I was liable for the Bond that was issued. The Bond has time restraints that we were not aware of nor did we ever see the actual Bond that was issued. We did import or drive the vehicle which we did not own into the USA from Canada but non of the paperwork that we filled ou stated any time restraints on getting the vehicle back to Canada. I agreed to a settlement and immediately got a Cashiers Check payable to Bob Labuda law firm and agreed to a settlement with Three Payments. I also asked for a agreement which would be signed by his law firm, Roanoke Insurance Group and our Company that stated that when the three payements were made this matter was resolved permanently. Bob Labuda stated he would send it and never did. I didn't think I was being unreasonable. Bob Labuda says one thing then sends threatening e-mails and phone calls and doesn't follow thru with what was origianlly discussed among the parties.  Consumers and businesses doing business in Illinois beware that Bob Labuda, he is NOT an Attorney as he represents himself as and neither is his law form Brown & Jabobs LTD. They are an Accounts Receivable Firm or debt Collector and they falsely represent who they actually are to Consumers and Businesses as in my case. As far as I am concerned this Bob Labuda is a con artist and is a FRAUD and so is the company that he works for.

 James N. Riley ,"  James N. Riley  400 W Main Street Clarksburg, West Virginia USA ","", ,""," Attorney James N. Riley? More like comedic actor John C. Reilly. James N. Riley of the Clarksburg, West Virginia law firm of McNeer, Highland, McMunn & Varner LC seems to think he can get away with the same, inappropriate twisting and misrepresentation of facts that he's always done simply because he's been doing it for so long. Same as John C. Reilly, he of the inappropriate and uncomfortably twisted roles in movies like ""Talledega Nights,"" ""Step Brothers"" and ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" - among others. Reilly the actor is often uncomfortably funny. Riley the attorney is uncomfortably annoying. He takes great relish in taking facts out of context and blowing up insignificant details trying to make them seem crucial. But what really gets annoyingly uncomfortable is when he takes ordinary, everyday behavior and twists it to seem somehow wrong. Come to think of it, Riley the attorney kind of morphs into Reilly the actor when you imagine how he does his job. Imagine Riley the attorney questioning someone about an everyday, ordinary thing, like brushing teeth. Imagine the questioning at a deposition or at a trial where he's trying to twist and turn and question every nuance about brushing teeth:  ""Tell me, how many times a day do you brush? Really? Why only twice? Do you think that's enough? Shouldn't you brush after every meal? And how many brush strokes? Well why don't you know how many? How long does it take you? You don't know that, either? Why not? Don't you think that's important to know these kinds of things? What kind of toothpaste do you use? Why? Are you getting a kickback on that? (Do you use coupons?) Do you think that's an ethical thing to do?"" Could sound like a dialogue John C. Reilly would have in a movie. But you can see how it would go. Under a lawyer like Big Jim Riley's accusatory questioning, almost any ordinary thing can be made to seem criminal. And that's the crux of it. Stretching the truth is not lawyering' it's stretching the truth. And misrepresenting facts is not lawyering; it's misrepresentation of facts. It's malpractice.  Sound familiar Big Jim?

The conclusion is inescapable that both XXXX and Lustig, agents of the corporate plaintiff, repeatedly lied under oath  concerning issues material to the prosecution of plaintiff's claim and defendants' affirmative defenses, in an effort to conceal the truth and have consequently forfeited plaintiff's right to proceed with this action.

He Refused to take responsibility for the damage to my car. I asked to speak to his Supervisor and he went up the steps and I followed him. I was focused on the steps and didn't realize that he had not taken enough of the steel grates off the bay and I slammed the top of my head into the grate and it jammed my head onto my neck.  He turned around and screamed at me ""I removed three grates for you!!"" and stormed off.

The main store Manager came and said he was not allowed to take me into the service area at all and safety goggles are required for any employee to go into the bay.  He violated multiple store policies.  Everything was recorded on Security cameras which have been confirmed as existing by Claims Management employees and store management as being viewed. I didn't realize at the time how serious the neck inury was because I was so upset.  I went home and took pain meds,muscle relaxers,and an icepack.  I could not sleep for the pain and immediately went to the Dr. when they opened up the next morning to seek help.  I was repeatedly called by Claims Management about the car. No concern for my injury,they wanted me to take my car to get proof of the damages right away.  I was in agony.  I took the car to a mechanic who told me that the oil plug was stripped.  I didn't know what the damages were and was relieved to find out that their wasn't serious damage to the car.  I paid for the plug to be replaced.  Never a drop of oil afterwards. They never claimed responsibility and sent a letter that they weren't responsible even though the oil change was two weeks prior to the oil leak. They called and said that they would settle with me after treatment because the injury never would have happened if the manager had not taken me into the bay and service area.  I had an up coming major surgery that was going to be scheduled any time.  I had crippling pain and needed the surgery it had to be the first priority as I was dealing with this before the Walmart injury.  My insurance said that they would not pay for 3rd party responsibility so I was left with no way to seek treatment.  After recovering from the major surgery I sought an Attorney because I could not handle the stress of repeated calls and intense pain. I thought it best for there bea go between to deal with this insurance co. I started seeing a chiropractor who was willing to be paid after the settlement agreed upon by Claims Management.  3 months before the statute of limitations runs out Claims Management said now they won't settle and my Attorney drops me after after a year plus of representation saying ""thank you for letting me review your case,but will won't be accepting your case"". Oil field injuries are far more profitable. I have struggled with daily serious pain since September 2012 and was finally able to get an Mri with serious damages to the left side of my discs and bone spurs forming in every disc trying to repair and fortify themselves.  I never had any damage on the left side in the previous Mri.  Concrete proof of significance of Injury. Now they say I could gotten hurt any time in the last two years, I didn't seek treatment right away which is not true.  I was an adult and didn't have to follow the manager and if he asked me to do something illegal would I have done that too?  They offered to settle I  what would amount to a couple of car payments for a permanent injury that will require  surgery and untold more treatment.  I have chiropractor bills and they said they are not responsible for them although they have repeatedly that the manager broke store policy and that the injury occurred due to this.  I will be in pain for the rest of my life with medications to treat the nerve pain from multiple additions areas of damage that would not be trying to endure from the serious negligence and endangerment of the Manager. It is beyond my understanding that a company could have such a lack of conscience,integrity,common decency,and responsibility for a serious lifelong injury.  How do you seek treatment with no insurance and no help or concern from a company that caused the injury and then take advantage of the fact that you can't get desperately needed treatment.  Its just inhumane  and disgusting.  I have a couple weeks left before the Statute of limitations runs out and they said they are closing the case.  Please help me get this out to the public to somehow get pressure on this company to give fair and just settlement for my injuries and pain and suffering from this gross negligence.  I need my medical bills paid and have no way to do this.

 Christie Krupp ,"  Christie Krupp  818 Dorken Ln Dekalb, Illinois USA ","", 815-787-6193,""," Christie Krupp a lawyer who ""represented"" my son, in what should have been, a rather minor traffic case.  The objective for hiring a lawyer is simple:  get  him off the ticket.  But instead she entered a guilty plea requiring him to pay a fine plus court cost.   Anyone can plead guilty on their own and no attorney fee is required thus saving you money.   What did she think she was there for?   She had a fiduciary duty to inform him that he could plead guilty without out hiring her to do that. My son's car was T-boned at an intersection having no stop signs, he was there first, and proceeded through.   And then was hit on his passenger side door.  He entered the intersection first thereby giving him the right-of-way.  That is the law. Christie Krupp never interviewed my son to get the facts.   According to the Internet (I googled her) she claims to have worked for 4 states attorneys so she understand plea bargaining.  What she didn't understand was we didn't want our son our son being blamed by our insurance company for the accident, and getting the court case dropped would be a good first step.  So entering a guilty plea is how she ""defends"" cases???   She got bullied by the states attorney and buckled at the knees.   Or maybe she was just helping him (possibly a friend?) to get a high conviction rate at the expense of my son.   We hired her to win, we can lose by ourselves without hiring a lawyer. AAA Motor Club ONLY  reimburses members for attorney fees IF you win the case, so thanks to Christie we cannot get reimbursed for legal defence.  Bargaining with the states attorney with a guilty plea is NOT my idea of how a lawyer should represent a simple traffic case. DO NOT hire Christie Krupp unless your objective is to have her enter a guilty plea, and you pay fines and court costs, and you pay her too.   Hire a shark, not a wimp.  Hire an established law firm, not someone working out of their home. On the other hand if you just hit the lottery and want to throw around some money then hire Christie Krupp.  Perhaps instead just throw the money in the garbage because if you hire Christie Krupp that is where its going.  ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

These individuals have been sending me threatening emails for months now about filing a case against me if I didn't send them money. When I first started receiving the emails in April 2014, I would entertain it with the same questions or concerns any person would have (who are you contacting me on behalf of? How much do I owe? etc). They said they were representing Advance Cash Services for a loan in the amount of $300 which has gone up to $847 and I could settle the debt for $500. I contacted Advance Cash America and they advised they have never heard of NCS nor the individuals representing NCS. They advised they only use one specific collector and NCS is not it and that I should keep record of this fraudulent entity. I also noticed that when I responded to NCS email, I started receiving several random emails from other entities claiming to also be collecting debt for a payday loan. But I will stick to this one company on this report since they are the only ones I still hear from after 5 months and are still claiming to be filing some sort of lawsuit againt me. Below are some of the messages I received from them. If you notice below, they use several different email addresses. That alone should raise alarm. All legit company emails are standardized.

In fact, she will do more damage to a case and to her unfortunate cleints( victims) than anything else--not withstanding other corrupt lawyers in her circle of co-defendants. Karen Rose is a despicable, lying, detestable woman and should give up her joke of a law degree. Here is an excerpt from a complaint by another one of her many miserable former clients: Attorney Karen Rose, You have showed yourself up by coming to one of the most public sites (this same site, but on a different page) and popular forums and, by your own hands, have committed career suicide. You have got to be one of the stupidest human beings EVER. You, YOURSELF, had the gall to come here and publicly reveal case info about a client! From all that I (and the rest of the world) have read here, alone, I can tell that that client was and is a very decent, good person who, like so many other women in a bad relationship, got caught up with a loser biyfriend and the loser biyfriend then hired a filthy, crooked lawyer (Arthir Corona) who whored himself out for the money and has tried to make this (former) client of your miserable. [continued below]....																			..... She had no funds to hire a good attorney, so she reached out to a last-ditch lazy, lying crook like you, Ms. Rose, and that's all she wrote... But I'm sure she hasn't let it get her down and that she's intelligent enough to do much better. I hope that that client writes a FORMAL COMPLAINT to the BAR Association about you--in fact, I will take it upon myself to locate and inform this former client of yours about the horrendously unethical and illegal move that you pulled here and I will advise her to file the complaint. You are a low-down, disgusting ""lawyer,"" as you like to be referred to. To call you a pig is charitable. After this, I cannot imagine any one who would want to hire you in any capacity--or will you be spewing some lies to a potential client, in order to get him/her to hire you IN PITY? Additionally, from the testimonies of so many other unhappy people, about you, it is evident that you are a lonely divorcee, a miserable old alcoholic and a LOSER. So many losers running around in this world, and you're just another one of them. A law degree can be bought--that never made anyone a lawyer. It's integrity and dignity and hard work and at least trying to play by the rules that makes someone an attorney--something that you'll never be. Karen Rose, a crooked attorney and a corrupt shmuck.   As you can see, this is the type of horrible attorney Karen Rose (aka Karen Ilene Rose, of Los Angeles) is. She enters into an agreement to represent a client, an unsuspecting client, then later shakes him/her down for more money than originally agreed upon. Then, if the client does not or cannot give into her extortion, Karen Rose goes to the opposing party and sells very sensitive case info about her own client and case--all totally ILLEGAL and unethical acts.

Her mentally ill brother tried fondling one of her daughters that was nine years old, the police were called, and arrested the brother and incardinated him. There were never altercations or problems with her brother before. Child and youth came inland investigated all sorts of allegations’ court date was set and at the hearing, my niece had proof of all allegations against her were false. The judge even caught the child and youth worker in a bold face lie, but didn't even make note of it. At the end of the hearing, her lawyer thought that they had won with no problem. Judge Rogers, who worked in child and youth before becoming a judge, said there was neglect because she missed 2 dentist appointments, and the child still had her baby teeth. How this Judge has the power and authority to remove the children from a loving parent that the kids miss dearly, and put them in a foster home, is beyond me. We gladly welcome anyone that wants to interview my niece, her father, my wife, or myself, please feel free to contact us.   I think the corruption in Luzerne county, rivals the witch hunts in Salem.

 Attorney Karen Rose ,"  Attorney Karen Rose  11500 Olympic Blvd./ suite 400 Los Angeles, California USA ","", (310)444-3019,""," Attorney Karen Rose is a JOKE and not worth hiring. In fact, she will do more damage to a case and to her unfortunate cleints( victims) than anything else--not withstanding other corrupt lawyers in her circle of co-defendants. Karen Rose is a despicable, lying, detestable woman and should give up her joke of a law degree. Here is an excerpt from a complaint by another one of her many miserable former clients: Attorney Karen Rose, You have showed yourself up by coming to one of the most public sites (this same site, but on a different page) and popular forums and, by your own hands, have committed career suicide. You have got to be one of the stupidest human beings EVER. You, YOURSELF, had the gall to come here and publicly reveal case info about a client! From all that I (and the rest of the world) have read here, alone, I can tell that that client was and is a very decent, good person who, like so many other women in a bad relationship, got caught up with a loser biyfriend and the loser biyfriend then hired a filthy, crooked lawyer (Arthir Corona) who whored himself out for the money and has tried to make this (former) client of your miserable. [continued below]....																			..... She had no funds to hire a good attorney, so she reached out to a last-ditch lazy, lying crook like you, Ms. Rose, and that's all she wrote... But I'm sure she hasn't let it get her down and that she's intelligent enough to do much better. I hope that that client writes a FORMAL COMPLAINT to the BAR Association about you--in fact, I will take it upon myself to locate and inform this former client of yours about the horrendously unethical and illegal move that you pulled here and I will advise her to file the complaint. You are a low-down, disgusting ""lawyer,"" as you like to be referred to. To call you a pig is charitable. After this, I cannot imagine any one who would want to hire you in any capacity--or will you be spewing some lies to a potential client, in order to get him/her to hire you IN PITY? Additionally, from the testimonies of so many other unhappy people, about you, it is evident that you are a lonely divorcee, a miserable old alcoholic and a LOSER. So many losers running around in this world, and you're just another one of them. A law degree can be bought--that never made anyone a lawyer. It's integrity and dignity and hard work and at least trying to play by the rules that makes someone an attorney--something that you'll never be. Karen Rose, a crooked attorney and a corrupt shmuck.   As you can see, this is the type of horrible attorney Karen Rose (aka Karen Ilene Rose, of Los Angeles) is. She enters into an agreement to represent a client, an unsuspecting client, then later shakes him/her down for more money than originally agreed upon. Then, if the client does not or cannot give into her extortion, Karen Rose goes to the opposing party and sells very sensitive case info about her own client and case--all totally ILLEGAL and unethical acts. Karen Rose is a weak, sniveling, unskilled lawyer. Warning to any and all potential clients: Do NOT hire. ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

We received a call from century legal group saying they could help us for a fee of $3000.00 . They would break it up into payments of $160.00 every 2 weeks until paid in full . After talking to our legal advisor she said there was a sale date on the home and she would be transferring our case to a different person , Lynn butler . After being transferred to her I tried calling every day and either got her voice mail ( which she did not return any calls ) and if she did manage to answer she would give a excuse such as I am in a meeting right now and will call you back when I am finished , however she did not call back . Or she would say I am talking to your lender right now and will call you back , however again no call back this went on for 2 weeks only after contacting the man that we started with did we get a call from ms. Butler . There were pallets sent to ms butler that she claimed she had not received and that I was lying about sending them , even when she found the pallets their was no apology from her that she did have the pallets and she was sorry for calling me a lyre . She said she needed updated check stubs from my wifes job on a Friday around 3:30 pm or 4:00 pm I told her I could not get it until Monday because it had to come from the main office and they would be hand delivering it . On Monday around 4:00 pm I send a copy of the check stub to her . I would call everyday and ask the guy that we started with if we needed to go file bankruptcy before the sale date and he repeatedly said no because that is why we are paying them and that he assured me they would take care of the sale issue . 2 days before the sale date ms butler sends a email around 5:00 pm that we need to go see a bankruptcy attorney because the mortgage co. Has not stopped the sale of our home .one day to go see a bankruptcy attorney just is not enough time , not to mention I had just made another payment of $650.00 just 3 days prior . That was money I could have used to hire a bankruptcy lawyer but I paid them believing in what they were telling me . Quote ( you do not need to file bankruptcy because that is what we are paying them for and they were going to take care of everything and we do not need to worry about anything ) un- quote This company not only will lye to you and take your money but they will call you a lyre and who knows what else , and when they see you told them the truth they will not apologize to you . I have now been locked out of my home and I am still fighting to keep my home but there is no garranty that we will get our home back .

King-Mays is a terrible attorney and one of the most dishonest people I have ever dealt with! On 3/4/14, we hired Nadine R. King-Mays to handle a number of very time-sensitive civil maters in Dallas County. While Nadine R. King-Mays gladly cashed checks totaling two-thousand dollars ($2,000.00), she stopped returning our phone calls shortly thereafter and has since failed to take any substantive action in addressing the multitude of legal matters she was hired to handle. While Nadine R. King-Mays assured us from the outset that she would be prompt and aggressive and would handle our legal matters in a timely and professional manner, she has failed miseraly to follow through on a number of her empty promises. Since taking payment, Nadine R. King-Mays has been noticeably unresponsive for months. Being that she never did her job as our attorney and our high level of dissatisfaction, she promised to issue a refund and then never did so. [continued below]....																			.....  As a hard-working business owner, I would advise you not to deal with Nadine R. King-Mays, as she is underhanded and very dishonest. While she will smile in your face, she lacks integrity and will take your money and then hide and duck your calls, as she did with us. Not only did she severely violate our trust, but she also recklessly breached her sacred fiduciary duty and has irresponsibly failed to protect the vital interest of a once trusting client. Even more, our legal interests were further compromised as a direct result of Nadine's failure to act as promised. Since then, we have reported her actions to the State Bar and will soon file suit to recoup our damages. Again, be very careful when dealing with Nadine R. King-Mays! ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

But what good does a generic, quick settlement do for anybody once hospital, doctor and other bills start rolling in, as meanwhile you are still hurting and missing time from work? With other law firms you may never hear from an actual attorney, and may instead deal exclusively with a legal assistant or paralegal. Even worse, you may end up speaking to a different person every time you call and never be able to get a clear picture of what is going on with your case. Every case is different. Unlike other firms, Kanner & Pintaluga encourages its clients to focus primarily on their health and medical recovery, with the secondary focus being to then get clients the maximum compensation possible once we know the full extent of their damages, including all medical bills, lost wages, pain and suffering or other damages. Further, at K&P, every case is overseen by a senior attorney, who is assisted by a dedicated team of case managers and associate attorneys. This means that as a Kanner & Pintaluga client you are only communucating with persons who are familiar with you and your case.”“The Law Offices of Kanner & Pintaluga is an aggressive, ethical and results-driven law firm committed to representing accident and serious injury victims in various states.

After this, I cannot imagine any one who would want to hire you in any capacity--or will you be spewing some lies to a potential client, in order to get him/her to hire you IN PITY? Additionally, from the testimonies of so many other unhappy people, about you, it is evident that you are a lonely divorcee, a miserable old alcoholic and a LOSER. So many losers running around in this world, and you're just another one of them. A law degree can be bought--that never made anyone a lawyer.

Since taking payment, Nadine R. King-Mays has been noticeably unresponsive for months. Being that she never did her job as our attorney and our high level of dissatisfaction, she promised to issue a refund and then never did so.

While she will smile in your face, she lacks integrity and will take your money and then hide and duck your calls, as she did with us. Not only did she severely violate our trust, but she also recklessly breached her sacred fiduciary duty and has irresponsibly failed to protect the vital interest of a once trusting client. Even more, our legal interests were further compromised as a direct result of Nadine's failure to act as promised. Since then, we have reported her actions to the State Bar and will soon file suit to recoup our damages. Again, be very careful when dealing with Nadine R. King-Mays! ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

[continued below]....																			.....  As a hard-working business owner, I would advise you not to deal with Nadine R. King-Mays, as she is underhanded and very dishonest. While she will smile in your face, she lacks integrity and will take your money and then hide and duck your calls, as she did with us. Not only did she severely violate our trust, but she also recklessly breached her sacred fiduciary duty and has irresponsibly failed to protect the vital interest of a once trusting client. Even more, our legal interests were further compromised as a direct result of Nadine's failure to act as promised. Since then, we have reported her actions to the State Bar and will soon file suit to recoup our damages. Again, be very careful when dealing with Nadine R. King-Mays! ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

As stated above, Kanner & Pintaluga is committed to 100% customer satisfaction and has made every possible effort to ensure that all customers have a positive experience while with the firm. After speaking with the management at Kanner & Pintaluga and emailing anyone who filed a complaint in the past, Ripoff Report is proud to give K&P a positive rating. Kanner and Pintaluga made efforts to ensure that all customers were satisfied and K&P assured Rip-off Report that the business has an improved business model that features customer satisfaction as the top priority. Kevin Sobel, the managing attorney for Kanner & Pintaluga Georgia offices, stated “We strive to treat all customer complaints as constructive criticism and use them as a means to better service future clients. The satisfaction of our clients is of the utmost importance, and we look forward to continually improving so as to ensure that our clients and their families receive dedicated service, and ultimately the compensation that they deserve.”STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM Kanner & Pintaluga. Kanner & Pintaluga always attempts to contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. K&P is willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers. Kanner & Pintaluga is an aggressive, ethical and results-driven law firm committed to representing accident and serious injury victims in various states. K&P only fights for the rights of injured victims, striving to meet their primary goal of acheiving the most favorable outcome for their clients, who have the absolute right to receive the maximum compensation for their injuries.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY  ""Other law firms promise or provide money immediately to injury victims and make guarantees about cases and settlements without any concern for the client's specific case or injury. But what good does a generic, quick settlement do for anybody once hospital, doctor and other bills start rolling in, as meanwhile you are still hurting and missing time from work? With other law firms you may never hear from an actual attorney, and may instead deal exclusively with a legal assistant or paralegal. Even worse, you may end up speaking to a different person every time you call and never be able to get a clear picture of what is going on with your case. Every case is different. Unlike other firms, Kanner & Pintaluga encourages its clients to focus primarily on their health and medical recovery, with the secondary focus being to then get clients the maximum compensation possible once we know the full extent of their damages, including all medical bills, lost wages, pain and suffering or other damages. Further, at K&P, every case is overseen by a senior attorney, who is assisted by a dedicated team of case managers and associate attorneys. This means that as a Kanner & Pintaluga client you are only communucating with persons who are familiar with you and your case.”“The Law Offices of Kanner & Pintaluga is an aggressive, ethical and results-driven law firm committed to representing accident and serious injury victims in various states.

After reading a negative review, I called him the following business day and told his office manager that I was no longer interested in having him represent me. She advised that I needed to write a letter stating the same per their office policy. I drove to the. Oral springs office, wrote and signed the letter and was informed that mr. Kaufman was the only person who could authorize a refund. The female Hispanic office manager told me that mr. Kaufman was in court and that he would call me that day; 08/04/14. I. Ever received a call that day so I called back on 08/05/14. I could not reach attorney barry kaufman and again spoke with his office manager. She said that she would pass the information along and have him call me. Needless to say, I again did not receive a callback today, 08/05/14.  I checked my bank account and he had already withdrawn my money without ever sending a retainer agreement or a credit card authorization for me to sign. I retained a different attorney to handle my pending case and will likely have to file a small claims suit to recover my money from this attorney; as he appears to be dodging my calls.  Ironically,  at the time of my initial call on 08/01/14, attorney barry kaufman called me within 10 minutes of my inquiry regarding potential representation. Now it has been two days of multiple contact attempts to retrieve my unauthorized withdrawl and he has not made any attempt to call me back or refund my money even though he is already aware that I retained a different attorney for more money and have called, spoken, left multiple messages and signed a letter advising that I do not want to use his attorney service.   I am writing this review so that other potential clients can be aware of the unprofessional and unscrupulous manner in which this attorney handles refunds.

 Peter Holzer Attorney At Law ,"  Peter Holzer Attorney At Law  228 W Main St, Second Floor Tustin, California USA ",www.attorneyholzer.com/, ,""," Don’t get ripped off from this Attorney Peter Holzer Attorney At Law 228 W Main St, Second Floor Tustin, CA 92780          I retained Peter Holzer’s services on 4/30/14 for an easy “Lease To Own” contract for a house I was renting.  I met with him and he said the cost would be $500 and he would draft something up within a weeks’ time. Over a Month later on 7/8 and after many messages for Peter to get back with me this, his assistant Linda sent me a title report and this email. Email…. Mr. Miller:  Mr. Holzer has asked that you review the attached property profile.  It seems to contradict your understanding of the status of title.  According to the property profile, the agreement that you are requesting Mr. Holzer to prepare will be completely ineffective. Thank you. I called Peter and he finally called me back and was completely confused and did not remember what we were doing because it had been so long.  He had a lot of papers and an agreement explaining who is purchasing what.  Then he finally sends me a title report because of the person that was on title was not me.  I had to explain things again to him.  After many promises to get me something “by tomorrow” or “later today” and many messages, he eventually stopped returning my messages.  NO return phone calls at all.  On 7/15 I was fed up and I called and told the receptionist to relay the message that I wanted a refund. On 7/16 Peter sent me half ass agreement.  Some of the information was wrong and another attorney looked it over and said it was not done correctly.  At this time had no faith that any real time or energy was spent on my agreement anyway and would have to seek other options to get this done. I asked for my money back and this is the reply.  “ I will not return the entire $500.00 to you; instead, I offer to refund $100.00 to you.  Please consider that offer seriously.  Thank you.” This attorney has wasted my time (almost 3 months) and money and now I have to get my money back.  Don’t let this happen to you!

 LP Advocates ,"  LP Advocates   , California USA ","", ,""," In September of 2013 we were told by our mortgage company, Wells Fargo,  they would not work with us to keep our home. Wells Fargo told us we had 2 options, to foreclose or short –sale. We decided to do a short sale. We contacted our mortgage company right away to let them know and got a real estate agent, who specialized in short sales.  We moved out of our home officially on November 23rd 2013.  We moved 2 and half hours away to the state of New Jersey.  In October 2013, there was an offer put on in for our house and everything was running smoothly.  Until our real estate agent contacted us in February of 2014 and told us that we had a 2nd mortgage on our house.  We were not aware of that. She explained that it was ok but that the short sale was just going to take a little longer.  In March of 2014 our real estate agent was trying to work with Wells Fargo to complete our sale, but she told us that we would have to contact a lawyer because no matter how many times she had requested the proper paperwork, Wells Fargo kept telling her they were not aware of a short sale and kept losing the necessary paperwork.  We had called a couple lawyers, but they were not responding.  We received a letter in the mail in March 2014 from LP Advocates stating that our Mortgage Company may have committed fraud and that we might be able to get our house back. It made sense at the time because they would not give our real estate agent what she needed. So we called and spoke with: Patrick West  Home Preservation Specialist Rep # 1003 LP Advocates Direct: (714) 602-3194 Fax:    (866) 395-7897 He pulled up our case number and informed us that he was working with Wells Fargo lawyer firm Zuckerburg, Gold, and Associates.  He told me that we should have never been turned down for help from Wells Fargo when we were and that we should have been approved for the HAMP Program. He asked if we wanted to return to our home and I said yes of course. He sent us all of the HAMP program documentation and answered many questions that we had. After talking on the phone and through e-mail for a few weeks he said that we were PRE-APPROVED for the HAMP Program and he sent us our new terms stating that Wells Fargo would reevaluate the price of our home and modify it down to $152,308.16. That we would get a 2.00% interest rate and our mortgage payments would be $601.21 a month for the next 30 years and that would include PMI.  We were told that we would have to send a reinstatement fee to Wells Fargo, it would go in and escrow account as in good faith. If we got an approval for the HAMP Program we would not get that money back but if we got denied we would get the money back. Then we would have to make 3 trial payments of $601.21 in June 2014, July 2014 and August 2014. I asked him what his opinion was because I didn’t want to move back to our home to only loose it again! We had no help with the money to move, only to move again. We borrowed money from family members. He told us we needed to go back to our home in order for Wells Fargo to even consider working with us and that 90% of people do not get approved and we wouldn’t have gotten that far in the process to only be denied. We were also told that LP advocates would not get paid unless we get paid from our “lawsuit.” Once we get paid they would take 25%.  After we sent in our $1,722.38 Cashier’s Check for our re-instatement fee we called Patrick West to confirm the tracking number.  We talked to him many times through e-mail and on the phone, he was a great listener and said he understood everything we were going through, that he use to work for Wells Fargo and knew how they were so corrupt. A couple days later Patrick then told us that his part of the process was over and that we would be working with Isaac Vargas: 1-415-763-2375 from now on. The main Lawyer who would be working with us on our lawsuit because of Wells Fargo over charging us, the exact words were excessively. We moved back into our home on April 12th 2014. A couple days later a person who was hired by Wells Fargo came to our house in Pennsylvania to take pictures to confirm that we lived there. I didn’t understand this. Another person was hired, a landscaper. I called Isaac Vargas and asked him to explain to me why we are still in foreclosure and these people are coming to our house.  He said at this point you still owe a debt so until your 3 month trial period is over you are still going to have these types of issues. I asked him about our lawsuit and he said that there are so many people in the same position that we are in right now and they are doing an audit on our mortgage going back to 2008 when we 1st had our 1st modification so it is going to take a while.    From April 12th 2014 to June 1st 2014 we were in contact with Isaac Vargas a few times. He would call us and request paperwork. We would receive paperwork from Wells Fargo so I knew LP Advocates were doing their jobs.   Isaac told me that in May 2014 we should receive a packet from Wells Fargo stating our terms for our trial payments and our approval. We never received a packet. After calling him a few times I was able to reach him and he just gave me the address over the phone. We were no longer bothered by Wells Fargo at that point as well.  These guys knew everything about our mortgage case. That we should have never been charged with lawyers’ fees, about our 2nd mortgage on the home. They knew too much.  After June 1st 2014 we no longer received calls from Isaac Vargas. I started calling him in July, after we made our second trial payment. I could not leave a voice mail. I then stated to write e-mails and call the other number I had. 1-877-791-8295. All 3 numbers that I have now been trying to call are just a busy signal, or I cannot leave a message. I have been sending e-mails and they are not being returned to sender, but they are not responding. Now we have contacted a real lawyer and are in the process of filing a complaint to the attorney general. After doing more research we have found that LP Advocates has the same web-site as another web-site who is also on the Rip Off report for the past couple of years. I guess they changed there name. Now we have to hope and pray our Mortgage company will work with us to stay in our home.  ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

He lied to me during initial questioning.  He told me he had a son and understood my grief and used this lie to draw answers out of me.  He did not have a son.  He later twisted my words to bolster his case in court  2. He then made me part of the prosecutions team.  I was supeoned and unable to attend court unless I was called.  He also supeoned my son's grandparents and they were unable to attend court unless they were called to testify.  We all wanted to be in court to support my son but were unable to show our support.  Kirvin had no intention on calling the grandparents to testify because they were in support of their grandson, they were supeoned to be kept out of court. 3. I received a phone call that Evan Kirvin wanted to talk to me and to come to meet him at the court house.  When I went to his office I was told to meet him on 3rd floor.  The truth was that court was in session and I was never told the trial was taking place.  Next thing I know I was on the stand answering Kirvin's questions. 4. He twisted my words and  when I was trying to clarify what I had said he called me a hostile witness. 5. He called a false witness to bolster his case, an ex girlfrind of the deseased that was on probation. 6.  He got the CHP to change his testimony to bolster his case.  There was a mistrial a year previously and the CHP's testimony was different the first time. 7.

I retained them to assist with a tax problem. I met with the person I thought would be assisting me.  As it turns out it was a salesman.  I was then turned over to an ""enrolled agent.""  Though collection activity had commenced, it took her FOUR MONTHS to contact the IRS revenue agent.  Every time I called her for an update, she said she'd call me back. She never once did so.  I finally had to call her supervisor-- an attorney.  Same thing. Every question was met with an ""I'll look into it and call you back."" He never once did so.  I was behind on tax returns and was quite ill and in the hospital. Instead of inquiring if I needed assistance, the alleged agent kept threatening me. After long periods where I would hear nothing, she would send me emails on a Friday afternoon demanding compliance by Monday morning.  In other words, instead of helping she was frightening me.  I requested a different agent.  It was refused. In the meantime I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown.  In speaking with my accountant, I realized they were not acting in my best interest and that I had lost all confidence in them.   I finally called the IRS agent directly and learned that the Tax Resolution Services Agent had been lying to me about the status of the case.  I also learned that despite their representations they never contacted the State Franchise Board re state collection actions. Due to their material misrepresetations and deceptive acts and practices, I terminated them in writing, demanded that they transfer my file to my accountant, and demanded a refund.  Although I have now sent multiple letters, they have failed and have refused to comply, notwithstanding their statutory obligation to provide me with my records and files and to return all unearned fees. This is nothing but a tax scam, aimed at taking advantage of people in desperate need of assistance. They charged me $10,000 and the bottom line is that they did nothing but make a few phone calls.  GO ANYWHERE ELSE BUT THIS. ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

AFR Mortgage operates in the U.S. AFR Mortgage has been in business for over 15 years and have funded over 2.7 billion dollars in the past year alone.According to Angel Bell, a representative of the company, all leads are acquired on multiple levels.

In this case, a customer is quoted an initial rate and package during the first interaction between the customer and loan officer. This is suggested by the loan officer to lock in that rate at that time. In this scenario, a customer will not lock in the rate at that time and end will end the conversation with the loan officer. At a later date that customer will call back in and request the same rate and package that was offered previously. Seeing how these rates are regulated by the government and are subject to change. This is where the complaint comes into play. When this happens, the president of AFR Mortgage will then proceed to contact and further educate the customer.

AFR Mortgage delivers home mortgage solutions to customers. It also provides low mortgage rates in spite less than perfect credit history. AFR Mortgage operates in the U.S. AFR Mortgage has been in business for over 15 years and have funded over 2.7 billion dollars in the past year alone.According to Angel Bell, a representative of the company, all leads are acquired on multiple levels. Part of the leads is purchased through online lead companies. A good portion of the leads come through referrals. Potential clients will indicate interest by calling in, engaging in chat, or now available is video chat through the website. A potential client will participate in a chat with an employee regarding AFR Mortgage products and services, or will call AFR Mortgage directly. After expressing interest in AFR Mortgage products/services, either by calling the company or being called, AFR Mortgages staff will explain the company’s products and services and answer any and all questions that the person may have. Usually asking what the rates are for the mortgage packages. After the potential client receives clarification and answers to questions they may have the process will move forward. Next, they are sent over to a licensed loan officer to continue with finding the best plan for the client. AFR Mortgage’s staff then asks potential customers a series of questions to determine their credit and establish the lowest rate possible. As well as establishing a payment plan. The staff will provide customers with information about the current rates of mortgage packages and what the process with AFR Mortgage entails.According to Ms. Bell “The only time a customer is not satisfied with the level of service or product they receive is only when they do not get the rate they want.” However, this complaint is not a common one. In this case, a customer is quoted an initial rate and package during the first interaction between the customer and loan officer. This is suggested by the loan officer to lock in that rate at that time. In this scenario, a customer will not lock in the rate at that time and end will end the conversation with the loan officer. At a later date that customer will call back in and request the same rate and package that was offered previously. Seeing how these rates are regulated by the government and are subject to change. This is where the complaint comes into play. When this happens, the president of AFR Mortgage will then proceed to contact and further educate the customer.  The president will go over rates and packages and come to an understanding. After these phone calls the customer understood that rates and happy time was taken out to explain the situation. American Financial Resources, Inc. Customer Satisfaction & CareAfter an issue is resolved, AFR Mortgage will proceed with setting the customer up with a package if they wish.

 WEG & MYERS ,"  WEG & MYERS  52 Duane Street New York, North Carolina USA ",www.wegandmyers, 212-227-4210,""," WEG @ MEYERS ATTORNEYS RIP OFF OF WIDDOW - DENNIS D’ANTONIO PARTNER   Dennis D’Antonio, managing partner of Weg & Myers ripped me off! Here’s my sad story. I am a widow whose husband died in the fire that destroyed our home in the fire that followed hurricane Sandy in Staten Island, New York. The insurance company refused to pay  our claim in full so I sued for bad faith. In the middle of the trial my contingency fee attorney suffered a stroke and couldn’t continue so there was a mistrial I needed another atorney. My formeer attornmey referred me to Weg & Myers as  experts in bad faith insurance litigation.  I visited Dennis D’Antonio in the Weg & Myers’ office in Downtown Manhattan. Dennis quoted his fee at $600 an hour which was more than I could afford and told him that it was out of the question. But he told me that I needed an attorney like him who could charm the jury into giving me a large award including punitive damages of at least two million dollars. He proceeded to recite his opening and closing arguments to the jury in which he said that insurance companies  are quick to collect premiums and act in bad faith in not paying claims. He charmed me into agreeing to retain him and paying a $30,000 retainer in advance which I had to drain my savings accounts and max out my credit cards to pay. Dennis had my prior attorney send him all the files including depositions and ordered the three days of trial transcripts which he reviewed. He then had me visit his office to review the case. He had his partner and an associate attend the meeting which I objected to as redundant and unnecessary but Dennis insisted they had to be familiar with the case as they would be working on it. I was billed $300 an hour for the associate plus $600 an hour each for Dennis and his partner for a total of $7,500 for the five hours of meetings. I was billed thirty hours for his associate to review the files including reading the depositions and trial transcripts for another $9,000. Then Dennis had to review the file, read the depositions and trial transcripts himself – he billed for reading them twice explaining that this was necessary so that he would not miss anything for a total of another twenty-five hours at $600 an hour adding $15,000 to the bill. Then they billed me $2,400 for the trial transcript sending me a bill at the end of the first month for $33,400 insisting that I pay $3,400 and send another $10,000 against future work. I called Dennis repeatedly to discuss the bill and he did not return my calls. Eventually the office manager called me to say that if I did not pay the money, Weg & Myers would not do any additional work on the case and would make a motion to be relieved of representing me telling me to get another lawyer. Ultimately, I found another contingency fee attorney to represent me but he can not get the files from Weg & Meyers as they refuse to release them unless they are paid $3, 400 which I do not have as a widow with two small children to support with no job.  I feel that Dennis Antonio and Weg & Myers really ripped me off by running up an atstronomical unnecessary bill. There was no need for three lawyers to attend the meetings with me.  There was no need for both the associate and Dennis to read the depositions and trial transcripts and review the files. Based on this I believe that I have been overbilled to the tune of at least $22.800. Given that they intended to resign the case after using up the $30,000 retainer and are none of the effort they put in is of any value to me I feel that that I have been ripped off for the entire $30,000. Dennis D’Antonio is an evil crook who takes advantage of widows who have no money. He is evil. Beware of him – he will cheat you. He will run up huge bills before making any actual progress on your case. He bill you for doing work twice. Beware of this crooked shyster.   ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Dr. John Talmadge and Mr. Don Nicolini convinced me to put my daughter Piper first and taught me how to do it. Mr. Kelly explained the “addiction defense” in terms of George Bush. He spoke about recovery and redemption and how we would make a clear, convincing case for Judge Mary Brown (Dallas County Family Court 303rd). We agreed on two goals. 1)      Get out of supervised visitation 2)      Remove the protective order against me declaring I committed domestic violence. I requested a Representation Agreement and Mr. Kelly agreed to provide one. Today is Friday 6/13/2014 and I still do not have a Representation Agreement despite multiple requests. A hearing was scheduled for 12/2/2013. My witnesses, including Dr. John Talmadge and Mr. Don Nicolini, were at the Dallas County Family Court 303rd, sitting waiting in the hall for four hours. The hearing that was scheduled never happened. I expressed my disappointment with Mr. Kelly again when I met with him in person on 12/4/2013. I asked “Have you done your best?” Mr. Kelly said “No” and “I commit to take control”. On 12/19/2013 I scheduled an appointment with Mr. Kelly for 12/20/2013.

Especially Dr. John Talmadge?” Mr. Kelly replied “No, I and I will subpoena him if I need to.” I replied “That does not sound professional.” I believe, in my heart-of- hearts, that I met my obligation as a Client and a Father. Mr. Jerry Kelly is clearly neglecting my case and that directly influences my relationship with Piper in a negative way. He does not return my phone calls or emails and he does not keep me informed about the status of my case. I believe this is a clear, fair representation of the facts. ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

" Tonkon Torp Law Firm, David Aman ","  Tonkon Torp Law Firm, David Aman  888 SW 5th Avenue Portland, Montana USA ",www.tonkon.com, 406-570-1489,""," On or about 2009 the Summit Principals filed bankruptcy after they had hired Obsidian Finance Group, David Aman’s client to help them restructure debt. David Aman was involved to protect Tonkon Torp Law Firm and Leon Simson of Tonkon Torp who had previously worked with Kevin Padrick and with Dept. of Justice Trustee Pamela Griffith. This enabled attorney and co-owner of Obsidian Finance Group, Kevin Padrick to get the Trustee job and make millions a year over 5 years. Also his prior work with Perkins Coie attorney Steven Hedberg at Miller Nash helped him as Hedberg was the Creditors attorney. Also then attorney Michael Simon was a creditor attorney and worked with Kevin Padrick on the 30 million dollar plus, Umpqua Bank Settlements. Perkins Coie attorney Michael Simon then became Judge Michael Simon and was put into office the same time as Judge Michael Simon, Cox alleges they are friends. Perkins Coie hosted the event that welcomed Judge Hernandez into office. It is important to note that Judge Marco Hernandez was not a Federal Judge in Portland until AFTER David Aman filed a 10 million dollar lawsuit against a penniless, homeless blogger who was exposing the inside dealing of the Summit Bankruptcy. Together David Aman and his client Kevin Padrick sued, and bullied any Summit insider who objected to their fees, video taped public meetings, filed court documents they did not approve of, and well, anyone that did not do exactly as they wanted was harassed, sued, set up, got criminal charges for fake acts, and even forced into mental institutes. On December 23, 2010 David Aman, Tonkon Torp Law Firm sent me a cease and desist requesting I, Crystal Cox, remove content online about  his client Kevin Padrick and Obsidian Finance. I had been reporting on the Summit Bankruptcy for 3 years by this time as David Aman clearly knew as he deposed Summit Insider Stephanie DeYoung and asked her Crystal Cox’s motive for posting, of which she answered in video at a deposition in August of 2009. David Aman gave me no blog post that he wanted removed, or had issue with and I literally had thousands by that time. With no way to know what he was requesting to be removed, therefore I did not remove any. David Aman filed a 10 million dollar lawsuit against me, just weeks after this, on January 14th 2011 saying the same generic information and stating No Blog post and requesting NO JURY Trial. According to Oregon’s Retraction Laws, Aman is required to ask for a retraction and then wait 2 weeks before he sues, otherwise he has no defamation claim. This law was completely ignored in this case and Defendant Crystal Cox, my, rights were completely violated. About Dec. 2010 or earlier David Aman began conspiring with a man named Sean Boushie, whom he knew there was a clear record that this man had threatened to kill me. David Aman worked with this man to harass me, bully me, keep me in constant fear and he was to come to the trial and bully me. I filed a motion to Exclude, Judge Hernandez granted this and claimed, as the record shows, that he was contacting the FBI on these matters in a hearing on Nov. 18th 2011. This FBI involvement never happened. Aman continued to conspire with this man. Throughout 2011 Aman contacted me by phone and email, lied to me, bullied me, offered me settlement offers that would incriminate others and discriminated against me as a pro se litigant as well as constantly threatened me and lied to me. As a top Oregon Law Firm, Judge Marco Herndandez protected David Aman over the rights of pro se litigant Crystal Cox, me. I allege they had many private communications of which I, Crystal Cox, pro se was not privy to and in this communications they discussed my alleged guilt of extortion and how they would paint me out as a criminal extortionist to the world, of which they have now successfully done. And has caused ire On Nov. 29th 2011, David Aman forced me to be deposed and questioned my on topics unrelated to the blog post I was on trial for, one of which was my internet marketing business that I had tried to do but never made a living at. I refused, Judge Hernandez came into the room, the video camera and court reporter were shut off and Judge Marco Hernandez ordered me tell Aman about this business. Aman’s motive was to set me up for the crime of extortion, of which violated my 14th amendment and 5th amendment rights and forced me to essentially incriminate myself. Mid Nov. 2011 Cox filed a motion asking Aman to again to stop accusing her of extortion. It was proper to file a criminal complaint if he thought Cox guilty of a crime and not use a civil court, connections with a Judge and manipulation of a Jury of which Cox never agreed to have. On Nov. 28th 2011, At the hearing before this deposition, Cox asked Judge Hernandez if Aman was allowed to bring in that one email into evidence, the Judge said he was not unless I testify, so Aman and Judge Hernandez tricked me into not testifying in my own defense, and then they let the email in anyway into the closing statement. Having asked the next day and told it was not coming in, I was not prepared with my easy defense of the 4 other emails of the email thread that David Aman willfully, neglectfully, deliberately left out to paint me as a criminal in a civil trial and cover up the crimes of elite portland Oregon law firms, DOJ Trustees, Bankruptcy Judges, utility and finance companies. The other 4 emails show that I was not saying what he painted to the world that I had said. And this email was an attorney to attorney email, as I was my own attorney. It was privileged and it was sent after I was sued for 10 Million dollars, yet David Aman made it the center of attention to put up a smoke screen and hide the corrupt and illegal actions of his law firm and his client in the Summit Bankruptcy proceeding. His client Kevin Padrick was under contract with Summit to help them restructure debt, he took a 100,000 from them and they had a signed contract. Under contract law this cannot be interfered with and under bankruptcy law Kevin Padrick was an insider and unable to be a Trustee then working on the opposite side of his cilent and essentially bankrupting them, setting them up for jail time, liquidating them and only when he got a 15% fee on everything that he SOLD. Before this time he simply seized and froze assets. Kevin Padrick did not declare in his trustee statement that he had prior contracts with Summit and clear conflicts of interest in working for the debtor and was therefore legally an insider, and in bankruptcy code, an “insider” is not allowed to be a Trustee. And in the Tax Code, in a 1031 Exchange Company a legally defined “insider” is not a “qualified intermediary”. Thus Cox claimed and still claims Tax Fraud and Bankruptcy Code Violations, as well as violations of Contract Law per contracts that Obsidian had with Summit. This court knows enough to order an investigation in the Summit Bankruptcy yet has not, Cox alleges this is to protect corruption in Portland Oregon. The court cannot interfere with contract law, yet Judge Randall Dunn ruled that Kevin Padrick be appointed Trustee which was in clear opposition to the best interest of the Creditors and violated contract law. Judge Marco Hernandez and David Aman knows that Kevin Padrick broke the LAW, alleges COX. And Cox alleges that he is protecting Perkins Coie mainly, and Judge Michael Simon. David Aman was Kevin Padrick’s attorney in the Summit Bankruptcy and involved in the corruption that Cox was and is alleging in the behind the scenes of that Bankruptcy. The TRUTH is Kevin Padrick was not LEGALLY able to be the TRUSTEE as a MATTER OF LAW. Therefore the Summit Bankruptcy should be VOID, started over and Kevin Padrick and all his co-conspirators such as Judge Randall Dunn, DOJ Trustee Pamela Griffith, Tonkon Torp’s Leon Simpson, and Perkins Coie Steven Hedberg SHOULD all go to JAIL. It is a BLATANT Fact that Kevin Padrick did not declare in his trustee statement that he had prior contracts with Summit and clear conflicts of interest in working for the debtor and was therefore legally an insider, and in bankruptcy code, an “insider” is not allowed to be a Trustee. And a fact per the record that a TRUSTEE was NOT in the best interest of the creditors PERIOD. David Aman blocked and prevented me from testifying at my trial in my own defense with lies about evidence, tricks and deceit. David Aman maliciously used an email I had sent him as a settlement offer to make the Jury think I was a criminal and that my motive, my “malice” was to post online about him and his client then 3 years later ask for the money to remove the content. When the whole email thread, including 5 emails showed that I was not intending “extortion”, it is clear. Yet Aman, desperate to discredit me to the world and keep the eyes off the criminal activity of Tonkon Torp and Kevin Padrick, he painted to the Jury and later to the world that I, Crystal Cox was a Felony Extortionist. Cox had a 1 day trial on Nov. 29th, 2011, the Jury loathed Cox so much they gave the Plaintiff $500,000 more then they asked for, for a total of $2.5 million. Cox would have had a smaller judgement if she had simply not attended the trial. Cox was bullied, denied due process, the Judge and Aman conspired, she was set up, discriminated against and her life made the collateral damage to protect Portland Oregon’s Elite. December 2011 after getting a $2.5 Million Judgement against Cox, attorney David took a private settlement negotiation, one email out of a 5 email thread and gave it to the Seattle Weekly, maliciously, deliberately, with malice, neglectfully and willfully telling them that I, Crystal Cox had extorted him and his client. The whole world then believed Cox a criminal as he and his client spread the email and the allegations to Forbes, the New York Times, the OS Bar magazine, the AP press, and many other big and small media and legal publications world wide. This has deliberately caused Crystal Cox, me, irreparable damage and my wish of the Oregon Bar is to ensure this does not happen to anyone else and to STOP Aman from doing this to me again in my new trial. On or about December 10th 2011, David Aman negotiated a deal with attorney Marc Randazza, it was some sort of deal to STOP me, Cox from appealing my ruling to the Ninth Circuit. I was made aware of this by attorney, UCLA professor Eugene Volokh. Marc Randazza was acting as my attorney to negotiate a deal that would benefit his big money clients in the Porn Industry, such as Liberty Media. Randazza posed as my attorney with no contract no agreement with me, and David Aman simply negotiated a deal and they moved forward with out my, the client, a pro se litigant’s knowledge or approval. Once I found out I made sure Randazza knew he did not represent me, as I wanted Professor Eugene Volokh to represent me on appeal and NOT Marc Randazza. It was unethical, and I allege, unlawful for David Aman to be negotiate a deal without my knowledge, knowing full well I was pro se and had been in court with him as my own attorney 2 weeks prior and filing motions for the prior year as my own attorney. After my firing attorney Marc Randazza, who did not have my permission to be negotiating for me, he got very angry and retaliated. Oregon attorney David Aman participated in this retaliation, willfully and with knowledge of it being unethical and unlawful. Marc Randazza contacted Aman and they made a plan to set me up for the crime of extortion. Randazza agreed that he would testify that I extorted him. But that Aman would have to Subpoena him in order to make it look legit, as Randazza had acted as my attorney, thought he did not have my permission and things could get sticky. So Aman subpoenaed Randazza. I was pro se so I got a copy of this subpoena so I began to blog the story and fight for my life as it was already shown that Judge Hernandez believed I was guilty of extortion and had taken a pot shot at that accusation in a ruling denying a new tria. So we had 2 attorneys and a Judge setting me up for extortion without due process, and in violation of my rights, my only hope was to start a blog and expose the situation of which I did, and for some reason Randazza never testified. Later he claimed to a court that I had intimidated him. Thing is I had questions ready to ask him and planned to be at the deposition. Aman then conspired with Randazza to hire “receiver” Laura Pearson who had worked with Randazza before in the Righthaven cases to seize blogs and get assets from litigants. Aman conspired with Randazza to SEIZE Cox’s right to appeal. On or about December 2012 David Aman conspired with Marc Randazza of Randazza Legal Group and Steven Wilker of Tonkon Torp law firm to seize my right to appeal a $2.5 million Judgement, see document, 144 and 145 of Obsidian v. Cox, Motion to Stay, the attached documents show the planned sheriff sale. At this time I represented myself on my assets. Randazza knowing his trick well, as a Florida attorney, coached, counseled Aman on how to file documents in the county where I live and in Multnomah County Oregon, to have a sheriff’s sale and auction of my “right to appeal” the $2.5 Million Judgment in Obsidian v. Cox, in order to satisfy the debt. At this time I was well into my Ninth Circuit Appeal. Aman, Tonkon Torp Lawyer, having powerful connections in Oregon, got a sheriff to issue this documents and set this auction. Just before Christmas vacation I contacted my appeal attorney Eugene Volokh, he wrote up an addition to our contract so he could represent me on this matter, filed a motion to stay, then flew to a hearing in Portland to block David Aman’s unconstitutional, unethical actons against Cox. Aman and Randazza continued for years to bully, threaten, harass and sue Cox, me, in order to STOP me from my Ninth circuit appeal or get me to “deal”, to settle. I won my ninth circuit appeal, fighting and clawing all the way to stay in it. And now I face a new trial where David Aman is again representing Obsidian. I have filed a motion to remove him as there is no way to get a fair trial with Judge Marco Hernandez as the Judge again and attorney David Aman involved. Crystal Cox, me, alleges that David Aman violated my constitutional rights, human rights, civil rights, rules of procedure and broke the law in his dealings with me in the Obsidian Finance Group v. Crystal Cox case. I allege that he acted willfully, deliberately negligent, unethically and relentless attacked me completely outside of law and in violation of my due process rights and all to retaliate against a whistleblower, an investigative reporter writing on the Summit Bankruptcy of which he was involved in.  Posted Proudly by Blogger Crystal L.

Ms. Gragg was timid and shy and seemed to be afraid to stand up to the opposing attorney who was a bulldog.  I felt like she just layed down and allowed opposing counsel to walk all over her and all over me by proxy!  I went from being very unhappy with her work to being very uneasy about the potential outcome of the case.  The Judge had already made it very clear that she was not happy with Ms. Gragg and her incompetence at all. Eventually, I was forced to fire Ms. Gragg and hire another attorney, and I'm glad I did.  My new attorney was able to minimize damages enough that I was able to get joint custody of my son, so I can at least report a happy ending.  I am convinced that, had I not fired Brandi Gragg, I would have lost custody of my son and been ordered to pay even more attorney's fees to my ex's attorney.

however, no action was taken on the subpoenas for over 4 months.  This puts us in the position of spending additional money without the benefit of reviewing the documentation and making an informed decision on whether or not to proceed.”     Incompetence - Some examples include: 3.1.  Most baffling is the fact that after 14 months the attorney had still not requested written discovery (request for production of documents) which was our primary objective and always the very first step to be taken. 3.2.  Consistently sent emails to an invalid email addresses. 3.3.  Repeatedly failed to provide us with our copies of documents, subpoenas, etc. 3.4.  Failed to follow our wishes on actions to be taken.  3.5.  Failed to file written discovery. 3.6.  Consistently dropped the ball through the following actions:  3.6.1.     Failure to file subpoenas in the time sensitive manner 3.6.2.     Incorrectly completed subpoenas 3.6.3.     At one point the plaintiff prepared a Motion and provided to attorney for submittal.  However, it was still not filed in time. 3.6.4.     The plaintiff, being a legal secretary, repeatedly had to monitor, follow through, and remind the attorney of deadlines and documents.  Luckily, plaintiff was knowledgeable enough to monitor the situation and catch many errors and delays.  However, that should never have been necessary; especially at the hourly rates we were being charged.      The client, being a paralegal, had to constantly stay on top of the attorney to make sure things got done on time and correctly.  Work done FOR the attorney because he was dropping-the-ball included:  {performed the following tasks and provided to our attorney} 4.1.  Edited and corrected Subpoenas 4.2.  Created Motion (was provided well in advance but still wasn’t filed in time) 4.3.  Researched case law 4.4.  Researched Burden of Proof laws 4.5.  Researched family trust and farm subsidy regulations 4.6.  Reminded attorney of deadlines 4.7.  Constantly monitored attorney’s progress and responsibilities through the courts public information (because we normally did not get any information from the attorney) 4.8.  After extended periods of no activity plaintiff constantly had to remind attorney of what he need to be pursuing and what documents we were trying to accomplish. 4.9.  Researched and provided pertinent County Assessor information                                         Communication: 5.1.  More often than not, attorney would never reply.  When motions were submitted, phone calls made to the defendant, courts, etc. attorney failed to follow-up and tell us what had transpired.   We did not receive copies of documents and attorney was uncooperative answering questions and responding to emails.       5.2.  Every few months we would have to send the attorney emails to get him “back on track”.  We would have no idea what was going.  We had to send attorney detailed emails refocusing him on the original, primary objective.         Phone conversations & questionable honesty: 6.1.  We had an impossible time staying informed and had horrible experiences trying to get any information about what was occurring or had transpired.   We could not get answers to specific questions/issues via phone but instead had some unnecessarily long winded and unproductive discussions. 6.2.  Things that were said and agreed upon over the phone were not carried out at all, or in the manner plaintiff had requested.  Attorney consistently failed to do what he promised, or would sometimes do the opposite of what was requested.  6.3.  We had an impossible time getting attorney to answer questions, we got inconsistent stories, could never get updates, were unable to find out was going on with the case, or get answers about the outcome of a meeting, phone call, or other task, etc. 6.4.  Attorney stated in the first meeting that he preferred telephone communications.  We though this odd in this day and age, but we complied.  We then finally realized this was the attorney’s way of avoiding a paper trail and not getting pinned down on anything he had said or promised.  At that point, we requested all communications be done via email.  After that request, attorney’s communication became almost non-existent.  6.5.  Very, very seldom did attorney follow-up and get back with us as promised.    The Law Firm’s attitude, ethics, and manner: 7.1.  Plaintiff was forced to send multiple emails to the other partners of the firm with complaints.  Nothing was done and no one ever even responded.  Every few months we would have to send attorney emails to get him “back on track”.  We would have no idea what was going.  We would have to send attorney detailed emails refocusing him on the original, primary objective.        I assume attorney had way too much on his plate, didn’t care, or both.  Obviously, it cannot be said that the attorney did no work on the case over the 14 month period.  After prodding and reminding him, he did do some things.  Like filing the same subpoena 3 times, although nothing had changed in the case.  They had just done it wrong the first 2 times.  What we can say is attorney did nothing to represent our best interests, only his billing interests.   As mentioned previously, throughout the year we voiced concerns and complaints, both to the attorney and to the other firm partners, in the event they may have been unaware of the problems and issues.  All complaint communications were completely ignored and never replied to.     Finally, the attorney botched the filing of a Motion and we complained again.  It was blatant incompetence, and attorney couldn’t even attempt to concoct an excuse this time.  There was also no apology…only arrogance.  Attorney then immediately terminated our attorney-client relationship, ceased to be our council.

As a result of Eli Samocha's actions, I spent the last couple of years fighting him throughout the courts for slander against myself and my family.  Eli Samoocha falsely claimed that I was beating my wife and stealing public funds from the city council to win political notoriety.  I filed a   Report Attachments:      										.....html"">civil claim against Eli Samoocha and won my case.  You can find the case here. An additional example of Eli Samoocha ripping off clients can be found here where Yardena Mayo, who sued the Israeli Ministry of Defense for monetary pension rights.  The lawyer demanded he receive the equivalent of 10% of all money received by Mrs. Mayo from the Israeli Ministry of Defense for the duration of 10 years.  The case on behalf of Mrs. Mayo never went to court, rather was settled by writing 3 simple letters.  Eli Sammocha's, sued Mrs. Mayo for 27,000 shekels (~ $7,500 USD) for writing the 3 letters.  In this judgement, The courts awarded Eli Samoocha and his cheazy law firm (which includes his sons Yuval Samoocha and Aviv Samoocha) just 1,542 NIS (~ $450).  ( אלי סמוכה נ' ירדנה מאיו ת""א 12447/07 ).  Please use http://Google.com/Translate - to view in any language of your choice.Eli Samoocha was arrested in 2012 for stealing 2 million shekels (~ $550,000 USD) from clients who deposited money into his trust for the sale of property that belonged to a couple who lives overseas.  According to a news article printed in Israel's largest newspaper Yidiot Achronot, Samocha admitted to police investigators he had taken the money - and claimed his ex-wife of 25 years (who subsequently left him for another man) had her sons (Yuval and Aviv Samoocha who are also lawyers in Eli Samocha's law firm) steal the money from him.  No charges against the ex-wife we're filed as the sons deny they or their mother were involved with Eli Samoocha's criminal actions.  In a crazy twist, after cheating on him, Samoocha took back his ex-wife, and later finally divorced her for good. The Israeli Bar Association is currently investingating Mr. Samoocha's activities, and is expected to suspend his license to practice law.  Clients should be warned from using the law practices of Eli Samoocha as he lacks morality, ethics, and is nothing more than a common thief.

At that point Ms. Leonard said she had done everything I had paid her to do. So I contacted her boss, with a copy of the email from Ms. Leonard stating she would handle the custody issue, then the boss had Ms. Leonard call me and she ""promised"" she would ""try"" to help.  During her trying to help me, she would tell me ""she didn't hear from my ex"" or she ""had been in contact with my ex several times"" ?? I was very confused.  When I asked Ms. Leonard what my ex wanted from me to return my child, she didn't know.  I  ""feel"" Ms. Leonard was not trying to help me at all and was actually retaliating against me for calling her boss.   When  I finally insisted on a answer, miracuallsouslly my ex who wouldn't call her back, called within a few minutes. After all of this, Ms. Leonard actually said she would get the agreement signed by a judge if I paid her more money -- mone I had already paid her to do this same thing 3 weeks earlier.  Of course I was not about the pay her any more money. I ""felt"" I was in a bait and switch scam since she promised to do something, then wanted more money to do it.  She definately was not prepared when we went to court, and although I paid her 3 times what all other attorneys wanted for just the 50B and I had it in writing that she was suppose to handle the custody issue, she said I didn't pay her to handle that.  I lost 2 weeks waiting for Ms. Leonard to get my child back and I could say alot more about all the things that happened, but I hope this is enought for others to see what kind of lawyer she is.  I definately would never recommend her to anyone.     ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

After doing some research online I found all these complaints about FG&G and their shady collection practices.  So at this point, we’re out $1600+ but you damn well better bet everyone who I can tell will know of these crooks!

I paid them $565.00 to fill out the forms, file with the court and serve 4 defendants. I had problems right after I paid them. Roxy and Elizabeth informed me that my forms were mailed to the court, 2 weeks later I still do not have the forms. I call several times and after I pay them they no longer answer their phone. They send me an unproffessional email stating that they can not control the courts. I decided to take a day off from work to go to the court and investigate my case. I was informed by the court clerk that they did not have a record of my filings.  I contacted Roxy and Elizabeth, I could only leave messages which I did. I received an email that they had their filler go to the court house and the court lost the papers. It did not sound right but I let it go. In the same email they informed me that they mailed the forms again. I thought this was strange because if their filler was at the court then why did they not file the papers that day but once again I tried to believe them. I also asked them why they did not efile, no answer from either of them. I did receive the court papers soon after that email. I then asked them when they were going to serve the defendants. Their comment was, do not worry, we have plent of time. They informed me that the defendants could be served up to 15 days before the trial. Their emails are extemely unproffessional. I then began to realise that this was not a proffessional company. I decided to hire someone else and I did find out that I was supposed to fill out the complaint with the defendant's legal names. Small claims filing never informed me of this, which means if I win a judgment then I need to correct the names before I can obtain my judgment. They are suppossed to know this.  On May 15th, 2014 I receive a notice from the court that the check that Small Claims filing gave them came back as Non Sufficient funds, which meant if I wanted my lawsuit to continue then I needed to pay the filing fee along with a $45.00 charge for a bad check. I went to the court and paid the fee. I contacted Small Claims filing and they refuse to refund me any money and informed me that that was a check that they stopped payment on becuase the court lost the papers. I then asked them for a cancelled check that the court cashed, they have not responded. They blamed everything on me and the court.

 Judge Tracey Yokich ,"  Judge Tracey Yokich  40 N. Main Street Mt.Clemens, Michigan USA ","", ,""," I have been in a custody battle in Macomb County Circuit Court for twelve years.  I have spent over $500,000 on lawyers in those twelve years.  The actions of the lawyers and judges in this Court are unbelievable and horrifying.  My daughter is the one that has suffered for those twelve years.   If you are a FRIEND of the judge, then don't worry about it, you get her decision in your favor. The first judge on our case was Antonio Viviano, yes, who definitely made mistakes, and kept stating, ""you two just need to get along"", as an excuse and an 'out' for not paying attention to what was really going on before you get to court.  Judge Viviano's daughter, Kathyrn Viviano, was the judge that received her father's docket when he retired.  Judge Kathyrn Viviano recused herself from our case from the start.  The entire bench already was aware of what type of case it was.  Judge Viviano's clerk, Rhonda Esler, was one of the defendants in a lawsuit filed, because Rhonda Esler had stricken Judge Viviano's signature OFF an Order regarding school issues with my daughter. Right before Judge Antonio Viviano's retirement, a Motion had gone to Judge Chrzanowski, due to Judge Viviano's absence, in which an Order was changed or adjusted in the best interest of my daugther.  Judge Viviano was so angry when he found out, that there was a argument between the two judges.  (Details will be on website)  Soon after that, Judge Chrzanowski also recused herself. Our case was then sent to Judge Tracey Yokich.  I have ALWAYS had my daughter's education a priority.  Plain and simple, my ex was fighting me on Grosse Pointe Schools -v- St. Clair Shores schools from kindergarten on.  I had my daughter attending pre-K for two years before kindergarten, and her father fought that also.  That, in and of itself, has been a horrible, horrible battle from my daughter's father that should never, ever be an issue.  In an attempt to keep it from being a personal issue or contest with my ex, I volunteered to have our daughter attend a private school, which I would pay for from day one to graduation, volunteering to sign an Order that I would do so.  My daughter's father fought me on that.  His attorney, Lori Finazzo, is a very good friend of Judge Tracey Yokich's.  Ms. Finazzo was representing my ex at that time.  She is no longer representing him, because she is now suing him for payment of her fees.  Judge Tracey Yokich had the issue of my daughter's educational advances drag on for two and a half years.  The first delay caused my daughter to lose her spot at that private school.  Then we had to start the testing and interview process again for the next school year.  My daughter did wonderful, scored very high, and also received two scholarships.  My ex still REFUSED to agree, and took us back to court in front of Judge Tracey Yokich, because he had gotten away with it before, so he knew he would again.  He was still being represented by Judge Yokich's friend, Lori Finazzo, at this time.  My attorney and I brought up and presented every single piece of evidence of the advantages of the private school for our daughter, had testimony by two Ph.D's regarding the importance and advantages of the education she would receive, and many, many documents of our daughter's intelligence level. Instead of agreeing that it would be in the best interest of our daughter, Judge Tracey Yokich turned it into a continued personal battle and attack on me personally, and did NOT CARE what it would do to our daughter.  Judge Yokich's opinion was that she wanted me to PROVE that I could pay for the next six years of school, not taking into consideration that my daughter had already received two scholarships for the sixth grade level, and that there was documentation and opinions by the Ph.D's that she has the intelligence level to possibly receive full scholarships.  At that time, I had already spent six years of tuition on attorneys, but also had two trusts regarding my daughter's education.  That still wasn't enough for Judge Yokich.  We returned back to court in a refiling of the Original Motion, with even additional documentation, and Judge Yokich still denied it, and spent more time attacking me personally again, making personal opinions about me on the record.  I have ordered and paid for each and every transcript that has come out of those courtrooms.  (This information will be available on the website) Having to explain to my daughter that she is unable to start school this year at the school she wants to attend, is a horrible thing to have to do.  With the intelligence level and IQ of my daughter, there is no need to have to explain exactly WHY.  She knows WHY.  She knows her own father was fighting against her mother more than he cared about her education.  All Judge Yokich had to do was see through the lies and bull from my ex, her friend's client, and do what was best for our daughter, but she didn't.  There are other avenues to take, and I will, but it's being done as a little girl is put through such an emotional state by a Circuit Court Judge's inablilty to know or do what is best for a child, unless you are her friend, or represented by a friend of hers.  I was a court reporter for 22 years before my accident.  The very father who has done this to his child, with the help of his friends, Judge Tracey Yokich, and her friend, Lori Finazzo, was the catalyst, and yet neither have the ability or knowledge, and definitely do not care, to see what is being done to my daughter.  MAYBE Lori Finazzo should remove her children from the private school they attend, since she felt it was in my daughter's best interest to agree to FIGHT against her client's and my daughter attending private school!!!  MAYBE Judge Yokich should get married and have children of her own before she is allowed or given the ability to make such decisions in someone else's child's life!!! (My website will be up soon with the entire truth) ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

 Cullen Weston Pines & Bach ,"  Cullen Weston Pines & Bach  122 West Washington Avenue Madison, Wisconsin USA ",http://www.cwpb.com/, (608) 251-0101,""," Get involved with the law firm ""Cullen Weston Pines & Bach"" at your own expense. Timothy D. Edwards of Cullen Weston Pines & Bach is dirty, immoral, incompetent, and brainless lawyer which is actually turning out to work in my favor because someone who has sued me is being represented by him. It almost seems as though they work against their own clients.  A UW-Whitewater teacher is suing me over $900 because get this... she doesn't like that I described her as ""condescending,"" ""demeaning,"" ""degrading,"" ""insulting,"" ""verbally attacking"" in my Internet reviews of her, which I did because of her glaring behaviors towards me all spring semester 2013. Apparently, lawyer Timothy Edwards of Cullen Weston Pines & Bach thinks this is an actionable case and has taken it on for the teacher.  In taking on this lawsuit, Timothy Edward's first act of incompetence was incriminating himself and his client. In late November 2013, Edwards falsely accused me of ""threatening the teacher's life"" through an online review that I made of this teacher and that for this reason I needed to take all my reviews offline. I called the lawyer on his nonsense, stating that the review in and of itself would be hard evidence that he and the teacher are lying as all my review does is recount specified instances of misconduct from this teacher. Mr. Edwards was very quick to apologize, urging me to consider it an understandable mistake. Mind you, this entire correspondence was through e-mail so unfortunately for this law firm it's all verifiable. Boy, that's sure going to make the law firm, Timothy Edwards, and this teacher look really good when I present this all this to the courts.  I accepted Timothy Edward's apology for the false reports and slander--despite the fact that the lawyer never stated anything about going back to authorities and correcting these false reports he made against me (that the teacher was also in on according to him, who also never corrected the false reports). And despite my accepting his apology, Edwards wasn't done there. He took a new approach to get me to take down my online reviews of the teacher, focusing on how my reviews still needed to come down because they're ""disparaging,"" otherwise legal action would follow. When I refused, Timothy Edwards and the teacher went ahead with their lawsuit to be handled in September 2014 for a ludicrous $900 included with an expectation that I pay all their legal fees.  Since filing the lawsuit, Mr. Edwards has been harassing me, sending letters to my place of residence, demanding that I give him all the evidence that I will be using against them in court; demanding that I release a bunch of irrelevant information on my background, nothing to even do with the case; demanding that I release personal information (home addresses, numbers, etc.) of ""every single person"" who I've ever spoken to about the teacher and without their consent; etc. Friends and family who I've complained about this teacher to have gladly agreed to report this lawyer over to law enforcement for harassment and violation of their privacy. I've found all this harassment from Timothy Edwards to be shocking considering I have an actionable case against him for false reports and slander with evidence of this through e-mails. Because of all the harassment from Mr. Edwards following his apology, I have now informed Cullen Weston Pines & Bach that if they do not redress his false reports, slander, harassment and malicious prosecution that I will be pursuing their entire firm with a lawsuit. I am now awaiting a reply from this law firm. Thanks to the law firm incriminating their client, I now also have a claim against the teacher for slander as well that I will be reporting to her with.  At the end of the day, I am glad that the teacher/plaintiff chose this firm since it seems to be working against her rather than for her. The lawyer has not only incriminated himself but his client as well by stating that she was in on these false reports made to authorities. Again, best of all, this correspondence was all through e-mail so I have proof against Cullen Weston Pines & Bach and a case against them and the teacher.

They are Yervand Arzakanyan, Chad Pratt, Deepak Sadashiv Parwatikar & others like them from this establishment. Here you go folks I am exposing the Pirates Lair if your are looking for information on any of the above keep on reading. The Pirates have plundered and pillaged for years and stolen countless amounts of money from consumers. I tuned-up my “Pirate Tracking Software” which does a specific search criteria for tracking Pirates and where and how they hide their names and booty. Real Estate Law Center PC in Los AngelesCalifornia is a registered corporation in California and is active and was registered on 8/18/2011. You can verify this and search for them at the California  Secretary of State website here: http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/ with their Entity Number of C3406727 make sure you select entity number for your search or search by their business name. OK. Here is where it gets interesting on the trail for the Pirates. After I locked the radar on to the Pirate Ship I traced the SS Crook’s stealthy Course I found their Agent For Service of Process is C.T. Corporation System with their jurisdiction in the State of Delaware and they have an address in New York City, Eighth Ave on the 13th floor. They are registered in the State of California, Secretary of State and their Entity Number is: C0168406 and is active. Here are some interesting facts; their incorporation date was 9/11/1936 and the listed Type is Foreign Stock. What is really interesting is there are 206 Companies with the same address in that building! Read further, it’s only the beginning! As we unlock the stealthy course of the SS Crook we find we have to go all the way back to Sacramento California. Why? I found their Agent For Service of Process for C.T. Corporation System from New York City is The Corporation Company, 555 Capitol Mall in Sacramento California, however they also show an address of 1232 Q Street first floor, Sacramento, CA 95814. As I was tracking the Pirates the radar blips were lighting up the entire screen! Alarm Bells were sounding with no less than 107,342 Entities Registered to The Corporation Company and most of those have a different Agent For Service of Process with a status mixture of Suspended, Surrendered, Dissolved, Forfeited, Merged Out and some showing Active. One name finally pops up, Richard F. Flynn, President, CEO, Director, Chairman/CEO, and Head Guy of aprox 300 Corporations. With addresses listed for C.T. Corporate System on Eighth Ave, 13 Floor in New York City. Richard F. Flynn also is listed in other addresses for other Corporations. It seems as though Mr. Flynn is some sort of a Broker to register Corporations and is most likely not responsible for the Real Estate Law Center PC. So who is? Good question, read on. That’s how they burry themselves check this next website and they tell you basically how to hide and not be responsible for your corporation. The Corporation Company has this website here at incorporate dot com. https://www.incorporate.com/?iq_id=46208064&utm_medium=ppc&utm_term=46208064&utm_source=msn&cid=46208064&campaign=ppc Now lets talk about Yervand Arzakanyan the new General Manager of the Real Estate Law Center PC. As I stated in a previous posting Yervand Arzakanyan is not a Lawyer, not a Real Estate Agent or Broker but a used car salesman from North Hollywood! Yervand Arzakanyans name pops up several places, a bogus website at yamg.com and another at autohighway.com where he is listed as President & CEO. The big problem is he has an association with the following: http://www.balancedlegalgroup.com/ which is another loan modification law group. Sounds fishy to me and here is why. They are not a corporation and nothing has been filed with the State of California. They are located in Los AngelesCalifornia. What is really interesting is the fact that Deepak Parwatikar is listed as the contact attorney. Deepak Parwatikar has had extensive disciplinary action by the State Bar of California starting in 2004, he has been suspended from practicing law at one point. Deepak Sadashiv Parwatikar State Bar #187683, was the principal with the Real Estate Law Center along with Chad Pratt, both fellow Pirates. There are 51 complaints against Deepak Sadashiv Parwatikar, Chad Pratt and the Real Estate Law Center PC for fraud against consumers that you can view at the rip off report dot com. They have a record of fraud complaints they have a history of taking peoples money and doing nothing. There are also numerous reports from other complaint sites on the Internet.

Arzakanyan has no real estate license in any state, is not a lawyer and has a history of selling used cars. I think he goes by the nickname of “Slick.” Check him out with a Google search and check him in linkedin also and see who his buddies are, crooks like Chad Pratt and other scammers at the real estate law center pc, also check his face book page. It is obvious now since Pratt was busted and is on trial by the Ca State Bar on NUMEROUS CHARGES of misconduct and a lot more. These Pirates have been scamming people out of millions of dollars for several years with other firms they worked for with no track record of doing anything but take peoples money. It looks like the Pirate Ship is manned by a bunch of Lame Duck Lawyers who’s Cannons Are Getting Limpy. They all are going to go down with the Pirate Ship and hopefully there will be some money refunded to us by the State Bar which has a fund for that against crooked lawyers. There Pirate Booty consists of BMW’s, Mercedes, property in North Hollywood and other cities along with other numerous toys! Do some research, they have a toy trail, just poke around, it’s all public record. When the California State Bar is done with these frauds I am going to sue each and every one of them for whatever I can and for whatever punitive damages I will be awarded. They don’t deserve fancy automobiles, property or toys bought with the money they stole from us. If any of you folks want to see justice served and make sure they get what they deserve, SUE THEM, SUE THEM RIGHT OUT ONTO THE STREET, destitute without so much as a back seat from a Mercedes to sleep on and let them eat out of the dumpsters behind the all you can eat buffet’s. They certainly don’t have any problem with people they stole money from having to do that very same thing. While they are living “High On The Hog” the people they stole from are “living in the gutter.” I am a disabled Vet and when I get kicked out of my house I’m heading down to Southern California in my walker followed by the News Media, “Tweeting All The Way” to Yervand Arzakanyan’s house to squat in his front yard. What do you think Mr. Arzakanyan, do you think that will make CNN? FOX? ABC? NBC? CBS? How about a youtube video going viral? You can read about it right here in the Rip Off Report! If any of you folks want to join me, well, grab Old Glory, your canes, walkers, wheelchairs, scooters or shopping carts and join the posy. It’s about time these pirates are made to “Walk Their Own Plank” like they did to many unsuspecting homeowners. It’s about time this kind of fraud is exposed and stopped.   ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Everytime I made a payment, in his office, with cash, I made sure I got a reciept.  I always paid it to his receptionist (later I learned was his wife).  When my payments reached $500 I reminded him of our agreement, but he did nothing. I continued paying because I needed to get my divorce dealt with.  I was thinking he was filling out forms or something to prepare my case.  When I had reached $800 in payments Mr. Foyil had nothing started or filed or anything and my divorce was pressing me to take action. When I called his office his wife denied the payments I had made.  In tears I took all my receipts into his office and she told me, ""Oh, I'm sorry it must have been a computer glitch.""  Still nothing was started.  I had landed a good  job and couldn't keep going out to his office, so I would leave him phone messages and emails that were never answered. His secretary (wife), I believe, emailed me back with some advice, but nothing else.  I know it wasn't Mr. Foyil that emailed me.  Then I received some documents for my divorce in the mail from his office.  It looked like I had to fill out the documents and file them myself, I was clueless, I've never done anything like that before that is why I had hired Mr. Foyil. Then he or whomever had been responding to my emails stopped responding. He was never there when I would call and he never returned my messages.  I stopped making payments, but I had already submitted $800.  I took off $200 for the emails and the documents mailed to me to come up with $600 that I received absolutely nothing for, absolutely nothing.  I wish Mr. Foyil knew how hard it had been on my kids and myself to make those payments to him that he simply kept.  I lost my home, $600 and we went without necessities for many months.  Thanks for nothing but more hardship Mr. Foyil.

My step-daughter is going through a divorce at the moment after nine years of marriage, and needless-to-say it's a very rough time for her. After a consultation, Moskowitz seemed like a compassionate fellow that is only willing to help a broken family. We got sucked in: hook, line, and sinker. Moskowitz gave me a brief summary of how he charged his clients. Promising my step-daughter justice and what he described as ""everything she deserves"", Moskowitz charged us an up-front fee of almost $11,000. It took about six weeks before we got a phone call from Moskowitz saying that he needed another $4,000. Confused and shocked, I demanded to know what the $4,000 was for. To make a long story short, he essentially said that we had depleted the initial $11,000 due to court appearances, making phone calls to him, etc. [continued below]....																			..... I'm not going to give any details away regarding our daughter's case, but let's just say we were disappointed. Moskowitz was literally embarassed in the courtroom, as we were shocked with the judgment. My daughter made a phone call to Moskowitz afterward in obvious emotional distress. Moskowitz, as arrogant as ever, acted like he's Tom Cruise in ""A Few Good Men"", convinced my daughter into making an appeal. Helpless, she agreed to his instructions that would cost me yet another $6,000. Now $20,000 in the hole, nothing to this point had been accomplished. Phone calls to Moskowitz remained rare, as he charges up to $150 per phone call! These phones calls, might I add, in which he was RUDE and arrogant the entire time, as if he didn't have the time to deal with us. Phone calls in which that we were only left with even more questions! Finally, I got on the phone with him myself to get things straight. We had several lingering questions, no clue in which direction the case was headed, and I personally wanted to know just exactly my money had gone towards thus far. Once again, acting like Tom Cruise from ""A Few Good Men"", however sounding more like Rick Moranis from ""Ghostbusters 2"", (I had even wondered at this point if he was drunk even though it was noon), I had decided to part ways with this clown. He advised it's a ""mistake"" to part ways with him at this time. However, that just ensured that I was making the right decision. Brian Moskowitz is a CROOK. Thief, degenerate, and con-artist can all be used to describe this low-life. It cost me over $20,000 to find that out. His self-proclaimed ""Best Catch"" on his website is an absolute joke. His name should be Saul Goodman from ""Breaking Bad"". I'm hoping this post will help other struggling families' decisions when hiring an attorney. It's hard to find the help and care you need in this time of struggle, and I promise Brian Moskowitz is NOT the man for the job. Good luck. ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

They wouldnt explain anything else i told them i was on my way but the supervisor said that wouldnt be neccary they would be with my kids for several hours investigating and questiong them . Come to find out all this happend because of a physical altercation that happened at there fathers house that weekend. A friend of mine who worked in the legal field adviced me that once cps got there evil claws on my kids it could become impossible for me to regain control { he was erraly correct} he adviced me to call them back and tell them i had a layer and i expected to be able to immediatly pick my kids up. After doing just that i was shocked at how fast when i mentioned i had a attorney that they told me to come get my kids. I set out for the 30 min drive it would take me to reach this county that none of us resided in. Once getting there and my kids being released to me i asked my sister to take my kids to the car so i could find out more information on what had happened at my ex husbands. After they were safe in the car the supervisor was very short and rude demanding i give her my lawyers name and phone number. I explained to her that i didnt have a attorney yet that a friend had given me the advice. That changed everything for me forever. Im in tears as i write this. She demanded my kids back out of the car when i resisted she called the POLICE and took my kids they told me i had 10 minitues to get out of there are i would be arrested!!! I still today cant believe this....After this i was appointed a public defender whos office was right next to cps im sure they would lunch togather they were very friendly with each other and there common agenda was me and breaking me down His name was Jason Dunn he told me that they were denying ever releasing my kids i told him couldnt her get the police report he responded im not here to fight for you only to advice you of your rights and that what ever cps wanted me to do the judge would back them up. What did i ever do in the first place?? The constructed a very lengthy list of classes that would take me well into the next year to complete and had me to sign this agreement.

They requested that i showed up to visit 2 hours early and then told me at the last minute she had forgotten my kids wasnt there they were on vacation!! Lauren Butcher never scheduled all of the classes i was to attend. She lyed in court she made it her misson to make me pay for lying about the attorney...she refused my aunt to take my kids because of dog poop in the back yard. YOu may be asking your self how this is possible im still wonderign the same thing. I had 12 months to complete this assesment on the 11 month without me being notified they called a court hearing and had my rights completly termenated!! And my kids in a very fast pace were adopted..How could the adoption be so fast it makes me wonder if it wasnt one of them are someone they had a intrest in adopting my kids. I found out yesterday they went as far as to change there FIRST names. HOw is this not mental abuse? Recently Greenville cps made the news in the alicia moore case. The very lady who i had the argument with about me having a attorney well her and 2 other cps employes were arrested and charged with Falsyfing documents,, illegal search and seizure and a charge called oppresion in more then one case. I dont know why when this was found out they didnt investigate every case she had worked on...and giving us our kids back. Even now they are allowing one of my other children who wasnt taken to stay in the care of a registered sex offender...This may all sound crazy and unbelievable but i challenge anyone to take a close look at my case and tell me anything else then what i said happened. I pray that soon lauren butcher and whoever else in the office that is corrupt will be removed and punished for this evil they have done. if that doestn happen in this lifetime it will in the next MOmma loves you both more then live Matthew and Chadsity Bennetthttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=376781115687306&set=t.100001412537926&type=3&src=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent-b-lga.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fhphotos-prn1%2Ft1.0-9%2F540219_376781115687306_1830351918_n.jpg&size=720%2C430https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=140991435957940&set=t.100001412537926&type=3&src=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent-b-lga.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fhphotos-frc3%2Ft1.0-9%2F165388_140991435957940_3903740_n.jpg&size=640%2C471 ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

You assume that the terms and conditions relate only to the service for which you have agreed to purchase but that is not the case.  Mentioned somewhere in lengthy terms is an entirely separate service to act as the Registered Agent for the company you have formed.

They did not wait until I recived any articles of incorporation at that time you will have made to installments on your agreement. They send an email notification reminding you when your upcoming installment payments are about to post to your account. They conveniently NEVER mention the $159 extra service fee for the registered agent service because then you may question and cancel it.  You never receive an email about the impending charge. They simply debit your account for the full amount and wait for you to call to hear that it was not included and that when you accepted the terms and conditions you authorized payment for the service.

Ste 210 Bingham Farms, Michigan USA ",www.firstamericanmitigators.com, 248-809-4980,""," I will never forget the day I walked into this office full of fear of being thrown out of my house by my mortgage company. i had tried on my own to do a mortgage modification, but i found the entire process extremely anxiety producing and overwhelming. The paperwork was confusing and there was no one available to help. As it was I was limited on my financial resources. All i had left to my name after losing my job was $2500. On Christmas eve morning, I received a packet in my mail about how to move out of my house from my bank. I was devistated and got online and located this company. I never expected to hear from them on Christmas Eve. Day morning but an attorney actually called me back. His name was Gilber Borman. WoW, I was so impressed that he actually called me on Christmas Eve Day, I thought wow this guy is truely invested in helping other, Little did I know that a simple phone call that day would ripp me off of the last $2500.00 that I had. He put me in touch with Micheal Rountree and they set me up for a meeting appointment on Dec. 26th, 2011 the day after Christmas. Mr. Borman told me, ""enjoy your Christmas, we will see you Monday and fix everythign"". At that meeting I was an emotional basket case and would have done anything they needed me to do to save my house keeping me from becoming homeless. The process went like this, they asked me to sign so many documents i cant even tell you a number. I read them but knew that I had to sign them in order for these people to help me. I provided them with any information they asked me for. I was assigned a ""case manager' who only complained about how overwhelmed she was to the point that I was intimidated about contacting her. Each and every time she told me "" you dont need to contact me, if I need anything from you or if anything changes I will email you or you will receive a letter in the mail"". They told me if you find a job and /or get the money to make your house payments ""don't do it"". I was instructed not to make any house payments even if I can because I needed to be 2 house payments behind to stay in the modification process and 3 or more to be forclosed. i was lucky enough to find a job and i kept calling them about the forgiveness program because all i wanted to do was get back on track, make my house payments and move on. However they insisted I would mess everything up if I started paying for my house. Finally, one day when i arrived home from my job i received a letter in the mail that my loan modification has been denied. It was not from Ms. Franklin, it was from my mortgage company. I was devistated. The decision had been made several months before and this letter was informing me that i was going to recieve forclosure documents. I tried to call Ms. Franklin she never was available, I finally sent her an email and she called me telling me she sent me a letter in the mail. I never received anythign from her. I never received a letter that my mortgage modification was denied. How can that happen? I asked her to send me a copy, she promptlyl stated, ""  your case has been closed and I dont even have your file its in the basement"". In the basement? I asked her to send me a copy, I deserve that I never received another letter, a copy of her letter. Nothing. I called to discuss the money I paid to them because I wanted it back to use it to pay a portion of my house payments and keep my house. No one ever returned my call. This was by far the worst experience I have ever had and I am suppose to believe that an attorney is suppose to help me? IF anyone has ever received any help from them I owuld be shocked. I doubt they will ever do the right thing and return my money to me. However, i can only hope that anyone who is considering using this company or any other company like them will go online to the State of Michigan website and look up mortgage help. The State of Michigan has a program where they help people who are in my situation. Unfortuantely for me because this entire process with this company took so long (almost like they know if they run out the time, it works to thier advantage) that it made me not eligible for the State of Michigan to help me either.

My dad and myself were loaning my brother money to pay this crooked lawyer and she took all of my 87 year old dads life savings. We all were appalled at her performance, especially the amount she kept on charging us and always showed up unprepared. The judge even asked her  where she got her education as she seemed to always upset him. When my brother finally decided to take the plea bargain, we thought that would be the end of the night mare. A day later, my dad received a final bill from this crook that almost sent us all into cardiac arrest. It was outrageous and we realized that this couldn't be normal. It lead my brother to the only thing he could do to save his house and filed bankruptcy as she was threatening to take it. After the bankruptcy, she even had the nerve to take my brothers inheritance that has been handed down since my ancestors came over on a ship. Now, I can't even believe this, she is going for my dad. Two weeks ago she issued my 87 yr old dad a summons for a ridiculous amount of money. We have no more to give.

Jim Black refused to investigate the State's only alleged Witness-Victim, an Impersonator, who falsely accused me of Assault, and of using “The N Word” when I donated two items to a still-unknown employee at Goodwill Industries. She was serving a community service sentence at GW for a drug conviction. She was intoxicated on hard, illegal narcotics, and didn't feel like doing any work. The Impersonator is a manager at GW. This case was all about the Black Mafia and Black politics. GW appears to traffic in drugs, and to bribe officials. GW submitted a fake, re-enacted video of the Scene to the Court, and destroyed the official surveillance video. GW stonewalled me, all the way, as did the corrupt Apex, NC cops. The Apex Police Chief retired early, soon afterward. He repeatedly refused to resign when I fired him. It took me three 130-mile trips to Court to fire him. He argued against me each time, stating that I was a crazy conspiracy theorist because I had fired three preceding Attorneys, none of whom would investigate the Impersonator-Perjuror. Such delayed my Case by about six months. I stayed in NC only to defend myself in this Case. The Case took two years, sixteen trips to court, and 20 trips to Raleigh, total. I moved out of the State, soon afterward. He ordered a psychological evaluation of me, even though three preceding Attorneys, fourteen Judges, and two ADAs did not see such a need. He lied to me by stating that the ADA wanted it. He made the Order to curry favor with the ADA. It took me nine days to write a nine-page description of facts and arguments for the shrink, plus another 138-mile trip to Raleigh. Jim never stated a reason for such an evaluation. A negative evaluation could have hurt my Case. If the shrink had concluded that I was not fit to stand trial, I would never be able to get a job, apartment, gun permit, or insurance, etc. And I would have been sent to a mental hospital, and forced to take drugs. The shrink found me sane, and fit to stand trial. He did a background check on me to find dirt on me that the Court couldn't find. Any dirt would escalate any sentence I would get. He talked to me about traffic tickets he found. He accepted my Case from the Public Defender's Office, even though his specialty was, and is, DUI cases. Therefore, he had a conflict of interest, never mind the inappropriate assignment, both of which he failed to disclose to me. He used me to curry favor with the ADA in my Assault Case to get brownie points for his DUI cases, his bread and butter. He even smirked at the ADA every time he handed my thick, 250-page file (95% written by me, between Attorneys, because my Attorneys failed to defend me) to the ADA. The smirk underscored his Allegation in Court that I was a crazy conspiracy theorist. He failed to reply to about 75% of the questions I wrote to him. He pretended that he never received some of my e-mail. How does an Attorney receive only some of a client's e-mail? Apparently, he doesn't know the laws about archiving e-mail.

When he was forced to leave the country I was eight and my sister was three. all of this becomes relevant later: My mother contacted David Lashgari with haste after my father's imprisonment. His name was the first Farsi name she'd find in the yellow pages and she was absolutely certain he'd help. I admit, I too fell for his lies. Every time I'd go to his office he'd tell me in the most genuine voice that everything was going to be okay, that my father was coming right back home. Needless to say this wasn't the case.  David Lashgari made my mother pay $5,000 upfront, $5,000 before he filed any documents and two payments of $3,000 each(one of these payments were taken WITHOUT her permission) during the process. Money wasn't the issue, the issue was bringing my father back home.  He never came back. After a year in prison he decided he was just going to go back to his country and await to see what would happen in GA. Well, because he and my mother were not legally married we lost everything in his name after he left. Her car, our houses, the business, even his bank accounts all untouchable. We lost it all. We went from one of the most healthiest families I'd ever have the pleasure to have known to nothing. My mom trying her hardest to recover from depression after she knew it was time to move on after we found out we were losing the house. Life for me was not easy either.

I have to deal with a teenage daughter(my sister) whom I never asked for because my mother has grown too tired to handle this by herself. However, I do not pity myself. I pity David Lashgari. I thought perhaps we were the only family screwed by him. That maybe after the fact he'd feel guilty and would not repeat these actions. For a person to literally send a healthy family through turmoil, self-destruction and homelessness and not feel an ounce of guilt, I cannot help but to pity him.   As im now 21 and working full time, I can file to bring my father back home. My whole life I've been preparing for this moment and I'm almost happy I've been able to go through so much distraught to make me a better person. So thanks, Lashgari.

I was contacted by one of the sales wolves that they employ that are only out for your money. I specifically asked if this was going to be a loan modification- and they said No! It was litigation and they were sure that I could win- well, the exact opposite happened, I did not win anything and I ended up losing my home- they could not even secure a loan modification for me at the very least. The home I've lived in for twetnty five years. When I tried contacting them about getting my money back for the horrible mess they put me in- no response and they were ignoring me.

Had an approved return July 2012 but when we did not receive it - we contacted them and was told that their accounts were ""frozen"" from other customers wanting returns and getting their credit card companies involved. We were asked to work with them to get us paid back. THEY proposed paying $500/month + finance charges on our credit card until the full amount was paid back. They did as they promised for a few months and then stopped. When we called asking what happened, we were told that funds were short and some accounts were still frozen but they were expecting to pay the next month. We continued to hear the same excuse month after month. We called our credit card company to see if they could help. We submitted all the written emails, the approved return paperwork and proposal they suggested to the credit card company. (Yes all in writing.) However,the credit card company said too much time had now passed especially since we were NOT calling it fraud - we just wanted the credit card company to apply pressure on Legally Mine to do the right thing. Legally Mine indicated to the credit card company that they intend to pay, but we continue to NOT receive any payment. I finally reached out again on 2/14/14 to Dave Gibb (who has been the main contact)to find out what the status of the return was. I heard the same excuses. I explained that this ""return"" of my money had turned into an involuntary loan with the best possible terms for THEM (0% interest, pay whenever you want - or maybe never?) I suggested that even a small $100-200/month payment plan would help to restore the broken trust in this relationship and would help to reassure me that they intend to pay as promised. Dave said he understood and would speak with the owners (I assume the McNeffs') at a meeting last friday(2/21). I finally hear today by email the SAME   EXCUSE!!!! They don't have the funds but will put me on some ""priority payment"" list so I should ""hopefully"" receive a payment by the end of April! I am beyond disappointed and frustrated with this company. They just keep telling me to ""be patient"". I believe I have been very patient and have given them more than a reasonable amount of time to simply do what they promised. It amazes me that they are in a service industry - I would assume they are going out and drumming up business which includes a ""no risk"" return policy similar to what I signed up for and yet they continue to show me through their actions that they do not value their clients! They have made it clear to me that I am not the only one in this situation, so if everyone else who had a return processed by them is having the same experience as I am than how is it possible for them to have an ""A"" rating with the BBB? I also contacted the BBB about this.  I have requested through the BBB that Legally Mine honor their promise to refund our money. I would like the FULL amount of $3000.00. I'm being VERY generous about ""forgetting"" the promise to pay the finance charges even though our credit card company does not take us being ""short on funds"" as a viable excuse not to pay this month! I was being patient by agreeing to a payment plan, but due to the lack of integrity they have demonstrated I no longer believe them. I will update this report accordingly.

I called RAB Performance, Mary Elliott's collection agency,  explained that they had processed someones paperwork, incorrectly entering the social security number of that person (this is exactly what the Treasury Dept. told me - even gave me her phone number) probably transposing numbers AND TURNED IT INTO MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER!!  Hence the State of Michigan was holding my tax refund until the mistake was corrected. Their response was ' sorry, unless you disclose your full social security number to us we can do nothing about this ' !! Even hung up one me. I'm 65, disabled, living on a fixed income.  I have paid my own way through my entire life, have never missed a payment nor been late with one,  and now, because of an inept collection agency/attorney, I am going to pay for someone who chose to live their life differently than I did.  I could give them my SS number but I am not comfortable doing that, nor do I think that I HAVE to.  It would probably cost me a whole lot more in the end than my tax refund.   ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

He had even made up all kinds of ridiculous lies about me Iin attempt to cover up the fact that he was having an affair.   I was actually happier about getting divorced from the lying wimp than about marrying him and he knew it so he played dirty throughout the divorce.  He dared to phone my mother's house looking for me the night before the hearing and on the day of the hearing he kept asking why I had been phoning for him!  The satanic midget tried to keep me from getting spousal support but fortunately not all members of the marine corp are lying jack asses that encourage adultry and cover up for those that are guilty of commiting it or spousal abuse.  When the satanic midget asked if we could speak alone, my response was ""Only if he's honest for a change"" and his attorney was dumb enough to respond to me with ""Don't say that...."" while my so called attorney, Mark Bastardini just sat there with a stupid look on his face when he should have defended me! When I phoned Bastardini days later, he copped a nasty attitude toward me and had the audacity to threaten to fire me!!!  I made the mistake of paying him a portion of his fee but when he continued to have a nasty attitude toward me and I refused to do business with him.   I also told off the attorney of the satanic midget.  When I spoke with Neil Morse about the manner, he claimed he wouldn't tell Mark how to do his job which is really theirbwayb of saying they don't respect ethnic people.  It's a damn good thing I didn't have $500 at the time to give that law firm just so they could screw me over.  If you are Asian, Black, Latin or Indian Do NOT do business with morse, morse & morse!!!

They told me that I would be getting credit report from Trans Union and Expierien .

Mr. Sobel went on to say that he knows “…how frustrating it is to be effected at work and limited in my regular daily activities, so I am happy to be able to help guide my injured clients through their recoveries.”Eric Pintaluga, one of the founding partners, echoed Mr. Sobel’s enthusiasm, stating, “I have a responsibility and a duty to make sure the clients’ rights are protected when they’re injured in an accident.”The information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Louis Mosca during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..Kanner & Pintaluga is an accident injury law firm with offices in multiple states. “We provide aggressive legal representation for people injured in an accident. We strive to make sure our clients recover physically from whatever medical care they need and ultimately receive the maximum compensation for their medical bills, pain and suffering,” states Kevin Sobel, a representative of the company. “We are licensed in numerous states and we have a track record of success. I, myself, am licensed to practice in GA, FL, MA and MN. We have no bar issues and thousands of satisfied customers,” he explains. Leads are typically acquired through telephone, radio and internet advertising, as well as referrals from current and past clients.The sales process typically involves an office associate receiving a phone call from a potential client who is interested in retaining the services of the law firm. The representative will discuss the details of the case and the process with the client to determine the next step. “We like to hold the client’s hand through the process as much as possible to make sure they receive the care they need and receive as much money as possible,” explains Mr. Sobel. The associates at Kanner & Pintaluga strive to be very hands-on with their clients, keeping a detailed file for each client, documenting every step in the case. “I personally touch every file that comes into my office,” states Mr. Sobel. The law firm is also entirely paperless, which allows them the opportunity to work with their clients from anywhere. “The phones are open 24/7. I answer e-mails any time I’m awake. We really try to help our clients get through a difficult time,” states Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. Client Care & Complaint Resolution At times, clients may not feel satisfied with the services they received. “The frequent complaint we get from clients is either they didn’t get enough money, or didn’t get money quick enough. Unfortunately, this is going to happen through no fault of our own,” explains Mr. Sobel. He further explains that this can be caused by a federal or state law that is impacting the case, the amount of medical damages they may have, or simply the facts of the case itself. To try and avoid these issues in the first place, Mr. Sobel and his team strive to educate the clients up-front with regard to what they should expect, what types of damages are covered, and what documentation is needed. After a complaint is resolved, Kanner & Pintaluga make following up with the client a priority. “We always follow up after a complaint. I do take it personally with my business,” states Mr. Sobel. “Happy clients don’t post negative complaints on the internet, so we go out of our way to make sure the customer is well educated on the things we can and cannot control. We follow up and the goal is to see clients pain free and walking away happy.”Mr. Sobel and his team take into consideration the time and money spent by the client, and strive to get the client what they need. “Missing out on a gym membership, lost wages, paying for extra help at home… It’s important that’s clients get compensated for every element of their damages, pain and suffering,” he states. They also strive to keep their clients informed throughout every step of the process, utilizing any form of communication necessary to keep in touch with the client, whether it’s a phone call, e-mail, or text message.In response to complaints lodged against his company on Ripoff Report, Mr. Sobel states, “I would like to point out that a number of the complaints seem fabricated and appear to be posted out of places that I do not work, by named that don’t match any of our clients or past clients’ names. Even still, we address every complaint, no matter how legit or complete.”Since receiving complaints, the team at Kanner & Pintaluga has instituted a property damage department where they can assist clients’ recovery, and they strive to be available to their clients at any time of the day. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. / Senior Managing Attorneys  ""The passion for client advocacy and service is obvious at Kanner & Pintaluga.

Kanner & Pintaluga property damage experts are happy to coordinate damage assessments, rental car services, and more.  The majority of our complaints (besides the fakes ones) are clients wanting more settlement money and/or settlement money faster.

Mr. Sobel went on to say that he knows “…how frustrating it is to be effected at work and limited in my regular daily activities, so I am happy to be able to help guide my injured clients through their recoveries.”Eric Pintaluga, one of the founding partners, echoed Mr. Sobel’s enthusiasm, stating, “I have a responsibility and a duty to make sure the clients’ rights are protected when they’re injured in an accident.”The information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Louis Mosca during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..Kanner & Pintaluga is an accident injury law firm with offices in multiple states. “We provide aggressive legal representation for people injured in an accident. We strive to make sure our clients recover physically from whatever medical care they need and ultimately receive the maximum compensation for their medical bills, pain and suffering,” states Kevin Sobel, a representative of the company. “We are licensed in numerous states and we have a track record of success. I, myself, am licensed to practice in GA, FL, MA and MN. We have no bar issues and thousands of satisfied customers,” he explains. Leads are typically acquired through telephone, radio and internet advertising, as well as referrals from current and past clients.The sales process typically involves an office associate receiving a phone call from a potential client who is interested in retaining the services of the law firm. The representative will discuss the details of the case and the process with the client to determine the next step. “We like to hold the client’s hand through the process as much as possible to make sure they receive the care they need and receive as much money as possible,” explains Mr. Sobel. The associates at Kanner & Pintaluga strive to be very hands-on with their clients, keeping a detailed file for each client, documenting every step in the case. “I personally touch every file that comes into my office,” states Mr. Sobel. The law firm is also entirely paperless, which allows them the opportunity to work with their clients from anywhere. “The phones are open 24/7. I answer e-mails any time I’m awake. We really try to help our clients get through a difficult time,” states Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. Client Care & Complaint Resolution At times, clients may not feel satisfied with the services they received. “The frequent complaint we get from clients is either they didn’t get enough money, or didn’t get money quick enough. Unfortunately, this is going to happen through no fault of our own,” explains Mr. Sobel. He further explains that this can be caused by a federal or state law that is impacting the case, the amount of medical damages they may have, or simply the facts of the case itself. To try and avoid these issues in the first place, Mr. Sobel and his team strive to educate the clients up-front with regard to what they should expect, what types of damages are covered, and what documentation is needed. After a complaint is resolved, Kanner & Pintaluga make following up with the client a priority. “We always follow up after a complaint. I do take it personally with my business,” states Mr. Sobel. “Happy clients don’t post negative complaints on the internet, so we go out of our way to make sure the customer is well educated on the things we can and cannot control. We follow up and the goal is to see clients pain free and walking away happy.”Mr. Sobel and his team take into consideration the time and money spent by the client, and strive to get the client what they need. “Missing out on a gym membership, lost wages, paying for extra help at home… It’s important that’s clients get compensated for every element of their damages, pain and suffering,” he states. They also strive to keep their clients informed throughout every step of the process, utilizing any form of communication necessary to keep in touch with the client, whether it’s a phone call, e-mail, or text message.In response to complaints lodged against his company on Ripoff Report, Mr. Sobel states, “I would like to point out that a number of the complaints seem fabricated and appear to be posted out of places that I do not work, by named that don’t match any of our clients or past clients’ names. Even still, we address every complaint, no matter how legit or complete.”Since receiving complaints, the team at Kanner & Pintaluga has instituted a property damage department where they can assist clients’ recovery, and they strive to be available to their clients at any time of the day. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. / Senior Managing Attorneys  ""The passion for client advocacy and service is obvious at Kanner & Pintaluga. Each client's case is overseen by a senior managing attorney, such as Kevin Sobel for the Georgia offices, who assigns an associate attorney and two (2) case managers who are available via email, text, phone and in person, to respond to questions or concerns at every stage of the process. These case managers are knowledgeable about their clients’ cases and use the same methods of communication to keep clients apprised of any developments in their case.Kanner & Pintaluga provides aggressive and effective legal representation to clients throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennesee ando ther states, with the highest standards of excellence, compassion and integrity. K&P is committed to obtaining the maximum compensation to which our clients are entitled. We always provide personalized attention and deliver prompt communication so that our clients always know where their case stands.”STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM YOUR COMPANY NAME. ""In response to client demand, and in an ongoing efforts to help clients in need, Kanner & Pintaluga created an entire new department consisiting of staff that specialize exclusively in handling clients’ property damage claims; property damage services are provided at no cost to clients who have bodily injury cases with the firm. This business move underscores K&P’s goal: allowing clients to focus on getting better while K&P focus on dealing with the responsible party and navigating the intricacies of the case. “We want our clients to use their time and energy towards their recovery. They can’t get better if they don’t get medical attention, and they can’t get to the doctor’s office without some sort of transportation,” said Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga property damage experts are happy to coordinate damage assessments, rental car services, and more.  The majority of our complaints (besides the fakes ones) are clients wanting more settlement money and/or settlement money faster. We combat this by providing as much information as possible up front to the clients, repeatedly by way of letters, emails conference calls, and/or meetings, to set appropriate expectations for how cases work.We work tirelessly for our clients, long days, nights and weekends, to ensure they get what they need. Our phones are answered 24/7 and we respond to emails at all hours. We are entirely paperless and have smart phones, iPads, remote access, etc. so we can work on files and/or update clients from anywhere.”In summary, after our review, which included discussions with Mr. Pintaluga and Mr. Sobel, Ripoff Report is convinced that Kanner & Pintaluga is committed to quality delivery of legal services resulting in the maximum client recovery and satisfaction.Read more about why consumers should feel confident when doing business with a member of Ripoff Report's Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.

 Anthon B Gordon Attorney Lawyer ,"  Anthon B Gordon Attorney Lawyer  5550 Topanga Canyon Blvd # 200 Woodland Hills, California USA ","", ,""," Anthony B. Gordon is, in our experienced opinion, definitely not the kind of lawyer you want defending your case. Aside from robbing his clients with unethically high fees, the man falls asleep in court, we are told. Sometimes, he actually doesn't show up for trial at all. And then he invents some made up story about why he missed trial -- when really he was asleep in his car, likely drinking. ""We are asking for his disbarment -- that's obviously as serious as the discipline gets,"" says John Cocker, a disciplinary attorney. Gordon's bad behavior has been going on for a long time, according his public record of the many clients who have terminated him. He's taken money from his clients, and we think has not done the work, and kept the cash. [continued below]....																			..... In one case, he ignored phone calls from a client with a serious legal problem. It was so bad that the poor man couldn't even keep the details of his own case straight. Gordon didn't even bother to provide the client with his legal file. Act like this for long and pretty soon people start to complain. Since March 2012, the lawyer's board has received or should have received over seven complaints about Gordon. Then this October, Gordon really blew it when he didn't bother to show up to his office to prepare the proper briefs for filing. But it got even worse when Gordon tried to explain himself. First, as I recall, he told the judge he wasn't there because he was needed at a civil case in another county. Then, he changed his story, claiming he'd been attacked and had woken up at a hospital, as I remember. He changed the details yet again, my memory tells me, claiming that he was treated in a chiropractor's office, not a hospital.   Gordon lies in the summons and complaint as an attempt to unethically badger his opponents. Turns out that Gordon habitually lies without verifying his claims. Did he miss court because he was in jail, arrested after police found him fast asleep inside his car, with a pipe and a baggie by his side? It would not surprise me. Oh, yeah -- one more thing. On Wednesday, we were told, Gordon missed another court date. To his unfortunate client: We highly suggest you find a new lawyer.  Just our very experienced opinion.  ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

He desparatly needed a lawyer for a difficult child custody case. They made so many promises. I paid them $ 2700.00. After months of waiting for help, they did not hold up to the promises they made. In September of 2013 they agreed to give me a full refund. They told my son if he signed an agreement to not talk bad about them or complain to the BBB they would refund the entire amount. My son signed the agreement, and they said they would refund the money in 30 days. We have called and e-mailed them continuously. They keep telling us there is a problem with their credit card processing company. We have left messages for Mr. Powell, the CEO, he has never returned any calls or e-mails. I sent them an e-mail last week thretening intent to sue. That was the first call I got back from them. They said it was Pay Pals fault, they were holding the money. I didn't use pay pal. I used my Bank card, they charged my bank card over the phone. And because it was a bank card the bank has a policy that I can not dispute the charge because it has been more than 90 days. I went to their Face Book page and left messages, still no response. There have been several people that have posted on their page that have had the same problem. They  were promised services, which they did not receive. They too were promised a refund and got the same excuses, problems with their credit card processing company. This company advertises help for Dads rights, and they promise help, but never follow through with their end of the agreement. They promise a refund but never issue a refund. They just take your money. So now we have no money, no attorney and  my son's house is in foreclosuer, trying to save money to pay for an attorney. We need the money to pay the mortgage and the attorney. My son may lose his house and his kids. Go to their Face  Book page and read the story about the Vet that committed suicide, because of this scam. I spoke with one woman that paid them $ 3000. The same thing happened to her. They gave her the same story about probelms with their credit card processing company for months, the same thing they are telling me.

No one from the ticket clinic showed up on the day of my court date, therefore not only did I have to pay the original ticket, but I also lost my case by default.  I had a perfect driving record and could not afford to lose that reputation.  When I called the ticket clinic, not only did they not give me a complete refund for not delivering services rendered, but they did nothing to resolve the issue. I spent a whole day in the DMV's office putting up a stink and showing my proof that the ticket I received was wrongful.  I won my case, but I still was out of pocket the money I paid to the ""Ticket Clinic"" as well as the original ticket from the police officer. I want to let individuals know that no one will fight hard for you except you!  Do not think this is the easy way out or will be less stressful for you if someone else takes care of your ticket.  THEY WILL NOT!! AND unless you are willing to fight back as I did your drivers record will be ruined and you will pay higher insurance rates.   In conclusion, I do not recommend using the TICKET CLINIC to fight your ticket!!!  My case was an easy case and a no brainer.  This company is incompetant and unreliable.

We really try to help our clients get through a difficult time,” states Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. Client Care & Complaint Resolution At times, clients may not feel satisfied with the services they received. “The frequent complaint we get from clients is either they didn’t get enough money, or didn’t get money quick enough. Unfortunately, this is going to happen through no fault of our own,” explains Mr. Sobel. He further explains that this can be caused by a federal or state law that is impacting the case, the amount of medical damages they may have, or simply the facts of the case itself. To try and avoid these issues in the first place, Mr. Sobel and his team strive to educate the clients up-front with regard to what they should expect, what types of damages are covered, and what documentation is needed. After a complaint is resolved, Kanner & Pintaluga make following up with the client a priority. “We always follow up after a complaint. I do take it personally with my business,” states Mr. Sobel. “Happy clients don’t post negative complaints on the internet, so we go out of our way to make sure the customer is well educated on the things we can and cannot control. We follow up and the goal is to see clients pain free and walking away happy.”Mr. Sobel and his team take into consideration the time and money spent by the client, and strive to get the client what they need. “Missing out on a gym membership, lost wages, paying for extra help at home… It’s important that’s clients get compensated for every element of their damages, pain and suffering,” he states. They also strive to keep their clients informed throughout every step of the process, utilizing any form of communication necessary to keep in touch with the client, whether it’s a phone call, e-mail, or text message.In response to complaints lodged against his company on Ripoff Report, Mr. Sobel states, “I would like to point out that a number of the complaints seem fabricated and appear to be posted out of places that I do not work, by named that don’t match any of our clients or past clients’ names. Even still, we address every complaint, no matter how legit or complete.”Since receiving complaints, the team at Kanner & Pintaluga has instituted a property damage department where they can assist clients’ recovery, and they strive to be available to their clients at any time of the day. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. / Senior Managing Attorneys  ""The passion for client advocacy and service is obvious at Kanner & Pintaluga.

Kanner & Pintaluga property damage experts are happy to coordinate damage assessments, rental car services, and more.  The majority of our complaints (besides the fakes ones) are clients wanting more settlement money and/or settlement money faster.

KEVIN SOBEL & ASSISTANT SAMANTHA PENTEGRAST ARE UNCARING UNPROFESSIONAL P*****. Duluth Georgia The words that best describe the Kanner & Pintaluga Accident Attorneys are INSOLENT and UNPROFESSIONAL. They will RIP YOU OFF they are LIARS do not use their representation I’m WARNING you THEY WILL LEAVE YOU WITH NOTHING and will leave you will bills to pay. I have been very disgusted with their customer service and representation that at one point I wanted to change attorneys I regret the decision to continue using their services the reason why I chose to stay with them is because they promised me results and they FAILED to do that. It has been over a year and my case is still on going, the way I came across Kanner & Pintaluga was through 411-Pain law referral service with the very catchy ads “big mistake”.  Problem 1) the amount of time it took them to get my medical bills together even after I faxed them to them and the extra outrageous fees they are charging me to retrieved other medical bills 2) when I called to check on the status of my case my case representative was very disrespectful and very reluctant to give me any information, they would only tell me that they are still negotiation and call back in three or four weeks this went on for about 11 months. I would have to basically beg them for information when I asked them how much my bills were in total I was only told that it was an amount that was outrageous when in fact I knew it was not as much as they said it was the amount actually included additional FEES THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO HIDE very unprofessional. I would ask my attorneys for a list of my medical bills and total they were not willing the only time I received answers was after giving them a hard time. Now that I received a final amount for my settlement that amount does not even cover all my bills nor does it leave me with any pain and suffering compensation they purposely left out a bill that they didn’t want to pay because they couldn’t negotiate enough money to pay my bills the only thing they are concerned with are their lawyer fees and additional lawyer cost. 3) The only time I was able to speak with my attorney was after threating to drop them from my case or after giving them a hard time after not wanting to give me any information on my case I would have to DEMAND information over and over again. 4) Their Georgia office is a front it’s basically office space that they are renting out to say that they are located in Georgia.  I requested to set an appointment in the Georgia office to speak with someone face to face (this was before I found out that the office was really nonexistent) I was told that they will call me back with an appointment time.  They never gave me an appointment time I would call and call for an appointment and after calling back after the forth or fifth time they would hang up in my face, purposely not answer my calls, or send me to the voice mail very unprofessional. I decided to go up to the Georgia office one day to discover that it was just a front. 5) THEY CASHED MY SETTLEMENT CHECK WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDE, Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT USE KANNER & PINTALUGA FOR ANY SERVICE.

That's how we roll. [continued below]....																			..... Last week the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld Crystal Cox's First Amendment rights, and in doing so protected yours, and mine, in important ways.This post is about that decision, and about what Crystal Cox was doing to undercut the First Amendment while the Ninth Circuit was thinking about it. As you will see below, I am one of the people Cox has tried to silence with frivolous litigation even as courts were protecting her right to speak.Chapter One: The Ninth Circuit Protects Crystal Cox, And In Doing So Protects The Speech of All CitizensCox Attacks Kevin Padrick and Obsidian Finance GroupBack in 2008, a bankruptcy court appointed Kevin Padrick as the trustee of a company called Summit Accommodators, Inc., which was seeking bankruptcy protection as it reorganized. Padrick, an expert on distressed businesses at a financial services firm called Obsidian Finance Group, LLC, was well qualified for the job. No court, and no sane person, has ever found that he did it wrong. To his great misfortune, Cox somehow heard about him and decided that he was a wrongdoer. This is how the Ninth Circuit describes what happened next:After Padrick’s appointment, Crystal Cox published blog posts on several websites that she created, accusing Padrick and Obsidian of fraud, corruption, money-laundering, and other illegal activities in connection with the Summit bankruptcy. Cox apparently has a history of making similar allegations and seeking payoffs in exchange for retraction. See David Carr, When Truth Survives Free Speech, N.Y. Times, Dec. 11, 2011, at B1. Padrick and Obsidian sent Cox a cease-and-desist letter, but she continued posting allegations.More on that extortion allegation soon. Cox attacked Padrick and Obsidian Finance with a flurry of posts on sites like ""obsidianfinancesucks.com,"" where she made extravagant and mostly incoherent accusations of wrongdoing without factual support. So Padrick and Obsidian Finance sued her.Cox Loses In The Trial Court, Which Gets It WrongPadrick sued in United States District Court in Oregon. Cox acted like an archetypical disturbed pro se litigant throughout, filing a bizarre cross-complaint against not only Padrick and Obsidian Finance and their lawyers but also everyone else who had annoyed her recently.United States District Judge Marco Hernandez eventually made two crucial rulings. One was right, and one was wrong. First, Judge Hernandez found that many of Cox's posts were statements of opinion, not statements of fact, and therefore could not be defamation. Those posts ""used figurative and hyperbolic language and could not be proved true or false.""As I frequently discuss here, only provably false statements of fact can be defamatory. Hyperbole and mere rhetoric, or statements of opinion that can't be interpreted as implying provably false facts, cannot. Judge Hernandez' first decision was right. Second, Judge Hernandez wrongly limited Cox's defenses. Judge Hernandez found that one of Cox's posts could be taken as implying a provably false statement of fact: on one of her attack sites, bankruptcycorruption.com, she claimed that Padrick failed in his duty as trustee to pay taxes on substantial amount of money owed by Summit. Judge Hernandez let that claim go to the jury, and the jury found that the statement was false and harmful, and awarded $1.5 million to Padrick and $1 million to Obsidian Finance. But Judge Hernandez incorrectly instructed the jury on the law, so they didn't know what standard should govern their decision. In short, Judge Hernandez didn't require Padrick and Obsidian Finance to prove, or the jury to find, that Cox got it wrong deliberately, or recklessly, or even negligently. To the contrary, he instructed the jury like this: ""Defendant’s knowledge of whether the statements at issue were true or false and defendant’s intent or purpose in publishing those statements are not elements of the claim and are not relevant to the determination of liability.” That decision was wrong. That decision flew in the face of Supreme Court precedent.First, in New York Times v. Sullivan, the Supreme Court held fifty years ago that when someone makes a false statement about a public official's official conduct, the official can't prove defamation without proving actual malice -- that is, without proving that the defendant acted knowing that the statement was false or reckless disregard as to its truth. Moreover, even private figures can't prove defamation merely by showing that a statement made about them was false.In Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., the Supreme Court held that even a private figure must prove, at least, that a false fact was uttered negligently to prevail on a defamation claim. In other words, defamation liability may not be imposed at all without some showing of fault.[note]The possible exception, as noted below, is speech about a purely private figure on an issue of purely private interest. But even that exception might not exist.[/note] So why did Judge Hernandez decide that way?He issued an order on the issue during the trial ruling that the Sullivan ""actual malice"" standard did not apply because Padrick and Obsidian Finance were not public figures or public officials. That's not the troubling part. Judge Hernandez also found that the plaintiffs need not even prove negligence under the Gertz standard, because Cox could not show that she was ""media"" or a professional journalist. That was the basis of his decision that Padrick and Obsidian Finance could prevail merely by showing that Cox's post was wrong and harmful, and that they need not show any level of fault. The finding was invited by Cox -- she argued that Gertz ought to apply because she should be considered ""media,"" when in fact Gertz should apply to everybody.This ruling was widely reported in the media as a federal judge finding that a blogger is not a journalist, which is a bit of an oversimplification. After trial -- perhaps in part because of widespread media coverage, and perhaps in part because Cox was by then competently represented instead of representing herself -- Judge Hernandez modified his position in the course of denying Cox's motion for a new trial, stating more explicitly that the Gertz standard only applies to ""media"" defendants, and that a private plaintiff need not necessarily prove that a private defendant acted negligently in making a false statement. That was wrong.The Ninth Circuit Gets It Right and Eliminates the False Distinction Between ""Media"" and CitizensThe estimable Eugene Volokh represented Crystal Cox pro bono on appeal, and achieved a result that protected not just Cox, but all of us. The Ninth Circuit opinion is here. Notably, on appeal, Cox did not dispute that her accusation against Padrick and Obsidian Finance was false and harmful. The Ninth Circuit did one crucial thing and one fairly important thing. The crucial thing was rejecting the false distinction between ""media"" defendants and citizen defendants. The Ninth Circuit held that the Sullivan and Gertz standards apply whether the defendant is ""media"" or a ""professional journalist"" or not. If someone sues you for what you write or say about them, they will have to prove some level of fault -- whether it's negligence (if the plaintiff is a private figure) or actual malice (if the plaintiff is a public figure or official, or the speech is on a matter of public concern). Quoth the Ninth Circuit:The protections of the First Amendment do not turn on whether the defendant was a trained journalist, formally affiliated with traditional news entities, engaged in conflict-of-interest disclosure, went beyond just assembling others’ writings, or tried to get both sides of a story. As the Supreme Court has accurately warned, a First Amendment distinction between the institutional press and other speakers is unworkable: “With the advent of the Internet and the decline of print and broadcast media . . . the line between the media and others who wish to comment on political and social issues becomes far more blurred.” Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 352. In defamation cases, the public-figure status of a plaintiff and the public importance of the statement at issue—not the identity of the speaker—provide the First Amendment touchstones.The Ninth Circuit noted that there might be one remaining area where Gertz does not apply and a defamation plaintiff does not need to prove even negligence -- if the plaintiff is a private figure and the speech is not on a matter of public concern. But the court found it need not decide that legal question, because Cox's posts were on issues of public concern -- they were about allegations of a crime against a trustee in a bankruptcy proceeding. The court noted that ""[p]ublic allegations that someone is involved in crime generally are speech on a matter of public concern"" and ""even consumer complaints of non-criminal conduct by a business can constitute matters of public concern."" That means that the limitations on Gertz -- if they exist[note]I think the better rule is that Gertz applies without regard to whether the speech is of ""public interest."" It's not clear to me how a false statement could be both ""on a subject of purely private interest"" and actually harmful to the reputation of the subject. Plus, a more robustly speech-protective rule protects everyone.[/note] -- are narrow. The court rejected, however, Cox's argument that Padrick and Obsidian Finance should be treated as public figures or public officials, triggering the Sullivan actual malice standard, just because Padrick was appointed by a court.The Ninth Circuit's fairly important achievement was firmly supporting the distinction between statements of fact (which may be defamatory) and statements of opinion or hyperbole (which may not). Rejecting Padrick's cross-appeal, they agreed with Judge Hernandez that Cox's other posts could not be taken as statements of provable fact and therefore could not be defamatory. The Ninth Circuit is polite and professional and would never put it this way, but I will: the court articulated the Batshit-Crazy Rule.[note]I am aware some people may take offense to that turn of phrase. I have written rather bluntly before about what it is like to suffer from major depression.I am sympathetic, generally, to social prejudice against mental illness. But I am unsympathetic about the sensibilities of people who use mental illness as an excuse or vector to abuse the persons and rights of others. Sorry.[/note] Cox's posts attacking people -- Padrick, attorneys who have opposed her, bloggers and journalists who have angered her, me -- come off as batshit-crazy. They make flamboyant and bizarre accusations that normal people would not credit.[note]For instance, for the record, I have not engaged in a conspiracy to murder adult entertainment performers.[/note] They do so on vividly-named sites, and employ an entire Souplantation's worth of word-salad. They recursively cite each other, or Cox's filings, rather than citing facts or evidence. They carry all the hallmarks of pervasive mental illness -- but also, and more importantly for First Amendment purposes, hyperbole, bluster, and opinion. The Ninth Circuit put this in more genteel fashion. The court explained it looks to three questions in determining whether a statement is fact or opinion -- “(1) whether the general tenor of the entire work negates the impression that the defendant was asserting an objective fact,(2) whether the defendant used figurative or hyperbolic language that negates that impression, and(3) whether the statement in question is susceptible of being proved true or false.""Applying those factors, the Ninth Circuit noted that Cox's posts at issue were full of hyperbole and extreme language, were posted on sites with names like obsidianfinancesucks.com that predispose readers to view them with skepticism as one-sided, contain run-on stream-of-consciousness sentences that seem more like diary entries about feelings than statements of fact, and contain bizarre flights of fancy like accusations that Padrick hired a hit man to kill Cox (a common delusional theme in Cox's writings). In short, ""the district court correctly found that, in the context of a non-professional website containing consistently hyperbolic language, Cox’s blog posts are 'not sufficiently factual to be proved true or false.'"" The Ninth Circuit therefore rejected Padrick's cross-appeal. The Ninth Circuit's opinion protecting Cox's free speech rights also protects your rights.The ruling means that if someone sues you for something you write or say, your First Amendment protections will not turn on whether a judge views you as a ""professional journalist."" Rather, the same legal protections that have traditionally been applied to the New York Times will apply to you. That is a substantial comfort, particularly because many jurists are not familiar with things like blogs. The ruling also robustly protects your right to express how you feel, using vivid language, by maintaining that only provable statements of fact are defamatory, and hyperbole and rhetoric are not. So: the Ninth Circuit's opinion was a substantial victory for free speech. What was Cox doing whilst the Ninth Circuit was mulling it over? She was working diligently -- some would say obsessively -- to attack and undermine the free speech of others, as one would expect of a narcissistic hypocrite. Chapter Two: Crystal Cox Gets Angry Before I explain what Crystal Cox did in 2013 to undermine the free speech rights of others, I have to explain why she got angry enough to do it. In short: Crystal Cox is mad because people called out her conduct and fought back.I'm Not An Extortionist, I Just Tell People I Will Stop Bad-Mouthing Them If They Pay Me MoneyCrystal Cox is very angry that people call her an extortionist. Why would people say such a thing? Well, it's because of emails like this: That's an email from Crystal Cox to the lawyer for Mr. Padrick and Obsidian Finance, after she had put up many websites accusing them of criminal offenses, offering to ""protect their reputation"" in exchange for $2,500 per month. Doubtless that influenced the Ninth Circuit to say this about Crystal Cox in their opinion:Cox apparently has a history of making similar allegations and seeking payoffs in exchange for retraction.One instance of interstate extortion isn't exactly a history, of course. But other people have complained of similar tactics by Cox. For instance, she sought the pro bono assistance of First Amendment badass Marc Randazza. When Randazza didn't respond quite the way she wanted, she sent him this:In other words, after approaching him about a case in which she had been sued for creating defamatory blogs about people, she registered a URL in Randazza's name, told him she needed to make money, and asked if he knew anyone who needed a search engine reputation manager. Nor is Randazza the only one. The Montana Board of Realty Regulation recently recommended that Cox's real estate license be suspended. The Board explained that Cox became irate when a potential customer backed away from her, and sought to destroy his reputation online with confidential information he had provided to her as a potential broker:The licensee became enraged that Cain had decided not to work with her. As a result of her anger, soon after Cain severed their business relationship, the licensee began blogging about Cain and contacting Cain through both e-mail and telephone. The licensee’s blogs exposed many of Cain’s real estate purchase plans for his company, information which the licensee had obtained through her discussions with Cain when Cain was having her line up properties in Montana.And then -- in an echo of her accusations against others of hiring hit men -- she made him an offer:On her February 17, 2011 blog on the www.martincain.com website, the licensee posited “Montana Man Admits to Working With Martin Cain to Set Me Up, Harm me, Kill me.” Exhibit 1, February 17, 2011 blog. Afterwards, the licensee deleted the February 17, 2011 blog and then sent an e-mail to Cain telling him that he could purchase the www.martincain.com website and domain name for $550,000.00.Cox is incensed that people call this extortion. One of her constant refrains is that she's never been charged criminally with extortion, and therefore it's defamation, a hate crime, a criminal conspiracy, a civil rights violation, and a general abuse of her rights to offer the opinion based on these facts that she committed extortion. Of course, Cox's whole schtick is creating web sites accusing other people of a bizarre array of crimes, even though they've never been charged with any such crimes. The hypocritical contradiction is typical of an extreme narcissist.I'm An Investigative Journalist, But Other Bloggers Are Just MeanCox is also angry because, when some news sources suggested that she might be a free-speech hero, bloggers fought back and showed her for what she is. For instance, I wrote about how Crystal Cox registered domains in the name of Marc Randazza's wife and young daughter in retaliation for Marc's dispute with her:Many other lawbloggers -- like Jordan Rushie and Scott Greenfield and Mark Bennett and Eric Turkewtiz -- also pointed out her conduct and explained that, whatever the merits of her case, she is a villain, not a hero. Even mainstream journalists -- like David Carr at the New York Times and Kashmir Hill at Forbes -- put her First Amendment claims in the context of her deranged and extortionate behavior.As a result, a Google search for Crystal Cox's name quickly yielded stories about her bad behavior. Crystal Cox didn't like that. in her mind, only she is allowed to write negative things to impact someone's search engine results.Marc Randazza Fights Back, Kicks AssMarc Randazza -- who is a friend and occasional client, in addition to being a First Amendment badass -- is not one to take abuse lying down. So when Cox registered a bunch of domains in his name (like marcrandazza.com and marcjohnrandazza.com) in order to bad-mouth him and sell advertisements, he fought back. The results have been very upsetting to Cox. First, Randazza filed an action with the World Intellectual Property Organization, which resolves disputes over domain names. Marc chose wisely by proceeding narrowly -- he didn't seek to capture domains that were on their face critical or satirical, like marcrandazzasucks.com. Instead, he sought only to capture those domains that used his name in a way that caused confusion, on the theory that Cox registered those domains in bad faith to cause confusion and make ad revenue. Marc knew to narrow his claim like that because he's successfully defended satirical bloggers who use their targets' names in non-confusing and clearly satirical ways, like glennbeckrapedandmurderedayounggirlin1990.com. WIPO agreed, and awarded Marc several domain names that used his name in a confusing and non-satirical manner, and in the process noted that Cox registered the domains fraudulently to commit extortion:In any event, for purposes of the Policy the Panel finds the Respondent’s intention, as reflected by the record, was never to solely provide, through her websites, speech critical of the Complainant. Rather, her objective in both registering and using the disputed names was apparently to engage in a rather sinister and tenacious scheme to extort money from the Complainant. Specifically, the Respondent first posted negative and false commentary on her websites that was intentionally calculated to injure the Complainant’s on-line reputation and disrupt the Complainant’s business conducted through his law firm. Thereafter, the Respondent used those sites in a manner that apparently optimized their ranking on the Google search engine in order to increase their visibility and prominence on search results yielded through a Google search of the Complainant, thus likely exacerbating the injury caused to the Complainant. Once all this occurred, the Respondent then offered her reputational management services to the Complainant through which, for a considerable fee, she would remediate the Complainant’s on-line reputation by eliminating all the negative and false commentary of her own making and presumably also ceasing her use of the disputed domain names. Basically, for a price, she would undo the injury to the Complainant for which she was responsible for having created in the first place. This egregious conduct clearly constitutes bad faith under the Policy.But Randazza wasn't done. He sued Cox in United States District Court in the District of Nevada. In his complaint, Randazza explicitly disclaimed any intent to sue Cox for theories like defamation or infliction of emotional distress. Instead, he accused Cox of registering domains in his name in order to make money of it, in violation of his rights, and as a pattern of extortion. He noted, for instance, one of Cox's posts titled ""Marc Randazza Domain Name for Sale.. Here Kitty Kitty..."" Based on that, Randazza articulated causes of action under the federal cyberpiracy and cybersquatting statutes, as well as under state right to publicity statutes. The gravamen of his claim -- and what distinguishes it from most cases of satirical websites -- is that Randazza alleged that Cox acted to extort money from him or make money through selling the domains or collecting other revenue. Randazza's suit has been successful. United States District Judge Gloria Navarro first issued a temporary restraining order against Cox locking the domains to prevent their transfer, and making this finding:In this case, Defendants have embarked on a campaign of cyber-extortion. Specifically, Cox sent an e-mail to Plaintiff Randazza that informed him that she had purchased and, in that same email, informed him of her “need to make money.” (Pls.’ Mot. for TRO, Ex. 8, ECF No. 2-10.)Judge Navarro later issued a preliminary injunction transferring the domains to Randazza. Judge Navarro repeated her finding that Cox was engaged in extortion:Here, Defendants’ actions leading up to the filing of the Complaint, as well as Defendants’ past behavior, as represented in Plaintiffs’ reply briefing, clearly seems to indicate cyber-extortion. (See Pls.’ Reply in Support of Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 28, Ex. 1). Specifically, Defendant Cox’s request for $5 million in exchange for and her offering of “reputation management services” indicate her intent to profit from the registration of Plaintiffs’ personal names as Domain Names. Defendant’s post hoc attempt to explain this as a “joke” is not credible. Given the fact that the Defendant has been shown to have engaged in a pattern of cybersquatting and cyber-extortion, this Court finds that she was more likely than not, attempting to sell this domain name to the plaintiff, or to solicit a price for the domain name in excess of herout of pocket expenses related to the domain name.As you will see below, as a result of these rulings Cox repeatedly and frivolously sued Judge Navarro.I'm Mad On Behalf Of My New Friend. Or Am I?Finally, Cox professes to be outraged on behalf of a new friend. The friend is a man named Elliot Bernstein. For many years, Bernstein has been asserting that he invented technology called iViewit, and that all of the companies using streaming video have stolen and infringed his rights to that technology in a vast conspiracy. I shall refrain from characterizing Bernstein and his litigation history. Let me, instead, quote from the opinion of a United States District Judge in New York dismissing one of Bernstein's cases:This action presents a dramatic story of intrigue, car bombing, conspiracy, video technology, and murder. In short, plaintiffs allege that hundreds of defendants engaged in a massive conspiracy to violate their civil rights and, in the process, contributed to the Enron bankruptcy and the presidency of George W. Bush. In plaintiffs' words: Plaintiffs depict a conspiratorial pattern of fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation, that runs so wide and so deep, that it tears at the very fabric, and becomes the litmus test, of what has come to be known as free commerce through inventors' rights and due process in this country, and in that the circumstances involve inventors' rights tears at the very fabric of the Democracy protected under the Constitution of the United States.As that Court suggests, Bernstein suggests that the violation of his intellectual property rights are intertwined with many of the most momentous events of the last few decades. For instance:In fact, plaintiffs suggests that the Iviewit case may have distracted Justice Labarga from his work on Bush v. Gore, leading possibly to its result.In his various motions seeking to reverse his litigation fortunes, Bernstein brags of seeking state and federal criminal charges against a large swath of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the judges of which are apparently complicit in the conspiracy. And so on. You may, with caution, visit Bernstein's site and draw further conclusions. Cox transferred many of her domains to Bernstein, perhaps to protect them from judgment creditor claims by Padrick and Obsidian Finance, and perhaps to protect them from Randazza. She also now asserts that all of the bad things said about her are part of a conspiracy to prevent her from revealing the secrets she knows about the vast conspiracy Bernstein claims in his lawsuits. No. Really. So. Where did all of this anger lead Crystal Cox? To court. More accurately, to a whole bunch of courts.Chapter Three: Crystal Cox Sues EverybodyIn 2013, Crystal Cox embarked on a series of federal lawsuits in numerous states, all combining her grievances from the Padrick and Obsidian Finance litigation, her grievances against the journalists and bloggers who wrote unflattering things about her, her grievances against United States District Judge Gloria Navarro and the WIPO for ruling against her in Randazza's actions, some poorly expressed grievances against people who annoyed her when she lived in Montana, and the grievances of her new friend, Elliot Bernstein. I was a defendant in one of those actions, because I wrote about Cox, and therefore was classified as a conspirator. Cox sued in federal courts in Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. I have collected all of her complaints, and the orders dismissing them, in the appendix to this post.[note]Yes, having a post with footnotes is already ridiculous. Yes, an appendix transcends self-parody. I AM WHAT I AM.[/note] Cox's defendant list varied a bit from suit to suit[note]I am only listing Cox's 2013 lawsuits against this group of defendants on this group of bizarre claims.Separately, Cox also sued a strange array of defendants in federal court in Montana, accusing them of being part of a vast conspiracy back in 2006 to conceal mold in a house. That suit was dismissed by the court. Cox also sued numerous realty (that's realty, not reality, obviously) organizations based on claims of conspiracy and antitrust violations. That claim was also dismissed by the court.[/note], but generally it included Judge Gloria Navarro (for ruling against her), Kevin Padrick and Obsidian Finance and their lawyers, the New York Times and journalist David Carr and Forbes and journalist Kashmir Hill (for criticizing her), numerous lawbloggers who criticized her (including me) and their law firms, New York Public Radio, the World Intellectual Property Organization and several of its officials, megafirms Proskauer Rose and Greenberg Traurig (who defended against Bernstein's litigation), the Multnomah County Sheriff Office and the Sheriff and one of his deputies, the University of Montana, Warner Bros. (which, as near as I can tell, is alleged to use streaming technology stolen from Bernstein), Godaddy (for allowing courts to tell it to move domains away from her), employees of Intel and Apple (again, apparently premised on the Bernstein claims), and the Free Speech Coalition (because fuck you, apparently).Like the defendant list, Cox's list of causes of action also varied. However, her complaints include both criminal claims (which, of course, Cox cannot lawfully bring) and civil claims, and include things like criminal and civil conspiracy, conspiracy to violate civil rights, deprivation of civil rights under color of law, ""all state and federal laws applying to defamation,"" ""ALL federal and state harassment laws applicable,"" ""all anti-discrimination laws,"" the Sherman Antitrust Act, violation of the Bill of Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human rights, violation of the International Covenant on Civil Rights and Political Rights, the Hate Crimes Act, abuse of process, tortious interference with contract and prospective business advantage, racketeering and RICO, malpractice, ""shield laws,"" witness tampering, False Claims Act, Deceptive Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act, ""all federal and state whistle blower [sic] retaliation laws,"" and others. It is extremely difficult to figure out what Cox says any particular person did.As near as I can figure, Cox -- whose avocation is accusing people of crimes on her blogs -- is arguing that it is defamation, racketeering, hate crime, and retaliation to point out that her published emails are extortionate. She also seems to be arguing that all of the defendants, somehow, are part of the vast global conspiracy against Bernstein to steal his iViewit technology, and that she is a victim because she has crucial information about the conspiracy and people are writing mean things about her in order to suppress her crucial testimony. Or something. One thing is very clear: just as clearly as she thinks the First Amendment should protect her saying terrible (and entirely bogus) things about Kevin Padrick and Obsidian Finance, she thinks the law should prevent other people from saying negative things about her. Again: narcissistic hypocrite. Notably, as far as I can tell, Cox never served a single defendant through lawful service.Nobody was ever required to respond. So how did the cases get dismissed? Well, rather than pay the filing fees -- which, given the number of cases, would have been substantial -- Cox pled poverty and asked the courts to waive the filing fees. Federal courts can do that -- but the statute that allows them to do so also allows them to dismiss frivolous and abusive complaints.The courts faced with Cox's claims have done so. Federal judges across the country have responded to Cox's claims with a mixture of bewilderment and scorn. They've called Cox's claims ""fantastical and implausible.""Another said ""[p]laintiff’s complaint is 153 pages in length, is not presented in numbered paragraph form, and does not clearly state what acts of what defendants are alleged to give rise to her claims."" Said another, ""[a]t 153 pages, Plaintiff’s Complaint is sprawling and incomprehensible. In what can only be characterized as a barrage of allegations and accusations, the Court cannot discern to which parties the individual claims are directed and on what basis the claims are brought."" In Florida the District Judge discussed the bizarre nature of Cox's claims:The current claim is clearly baseless in light of the fact that the Complaint is comprised of conclusory allegations that are oft-times fantastic or delusional, and substantiated by no facts to support the practicality of the claims. For instance, Plaintiff states that Defendant Randazza and his co-conspirators are involved in prostitution rings, client shakedowns, controlling judges, strong arming or paying off media, and extreme retaliation against those who criticize Defendant Randazza. (D.E. l-2 at p. 94). Plaintiff factually substantiates none of these claims. Plaintiff also conclusively alleges without substantiation that Defendant Judge Gloria Navarro placed Plaintiff's life in danger. Ié. at p. 25.In Massachusetts, in an very thorough order putting Cox's claim there in the context of her nationwide campaign, the court dryly noted that her complaint is ""not entirely intelligible or organized."" Based on their power triggered by Cox's request to proceed without paying fees, the courts have all dismissed Cox's complaints. When they have given her leave to amend, she has either failed to do so or has filed amended complaints that are just as unintelligible as the original ones. In some cases Cox has ceased communicating with the court. Courts sending mail to the post office box she provides in her pleadings have had it returned as undeliverable, even though she continues to use that post office box in recent filings. (Refusing to acknowledge or accept undesirable court mailings is a common vexatious litigant tactic.) Similarly, Randazza notes that she's playing a similar game in his suit against her -- she's commenting online about the content of filings and court orders even as she ignores and fails to respond to them.Cox's federal complaints have gone nowhere. That is unlikely to change. But they have represented an effort to suppress and retaliate against free speech by vexatious harassment of her critics. Being sued -- even by a deranged person -- is stressful and unsettling. Even when your speech is clearly protected by the First Amendment, like the commentary about Cox has been, it's difficult not to be chilled by frivolous lawsuits. Cox was uttering censorious demands out of one side of her mouth even as she asked the Ninth Circuit to protect her free speech out of the other side.ConclusionUltimately this case shows the legal system working. A judge violated the rights of an extremely distasteful and justifiably despised litigant, and the Ninth Circuit applied the First Amendment correctly to someone who, herself, abuses it at every opportunity. A disturbed pro se litigant filed a flurry of abusive and frivolous suits, which were dismissed without any defendants even having to respond. I would feel that the system was working even better if an enterprising United States Attorney somewhere prosecuted Cox for interstate extortion, but we don't always get what we want. For now, it is satisfying to know this: Crystal Cox's appeal to the Ninth Circuit produced an important ruling that defends my rights and yours, and that ironically will make it easier to defeat her nonsensical, abusive, and censorious lawsuits if anyone is ever called upon to do so.AppendixDistrict of Arizona ComplaintDistrict of Arizona Amended ComplaintDistrict of Arizona First DismissalDistrict of Arizona Final DismissalNorthern District of California ComplaintNorthern District of California DismissalSouthern District of Florida ComplaintSouthern District of Florida DismissalSouthern District of Florida Final DismissalNorthern District of Illinois ComplaintNorthern District of Illinois Minute Order Explaining DismissalNorthern District of Illinois Final Judgment of DismissalDistrict of Massachusetts ComplaintDistrict of Massachusetts Dismissal OrderDistrict of Massachusetts Final DismissalDistrict of Nevada ComplaintDistrict of Nevada Dismissal OrderDistrict of Nevada Final DismissalDistrict of New Jersey ComplaintDistrict of New Jersey Dismissal OrderDistrict of New Jersey Final DismissalSouthern District of New York ComplaintSouthern District of New York Order Transferring Case to Nevada[note]The court has not yet dismissed this action.[/note]Eastern District of Pennsylvania ComplaintEastern District of Pennsylvania Dismissal orderEastern District of Wisconsin ComplaintEastern District of Wisconsin Dismissal OrderNOW TO THE ORIGINAL REPORT THAT WAS FILED  =====================Randazza Legal Group and Marc Randazza is GUILTY of unethical practices, Fraud on the Courts, Violating my Constitutional Rights, Violating my Free Speech Rights, Denying me Due Process, using Privileged information gained acting as my attorney against me to further his own agenda and protect his clients in the Porn Industry. Marc Randazza of Randazza Legal Group talked down to me as a client, misrepresented me, mistreated me and attempted to make deals on my behalf with the opposition in my case without discussion the deal with me, the client prior.Marc Randazza of Randazza Legal Group acts outside of the law and puts his clients rights and quality of life in the back seat per say as he does as he pleases with total disregard for what is truly the best interest of his client.  Marc Randazza of Randazza Legal Group believes that if he takes a case for Free, then you dang well better sit down and shut up, and do what he says.

As well as double and triple billings of differnt people within the office doing the exact samething!! When I refused to pay these additional fees of which I absolutely did not authorize. Randall Warmdrodt gets another of his friends to file a small claim against myself for the $10,700.00 The case for small claim is slated for 2014 but word to the wise STEER CLEAR OF THIS FIRM!!  ",  Attorneys & Legal Services 
 Home Defense Law Group ,"  Home Defense Law Group  7751 Kingspointe parkway #110 orlando, Florida USA ",www.homedefenselawgroup.com, 407-378-4545,"","  Para mediados del año 2012 teníamos ciertos gastos misceláneos que nos sacaban del “Budget”.  Ejemplo; gastos universidad de nuestra hija,  auto, gastos médicos, entre otros.  Además, teníamos un % de interés alto en nuestra hipoteca y se oía mucha promoción sobre HARP, nuevo programa de modificación de Obama, el cual ayudaba a personas con los pagos al día.  Por lo cual mi esposo y yo comenzamos a pedir precualificaciones para el refinanciamiento de nuestra hipoteca.  Luego de obtener dos precualificaciones de banco, muy buenas, oímos el anuncio radial de Home Defense Law Group donde dice: “te ayudamos no importa estés al día o no en tus pagos” y  de John Mussa que dice “HDLG te dará paz mental”.  Decidimos ir a orientarnos. Fuimos a orientación en octubre 2012, HDLG  dijo que sí podían ayudarnos, que teníamos un buen caso, “todos teníamos derecho no importa los ingresos”, por que las casas habían bajado de valor y los prestamos eran altos. Dijeron que eran los mejores negociadores y podian conseguir bajar el pago, bajar el interés y no pagar gastos de cierre.  Muy bueno, como dicen para ser cierto, pero tienen una amabilidad al principio que te derrites y le crees. Nos convencieron y firmamos contrato.  En todo momento en la orientación y durante el proceso le hicimos saber a HDLG que: ambos teníamos crédito excelente, que NO queriamos se nos afectara el crédito  . no queriamos subir los años de préstamo a más de 30 años. que queriamos bajar algo nuestro pago mensual y el interés. que no íbamos de dejar de pagar el mortgage, a lo cual estuvieron claros, porque de lo contrario tenían que cobrar otros honorarios. Se acordó hacer el pago en tres plazos, el 1er pago al momento y los otros 2 por mes. Desde ese momento empezaron a fallar, porque en el 2do pago lo cobraron todo, cobraron noviembre y diciembre en el mes de noviembre; todo sin decirnos nada y su escusa fue falla del sistema de cobro. Luego de e-mails enviados a HDLG  sin ninguna contestación, la Sra. Carmen de la Torre en llamada telefónica nos solicita que para lograr una buena modificación  no pagaramos el mortgage dos meses. Le insistimos que no queríamos hacer eso por el peligro de dañar el crédito,  pero ella insistió y ya habían cobrado sus honorarios completos yyy se supone ellos sabían lo que hacían.  El peor error de nuestras vidas fue haberle hecho caso y confiar en esa mujer.   Durante el proceso lo único que hizo fue pedir los mismos documentos: prueba de ingresos, bank statement, y utility bills. Ella no pedía evidencias de los pagos misceláneos que nos hacían salir del “Budget”. ¿Cómo entonces ella podía demostrar al lender la situación económica  por los gastos extras que teníamos en ese momento? En una ocasión, tuvimos que ir en persona para asegurarnos la Sra. De la Torre llamara a nuestro lender para que nos enviaran la forma 1098, ante las gestiones infructuosas que hicimos directamente con el lender. Ellos nos decía que no podían hablar con nosotros, que nuestros abogados tenían que pedirla.  ¿Cómo, que no podíamos solicitar esta forma  que es para llenar los taxes y solicitar las becas de nuestra hija? En ese momento supimos que HDLG  te hace firmar una hoja, que no te explican que es para que no puedas en lo absoluto hablar con tu lender.  De la Torre sólo hizo  gestión de llamar y darnos  un pedazo de papel de libreta con la información para llenar los taxes, y ahí quedó. Saben que, después del tiempo, nuestro lender nos dijo que todo documento que ellos nos enviaban a la dirección de HDLG, HDLG NO la recibían porque no había quien lo firmara como recibido, incluyendo la 1098. Dejamos de recibir cartas con información importante relacionada a taxes, a “flood insurance” que luego nos causaron muchos problemas, por cuenta de HDLG no haberla recibido y haberla entregado a nosotros. Se imaginan cuando empezaron a llegar cartas con la palabra FORECLOSURE, mi esposo fue en persona, sin cita y el Sr. Matos dice, que no nos preocuparamos, que era normal, parte del proceso.  Si de algo, o lo único que tienen HDLG es amabilidad, que te deja atónito.  Mi esposo le comentó, sobre la falta de profesionalismo de la Sra. De la Torre, y al día siguiente ella llama para decirnos: “Sr. Morales usted se desesperó  ayer viniendo a las oficinas y sabe que, la desesperación es sinónimo de fracaso”.  ¿Que se puede interpretar con esto? Continuabamos enviando E-mails pidiendo contestación a preguntas. Les recalcábamos en los e-mails, no queríamos subieran los años.  Llamamos en muchas ocasiones, sonaba y sonaba   y no contestaban el teléfono para nada (claro, veían nuestros números de célular y las pobres recepcionistas no sabían que hacer). Hicimos un prueba: una compañera  llamó al mismo tiempo como nueva cliente desde su celular y sí le contestaron. Viendo HDLG en su caller ID un numero de tel. diferente/nuevo lo contestan inmediatamente por si es una nueva víctima. Miren la falta de profesionalismo por parte de la Sra. De la Torre, que le envíabamos documentos solicitados por ella por e-mail y, siempre le pedíamos muy amablemente nos dejara saber si los recibió, solo eso.  Nunca nos contestaba y cuando ya cansados de llamar y preguntar por e-mail si los recibió, ella mandaba a la recepcionista a indicarnos que no los había recibido.  Helloooo, con que documentos ella estaba trabajando?  O,  ¿cómo le daba seguimiento?. Nos  gustaría saber hasta qué punto HDLG tenía el derecho, privilegio, o legalidad de solicitar a una tercera entidad un préstamo a nuestro nombre, sin previo aviso de nuestra parte. Según el contrato firmado no creemos hable o se mencione sobre este particular. Luego de meses pasados, y sólo oyendo (muy pocas veces)  de Sra. De La Torre: “el caso está en proceso”, el 17 de mayo, en reunión me explica sobre el proceso final “Trial Period” de hacer tres pagos por la misma y exacta cantidad por tres meses consecutivos. Me indico que tenía que firmar la aplicación “Uniform Borrower Assistance Form”, forma que estaba en blanco. Le reclamé y ella en tono molesto dijo que estaba en su computadora llena, pero no me la permitió ver.  La firmé, porque me iba a dar copia. Cuando en casa me percato, la copia que me dio estaba en blanco.  Tan pronto como pude me cominiqué con la Sra. Isabel Pael, Office Manager, para exigirle le ordenara a la Sra. De la Torre nos enviara copia  de la forma que firmé y que nos diga si recibe o no los documentos. Todavía estamos esperando esa copia. En Agosto 2013, nos llaman para firmar la modificacion;  para sorpresa  40 AñOS,  con unos término de pagos rídiculos que hasta un niño sabría que sumando y restando esto no le conviene. Y con la anotación: tu credito de affectaría si firmas la modificacón. Cuando exigimos a HDLG terminara con el proceso y nos enviara el  “reinstatement letter”   para volver a los términos originales del préstamo, por equivocación el Sr. Matos nos envía carta que HDLG le habían enviado previamente  a nuestro lender como que ya no son nuestros abogados. ¿Como?, cobraron su dinero, no hicieron su trabajo y ni siguiera tuvieron el respeto de decirnos.  A lo cual el Sr. Matos nos dice por teléfono que cometió el error de NO darnos a firmar el “conclusion contract” y nos dice que cuando la modificación baja ellos cierran el caso.  Al día de hoy no hemos recibido el “conclusion contract”. Por falta de profesionalismo, comunicación y sensibilidad de estas personas de HDLG tuvimos que pagar sobre $10,000 al lender para evitar perder nuestra casa, mas perdimos 1,895.00  pagado a HDLG,  solo por darnos problemas, disgustos, hacernos perder tiempo y dañarnos el crédito. HDLG nos daño el crédito, es lo mas que nos duele.  Estamos luchando con las tres compañías de crédito, EQUIFAX, TRANSUNION Y EXPERIAN, para poder arreglar este asunto. Estamos seguros que hay muchos más clientes que pasaron por lo mismo o lo están pasando actualmente.  Pasen la voz.  No crean en el anuncio de radio; donde John Musa decía “HDLG te dará paz mental”  él no sabe que lo que le puede dar al cliente es un derrame cerebral con tantos problemas.   By mid -2012 we had certain miscellaneous expenses that drew us to the ""Budget"" . Example , our daughter's college expenses , auto, medical expenses, among others. In addition , we had a high % interest in our mortgage and a lot of promotion on HARP , new Obama modification program , which helped people with daily payments could be heard. Therefore my husband and I began to ask precualificaciones to refinance our mortgage. After obtaining two precualificaciones bank , very good, heard the radio ad for Home Defense Law Group where he says : ""I do not mind helping you up to date on your payments or not "" and John Mussa says "" HDLG will give peace of mind"" . We decided to get our bearings. Went to orientation in October 2012, we said yes HDLG could help us, we had a good case, "" all had right no matter the income,"" that the houses had fallen in value and the loans were high. They said they were the best negotiators and could get lower payments , lower interest and pay no closing costs. Very good , as they say to be true, but they have a kindness at first that you melt and you believe him . We convinced and signed contract. At all times in the direction and in the process we made HDLG know that : both had excellent credit, we did not want it to affect us credit .years did not want to raise loan over 30 years.we wanted something lower our monthly payment and interest.that not going to stop paying the mortgage , to which were clear , because otherwise had to charge other fees.It was agreed to make the payment in three installments , the 1st payment at the time and the other 2 per month . From that moment began to fail , because the 2nd payment is charged all charged in November and December November , all without saying anything and his excuse was system failure recovery . After e- mails sent to HDLG no reply , Ms. Carmen de la Torre on phone call asking us to get a good mortgage modification fail to pay the two months. We urge you not to want to do that because of the danger of damaging the credit , but she insisted and had already paid their full fee yyy is assumed they knew what they were doing. The biggest mistake of our lives was have listened and trust that woman. During all I did was ask for the same documents : proof of income, bank statement and utility bills . She did not ask for evidence of miscellaneous payments made ​​us leave the ""Budget"" . How then could she show the lender the economic situation for the extra expenses we had at that time? On one occasion , we had to go in person to make sure Ms. De la Torre called our lender sent us to 1098 , to the fruitless efforts we made directly with the lender . They told us we could not talk to us, our attorneys had to ask. How, we could not apply this way is to fill taxes and apply for grants of our daughter ? At that point we knew we HDLG makes you sign a sheet , you do not explain it so you can not talk at all with your lender . De la Torre was managing a call and give us a piece of notebook paper with information for filing taxes , and there I was . They know that after time, our lender told us that any document they sent us in the direction of HDLG , HDLG NOT received because there was no one signed him as received , including 1098. We stopped receiving letters with important information related to taxes , to "" flood insurance"" which then caused us many problems, not having realized HDLG having received and delivered to us . Imagine when they began to get letters with the word FORECLOSURE , my husband was in person without an appointment and Mr. Matos says , not to worry , that it was normal , part of the process . If something, or they just have HDLG is kindness , that leaves you stunned. My husband commented on the lack of professionalism of Ms. De la Torre, and the next day she called to tell us , ""Mr. Morales despaired you coming to the office yesterday and know that despair is synonymous with failure. "" What can we interpret this? We continued sending e -mails asking to answer questions. Les we emphasized in the e- mails did not want to go up year. Often called , rang and rang and did not answer the phone at all (of course, saw our cell numbers and poor receptionists who do not know ) . We did a test : a companion drew the same time as a new client from his cell phone and he answered yes . Displaying HDLG on your caller ID a number of tel . different / new the answer immediately if a new victim. Look at the lack of professionalism by Ms. De la Torre , who requested we sent for her by e- mail and documents , whenever we asked very kindly let us know if you received them , just that. We never answered and when I tired to call and ask if the e-mail received , sent her to tell the receptionist that he had not received . Helloooo , that she was working papers ? Or , how you followed up ? . We want to know how HDLG had the right , privilege, or legality of asking a third party for a loan on our behalf , without notice from us. According to the signed contract or not we talk about this particular mention . After months old, and only heard ( rarely ) Ms. De La Torre : "" the case is in process,"" May 17 , at a meeting I explained about the final process ""Trial Period"" making three payments the exact same amount for three consecutive months . I indicated that I had to sign the "" Uniform Borrower Assistance Form "" application form was blank. I complained and she said in an annoyed tone in his computer was full, but not allowed to see me . I signed it because I was going to give back . When at home I realize , the copy he gave me was blank. As soon as I could she communicates with Ms. Isabel Pael , Office Manager , to require him to order Ms. De la Torre sent us a copy of the form I signed and to tell us whether or not you receive the documents. Still waiting for that copy. In August 2013 , we are called to sign the amendment , to the surprise 40 YEARS , with payment term flouted that even a child would know that adding and subtracting this does not suit you . And with the note: your credit for if you sign the modificacón affectaría . When we demand HDLG finished with the process and send us the "" reinstatement letter "" to return to the original terms of the loan, Mr. Matos inadvertently sent us a letter that he had previously sent HDLG our lender as they are no longer our lawyers . How? , Took their money , they did their job and did not even tell us respect . To which Mr. Matos tells us over the phone that made ​​the mistake of giving us NOT to sign the "" finding contract"" and tells us that when they close down the case modification . To date we have not received the "" finding contract"" . For lack of professionalism , communication and sensitivity of these people HDLG we had to pay over $ 10,000 a lender to avoid losing our home , but we lost 1,895.00 we paid HDLG , just give us problems , dislikes, wasting our time and harm us credit. HDLG harm us credit , but that is what hurts us . We are fighting with the three credit companies, Equifax , TransUnion and Experian , to solve this issue. We are sure there are many more customers who went through the same thing or are currently going through. Spread the word . Do not believe the radio ad , where John Musa said "" HDLG give you peace of mind"" that he does not know what he can give the customer a stroke with so many problems .

At one meeting she made sexual advances on me in a closed conference room. I was shocked. The legal work that i paid for was done in a sloppy unprofessional way.  I later looked up Rhonda binstocks name and found out some unbelivable facts about her on rip off report and other sites.

(Meanwhile the moving company was successfully sued by another party for the same reason).   In my frustration, I contacted the State Bar of Reviews and not only did they barely respond to my letters, I discovered that Mr Pinaud was ON the board of reviews.  Interesting.  After weeks of demands, he FINALLY provided one letter that he supposedly sent to CA, with no proof of any contact with the moving company.  He suspiciously never had that letter or mentioned it prior the the Bar Review.     It has been a few years, but I hope this helps anyone interested in utilizing this particular attorney.  I am sure they do some reponsible actions for others, but he was a terrible, irresponsible attorney for me.  I finally got my items from the moving company by paying over $1500 extra, but half was missing or distroyed.  Because of this attorney, I had no options for justice and took a huge loss, losing priceless family momentoes, losing so much money and feeling like I got ripped off twice. We tried to utilize other attorneys but Mr Pinaud mysteriously had lost the evidence and tried to say that I never gave him any.   If there is a rebuttal to this posting by Mr Pinaud, he certainly will have put more energy and effort into a public report than he did into my valid case.  I wish I had read other's reports that are now on the internet before I retained him.  I can only let karma take care of injustice, but glad I can help it along with warning others.   ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

The complaint claimed that I owed $100 for services rendered in late 2007 that my insurance provider at the time, refused to pay for some reason. Complete Family Care, P.C. never advised me of this and if they did, I would have called the insurance provider and would likely have been paid and if not, I would have paid it - it's not much... After speaking with Andrew Nimtz from The Law Office of Andrew Nimtz he advised me that they made an attempt by sending letters to an address I didn't recide at. In addition, nothing ever was reported on my credit, if it was - you can bet I would have jumped on the debt. Instead, Andrew is using a common bullying tactic in attempt to make a quick, chunk of change on something he put obviouslly little effort in. [continued below]....																			..... If his skip tracer knew what he was doing, they could easily find out where I lived as it's plastered all over the internet and a simple 'Google search,' would have done the trick. After further research, I also learned that Mr. Andrew Nimtz has a criminal record and was suspended for quite some time, in fact I am surprised he wasn't disbarred. Source: cobar.org/tcl/tcl_articles.cfm?articleid=8296 No. 13PDJ056. People v. Nimtz. 07/22/2013. Attorney Suspended. The PDJ approved a conditional admission of misconduct submitted by the parties and suspended Andrew Steven Nimtz, attorney registration number 30081, from the practice of law for one year and one day, with sixty days to be served and the remainder to be stayed pending completion of a one-year period of probation with conditions. The suspension was effective August 1, 2013. Nimtz represented a client whom Nimtz knew to be prohibited from obtaining a license to operate a medical marijuana dispensary due to a pending tax lien. For his client to continue operating the dispensary, Nimtz applied for the license in his own name, even though the client, not Nimtz, owned the dispensary in question. The State of Colorado granted Nimtz a license. After a police search of the dispensary, Nimtz was charged in Adams County with two class 4 felonies. On July 26, 2012, he pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, a class 1 misdemeanor. Nimtz was sentenced to serve one year of probation, to pay fines and costs, and to complete forty hours of public service. His probation terminated early on January 9, 2013. Nimtz’s misconduct constituted grounds for the imposition of discipline pursuant to CRCP 251.5, and violated Colo. RPC 1.2(d), 4.1(a), and 8.4(b).   At this point I am challenging Mr. Nimtz and Complete Family Care P.C., in Northglenn, CO in court and will update this report with the outcome.

 Doan Law Group ,"  Doan Law Group  2850 Pio Pico Drive Suite D Carlsbad, California USA ",www.doanlaw.com, (760) 450-3333,""," Hope this helps some people find a firm who cares about you! Back in 2008-2009 after the market crashed I was one of those people who lost a good deal of my income and therefore was considering filing BK. I was shopping around and read, (what I now believe to be fake) reviews touting Doan Law Group and its counseling of clients. I do not contest that they have filed many BK's, but that in itself lay the problem. In my experience, this family is in business only to process and file BK's, NOT to consult the consumer on their options. If they actually counseled you and found that Bankruptcy wasn't your best option, they don’t tell you because that wouldn't make them money. I am writing this, even though years have passed since this incident occurred, because I want others to be aware of how this firm misrepresents how they counsel clients, just to make a buck.  It all began when I was told to come in their office and meet in person with what I assumed would be a BK attorney. That did not happen, and never did happen throughout the course of my dealings with them, not ever even a phone call from an attorney. I was sat down by a Salesman who proceeded to present himself as a 'counselor'. (This behavior should be considered fraud since Attorneys are also known as Counselors, but I'm not an Attorney so what do I know) At this point not knowing that he wasn’t an Attorney, I proceeded to give him my story regarding finances in the past, current, and immediate future forecast. I looked upon him as someone who knew what he was talking about and that he would be COUNSELING me on the best options given the details of my specific situation. He advised BK and took a fee of just over $2000. Before I left that day, he inadvertently exposed to me that he had a quota to meet in BK 'sign-ups' just like he did for loans 'back in the mortgage days'. I was shocked to hear this and even told him I wasn't comfortable with his advice now knowing he wasn’t an Attorney. He said to me something along the lines of ""This is just the initial consultation, (more Attorney lingo) I will give your info to our attorneys and they will then make sure WE have made the right decision for you"" Although I wasn't comfortable with him I figured I would hear something from the Attorney to go over all the information I had given, that never happened. I was told I would not get to speak with an Attorney until I had all my paperwork together needed for filing. Really? I wasn't even sure if I wanted to go BK at this point, let alone try and get mortgage deeds from the banks (banks fined for forging docs and robo-signing) and every other financial institution to which I owed money.  I made multiple attempts to reach an Attorney but kept getting blocked by the front desk. I asked for a refund since I never received a legitimate consultation, and that is when I received the only Attorney communication I was going to get....a form email from Kristin Lamar stating laws on how they can keep the fee, EVEN though I never met with an attorney and the only real communication I had was about 4 emails (for refund) and numerous calls to try to speak with an actual attorney about my situation. I guess they have that form email due to continuously having to ‘explain’ how you are not going to see and attorney, and not get your money back when that is not acceptable to you. Lesson learned to not do business with someone in it for the numbers, they don’t care about you, just your successful filing and fee so they can boast how much business they do.  In case you’re wondering why it took so long to post this: I recently received advertising email from Doan and it opened up an ""old wound"", then I Googled them to see if others had issues with them and I saw how they (Doan) tried to dismiss the other complaints on here as being from 'their competition', I knew I had to write something. Those other complaints are almost exactly the scenario I went through, so I know how it feels to be cheated and mislead by Doan.  Did I ever get a call from an Attorney, or an apology, or my money back? NO, and I didn't have the money or resources to fight it because I was considering BK.  Good luck in your search, I hope you find a firm who cares, these people clearly don’t.   ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

We called him to handle a criminal case, where the chances of the case being dropped are very high. He met us at a location for the free initial consultation (job interview), we decided to hire him and gave him a $2000.00 retainer. During a period of two weeks, Mr. Blum took maybe a dozen of phone calls, returned VMs, and wrote a demand letter requesting personal property back. Which was returned to us without his assistance. We were advised that we no longer required his services due to the nature of the case (We needed an attorney who could handle the criminal as well as civil). We requested an itemized bill for services rendered... a few phone calls, and a letter for return of property, the Initial consultation was supposed to be free... with the balance being refunded. Keep in mind the services performed. The bill came in and we were charged $625.00 for the initial consultation, which he stated the initial consultation is always free. ""I Am Waiting To Give You a FREE Consultation and Evaluation of Your Case"", verbatim from his website!! Additional charges were $200 to write a four sentence form letter requesting the return of property, and $400 for no more than a dozen phone calls, each averaging no-more than 5 minutes in duration. although we feel the charges are for the phone calls vm's and letter are justified they are overly inflated to bill the maximum amount possible. The charge for the initial consultation is straight up fraud.  Mr. Blum will justify keeping every penny of your retainer. When we called to inquire about the supposed ""free initial consultation"" charges, Mr. Blum refused to return calls and/or emails. He is a piece of work.   PS: I felt bad for cancelling his services, so I refered a freind who had just gotten a dui, this was before I got my staement from this POS attorney... Had I known!

Meanwhile, no work had been performed. Flag 2 was two months later, in April of 2013, I lose my house to foreclosure.

Further, they understand that every case is different, and carefully listen to each individual clients’ unique needs and concerns.Kevin Sobel, the managing attorney of K&P's Georgia offices fights hard for his clients because he knows what they are going through from personal experience, ""I've been there. I hurt my back in a car accident a few years ago and had to undergo therapy, injections and even back surgery."" Mr. Sobel went on to say that he knows “…how frustrating it is to be effected at work and limited in my regular daily activities, so I am happy to be able to help guide my injured clients through their recoveries.”Eric Pintaluga, one of the founding partners, echoed Mr. Sobel’s enthusiasm, stating, “I have a responsibility and a duty to make sure the clients’ rights are protected when they’re injured in an accident.”The information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Louis Mosca during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..Kanner & Pintaluga is an accident injury law firm with offices in multiple states. “We provide aggressive legal representation for people injured in an accident. We strive to make sure our clients recover physically from whatever medical care they need and ultimately receive the maximum compensation for their medical bills, pain and suffering,” states Kevin Sobel, a representative of the company. “We are licensed in numerous states and we have a track record of success. I, myself, am licensed to practice in GA, FL, MA and MN. We have no bar issues and thousands of satisfied customers,” he explains. Leads are typically acquired through telephone, radio and internet advertising, as well as referrals from current and past clients.The sales process typically involves an office associate receiving a phone call from a potential client who is interested in retaining the services of the law firm. The representative will discuss the details of the case and the process with the client to determine the next step. “We like to hold the client’s hand through the process as much as possible to make sure they receive the care they need and receive as much money as possible,” explains Mr. Sobel. The associates at Kanner & Pintaluga strive to be very hands-on with their clients, keeping a detailed file for each client, documenting every step in the case. “I personally touch every file that comes into my office,” states Mr. Sobel. The law firm is also entirely paperless, which allows them the opportunity to work with their clients from anywhere. “The phones are open 24/7. I answer e-mails any time I’m awake. We really try to help our clients get through a difficult time,” states Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. Client Care & Complaint Resolution At times, clients may not feel satisfied with the services they received. “The frequent complaint we get from clients is either they didn’t get enough money, or didn’t get money quick enough. Unfortunately, this is going to happen through no fault of our own,” explains Mr. Sobel. He further explains that this can be caused by a federal or state law that is impacting the case, the amount of medical damages they may have, or simply the facts of the case itself. To try and avoid these issues in the first place, Mr. Sobel and his team strive to educate the clients up-front with regard to what they should expect, what types of damages are covered, and what documentation is needed. After a complaint is resolved, Kanner & Pintaluga make following up with the client a priority. “We always follow up after a complaint. I do take it personally with my business,” states Mr. Sobel. “Happy clients don’t post negative complaints on the internet, so we go out of our way to make sure the customer is well educated on the things we can and cannot control. We follow up and the goal is to see clients pain free and walking away happy.”Mr. Sobel and his team take into consideration the time and money spent by the client, and strive to get the client what they need. “Missing out on a gym membership, lost wages, paying for extra help at home… It’s important that’s clients get compensated for every element of their damages, pain and suffering,” he states. They also strive to keep their clients informed throughout every step of the process, utilizing any form of communication necessary to keep in touch with the client, whether it’s a phone call, e-mail, or text message.In response to complaints lodged against his company on Ripoff Report, Mr. Sobel states, “I would like to point out that a number of the complaints seem fabricated and appear to be posted out of places that I do not work, by named that don’t match any of our clients or past clients’ names. Even still, we address every complaint, no matter how legit or complete.”Since receiving complaints, the team at Kanner & Pintaluga has instituted a property damage department where they can assist clients’ recovery, and they strive to be available to their clients at any time of the day. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. / Senior Managing Attorneys  ""The passion for client advocacy and service is obvious at Kanner & Pintaluga. Each client's case is overseen by a senior managing attorney, such as Kevin Sobel for the Georgia offices, who assigns an associate attorney and two (2) case managers who are available via email, text, phone and in person, to respond to questions or concerns at every stage of the process. These case managers are knowledgeable about their clients’ cases and use the same methods of communication to keep clients apprised of any developments in their case.Kanner & Pintaluga provides aggressive and effective legal representation to clients throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennesee ando ther states, with the highest standards of excellence, compassion and integrity.

This business move underscores K&P’s goal: allowing clients to focus on getting better while K&P focus on dealing with the responsible party and navigating the intricacies of the case. “We want our clients to use their time and energy towards their recovery. They can’t get better if they don’t get medical attention, and they can’t get to the doctor’s office without some sort of transportation,” said Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga property damage experts are happy to coordinate damage assessments, rental car services, and more.  The majority of our complaints (besides the fakes ones) are clients wanting more settlement money and/or settlement money faster. We combat this by providing as much information as possible up front to the clients, repeatedly by way of letters, emails conference calls, and/or meetings, to set appropriate expectations for how cases work.We work tirelessly for our clients, long days, nights and weekends, to ensure they get what they need. Our phones are answered 24/7 and we respond to emails at all hours.

I was told by a paralegal the settlement check was in their possession and they were waiting for my signed statement. I called to verify they received the signed statement 10/22/213, after I mailed it out 10/10/2013. Mary Anna in accounting said she would call me back later that very afternoon. After 10 days and several phone calls I still have not heard a response from Mary Anna.  When I ask to speak to her superior or a human resources representative I am forwarded to her voice mail. All of this for less than 20% of the settlement amount on an accident that occurred July 2011. I will have back pains for the rest of my life. Forget going to the doctor, I will not even be able to buy a decent mattress with my portion if I ever receive it.  ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

 Jim Perdue ,"  Jim Perdue  4855 Technology Way Boca Raton, Florida USA ",www.jennafortgang.com, 561-314-2099,""," I came across by Mr. Perdue by calling an advertisement I saw on TV in March of 2013. I had a sale Date scheduled for the middle of April. Mr. Perdue guaranteed me HE could get my sale date stopped. He portrayed himself as one of the lead attorney's of the firm. It wasn't until after I paid him his retainer fee of $1500 that he informed me that he was in-fact not a lawyer (coincidence he didn't tell me until AFTER he got my money?? I doubt it). Well anyway,prior to signing up, Mr. Perdue guaranteed me that I would not lose my home, He said he might be able to get my payment reduced, but getting HSBC (my  bank) to re-instate my the loan and cancel the sale would be easy for him to accomplish as long as I paid him his SAP. He spoke very confidently, but told me I had to do something immediately Or I'd be living in the streets. So, unfortunately I chose to use his services. Well, his company did get the sale date cancelled BY FILING FOR CHAPTER 13 BANKRUPTCY FOR AN EXTRA $500. He never once mentioned this charge to me beforehand. But the sale was cancelled so I was happy. Next thing I know Mr. Perdue and his military (those who work for him) start debiting $695 a month from my account. I KNOW WE NEVER WENT OVER THIS MONTHLY FEE BEFORE I SIGNED UP!!!!!!!!  HE claims we did. No WAY! but after going back and reading the contract, i realized it was in the agreement - HE JUST NEVER BOTHERED TO TELL ME. So what Mr. Perdue told me was a $1500 fee had now cost me $2700 and I had only been a client for 40 days!!!. Well another sale date came up, and Mr. Pedrue (the Attorney who wasn't) and his military weren't able to stop this one. BUT THAT DIDNT STOP FROM TAKING MY $695 even after the house was SOLD. All told I was a client for less than four months, and despite all the promises and Guarantees from MR. JIM/JAMES PERDUE, I PAID $4,290 TO LOSE MY HOUSE. Im still here in my home because I hired a real attorney, with a real law degree, to dn appeal. Despite his big talk, big promises and endless guarantees - Perdue was a hack. Nothing more than a fraud who takes advantage of people struggling to survive. He preys on the desperate. Sadly, looking back on my notes of what he said he would do prior to me signing up - it was one big lie. He never answered my call after being paid, my mortgage company has never even heard of him. There's nothing I can do except warn others.  I must say that everyone else I dealt with was nice and considerate AND HONEST. If he would've told the truth from the start, there'd be no problem. But he's just another lying democrat. BE WEARY WHEN DEALING WITH HIM.     ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

If you want to be called back when promised and you want to be sent to a Doctor for anything more than a toothache then I would sure say that I certainly would not be able to recommend this Lawyer.

This dedicated team of professionals works tirelessly to get the maximum compensation to which their clients are entitled. Further, they understand that every case is different, and carefully listen to each individual clients’ unique needs and concerns.Kevin Sobel, the managing attorney of K&P's Georgia offices fights hard for his clients because he knows what they are going through from personal experience, ""I've been there. I hurt my back in a car accident a few years ago and had to undergo therapy, injections and even back surgery."" Mr. Sobel went on to say that he knows “…how frustrating it is to be effected at work and limited in my regular daily activities, so I am happy to be able to help guide my injured clients through their recoveries.”Eric Pintaluga, one of the founding partners, echoed Mr. Sobel’s enthusiasm, stating, “I have a responsibility and a duty to make sure the clients’ rights are protected when they’re injured in an accident.”The information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Louis Mosca during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..Kanner & Pintaluga is an accident injury law firm with offices in multiple states. “We provide aggressive legal representation for people injured in an accident. We strive to make sure our clients recover physically from whatever medical care they need and ultimately receive the maximum compensation for their medical bills, pain and suffering,” states Kevin Sobel, a representative of the company. “We are licensed in numerous states and we have a track record of success. I, myself, am licensed to practice in GA, FL, MA and MN. We have no bar issues and thousands of satisfied customers,” he explains. Leads are typically acquired through telephone, radio and internet advertising, as well as referrals from current and past clients.The sales process typically involves an office associate receiving a phone call from a potential client who is interested in retaining the services of the law firm. The representative will discuss the details of the case and the process with the client to determine the next step. “We like to hold the client’s hand through the process as much as possible to make sure they receive the care they need and receive as much money as possible,” explains Mr. Sobel. The associates at Kanner & Pintaluga strive to be very hands-on with their clients, keeping a detailed file for each client, documenting every step in the case. “I personally touch every file that comes into my office,” states Mr. Sobel. The law firm is also entirely paperless, which allows them the opportunity to work with their clients from anywhere. “The phones are open 24/7. I answer e-mails any time I’m awake. We really try to help our clients get through a difficult time,” states Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. Client Care & Complaint Resolution At times, clients may not feel satisfied with the services they received. “The frequent complaint we get from clients is either they didn’t get enough money, or didn’t get money quick enough. Unfortunately, this is going to happen through no fault of our own,” explains Mr. Sobel. He further explains that this can be caused by a federal or state law that is impacting the case, the amount of medical damages they may have, or simply the facts of the case itself. To try and avoid these issues in the first place, Mr. Sobel and his team strive to educate the clients up-front with regard to what they should expect, what types of damages are covered, and what documentation is needed. After a complaint is resolved, Kanner & Pintaluga make following up with the client a priority. “We always follow up after a complaint. I do take it personally with my business,” states Mr. Sobel. “Happy clients don’t post negative complaints on the internet, so we go out of our way to make sure the customer is well educated on the things we can and cannot control. We follow up and the goal is to see clients pain free and walking away happy.”Mr. Sobel and his team take into consideration the time and money spent by the client, and strive to get the client what they need. “Missing out on a gym membership, lost wages, paying for extra help at home… It’s important that’s clients get compensated for every element of their damages, pain and suffering,” he states. They also strive to keep their clients informed throughout every step of the process, utilizing any form of communication necessary to keep in touch with the client, whether it’s a phone call, e-mail, or text message.In response to complaints lodged against his company on Ripoff Report, Mr. Sobel states, “I would like to point out that a number of the complaints seem fabricated and appear to be posted out of places that I do not work, by named that don’t match any of our clients or past clients’ names. Even still, we address every complaint, no matter how legit or complete.”Since receiving complaints, the team at Kanner & Pintaluga has instituted a property damage department where they can assist clients’ recovery, and they strive to be available to their clients at any time of the day. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. / Senior Managing Attorneys  ""The passion for client advocacy and service is obvious at Kanner & Pintaluga. Each client's case is overseen by a senior managing attorney, such as Kevin Sobel for the Georgia offices, who assigns an associate attorney and two (2) case managers who are available via email, text, phone and in person, to respond to questions or concerns at every stage of the process. These case managers are knowledgeable about their clients’ cases and use the same methods of communication to keep clients apprised of any developments in their case.Kanner & Pintaluga provides aggressive and effective legal representation to clients throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennesee ando ther states, with the highest standards of excellence, compassion and integrity.

This business move underscores K&P’s goal: allowing clients to focus on getting better while K&P focus on dealing with the responsible party and navigating the intricacies of the case. “We want our clients to use their time and energy towards their recovery. They can’t get better if they don’t get medical attention, and they can’t get to the doctor’s office without some sort of transportation,” said Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga property damage experts are happy to coordinate damage assessments, rental car services, and more.  The majority of our complaints (besides the fakes ones) are clients wanting more settlement money and/or settlement money faster. We combat this by providing as much information as possible up front to the clients, repeatedly by way of letters, emails conference calls, and/or meetings, to set appropriate expectations for how cases work.We work tirelessly for our clients, long days, nights and weekends, to ensure they get what they need. Our phones are answered 24/7 and we respond to emails at all hours.

Delray Beach Florida  I went through this law firm after my serious car accident because of a damn 800-411-pain commercial on the radio.  That was one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made.  Last year I was involved in a serious accident where I became permenantly disabled.  I cannot work and being a single mother of three children money is very tight.  I was excited when last year December I was told that my case settled and I would be receiving my settlement by February or March.  I gave it until April before I started calling to find out where my case was.  The woman who was handling my case told me that she was working on it and when she settles she will give me a call back.  I informed her that I would give it another month before calling her back.  She immediately caught an attitude and told me that she will call me and there was no need to continue to follow back up. May came and I called back as I promised I would.  She avoided my phone calls until I threatened to take my case to another law firm.  When I did speak with her she was very nasty and told me that these things takes time but she's working hard on it.  I told her that due to unforseen circumstances and my upcoming 7th surgery since the accident that I didn't care about the accident and I would need the funds to be released ASAP.  She assured me that she would do so by the end of May. Two weeks later I call back and get the run around.  Finally I got fed up and demanded to speak with the lawyer.  I got all kinds of excuses of why I couldn't be transfered to him.  He was busy, he was in court, he was on a phone call, etc.  All of that is fine but I just wanted to leave a voicemail.  Finally after some more threatening to leave to go to another law firm I get through to someone who claims to be my attorney.  Within a week I find out that the woman 'quit' and my file was transferred to someone new.  5 months later and I'm still battling to get my settlement.  I'm totally getting ready to lose everything and have been without water for over a month, and pretty soon I will be evicted and will lose my car.  I have $100 to my name and that's to last for 3 more weeks.  We don't have much food in our fridge and I have a disabled child.  Choosing this law firm for it's catchy jingle instead of doing my research is the biggest mistake that I could've possibly made.  Please understand that I wouldn't be sitting here taking the time out to let people know if it wasn't fact.  Research your law office before you go along and sign anything.  They are getting over 33% and haven't worked much to earn it.  In fact I have done more to get my bills reduced and settled than they have.  And of course they aren't willing to reduce the amount of their fee!

Sparks, NV     I went to arbitration regarding the fee dispute that I'd filed with the bar.  Ken was only willing to refund $750 of the $2,500 fee.  I settled just because I didn't want to drag it out any further.  He had no time records with him to substantiate his position that he spent more time on the case than the $2,500 fee, so that was not a real surprise.  Was nice to finally meet the man who ""spent so much time on my case"" that I never even met him in person.  Just remember, you get what you pay for - or in some cases ... not.   1 Previous Review: Hide »    I hired Ken back in December of last year to wrap up a few items from my divorce.  I paid a $2,500 flat fee to resolve two issues:  1) to determine how the balance in our client trust account with my ex would be distributed, and 2) how to ensure my liability tied to my former business connection with the ex might be limited thus providing me more protection.  He accomplished neither - but I did get an accounting spreadsheet from my ex's former attorney finally at the end of July (took eight months to get one half-page spreadsheet).  This is when Ken dropped me as a client citing that I was abusive to his staff.  While it is true that I communicated primarily with his staff never having the opportunity to meet him face-to-face, I never raised my voice and never used language inapprorpiate in a business climate.  For the $2,500, he filed one motion not correctly identifying the issue which resulting in my ex's attorney interpreting the order to their benefit and my receiving no funds from the community trust account (the ex received nearly $10k - the balance remaining).   I have since filed a bar complaint and request for refund based on a number of infractions including RPC (Rules of Professional Conduct) 1.4 for Communication or lack thereof, RPC 5.3 regarding Non-Lawyer Assistants, and SCR (Supreme Court Ruling) Rule 1.16 regarding the Termination of Relationship.   Every single person I've spoken with since having this negative experience, including other attorneys, said ""I wish you would have asked me about him before you hired him.""  I'm understanding that while the flat rate seems very attractive to the budget-conscious litigant, the services are limited at best, and most likely all you will get is the assistance of a paralegal or legal assistant handling a majority of your case.  You may even get to meet this attorney whose trial experience includes the famed Judas Priest case - whereas he lost, but still rides on this infamous and unfortunate personal tragedy.   I would recommend that before hiring Ken McKenna - ask around and you'll likely get the same response I did.  No wonder he didn't win political office - this is a small town and people do talk! I have since had a good experience with ""We the People"" on South Virginia.  I would recommend them for low-cost solutions pertaining to divorce and trusts.  They are considered a document preparation service and have an attorney on staff for legal issues for only $125/hour, half of the average hourly rate of any other legal firm. I have additionally settled the fee dispute in arbitration whereas Ken provided a $750 refund - not enough - but not worth the trouble of going further as he kept no time records to substantiate his position that he spent more than $2,500 in time on my case.   ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Only after months of getting strung out by there lies and paying them more and more money did I find out the true nature of this company. They are scam artists.  they will say anything to get your money.  They say its a ""FLAT FEE"" but once they have you they keep coming up with ""new findings"" that were ""not included in the fee arangement"" and demand more money or they will just stop doing anything and forget you exist.  I am suprised that the florida bar is so accepting of this company and their lawyers neglegence and deception.   I am writing this to stop others from making the same mistake.

I have nothing to hide and nothing to lie about so when they rebut just remember they are corrupt as a Chicago Governer! Also I never missed a weekend with my daughter and never ever missed a child support payment. So let me tell you a story.  After my divorce I was in financial ruin and forced to leave Michigan and move back to my hometown in the Chicago area. I took me 2 and a half long years to fix the damage that was done.  In the meantime my ex decided to Drive Drunk.  Not once but two times...in 13 months.  At this point I was alrady planing my return to Michigan with my new wife and step daughter.   Moved back, bought a home, ect ect... I then proceded to file for joint physical custody at the Van Buren County Friend of the court.  Big Mistake... I knew I was doomed when my Attorney told me that she overheard Judge Hamre say once ""If i took every child away from a parent that got a few DUI's that there would be a lot of kids on on the street in Paw Paw""  My case was judged by Refreee Scott Smith who answers to the main Judge. Needless to Say things did not go well.  Smith said all I did by returning to Michigan was ""return things back to the Status Quo""  Also since my ex was in treatment for her DUI's that it would not be in my daughters best intrest to change the custody agreement. Hey Scott!!!   Didnt she ""change the Status Quo"" when she got 2 DUI's in 13 Months??  Or didnt she change the Status quo when she moved 4 times in 2 years because she wont pay her bills??  Didnt she ""Change the Status Quo"" when my ex sat on the witness stand and called teachers that testified Liers?? Scott Smith you discust me.  You and Judge Hamre are the reason part of the reason that this country is going to shit...You reward Bad Behavior!!  You consort with Attorneys like Kelly Page and the corrution runs rampant. I have spoken with many attorneys and showed them the facts of the case and how it was decided and they are stunned.  This would never happen in my court is what i keep hearing.  Some even say that I wouldnt even need an attorney to get custody changed in other courts for something like this.

 Las Vegas Attorney Tom Pitaro ,"  Las Vegas Attorney Tom Pitaro  330 S 3rd St # 86 Las Vegas, Nevada USA ","", ,""," Tom Pitaro knows the law, and is well-known in Las Vegas legal circles, but his tactics are always the same: delay, delay, delay. And you know the saying: Justice delayed is justice denied. These continuous delaying tactics have a major impact on the victims’ lives and mental well-being. Consider the case of the State of Nevada v. Robert Jackson, Case No. C274436. The state is bringing a case against Jackson, who has been accused of shooting four people on the Strip on Aug. 19, 2007. It was an apparent gang fight, except only bystanders were hit with bullets. That was 2007. It’s now 2013. Jackson avoided capture for four years, but even factoring that in, he still hasn’t come to trial. It’s been two years. And Tom Pitaro has engineered almost every delay, using every legal stalling tactic -- in short, every trick in the book -- to keep his client out of the courtroom to face the charges. You name it -- calendar oversights, Jackson present in court without Pitaro, his lawyer, bail battles ... This trial has been continued six times from July 2011 to now. Five of these continuances have been at the hands of Pitaro. And now the new trial date has been set for June 16, 2014. This crime occurred in 2007 and the defendant has yet to be tried.Yeah, thanks for all that, Tom Pitaro. How can guy like Jackson – who has a supposed start-up photo/video business and can’t meet with clients because of his house-arrest restrictions, who has to take care of his elderly incontinent grandparents, and who has fathered another child since returning to Las Vegas – how on earth can he afford representation from the likes of Tom Pitaro, who is known to command substantial legal fees? After all, he was one of the attorneys who was on O.J. Simpson’s defense team. That’s a question the prosecutors should ask. Is Tom Pitaro still smart enough to pull the wool over Clark County D.A.

I was not a shooter, but was right in the middle of this critical incident. We were sequestered to the station where would await our interviews.  The shooting officer, and another witness officer, contacted FOP.  I had CPPA. I have a ""gold"" membership (i.e., covers criminal, civil, and adminstrative) and have been a member for over a decade, always paying my legal defense fees by automatic withdrawal every month.   I went to the Colorado Police Protective Association web-site to obtain contact phone numbers to get legal counsel. I called the local number and the 800 number. On each occasion, the message stated that if I was having a critical incident to hit ""7"".  I did so, and it rolled over to a CPPA message that asked me to leave a message. I even tried e-mailing them in desperation, but could not reach anyone.  It was supposed to roll over to their legal defense phone number, but apparently there was some kind of a problem with it.  As a result, when I needed assistance the most, during this one time in my career, I received absolutely no assistance.  I ended up doing my interview on my own. I was eventually contacted by the CPPA manager who basically accused me of lying. She admitted the web-site was confusing. If you go to it now, they've added a red link to the correct phone.  I asked for my money back, since I'd paid for service from them, and didn't receive it.  The president said she presented it to the board, and they refused to refund the money. They then strongly encouraged me to drop out of CPPA?? This puts me in a precarious position now because if I do drop them I won't have civil and administrative coverage for the rest of this incident. In essence, they really screwed up from the beginning, and now are trying to make me go away and cover the whole thing up.   I strongly encourage all police officers to NOT use CPPA.  When I needed them most they were not there for me.  When you've been involved in a critical incident, and you're afraid of legal, civil, and administrative ramifications, you CANNOT trust CPPA to take care of you.  I paid them a whole lot of money for absolutely nothing, and I encourage you not to make this same mistake.

 Richard F. Scholz III ,"  Richard F. Scholz III  518 Vermont St Quincy, Illinois USA ",www.scholzsucks.com, 217-222-4800,""," IARDC.Org Complaint Response. www.ScholzSucks.Com C. Richard Wray                No. 2013IN03999 3161 W White Oaks Dr. Suite 301 Springfield, IL 62704 In my response to the letter marked September 18, 2013 by Mr. Richard F. Scholz III, I am sorry to say that I not only disagree on his claims that he met with us for at least an hour and twenty minutes, but by analyzing Mr. Scholz’ statements in the way he claims things happened and presenting one key piece of evidence, I can prove we left BEFORE 5:00pm. THIS PARAGRAGH IS TO DESGRIBE WHY I BELIEVE MR SHOLZ IS LYING ABOUT HIS TIME The first reason I say this, is if his secretary does get off at 5:00pm like he claims she does, and if we were truly there for the hour and twenty minutes Mr. Scholz claims he spent with us; then it wouldn’t be his receptionist’s signature on our 500$ receipt. In Exhibit A, it’s highlighted where Mr. Scholz makes specific claims that don’t fit the puzzle. (HOW I KNOW IT’S HIS RECEPTIONIST’S SIGNATURE ON OUR RECIEPT): The first and foremost reason I know it’s her signature on our receipt is I watched her write the receipt out myself. However, Exhibit F bears the same signature as the receipt dated 7-23-2013 (exhibit D).  Exhibit F is a written message FOR “Riff” (aka Mr. Scholz), written by Mr. Scholz’ secretary…meaning that his secretary is the only person who bears this signature. This signature is on BOTH Exhibit F and Exhibit D. THE WAY THINGS HAPPENED: During the consultation, what I was hearing is that he would extend the time and we’d pay him the amount of money out of that retainer for how much work he did. We paid Riff AFTER we explained our situation to him for the fifteen minutes we spent with him. We went out of the consultation room and paid the 500$ in cash to Mr. Scholz’ receptionist. Mrs. Stutheit gave us a receipt (See Exhibit D). (PLEASE CONSIDER WITNESS RELIABILITY) Please note that Mr. Scholz is Mrs. (Ms.) Stutheit’s superior, and there are consequences pertaining her job should she not agree with Mr. Scholz, this is why Mrs. Stutheit is not a reliable witness. The only reason I mentioned her was because I have written confirmation that she was there when we left. HOW I KNOW I DID NOT PAY MR. SCHOLZ BEFORE OR DURING THE CONSULTATION Let’s say that Mr. Scholz’ claims are true in all content (even though they are not), if we were to re-enact the day, consider these observations. If I paid $500 BEFORE the consultation, he wouldn’t have known enough to accept the case. Just in case he tries to claim we paid him before he would talk with us, keep in mind Mr. Scholz makes his statement in exhibit B, “I made that clear AT the conference on July 23rd…” of a non-refundable retainer. He makes it very clear that it was proclaimed DURING the consultation inside his own response; which would mean if I DID pay the 500$ before consultation, he would have still stolen my money by saying it was ‘non-refundable’. And if we ever did agree to a “non-refundable” retainer, it would have been WAY LESS than 500$. And if Mr. Scholz’ claims were accurate, by saying his receptionist only entered the room (according to him, see exhibit A) only to inform him she was leaving, it would insinuate that she left the building without further interaction. If Mr. Scholz’ statements are in any way consistent, it would be HIS signature on our receipt, not his receptionist’s. BUT being that Mr. Scholz’ statements are not accurate, being as I paid his receptionist AFTER the consultation, the receipt acknowledges that his secretary was STILL there. She was there to the very end of our fifteen minutes, to write and sign the receipt. This not only means we got out BEFORE 5:00pm, but also that Mr. Scholz’ claim of his secretary only interacting to inform him that she was leaving is false as well. Meaning that Mr. Scholz is lying about his timing and who was there. This gives his other statements less validity as well. THE REASON I KNOW I DID NOT AGREE TO A ‘NON-REFUNDABLE’ RETAINER We would not have paid 500$ BEFORE we understood what he could do for us. IF I knew that I wasn’t going to be able to get at least SOME of my money back, I would have never asked for his legal representation. He DID say that ALL he COULD do was extend the time line. Sure, I wouldn’t mind extending the timeline, but if I knew his demands were going to be NON-refundable (which he NEVER said) I would have KEPT my money. I would not pay someone $500 non-refundable when they tell me there’s not much I can do and the job is the NEXT day. Plus, why would anybody pay 500$ non-refundable to a person BEFORE they did the job without contract, no matter what their profession? That would be stupid; there would be no warranty that they would accurately DO their job after they got paid. I would NEVER pay ANYONE a non-refundable payment without a letter of engagement, in writing, BEFORE I paid them. Neither would Mr. Heeger. A statement PROMISING that they would do their job. And since we never made that agreement, since I have common sense enough to not waste money like that, the retainer was nothing MORE THAN a regular retainer. THE REASON I KNOW MR. HEEGER WOULD HAVE NEVER AGREED TO A ‘NON-REFUNDABLE’ RETAINER Being that Mr. Heeger is a tougher negotiator than I am and requires everything in writing (not to mention I was right next to him confirmed by Mr. Scholz in Exhibit A). A good example of him requesting things in writing is his request for an itemized statement, talking to Mr. Scholz through email only, and getting receipts of all messages/money given to Mr. Scholz. He would not have agreed to a non-refundable payment either. As Mr. Scholz gives in his exhibit E, Mr. Heeger has obviously done his research on how to get everything in writing. Why would a person who reads books such as this agree to a non-refundable form of payment and NOT get it in writing? Since, Mr. Scholz said that there was not much he could do for us, why would we agree to a non-refundable payment if he couldn’t do much more than we could ourselves? To accuse someone of having a grudge against the system, showing that they’re educating themselves about the system and then trying to make a claim that they made a non-refundable payment agreement without having it in writing (an ignorant move). However Mr. Scholz shows that he is not an ignorant person when pertaining to these matters. That’s an inconsistent and non-realistic statement by Mr. Scholz. IT WASN’T AN EVICTION                 Also another thing I would like to acknowledge is that this case wasn’t an eviction case, it was a demand for possession of property. We didn’t have a rental agreement with the petitioner. This detail shows the lack of effort/time Mr. Scholz put into our representation, meaning that he doesn’t deserve all $500. TRYING TO PAINT A NEGATIVE PICTURE ON ME WITH MR. HEEGER’S DEEDS DOESN’T SOLVE ANYTHING FOR MR. SCHOLZ May I also say that I, Cora Newbold, have NEVER filed any complaints against ANY lawyers until now. Nor have I put up ANY sites of any negative content about the opposing parties OR of Mr. Scholz. Exhibit E features books that I, Cora Newbold, have NEVER read. The only reason I know that those books exist is Mr. Heeger showed me what he used to inform himself during his Mercantile lawsuit in 2007. All of the things Mr. Scholz is using to put ‘us’ in a ‘bad light’ were results of Mr. Heeger’s actions. However, even WITH these actions it DOES NOT give Mr. Scholz an excuse for taking our Money. As he CLEARLY states he represented BOTH of us meaning that I have every right to file this complaint.                 AN EXPLAINATION ON ‘PSYCHOLOGICAL’ PROBLEMS As it states in the paper, I was very scared about the thought of being homeless. However, that does NOT mean that I carry ANY grudge against the legal system. The only ‘problem’ that I psychologically had, had NOTHING to do with the legal system, they had MORE to do with the fact that I had a 10month old, about to get kicked out of a house with nowhere to go. This would make ANYONE in that position anxious. Or as Mr. Heeger likes to colorfully describe it as in Exhibit F “...having a mental break down…”. For Mr. Scholz to take the words ‘psychological problems’, harness them, and use them to create a stereotypical picture, that I am out to harm him in some way due to some mythical ‘grudge’, is unprofessional. Not only is Mr. Scholz not authorized to make that assessment; but to take people merely having a difficult time and blowing it up to insinuate that they’re crazy, (when it’s not their category of expertise) is defaming and discriminatory. Not only that but this subject was brought up to do nothing more than for you to form a negative opinion about me and to avoid the REAL problem. AGAIN MR. HEEGER’S ACTIONS The website, www.ScholzSucks.com, was put up by Mr. Heeger AFTER we found out that Mr. Scholz was wrongfully keeping our money. I admit that Mr. Heeger’s ways of expression are eccentric, but they are nothing more than him expressing his disappointment of Mr. Scholz’ unjust enrichment. Mr. Heeger does have a right to be disappointed, had this not happened in the first place there wouldn’t be a “Scholzsucks.com”. Had Mr. Scholz performed his responsibilities professionally, there would have been no conflict. Sean and I had actually agreed at the time after the court date to give Mr. Scholz $200 out of the original 500$ retainer we paid, out of gratitude for his short-notice representation. However, since Mr. Scholz has created a conflict, drug the conflict out, and has treated us with disrespect, we have changed our minds.                 NO MATTER WHAT THE EXCUSE IT’S AN EXCUSE NONE THE LESS Psychological problems, “grudge against the system”, either way it’s NOT an excuse for Mr. Scholz to take the attention off of his wrong doing and to place it on me. The thing is MOST of these things Mr. Scholz is trying to point a finger at, were all done by Mr. Heeger. I, Cora Newbold, am the one filing the complaint. Not because of ANY ‘grudge’, spite, or ‘psychological’ problem but because I DID NOT AGREE (nor did Mr. Heeger) to a NON-Refundable form of payment! Mr. Scholz has still not proven, if anything he’s disproven, his statements in saying the retainer was non-refundable. He still has neglected to show any way in which the money was used, or PROOF of his work besides in-court representation. Even with his in-court representation, Mr. Scholz was within the court house prior to our hearing anyways, so it wasn’t a big effort to get there. He’s not even on the public court records AS representing us. I still believe that Mr. Scholz owes us at the VERY LEAST $350 in refund.                 I believe that Mr. Scholz’ response is nothing more than an act to take the attention off of himself and place Mr. Heeger and myself in a bad light. I sincerely believe that this response of his was more an aggressive defense than a factual response. I am a VERY LOGICAL, analytical and realistic person. I do NOT impulsively run on emotions like Mr. Scholz is trying to paint me as. I have no conflict with any other lawyer, including Ms. Lannerd, except for Mr. Scholz. You will come to find that everything that Mr. Scholz has said about me pertaining Ms. Lannerd is also another conflict of Mr. Heeger’s. I just want what’s rightfully mine. And since Mr. Scholz so openly tried to put myself in a bad light, let it be known that this is NOT the FIRST time Mr. Scholz has been accused of stealing large sums of money. I will say that these statements come from reports from the media. The comments from another former “client” show how displeased she was with him (Exhibit H), notice how the date is December 21, 2011 showing that it was not recently posted to ‘conspire’ against Mr. Scholz. Then a report from KHQA (a local news group on channel 7) reports on their web site Mr. Scholz being accused of not cashing checks for his client’s estate (see exhibit G). Exhibit I are the comments that are connected to the KHQA report and they too were posted on January-September of 2012 as to again not be accused of any ‘conspiracy’. There IS one positive comment, but that was an interpretation based upon what the rest of his family has done, obviously without knowing him personally. The rest of them are negative, agreeing with ‘Riff’ being a thief.   Thank you, 09/23/2013 ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

IF I knew that I wasn’t going to be able to get at least SOME of my money back, I would have never asked for his legal representation. He DID say that ALL he COULD do was extend the time line. Sure, I wouldn’t mind extending the timeline, but if I knew his demands were going to be NON-refundable (which he NEVER said) I would have KEPT my money. I would not pay someone $500 non-refundable when they tell me there’s not much I can do and the job is the NEXT day. Plus, why would anybody pay 500$ non-refundable to a person BEFORE they did the job without contract, no matter what their profession? That would be stupid; there would be no warranty that they would accurately DO their job after they got paid. I would NEVER pay ANYONE a non-refundable payment without a letter of engagement, in writing, BEFORE I paid them. Neither would Mr. Heeger. A statement PROMISING that they would do their job. And since we never made that agreement, since I have common sense enough to not waste money like that, the retainer was nothing MORE THAN a regular retainer. THE REASON I KNOW MR. HEEGER WOULD HAVE NEVER AGREED TO A ‘NON-REFUNDABLE’ RETAINER Being that Mr. Heeger is a tougher negotiator than I am and requires everything in writing (not to mention I was right next to him confirmed by Mr. Scholz in Exhibit A). A good example of him requesting things in writing is his request for an itemized statement, talking to Mr. Scholz through email only, and getting receipts of all messages/money given to Mr. Scholz. He would not have agreed to a non-refundable payment either. As Mr. Scholz gives in his exhibit E, Mr. Heeger has obviously done his research on how to get everything in writing. Why would a person who reads books such as this agree to a non-refundable form of payment and NOT get it in writing? Since, Mr. Scholz said that there was not much he could do for us, why would we agree to a non-refundable payment if he couldn’t do much more than we could ourselves? To accuse someone of having a grudge against the system, showing that they’re educating themselves about the system and then trying to make a claim that they made a non-refundable payment agreement without having it in writing (an ignorant move). However Mr. Scholz shows that he is not an ignorant person when pertaining to these matters. That’s an inconsistent and non-realistic statement by Mr. Scholz. IT WASN’T AN EVICTION                 Also another thing I would like to acknowledge is that this case wasn’t an eviction case, it was a demand for possession of property. We didn’t have a rental agreement with the petitioner. This detail shows the lack of effort/time Mr. Scholz put into our representation, meaning that he doesn’t deserve all $500. TRYING TO PAINT A NEGATIVE PICTURE ON ME WITH MR. HEEGER’S DEEDS DOESN’T SOLVE ANYTHING FOR MR. SCHOLZ May I also say that I, Cora Newbold, have NEVER filed any complaints against ANY lawyers until now. Nor have I put up ANY sites of any negative content about the opposing parties OR of Mr. Scholz. Exhibit E features books that I, Cora Newbold, have NEVER read. The only reason I know that those books exist is Mr. Heeger showed me what he used to inform himself during his Mercantile lawsuit in 2007. All of the things Mr. Scholz is using to put ‘us’ in a ‘bad light’ were results of Mr. Heeger’s actions. However, even WITH these actions it DOES NOT give Mr. Scholz an excuse for taking our Money. As he CLEARLY states he represented BOTH of us meaning that I have every right to file this complaint.                 AN EXPLAINATION ON ‘PSYCHOLOGICAL’ PROBLEMS As it states in the paper, I was very scared about the thought of being homeless. However, that does NOT mean that I carry ANY grudge against the legal system. The only ‘problem’ that I psychologically had, had NOTHING to do with the legal system, they had MORE to do with the fact that I had a 10month old, about to get kicked out of a house with nowhere to go. This would make ANYONE in that position anxious. Or as Mr. Heeger likes to colorfully describe it as in Exhibit F “...having a mental break down…”. For Mr. Scholz to take the words ‘psychological problems’, harness them, and use them to create a stereotypical picture, that I am out to harm him in some way due to some mythical ‘grudge’, is unprofessional. Not only is Mr. Scholz not authorized to make that assessment; but to take people merely having a difficult time and blowing it up to insinuate that they’re crazy, (when it’s not their category of expertise) is defaming and discriminatory. Not only that but this subject was brought up to do nothing more than for you to form a negative opinion about me and to avoid the REAL problem. AGAIN MR. HEEGER’S ACTIONS The website, www.ScholzSucks.com, was put up by Mr. Heeger AFTER we found out that Mr. Scholz was wrongfully keeping our money. I admit that Mr. Heeger’s ways of expression are eccentric, but they are nothing more than him expressing his disappointment of Mr. Scholz’ unjust enrichment. Mr. Heeger does have a right to be disappointed, had this not happened in the first place there wouldn’t be a “Scholzsucks.com”. Had Mr. Scholz performed his responsibilities professionally, there would have been no conflict. Sean and I had actually agreed at the time after the court date to give Mr. Scholz $200 out of the original 500$ retainer we paid, out of gratitude for his short-notice representation. However, since Mr. Scholz has created a conflict, drug the conflict out, and has treated us with disrespect, we have changed our minds.                 NO MATTER WHAT THE EXCUSE IT’S AN EXCUSE NONE THE LESS Psychological problems, “grudge against the system”, either way it’s NOT an excuse for Mr. Scholz to take the attention off of his wrong doing and to place it on me. The thing is MOST of these things Mr. Scholz is trying to point a finger at, were all done by Mr. Heeger. I, Cora Newbold, am the one filing the complaint. Not because of ANY ‘grudge’, spite, or ‘psychological’ problem but because I DID NOT AGREE (nor did Mr. Heeger) to a NON-Refundable form of payment! Mr. Scholz has still not proven, if anything he’s disproven, his statements in saying the retainer was non-refundable. He still has neglected to show any way in which the money was used, or PROOF of his work besides in-court representation. Even with his in-court representation, Mr. Scholz was within the court house prior to our hearing anyways, so it wasn’t a big effort to get there. He’s not even on the public court records AS representing us. I still believe that Mr. Scholz owes us at the VERY LEAST $350 in refund.                 I believe that Mr. Scholz’ response is nothing more than an act to take the attention off of himself and place Mr. Heeger and myself in a bad light. I sincerely believe that this response of his was more an aggressive defense than a factual response. I am a VERY LOGICAL, analytical and realistic person. I do NOT impulsively run on emotions like Mr. Scholz is trying to paint me as. I have no conflict with any other lawyer, including Ms. Lannerd, except for Mr. Scholz. You will come to find that everything that Mr. Scholz has said about me pertaining Ms. Lannerd is also another conflict of Mr. Heeger’s. I just want what’s rightfully mine. And since Mr. Scholz so openly tried to put myself in a bad light, let it be known that this is NOT the FIRST time Mr. Scholz has been accused of stealing large sums of money. I will say that these statements come from reports from the media. The comments from another former “client” show how displeased she was with him (Exhibit H), notice how the date is December 21, 2011 showing that it was not recently posted to ‘conspire’ against Mr. Scholz. Then a report from KHQA (a local news group on channel 7) reports on their web site Mr. Scholz being accused of not cashing checks for his client’s estate (see exhibit G). Exhibit I are the comments that are connected to the KHQA report and they too were posted on January-September of 2012 as to again not be accused of any ‘conspiracy’. There IS one positive comment, but that was an interpretation based upon what the rest of his family has done, obviously without knowing him personally. The rest of them are negative, agreeing with ‘Riff’ being a thief.   Thank you, 09/23/2013 ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

 Richard F. Scholz III ,"  Richard F. Scholz III  518 Vermont St Quincy, Illinois USA ",www.scholzsucks.com, 217-222-4800,""," IARDC.Org Complaint Response. www.ScholzSucks.Com C. Richard Wray                No. 2013IN03999 3161 W White Oaks Dr. Suite 301 Springfield, IL 62704 In my response to the letter marked September 18, 2013 by Mr. Richard F. Scholz III, I am sorry to say that I not only disagree on his claims that he met with us for at least an hour and twenty minutes, but by analyzing Mr. Scholz’ statements in the way he claims things happened and presenting one key piece of evidence, I can prove we left BEFORE 5:00pm. THIS PARAGRAGH IS TO DESGRIBE WHY I BELIEVE MR SHOLZ IS LYING ABOUT HIS TIME The first reason I say this, is if his secretary does get off at 5:00pm like he claims she does, and if we were truly there for the hour and twenty minutes Mr. Scholz claims he spent with us; then it wouldn’t be his receptionist’s signature on our 500$ receipt. In Exhibit A, it’s highlighted where Mr. Scholz makes specific claims that don’t fit the puzzle. (HOW I KNOW IT’S HIS RECEPTIONIST’S SIGNATURE ON OUR RECIEPT): The first and foremost reason I know it’s her signature on our receipt is I watched her write the receipt out myself. However, Exhibit F bears the same signature as the receipt dated 7-23-2013 (exhibit D).  Exhibit F is a written message FOR “Riff” (aka Mr. Scholz), written by Mr. Scholz’ secretary…meaning that his secretary is the only person who bears this signature. This signature is on BOTH Exhibit F and Exhibit D. THE WAY THINGS HAPPENED: During the consultation, what I was hearing is that he would extend the time and we’d pay him the amount of money out of that retainer for how much work he did. We paid Riff AFTER we explained our situation to him for the fifteen minutes we spent with him. We went out of the consultation room and paid the 500$ in cash to Mr. Scholz’ receptionist. Mrs. Stutheit gave us a receipt (See Exhibit D). (PLEASE CONSIDER WITNESS RELIABILITY) Please note that Mr. Scholz is Mrs. (Ms.) Stutheit’s superior, and there are consequences pertaining her job should she not agree with Mr. Scholz, this is why Mrs. Stutheit is not a reliable witness. The only reason I mentioned her was because I have written confirmation that she was there when we left. HOW I KNOW I DID NOT PAY MR. SCHOLZ BEFORE OR DURING THE CONSULTATION Let’s say that Mr. Scholz’ claims are true in all content (even though they are not), if we were to re-enact the day, consider these observations. If I paid $500 BEFORE the consultation, he wouldn’t have known enough to accept the case. Just in case he tries to claim we paid him before he would talk with us, keep in mind Mr. Scholz makes his statement in exhibit B, “I made that clear AT the conference on July 23rd…” of a non-refundable retainer. He makes it very clear that it was proclaimed DURING the consultation inside his own response; which would mean if I DID pay the 500$ before consultation, he would have still stolen my money by saying it was ‘non-refundable’. And if we ever did agree to a “non-refundable” retainer, it would have been WAY LESS than 500$. And if Mr. Scholz’ claims were accurate, by saying his receptionist only entered the room (according to him, see exhibit A) only to inform him she was leaving, it would insinuate that she left the building without further interaction. If Mr. Scholz’ statements are in any way consistent, it would be HIS signature on our receipt, not his receptionist’s. BUT being that Mr. Scholz’ statements are not accurate, being as I paid his receptionist AFTER the consultation, the receipt acknowledges that his secretary was STILL there. She was there to the very end of our fifteen minutes, to write and sign the receipt. This not only means we got out BEFORE 5:00pm, but also that Mr. Scholz’ claim of his secretary only interacting to inform him that she was leaving is false as well. Meaning that Mr. Scholz is lying about his timing and who was there. This gives his other statements less validity as well. THE REASON I KNOW I DID NOT AGREE TO A ‘NON-REFUNDABLE’ RETAINER We would not have paid 500$ BEFORE we understood what he could do for us. IF I knew that I wasn’t going to be able to get at least SOME of my money back, I would have never asked for his legal representation. He DID say that ALL he COULD do was extend the time line.

It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected; the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. “Making things right” can mean a lot of different things to different people, but our point is this - by working closely with the company or individual to resolve any disputes, Ripoff Report can track the footprints of customer service to ensure that our Corporate Advocacy Program members are doing everything they can to treat customers fairly and to increase their customer satisfaction.

By Ed Magedson - Founder, Ripoff Report  Glen Lerner Injury Attorneys approaches Ripoff Report with the intent of wanting to resolve any customer issues and reports posted on Rip-off Report. As a Part of the Corporate Advocacy Program the member business allows Ripoff Report to send an email to all of those who filed a complaint in the past, letting the customer know, the member business wanted to make things right with them, whatever it takes to do so. Ripoff Report always monitors these emails to insure the member business does what they agreed to. The people at Glen Lerner Injury did just that. This national law firm for injured people has gone through great lengths to make sure they try and resolve any and all customer issues. They joined the Corporate Advocacy Program because they want customers to know they will resolve any and all customer issues. They never want their customers to feel like they weren’t taken care of. Mr. Lerner stated “My national personal injury law firm wouldn’t be where it is today if we didn’t care enough about our clients to offer them the highest level of representation in their time of need.” LAW FIRM CONTINUES TO CLARIFY WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY CAN DO FOR CLIENTS   ”""Glen Lerner Injury Attorneys has been in the business of providing the best possible representation to our clients since 1991. Our personal injury attorneys and support staff work together to help ensure that are client's best interests are maintained, in and out of the courtroom. We are not out to make a quick buck, but to get the most compensation available, when possible, to cover our clients expenses, damages, future medical requirements and pain and suffering.” WHY THIS LAW FIRM FOR INJURED PEOPLE IS BETTER THAN THEIR COMPETITORS  The attorneys of this national personal injury law firm have built a reputation of aggressively negotiating settlements for clients and getting them the most amount of money possible to cover medical expenses, damages, and ongoing financial obligations. This national law firm handles personal injury cases of all sizes. What makes this law firm better is that their attorneys and support staff are easily accessible 24/7 and they are more willing to take on cases that other personal injury law firms have declined to handle. Another quality that makes this national law firm better is that their affiliated network of lawyers are also skilled at representing clients with military injury claims (TSGLI) and mass tort claims against dangerous drug and defective product liability manufacturers.

Oxley Esq.   16935 West Bernardo Drive Suite#104 San Diego, California USA ",www​.deniseoxleylaw.com, (858) 486-4823,""," ***Stay CLEAR from attorney Denise Oxley located in San Diego. She is a SCAM artist posing as an attorney who will steal thousands upon thousands of your dollars in fees all the while doing it with a smile on her face. She will steal from me, and she sure as hell will steal from YOU. She is nothing but a cash starved snake. If I can save just ONE other person from being deceived and robbed of their hard earned money by her, then registering on this site was all worth it and I'll continue shouting it out everywhere!  You have been WARNED... My mother was in need of a family/divorce attorney to settle assets from a marriage and Denise Oxley was recommended.. and boy do I wish I went against the advice because this lady will keep a case going as long as she possibly can to secure as much $$$ as she can. My mother doesn't speak English all too well and Miss Oxley knowing this, took full advantage of the situation. [continued below]....																			..... After growing concern, my mom asked me if I could be involved and be present at her meetings alongside Oxley after she had been going to the attorney's office for some time alone. She wanted me there to ensure that everything was being communicated properly because of her poor English and to take notes. Which son wouldn't? After returning from my first meeting with Oxley and my mom present, mom told me on the drive home that Oxley's attitude had completely changed, for the better this time, simply because I showed up. She was right. I kept thinking to myself in that office that Oxley appeared nervous for no apparent reason. Interesting. I made no issue of it, and brushed it off because I wanted further confirmation, and because I wanted to give Oxley a fair shot and to further investigate. I then met with Oxley and my mom for just the second time ever in her office, and the FIRST thing that came out of Oxley's mouth after the handshake was her concern for ME being present at these meetings. I wonder why??.. She claimed that I was a threat to the case because I could be subjected into the case from the opposing attorney's side. I almost laughed upon hearing this because at that moment, I knew the only THREAT I became to anything at all was HER bank account! I called her out on her B.S. politely and told her that I felt it was important for me to be there for my mom regardless of her opinion. It was hard, but you could see her blushing through her black skin. Her reaction was all we needed to know. We were deceived, and there was nothing we could do about it or the thousands and thousands of dollars we invested in this worthless, incapable, ""attorney"". DON'T be fooled by her secretary Yolanda Meija either. She's the secretary up front who's 60+ years old and pathetically tries to dress like she's still in her 20's.. There isn't enough clothing to conceal that kind of sag. Yolanda, the secretary was for some strange reason allowed to take notes during their meetings.. but I the son wasn't?? It didn't pass the smell test. They are both in it together for the sake of profiteering off of vulnerable people, and I saw it first hand. My recommendation for you is to find an attorney who is actually qualified, who will fight for you, not with you. An attorney who studied in America. She got her degree from who knows from where, in England. Don't be taken like we were. Invest the TIME to find someone who is capable before paying ANY attorney ANY fee. That was my mistake. Let it not be yours.  Good luck to you and your case. - No need to say it.. You are welcome! ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

 Las Vegas Attorney Tom Pitaro  ,"  Las Vegas Attorney Tom Pitaro   330 S 3rd St # 860 Las Vegas, Nevada USA ","", (702) 382-9221,""," Tom Pitaro knows the law, and is well-known in Las Vegas legal circles, but his tactics are always the same: delay, delay, delay. And you know the saying: Justice delayed is justice denied. These continuous delaying tactics have a major impact on the victims’ lives and mental well-being. Consider the case of the State of Nevada v. Robert Jackson, Case No. C274436. The state is bringing a case against Jackson, who has been accused of shooting four people on the Strip on Aug. 19, 2007. It was an apparent gang fight, except only bystanders were hit with bullets. That was 2007. It’s now 2013. Jackson avoided capture for four years, but even factoring that in, he still hasn’t come to trial. It’s been two years. And Tom Pitaro has engineered almost every delay, using every legal stalling tactic -- in short, every trick in the book -- to keep his client out of the courtroom to face the charges. You name it -- calendar oversights, Jackson present in court without Pitaro, his lawyer, bail battles ... This trial has been continued six times from July 2011 to now. Five of these continuances have been at the hands of Pitaro. And now the new trial date has been set for June 16, 2014. This crime occurred in 2007 and the defendant has yet to be tried.Yeah, thanks for all that, Tom Pitaro. How can guy like Jackson – who has a supposed start-up photo/video business and can’t meet with clients because of his house-arrest restrictions, who has to take care of his elderly incontinent grandparents, and who has fathered another child since returning to Las Vegas – how on earth can he afford representation from the likes of Tom Pitaro, who is known to command substantial legal fees? After all, he was one of the attorneys who was on O.J. Simpson’s defense team. That’s a question the prosecutors should ask. Is Tom Pitaro still smart enough to pull the wool over Clark County D.A.

I hurt my back in a car accident a few years ago and had to undergo therapy, injections and even back surgery."" Mr. Sobel went on to say that he knows “…how frustrating it is to be effected at work and limited in my regular daily activities, so I am happy to be able to help guide my injured clients through their recoveries.”Eric Pintaluga, one of the founding partners, echoed Mr. Sobel’s enthusiasm, stating, “I have a responsibility and a duty to make sure the clients’ rights are protected when they’re injured in an accident.”The information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Louis Mosca during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..Kanner & Pintaluga is an accident injury law firm with offices in multiple states. “We provide aggressive legal representation for people injured in an accident. We strive to make sure our clients recover physically from whatever medical care they need and ultimately receive the maximum compensation for their medical bills, pain and suffering,” states Kevin Sobel, a representative of the company. “We are licensed in numerous states and we have a track record of success. I, myself, am licensed to practice in GA, FL, MA and MN. We have no bar issues and thousands of satisfied customers,” he explains. Leads are typically acquired through telephone, radio and internet advertising, as well as referrals from current and past clients.The sales process typically involves an office associate receiving a phone call from a potential client who is interested in retaining the services of the law firm. The representative will discuss the details of the case and the process with the client to determine the next step. “We like to hold the client’s hand through the process as much as possible to make sure they receive the care they need and receive as much money as possible,” explains Mr. Sobel. The associates at Kanner & Pintaluga strive to be very hands-on with their clients, keeping a detailed file for each client, documenting every step in the case. “I personally touch every file that comes into my office,” states Mr. Sobel. The law firm is also entirely paperless, which allows them the opportunity to work with their clients from anywhere. “The phones are open 24/7. I answer e-mails any time I’m awake. We really try to help our clients get through a difficult time,” states Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. Client Care & Complaint Resolution At times, clients may not feel satisfied with the services they received. “The frequent complaint we get from clients is either they didn’t get enough money, or didn’t get money quick enough. Unfortunately, this is going to happen through no fault of our own,” explains Mr. Sobel. He further explains that this can be caused by a federal or state law that is impacting the case, the amount of medical damages they may have, or simply the facts of the case itself. To try and avoid these issues in the first place, Mr. Sobel and his team strive to educate the clients up-front with regard to what they should expect, what types of damages are covered, and what documentation is needed. After a complaint is resolved, Kanner & Pintaluga make following up with the client a priority. “We always follow up after a complaint. I do take it personally with my business,” states Mr. Sobel. “Happy clients don’t post negative complaints on the internet, so we go out of our way to make sure the customer is well educated on the things we can and cannot control. We follow up and the goal is to see clients pain free and walking away happy.”Mr. Sobel and his team take into consideration the time and money spent by the client, and strive to get the client what they need. “Missing out on a gym membership, lost wages, paying for extra help at home… It’s important that’s clients get compensated for every element of their damages, pain and suffering,” he states. They also strive to keep their clients informed throughout every step of the process, utilizing any form of communication necessary to keep in touch with the client, whether it’s a phone call, e-mail, or text message.In response to complaints lodged against his company on Ripoff Report, Mr. Sobel states, “I would like to point out that a number of the complaints seem fabricated and appear to be posted out of places that I do not work, by named that don’t match any of our clients or past clients’ names. Even still, we address every complaint, no matter how legit or complete.”Since receiving complaints, the team at Kanner & Pintaluga has instituted a property damage department where they can assist clients’ recovery, and they strive to be available to their clients at any time of the day. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. / Senior Managing Attorneys  ""The passion for client advocacy and service is obvious at Kanner & Pintaluga. Each client's case is overseen by a senior managing attorney, such as Kevin Sobel for the Georgia offices, who assigns an associate attorney and two (2) case managers who are available via email, text, phone and in person, to respond to questions or concerns at every stage of the process. These case managers are knowledgeable about their clients’ cases and use the same methods of communication to keep clients apprised of any developments in their case.Kanner & Pintaluga provides aggressive and effective legal representation to clients throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennesee ando ther states, with the highest standards of excellence, compassion and integrity.

""In response to client demand, and in an ongoing efforts to help clients in need, Kanner & Pintaluga created an entire new department consisiting of staff that specialize exclusively in handling clients’ property damage claims; property damage services are provided at no cost to clients who have bodily injury cases with the firm. This business move underscores K&P’s goal: allowing clients to focus on getting better while K&P focus on dealing with the responsible party and navigating the intricacies of the case. “We want our clients to use their time and energy towards their recovery. They can’t get better if they don’t get medical attention, and they can’t get to the doctor’s office without some sort of transportation,” said Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga property damage experts are happy to coordinate damage assessments, rental car services, and more.  The majority of our complaints (besides the fakes ones) are clients wanting more settlement money and/or settlement money faster. We combat this by providing as much information as possible up front to the clients, repeatedly by way of letters, emails conference calls, and/or meetings, to set appropriate expectations for how cases work.We work tirelessly for our clients, long days, nights and weekends, to ensure they get what they need. Our phones are answered 24/7 and we respond to emails at all hours.

I was in a car accident they recommended I go to therapy because I have some neck & upper back pain after I started going to therapy I had to call them at least once a month to get an update on my case. They NEVER called me. Most of the time the girls that answer the phone would just transfer me to a voice mail. I had not heard from them in a over 3 months. Im A busy Full-Time student & I work a 40 Plus hour job overnight to support myself so my time is very limited. I hadn't had time to call them & even if I did I would just get transferred to a voice mail anyways. (They would never return my calls) I had to call over 3 times to be able to speak with an actual ""HUMAN"" He then informed me that they are not taking my case! I was very upset to say the least not that they did not take my case after the investigation they did. What I was really upset about was the fact that they didn't have the decency to call me, email me, or get in contact with and informed me they couldn't take my case. I asked them repeatedly when did they find out that they could not take my case? Nobody had an answer... simply they told me that they would send me a letter in the mail explaining why. I asked them why did nobody inform me by phone or email or even send me a letter before? they once again had noooooooo... answer for me. I was very polite and nice even though i was fuming and it didn't help that nobody really spoke english. so i had to speak spanish to them they could understand me. They declined to inform me when they knew that I was not going to be an eligible client to them.

[continued below]....																					.....Kevin Sobel, the managing attorney of K&P's Georgia offices fights hard for his clients because he knows what they are going through from personal experience, ""I've been there. I hurt my back in a car accident a few years ago and had to undergo therapy, injections and even back surgery."" Mr. Sobel went on to say that he knows “…how frustrating it is to be effected at work and limited in my regular daily activities, so I am happy to be able to help guide my injured clients through their recoveries.”Eric Pintaluga, one of the founding partners, echoed Mr. Sobel’s enthusiasm, stating, “I have a responsibility and a duty to make sure the clients’ rights are protected when they’re injured in an accident.”The information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Louis Mosca during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..Kanner & Pintaluga is an accident injury law firm with offices in multiple states. “We provide aggressive legal representation for people injured in an accident. We strive to make sure our clients recover physically from whatever medical care they need and ultimately receive the maximum compensation for their medical bills, pain and suffering,” states Kevin Sobel, a representative of the company. “We are licensed in numerous states and we have a track record of success. I, myself, am licensed to practice in GA, FL, MA and MN. We have no bar issues and thousands of satisfied customers,” he explains. Leads are typically acquired through telephone, radio and internet advertising, as well as referrals from current and past clients.The sales process typically involves an office associate receiving a phone call from a potential client who is interested in retaining the services of the law firm. The representative will discuss the details of the case and the process with the client to determine the next step. “We like to hold the client’s hand through the process as much as possible to make sure they receive the care they need and receive as much money as possible,” explains Mr. Sobel. The associates at Kanner & Pintaluga strive to be very hands-on with their clients, keeping a detailed file for each client, documenting every step in the case. “I personally touch every file that comes into my office,” states Mr. Sobel. The law firm is also entirely paperless, which allows them the opportunity to work with their clients from anywhere. “The phones are open 24/7. I answer e-mails any time I’m awake. We really try to help our clients get through a difficult time,” states Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. Client Care & Complaint Resolution At times, clients may not feel satisfied with the services they received. “The frequent complaint we get from clients is either they didn’t get enough money, or didn’t get money quick enough. Unfortunately, this is going to happen through no fault of our own,” explains Mr. Sobel. He further explains that this can be caused by a federal or state law that is impacting the case, the amount of medical damages they may have, or simply the facts of the case itself. To try and avoid these issues in the first place, Mr. Sobel and his team strive to educate the clients up-front with regard to what they should expect, what types of damages are covered, and what documentation is needed. After a complaint is resolved, Kanner & Pintaluga make following up with the client a priority. “We always follow up after a complaint. I do take it personally with my business,” states Mr. Sobel. “Happy clients don’t post negative complaints on the internet, so we go out of our way to make sure the customer is well educated on the things we can and cannot control. We follow up and the goal is to see clients pain free and walking away happy.”Mr. Sobel and his team take into consideration the time and money spent by the client, and strive to get the client what they need. “Missing out on a gym membership, lost wages, paying for extra help at home… It’s important that’s clients get compensated for every element of their damages, pain and suffering,” he states. They also strive to keep their clients informed throughout every step of the process, utilizing any form of communication necessary to keep in touch with the client, whether it’s a phone call, e-mail, or text message.In response to complaints lodged against his company on Ripoff Report, Mr. Sobel states, “I would like to point out that a number of the complaints seem fabricated and appear to be posted out of places that I do not work, by named that don’t match any of our clients or past clients’ names. Even still, we address every complaint, no matter how legit or complete.”Since receiving complaints, the team at Kanner & Pintaluga has instituted a property damage department where they can assist clients’ recovery, and they strive to be available to their clients at any time of the day. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. / Senior Managing Attorneys  ""The passion for client advocacy and service is obvious at Kanner & Pintaluga. Each client's case is overseen by a senior managing attorney, such as Kevin Sobel for the Georgia offices, who assigns an associate attorney and two (2) case managers who are available via email, text, phone and in person, to respond to questions or concerns at every stage of the process. These case managers are knowledgeable about their clients’ cases and use the same methods of communication to keep clients apprised of any developments in their case.Kanner & Pintaluga provides aggressive and effective legal representation to clients throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennesee ando ther states, with the highest standards of excellence, compassion and integrity. K&P is committed to obtaining the maximum compensation to which our clients are entitled. We always provide personalized attention and deliver prompt communication so that our clients always know where their case stands.”STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM YOUR COMPANY NAME. ""In response to client demand, and in an ongoing efforts to help clients in need, Kanner & Pintaluga created an entire new department consisiting of staff that specialize exclusively in handling clients’ property damage claims; property damage services are provided at no cost to clients who have bodily injury cases with the firm. This business move underscores K&P’s goal: allowing clients to focus on getting better while K&P focus on dealing with the responsible party and navigating the intricacies of the case. “We want our clients to use their time and energy towards their recovery. They can’t get better if they don’t get medical attention, and they can’t get to the doctor’s office without some sort of transportation,” said Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga property damage experts are happy to coordinate damage assessments, rental car services, and more.  The majority of our complaints (besides the fakes ones) are clients wanting more settlement money and/or settlement money faster. We combat this by providing as much information as possible up front to the clients, repeatedly by way of letters, emails conference calls, and/or meetings, to set appropriate expectations for how cases work.We work tirelessly for our clients, long days, nights and weekends, to ensure they get what they need. Our phones are answered 24/7 and we respond to emails at all hours.

I paid my $70.00 then met with Craig C. (Owner). He assured me he could help me no problem and had the perfect lawyer for the case, he called her the ""Bull dog"" because she was a Pitt bull in court, his contempt queen who supposedly specializes in contempt cases. He told me we could get her on contempt and purgery. I said whatever it takes to get her to stop all this and let me be with my daughter again because this has to be destroying her. Craig then told me we could do this for $3250.00, I agreed then walked downstairs with him to meet Lisa Berg aka ""bull dog"" . We talked about my case, I gave her all my court papers, she told me we had a good contempt case and valid purgery charges, she then asked me if I could handle it or be alright with the fact that she will be going for the jugular! I responded ""this is my daughter's mother, I normally wouldn't do this but this time she went too far but if this is what it takes to make her stop doing this to me and my daughter then cool! Let's do it. Lisa then went on to discuss her rate of $295.00 an hour her paralegals rate of $125.00 he etc.. and assured me we could get it done for the $3250.00 . She had me sign the paper work hiring her as my attorney. My court hearing was in two in a half weeks and I asked if that would be a problem and she said no not at all but we may not be going to court on that day because she was going to be getting it extended. I felt so relieved and comforted so I gave them a check for $3250.00 and didn't hear anything back from them until the day before court which I found kind of odd since I had so much more to tell them and give to them and that was only because I had left messages asking if we would be going. Lisa called me and told me we did in fact have court and what time I should be there. We showed up for court the next day only for me to find out she had not even looked at my file nor even knew anything at all about my case. In the courthouse she was just making a complete idiot out of herself, didn't know what questions to ask, studdering, etc.. I was trying to help her out by giving her evidence and telling her what happens and what to ask but she kept telling me to shut up! I started to become agitated and I think it began to show. I thought my head was going to explode. She caused me more harm in that case because I was not allowed to talk. We lost the case. There was never any mention of contempt or purgery. Without her I would have won. I had all the evidence, everything prepared. I had this. She is trying to Bill me the full amount. I expect a little more out of a $295.00 hr. attorney. I mean you would think they would at least look over my file and have some clue. So here I am, broke and still missing my daughter with no clue as to what to do next. Any ideas?

 Tom Pitaro ,"  Tom Pitaro  330 S 3rd St # 860 Las Vegas, Nevada USA ",http://www.pitaro.net, (702) 382-9221,""," Las Vegas attorney Tom Pitaro knows the law, and is well-known in Las Vegas legal circles, but his tactics are always the same: delay, delay, delay. And you know the saying: Justice delayed is justice denied. These continuous delaying tactics have a major impact on the victims’ lives and mental well-being. Consider the case of the State of Nevada v. Robert Jackson, Case No. C274436. The state is bringing a case against Jackson, who has been accused of shooting four people on the Strip on Aug. 19, 2007. It was an apparent gang fight, except only bystanders were hit with bullets. Again, that was 2007. It’s now 2013. Jackson avoided capture for four years, but even factoring that in, he still hasn’t come to trial. It’s been two years. And Tom Pitaro has engineered almost every delay, using every legal stalling tactic - in short, every trick in the book - to keep his client out of the courtroom to face the charges. You name it - calendar oversights, Jackson present in court without representation (by Pitaro), bail battles ... This trial has been continued six times from July 2011 to now. Five of these continuances have been at the hands of Pitaro. And now the new trial date has been set for June 16, 2014. This crime occurred in 2007 and the defendant has yet to be tried.Yeah, thanks for all that, Tom Pitaro. How can guy like Jackson – who has a supposed startup photo/video business and can’t meet with clients because of his house-arrest restrictions, who has to take care of his elderly incontinent grandparents, and who has fathered another child since returning to Las Vegas – how on earth can he afford representation from the likes of Tom Pitaro, who is known to command substantial legal fees? After all, he was one of the attorneys who was on O.J. Simpson’s defense team. That’s a question the prosecutors should ask. Is Tom Pitaro still smart enough to pull the wool over Clark County D.A.

 Tony Abbatangelo ,"  Tony Abbatangelo   Las Vegas, Nevada USA ","", ,""," That's the latest law firm endeavor from Las Vegas attorney Tony Abbatangelo.  We'll overlook the personal issues of domestic violence (a couple years back he was removed from the bench for beating his wife) and focus on the facts around how he cheated the system, aided and abetted others in cheating the system, and pretty much got away with it. So far.Perry Klein and business partner Alan Rapoport invested together and built an 11,000-square-foot mansion in Lake Las Vegas in Henderson. Klein moved into the house when it was finished, but Rapoport had him evicted. How, you wonder? Rapoport got a lot of help from Assemblyman Scott Sibley and Judge Tony Abbatangelo. Here's how it went down:    Abbatangelo is the key. In a supposed random paperwork process, he was the judge who signed a temporary protective order on Rapoport's behalf that led to Klein's eviction from the house. Assemblyman Sibley, also a process server, served the papers to Klein that compelled him to leave the house. The connection between Abbatangelo and Sibley is Jason Huffer, an advisor to the judge at the time as well as Sibley's campaign manager. According to a Las Vegas Journal Review story there were some ""90 phone calls between all the men in three days' time."" Document time stamps show the protective order was granted by Abbatangelo before the application for it was even filed.  Like the headline says: do we cheat 'em, and how! Klein won a 2006 judgment totaling $10 million in a suit that named Rapoport and Sibley as defendants. However he's yet to collect anything. Abbatangelo was not named in the suit. We'll see how long Abbatangelo can avoid legal scrutiny in his role in this. ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

 Tony Abbatangelo -  ,"  Tony Abbatangelo -   611 S 6th St Ste 220 Las Vegas, Nevada USA ","", ,""," You don’t want to get on the wrong side of things with former Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Tony Abbatangelo and his political cronies. You could find yourself suddenly locked out of your own house. That’s what happened to Perry Klein. He and business partner Alan Rapoport collaborated on building a house – well, an 11,000-square-foot mansion – at Lake Las Vegas in Henderson. When the house was built, Klein moved in, and Rapoport moved to cut his ties with his partner. So Rapoport enlisted a little help – from an assemblyman who worked as a process server, and Judge Abbatangelo. In what is normally a random assignment of legal paperwork, Abbatangelo somehow became the judge who made the decision to sign a temporary protective order that effectively forced Klein out of the house. And it all happened lightning-fast. And, let’s remember, the house is in Henderson. Abbatangelo was a judge in Las Vegas. Two different jurisdictions.But things backfired on Abbatangelo. In a suit filed by Klein, some interesting things came to light. A man by the name of Jason Huffer proved to be the key. He managed the assemblyman’s election campaign, and he just so happened to run the re-election campaign of Abbatangelo as well. Hmmmm. Wonder how the assemblyman and the judge got together? The jury in the case found that Assemblyman Scott Sibley deliberately conspired to violate a citizen's rights. By definition, a conspiracy must involve more than one person. And who was that other person who aided in this conspiracy? Judge Abbatangelo.And the jury in the case returned a sobering judgment in favor of Klein. Rapoport was ordered to pay Klein $4.9 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages. Assemblyman Sibley was ordered to pay Klein $100,000 for abusing his position as a process server.And Judge Abbatangelo? Well, he was about to come undone in a very different way involving his wife, domestic violence, a public censure, and a four-year ban on serving as a judge. But that’s another story.

The attorney that most of the persons fighting for their title hired is Mr Raul Ruiz. He failed to deliver a single title after 3 years yet he has continued to bill everybody. A few months ago somebody informed us that we did not have to pay Mr Ruiz anymore as the Notary 13 of tepic was going to take care of the matter for homeowners and fix the situation. Ruiz continues to bill people even though these people have no need of using him. I am much more calm knowing that my case is now in the hands of a notary public and not of a scammer theif lawyer. He has not had any progress whatsoever on the case and they claim that they are coming to an end. He claims the developer is coming close to settling the matter with us but the story sounds fishy. They say that he is going to sign all titles and give up all common properties that currently belong to him, including parking, pools, restaurants and commercial units. This doesnt seem like something a scammer is going to do so I think they are lying and since I stopped paying him my money I feel less robbed and way more calm. I reccomend all acqua homeowners to reach out to the Notary 13 to settle their matter without spending another penny on this crooked lying theif.

He was removed from the bench for beating his wife and barred in March 2011 from running to be elected as a Justice of the Peace again for four years. He admitted attacking his then-wife of 13 years.Here’s the thing: Domestic violence is never acceptable. And according to his wife’s testimony, “Terrible Tony ‘tangelo” had been choking and attacking her for two years before it all came to a head during an argument in 2008. Here are some of the details of the attack between the couple, as reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal: “ ... they got into a fight because, [his wife] claims, he's been going to Seamless, a topless club. She claims Abbatangelo grabbed her by the neck and shoved her against a wall. Abbatangelo then choked her until she had trouble breathing, yelled at her and spit into her face, according to [a] temporary restraining order. The couple continued to fight in the house. She contends he grabbed her by the hair and dragged her through a hallway. She eventually got away and hid in the backyard of the house until he left, she stated. ... Sue Abbatangelo suffered noticeable injuries to her neck, according to a Las Vegas police domestic battery report taken about an hour after the incident. The report states Sue Abbatangelo was crying, nervous and fearful.”Terrible Tony was convicted in 2009 of misdemeanor battery, domestic violence. He was sentenced to two days house arrest, community service and domestic violence counseling. Seriously?Hitting a woman is never OK, no matter what the situation or what the context of the disagreement -- especially when it involves a Justice of the Peace, like Tony ‘tangelo was. At least he’s no longer that – a Justice of the Peace. He lost a bid for a third term after the conviction. He’s also remarried – to Henderson dentist Tina Brandon – and is trying to put this whole domestic violence thing behind him. Let’s hope the counseling took hold, for his new wife’s sake.

He said such nasty things and that I would be put in jail for 3-5 Years unless I paid him, this was not my debt, but a family members,  we defaulted on the loan but had every intention of paying it,  but I did not want the family member to know that we defaulted.  So he insisted on taking $3,000 in payments and I gave him my debit card and he debited about $1,200 out of my checking account and said that he would do the rest later. So like two days later,  I spoke to my family member,  who indicated that she was already on a repayment agreement with another company for the same debt. So she contacted the other company who said that we had just been ripped off of $1,000.00.  When the other company called Seneca Asset Management to inquire,  they hung up on them. The other company said that Seneca Asset Management did not own the debt and the $1,000 we just gave them was stolen from us.  The also researched and found out the was no Attorney in the United States named Les, Lester or Leslie Michaels that was afiliated with Seneca Asset Management. The company told me that this was a civil matter and that since my family member acknowledged the debt and was making payments and that they owned the debt that there was no fraud involved.  And that a company can not use tactics like that to collect a debt,  as long as the debt is being repaid in good faith.   The company also indicated that Seneca Asset Management did not read me the mini miranda act and that they should have not been discussing the matter with me under any circumstances.

You will get the same results. I hired Shannon Reid to have my wifes speeding ticket reduced from 13 to 9 mph over. I paid him the day before the court date and he said it would be taken care of. Two months later I receive a notice that her license will be revoked next month for failure to appear. We call Shannon who apologizes and says he will take care of it that week. My wife calls at the end of the week and he says that he hasn't gotten around to it, but we have plenty of time before her license is revoked. I call him back and tell him we have found another attorney. He changes his story and says that he DID take care of the ticket and that it just takes time to go to the DMV. I called the courts next Tuesday and they tell me he still hasn't done anything. So I go ahead and get another attorney who fixes everything the next day. So if your thinking about using FRT, go with one of the many other attorneys that will actually show up at your court date, or at least fix things when they make a mistake. I have no doubt he would have let my wifes license be revoked. A quick Google search shows that Shannon has been disciplined by the state bar in the past for doing the same thing, and he now has another complaint in the works from me. Shannon stopped picking up the phone when I call, so my only recourse at this time is to spread the word about how he treats his clients and protect other people from going through my experience.

 Debra Grimalia ,"  Debra Grimalia  19200 Von Karman Ave Irvine, Ca 92612 Irvine, California USA ","", 9497608775,""," I had gone to see Debra on Aug 19th at her Irvine office everything i express in this message is my sole opinon based on meeting Debra personally myself. This is not an attempt to slander anyone but warn others from blunders such as these.   As I usually do before I go on using any type of outside service I attempt to screen there background & reputation just to get a better feel for the persons practice & area of expertise.  I had gone on to see that Debra had what looked like were "" people Issues"" being reported against her in the past, I didnt think TOO much of it as she seemed to respond to complaints & ultimatley resolve the matter.  I also went on Yelp & saw that she had a few poor remarks, but after speaking to her I thought I should at least speak to her face to face to determine this for myself, & if all went well to see about possibly retaining her since she was readily available.  Debra stated she was free that afternoon & schecduled to see me that same day. She seemed very eager to see but I just figured she was high energy or something. After waiting in the lobby for at least 20 minutes she comes out & brings me to her 8x8 office (room) way in the back of the hall; that should of been a red light right away to me to get away as it could harldly be called an office & more like a bedroom.  We had gone on to discuss what I thought was a ""Free Consulation"" where later in the conversation she had stated (after I had driven to her office)  ""that I will have to pay her $300 no matter what since my consulation is taking so much time""  I had questioned this at first and then she states ""but you were going to hire me anyway right.? So no big deal"".  I go on to explain my situation & we devise not only a final retainer price which I had conferenced in a third party as they were sharing the costs of the retainer with me (which he heard everything)  but also devised a strategy, expectations & a time frame that Debra would execute this strategy for us. She had agreed with us that the parties at hand would recieve custom specific letters within 24-48 hours, and she was going to charge us $300 per letter.  After talking Debra down from 7 letters to 4 letters as she was very insistent on sending a letter to EVERYONE, she then goes on to tell me that I need to give her at least 500-800 more worth of extra funds for her to return calls speak to the parites recieving letters etc. I agreed & paid her $2k to write 4 letters,& resolve a final resolution with the party we were having the problem with & to ensure the matter ulitmalty is closed with no one unscaved.  Keep in mind this was Monday afternoon, by the next day at 3 pm I had sent what she had asked me for regarding licensing to her email within 24 hours & had not heard any type of response or conformation at all that day.  Generally a response such as "" recieved "" is apprecaited.    I had called Wed Afternoon 8-21 and followed up & left a message around 11 am, no response back ALL DAY, I even emailed her as well still NO response.  I finallly sent another email on Thursday 8-22 regarding speaking to her & called her office & again left a message.  Finally she calls me back around Noon and goes on to tell me she had a deposition & it was time sensitive & she is very sorry she had not returned my calls but YES she did get my email.  I explained to her the time sesitivie nature of this situation & how I was expecting these letters to be in the mail already, especially since I paid her for this.  Which she insisted I Pay Cash, & after asking her why she does not accept credit card she remarks & I quote"" FYI, I do not take credit cards, because the world is filled with people like you who like to get something for nothing""..  This was hrt response, this is the type of attitude & position she had the entire time she was more like a relative staying at my house more then an attorney advising me, she even likes to make her point by dropping the occasional "" F "" bomb, for an older lady this again is something I am not use to, escpeially by an attorney. From here it was all down hill, she called me back an hour later or so & tells me she typed up a formal response & that she emailed this to me for my review. After reading the letter I had gone on to share with Debie a few points that needed to be revised & how I did not want to sound so FORTHCOMING in the letter, but moreover that I must be crazy to pay $300 x 4, for the same letter.  Debra then becomes upset & starts talking over me & shouting & hollering, about I dont know what I'm saying & that I told her only to write one letter, & that the agency recieveng the letter is going to know its ME by my lic # if i remove my lic. # in the letter as a reference no one will figure out its regarding my specific matter.  I go on to tell her I am certain someone will see "" MY NAME"" & put too & too together.  She then becomes more upset & states that maybe this is not working out & that she shouldn't be my attorney anymore.  All this is taken place within a matter of 2-3 minutes of our conversation the first day after my consulation.  I go on to tell her if she feels this way that maybe we shouldnt work together & she goes on to say immediatly there after almost like she had it planned "" I WILL send you an invoice & refund any monies that I deem unused. "" Keep in mind I never even spoke to this lady before today other then our orginal cousulation 3 days ago, never recieved any letter, never recieved any coorespondence, never even had her send THE ACTUAL PARTY AT HANDa mailed LETTER, I never even recieved a response via email until TODAY...  This lady did nothing for me, I spoke to her twice today 8-22 for a combined time of 7 minutes and she chargs me $180.00 for this alone & goes on to justify her fee saying ""its in the contract"".  She even charges me $90.00 to type up the final invoice, she is really hurting for money or just a really dishonest person. This lady is really someone you need to consider twice before using, she is not relaible & in 3 days she did NOTHING for me and charged me over $1700.00, of course she will go on to attempt to justify her fees but saying she did this & did that & spoke to me for 2 hours when we just met, but again this is just an attempt to say she earned these bogus fees. How is she going to charge me $750 for a consulation when I never agreed to this.   She is unprofessinonal & goes on to tell me her husband is leaving her & that she needs to get 'PAID"".  Debra is out for herself & has casused me a huge amount of stress & worry, all she wasted valuable time for me & cost me alot of money I dont have.  I dont have any reason to spend over an hour writing this complaint trying to warn others unless my grievance has merit & truth.  I will formally seek a greivance with the state bar regarding this matter & I encourage others to step forward if you share an experience like mine.

Mr. Sobel went on to say that he knows “…how frustrating it is to be effected at work and limited in my regular daily activities, so I am happy to be able to help guide my injured clients through their recoveries.”Eric Pintaluga, one of the founding partners, echoed Mr. Sobel’s enthusiasm, stating, “I have a responsibility and a duty to make sure the clients’ rights are protected when they’re injured in an accident.”The information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Louis Mosca during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..Kanner & Pintaluga is an accident injury law firm with offices in multiple states. “We provide aggressive legal representation for people injured in an accident.

I, myself, am licensed to practice in GA, FL, MA and MN. We have no bar issues and thousands of satisfied customers,” he explains. Leads are typically acquired through telephone, radio and internet advertising, as well as referrals from current and past clients.The sales process typically involves an office associate receiving a phone call from a potential client who is interested in retaining the services of the law firm. The representative will discuss the details of the case and the process with the client to determine the next step. “We like to hold the client’s hand through the process as much as possible to make sure they receive the care they need and receive as much money as possible,” explains Mr. Sobel.

Client Care & Complaint Resolution At times, clients may not feel satisfied with the services they received. “The frequent complaint we get from clients is either they didn’t get enough money, or didn’t get money quick enough. Unfortunately, this is going to happen through no fault of our own,” explains Mr. Sobel. He further explains that this can be caused by a federal or state law that is impacting the case, the amount of medical damages they may have, or simply the facts of the case itself. To try and avoid these issues in the first place, Mr. Sobel and his team strive to educate the clients up-front with regard to what they should expect, what types of damages are covered, and what documentation is needed. After a complaint is resolved, Kanner & Pintaluga make following up with the client a priority. “We always follow up after a complaint. I do take it personally with my business,” states Mr. Sobel. “Happy clients don’t post negative complaints on the internet, so we go out of our way to make sure the customer is well educated on the things we can and cannot control. We follow up and the goal is to see clients pain free and walking away happy.”Mr. Sobel and his team take into consideration the time and money spent by the client, and strive to get the client what they need. “Missing out on a gym membership, lost wages, paying for extra help at home… It’s important that’s clients get compensated for every element of their damages, pain and suffering,” he states. They also strive to keep their clients informed throughout every step of the process, utilizing any form of communication necessary to keep in touch with the client, whether it’s a phone call, e-mail, or text message.In response to complaints lodged against his company on Ripoff Report, Mr. Sobel states, “I would like to point out that a number of the complaints seem fabricated and appear to be posted out of places that I do not work, by named that don’t match any of our clients or past clients’ names.

This law firm should not be allowed to practice in any state! Duluth Georgia I regret doing business with this law firm! I was in an accident and sawc an advertisment on the television for Kanner & Pintaluga; so I decided to call them to represent me. I regret doing so! Kevin SOble, the lawyer representing my case, never returns phone calls, told me that he will not release my funds from the accident until he is good and ready! Samantha Pentegrast, who is the office manager or assistant of some kind, has been extrememly rude and hung up on me severl times. The doctors that Kevin Sobel told me to go to have over charged me and one I never even saw. I am possibly facing bankruptcy due to this law firm, Kanner & Pintaluga. They do not care about their clients needs and should not be allowed to practice in any state! I sent Kanner & Pintaluga a letter notifying them of Mr. Kevin Soble and Samantha Pentegrast's behaviors, but I received no reply. I made sure send every letter to this law firm certified with return and receipt. I further explained to Kevin Soble that I would be filing a complaint with the State Bar of Georgia and he, without fear or regard said they will not do anything to him but ask him a few questions. I have posted this complaint as a deterent for other future victums to this unethical law firm that should not be allowed to practice law of any kind, nor cause future problems to any other person! I truly hope that the Georgia State Bar does makemake Mr. Kevin Soble accountable for his actions!

[continued below]....																					.....Kevin Sobel, the managing attorney of K&P's Georgia offices fights hard for his clients because he knows what they are going through from personal experience, ""I've been there. I hurt my back in a car accident a few years ago and had to undergo therapy, injections and even back surgery."" Mr. Sobel went on to say that he knows “…how frustrating it is to be effected at work and limited in my regular daily activities, so I am happy to be able to help guide my injured clients through their recoveries.”Eric Pintaluga, one of the founding partners, echoed Mr. Sobel’s enthusiasm, stating, “I have a responsibility and a duty to make sure the clients’ rights are protected when they’re injured in an accident.”The information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Louis Mosca during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..Kanner & Pintaluga is an accident injury law firm with offices in multiple states. “We provide aggressive legal representation for people injured in an accident. We strive to make sure our clients recover physically from whatever medical care they need and ultimately receive the maximum compensation for their medical bills, pain and suffering,” states Kevin Sobel, a representative of the company. “We are licensed in numerous states and we have a track record of success. I, myself, am licensed to practice in GA, FL, MA and MN. We have no bar issues and thousands of satisfied customers,” he explains. Leads are typically acquired through telephone, radio and internet advertising, as well as referrals from current and past clients.The sales process typically involves an office associate receiving a phone call from a potential client who is interested in retaining the services of the law firm. The representative will discuss the details of the case and the process with the client to determine the next step. “We like to hold the client’s hand through the process as much as possible to make sure they receive the care they need and receive as much money as possible,” explains Mr. Sobel. The associates at Kanner & Pintaluga strive to be very hands-on with their clients, keeping a detailed file for each client, documenting every step in the case. “I personally touch every file that comes into my office,” states Mr. Sobel. The law firm is also entirely paperless, which allows them the opportunity to work with their clients from anywhere. “The phones are open 24/7. I answer e-mails any time I’m awake. We really try to help our clients get through a difficult time,” states Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. Client Care & Complaint Resolution At times, clients may not feel satisfied with the services they received. “The frequent complaint we get from clients is either they didn’t get enough money, or didn’t get money quick enough. Unfortunately, this is going to happen through no fault of our own,” explains Mr. Sobel. He further explains that this can be caused by a federal or state law that is impacting the case, the amount of medical damages they may have, or simply the facts of the case itself. To try and avoid these issues in the first place, Mr. Sobel and his team strive to educate the clients up-front with regard to what they should expect, what types of damages are covered, and what documentation is needed. After a complaint is resolved, Kanner & Pintaluga make following up with the client a priority. “We always follow up after a complaint. I do take it personally with my business,” states Mr. Sobel. “Happy clients don’t post negative complaints on the internet, so we go out of our way to make sure the customer is well educated on the things we can and cannot control. We follow up and the goal is to see clients pain free and walking away happy.”Mr. Sobel and his team take into consideration the time and money spent by the client, and strive to get the client what they need. “Missing out on a gym membership, lost wages, paying for extra help at home… It’s important that’s clients get compensated for every element of their damages, pain and suffering,” he states. They also strive to keep their clients informed throughout every step of the process, utilizing any form of communication necessary to keep in touch with the client, whether it’s a phone call, e-mail, or text message.In response to complaints lodged against his company on Ripoff Report, Mr. Sobel states, “I would like to point out that a number of the complaints seem fabricated and appear to be posted out of places that I do not work, by named that don’t match any of our clients or past clients’ names. Even still, we address every complaint, no matter how legit or complete.”Since receiving complaints, the team at Kanner & Pintaluga has instituted a property damage department where they can assist clients’ recovery, and they strive to be available to their clients at any time of the day. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. / Senior Managing Attorneys  ""The passion for client advocacy and service is obvious at Kanner & Pintaluga. Each client's case is overseen by a senior managing attorney, such as Kevin Sobel for the Georgia offices, who assigns an associate attorney and two (2) case managers who are available via email, text, phone and in person, to respond to questions or concerns at every stage of the process. These case managers are knowledgeable about their clients’ cases and use the same methods of communication to keep clients apprised of any developments in their case.Kanner & Pintaluga provides aggressive and effective legal representation to clients throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennesee ando ther states, with the highest standards of excellence, compassion and integrity.

The law firm is open to hearing client concerns and sees them as an opportunity to learn from past mistakes and become more efficient in the legal services they offer. Ripoff Report knows first-hand, one of the biggest long time complaints with attorneys is, they do not respond to your calls having a heck of a time getting them to keep you up to date on your case. Not so with Glen Lerner. Someone will always keep you informed. EDitor’s UPDATE: Positive rating and recognition has been given to  Glen Lerner Injury Attorneys for their commitment to excellence in customer service.The information provided in this report is based on comments made by Brian Prezgay and Kevin Rowe during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Glen Lerner.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..Glen Lerner's law firm employs injury attorneys. They focus mainly on personal injury claims which include automobile accidents, tractor trailer accidents, motorcycle accidents, and personal property accidents (i.e. slips, falls, etc.). They also handle social security and disability claims. Glen Lerner's injury attorney's also extend their services to include criminal defense, DUI defense, bankruptcy, and real estate sales.Glen Lerner's attorneys set themselves apart from other competitors by the level of commitment and compassion from the entire team.  Kevin Rowe, of Lerner and Rowe, is not only a boss, but an active team member; he prides himself on his passion and desire to help every person that he is able to.  Mr. Rowe has a motto that the way things are now are “never enough,” meaning that he pushes his team to strive for better.  He wants a “volume based company with a boutique feel for the customer” so each and every client feels as though they are the only client and receive full and satisfying attention from the entire team.  The desire to help people and provide special attention to each case as it comes into the business is the basis for the level of customer service provided for each and every person who comes through the door.  There is a wealth of knowledge and experience among the team members, with some holding 40 years of experience.  Mr. Rowe stated that he wants everyone to be able to learn something new every day just from interacting with each other.  The team members will also go to clients if they are unable to come into the office, ensuring that they can help in any way possible.  Exit reviews/surveys are completed for every client once their case is settled or resolved, to find out any problems the client had with the process and/or what positive experiences the client had.  Mr. Rowe stated that he wants to know the good and the bad so the company can continue to improve their practices.  Glen Lerner and Lerner & Rowe also contributes and volunteers with a large charity base throughout Arizona, making donations, volunteering time, attending events and participating as much as possible.  Mr. Rowe discussed his own personal experiences with several local charities and explained that the entire office gets involved as well.  He has been involved with Phoenix Children’s Hospital, Phoenix Rescue Mission, Susan G. Komen, and Arizona Chapter for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, as well as several others.  Lerner and Rowe have setup a webpage giving information on events and charities they are involved with for anyone who is interested: lernerandrowegivesback.com.  Glen Lerner's attorneys acquire clients through their multi-media advertising campaigns, and from referrals from past and present clients.  The company advertises on television, radio, internet, billboards, bus stops and cabs.  Mr. Lerner stated that many clients come to them due to hearing the jingle on the radio or seeing the commercials, but a large amount of clients are through referrals.  The clients speak with one of the In-take Specialists when they first come into the office or when the call is received, discussing the issue and proceeding from there.The typical experience a client should expect to receive is individual attention and a feeling that they are the only client.  Each client is provided with a knowledgeable team, who are available at any time to answer questions or concerns, to provide updates and just to check to see how the client is doing.  Glen Lerner's attorneys strive to provide a satisfying experience for each client and to give a sense of relief and assurance of help, so the client can focus on getting better and on their recovery, not having to worry about the case details.When the client comes in to the office, calls, or makes contact with any of Glen Lerner's offices, initially they speak with an Intake specialist, who takes some details and then assigns the case to a specific team.  This is the team that the client will work with through the entire process, consisting of a Case Manager (paralegal), Attorney, Associate Attorney, Co-Case Manager, and Accounting Team.  The client receives communication and information from the Case Manager and Attorney primarily; the other team members are supportive and administrative roles, helping the Case Manager and Attorney.  The Case Manager and Attorney are expected to provide consistent communication throughout the entire process, no matter how long the case takes.  If there is any kind of delay in the case or time while waiting for information from Medical Providers or Insurance, the Case Manager and Attorney are responsible for reviewing the case and contacting the client at least once a month. ”During the onsite interview with Kevin Rowe, of Lerner & Rowe, we asked Mr. Rowe to describe their standard process for taking care of a complaint: “The standard process for taking care of a complaint is a little different depending on if it is a current client or a past client.  If a current client has a complaint about the Case Manager, Co-Case Manager or Associate Attorney, the supervising Attorney will speak with the client for resolution.  If unable to provide resolution or if the complaint is about the Attorney, it is reviewed by me and my team of Executive Assistants.  I will speak with the client directly, in person or by phone, to find out more information about the complaint and to find the best resolution for the situation.  If a past client has a complaint, I will call the client to speak about the situation and try to provide a resolution.  Each case is notated each time it is accessed, for conversations with the client to updates in the case.  Each notation gives a detailed explanation of what was discussed, any offer made or information that was given regarding the case.  When I speak with a client regarding a complaint I review all of the information to find out if something went wrong or if a client is upset because the outcome was not what they were expecting or wanting.  I try to understand what caused the complaint and to provide the best resolution to the situation at hand.  Through utilization of exit surveys for current clients many complaints or concerns are resolved before the client leaves allowing for resolution and communication at the time it occurred.  I take every concern or complaint to heart and try to provide resolution for situations as quickly as possible; sometimes I am unable to provide complete resolution depending on the situation.  I take all concerns or complaints personally and work tirelessly to provide satisfaction and closure for my clients, past and present.”In addition to how their office handles complaints, Mr. Rowe was asked to describe a specific situation where a client was not satisfied with the level of service they received: “The client was upset with a situation regarding the settlement; there was a discrepancy from what was offered originally and what was received.  I called the client to discuss the situation, while speaking with the client and with the review of the notes and information regarding the case, the discrepancy was found.  I was able to correct the issue and made an offer of resolution for the situation.  The resolution was accepted by the client and they expressed deep satisfaction for the quick resolution.  The client has since referred friends and family to us, stating that he is very thankful for our help and sincerity for the entire process.” ”The process for dealing with insurance company requests starts with obtaining all necessary information from the client, requesting medical records/bills for any doctor/hospital visits.  Glen Lerner's attorneys are at the mercy of the medical providers to send the information as quickly as possible, it can take several weeks, months sometimes for the records to be received.  Once everything is received, the information is provided to the insurance company for review and determination.  The insurance company can take between 30-45 days for review.  The delays and time it takes that has spurred complaints about how insurance claims are handled are due to the length of time medical providers and insurance company review takes, it is not something that can be controlled by Glen Lerner's attorneys.  Mr. Lerner stated that the company is not able to go pick up medical records or force the insurance review process to move faster or keep to the time frame given when the reports are sent.  He stated, “We do not gain anything from delaying the process, it is better for the company for the process to run smoothly and quickly.”Some internal processes needing improvement include the size of caseloads each team handles; the company is in process and has already seen improvement of hiring additional staff to lessen the case loads.  The teams are already benefitting from the increase in people and are able to better help clients efficiently and effectively.  Also needing some additional improvement was general training and expectations of the company for newer employees.  Improved training and learning expectations for the company have contributed to better communication with clients and between team members.  Mr. Lerner strives to have pro-active client contact and communication, instead of re-active, he wants to have the teams reach out to the clients and make sure everything is going okay, not to have the clients calling concerned with the process.The changes seen have been better communication with clients and lessened case load for the teams, allowing more efficiency and effective client interaction.  Additional supportive and administrative staff allows more functionality of the office and allows the teams to focus on the clients more.  Concerns are easier to address and resolve and no client is being overlooked or falling through the cracks.  Mr. Lerner stated that he has a quote that he found a few years ago that he sends to his teams to remind everyone that the client is the most important part of this business, without them we have no business.  The quote he gives; “A client is the most important visitor on our premises, he is not dependent on us, we are dependent on him.  He is not an interruption of our work; he is the purpose of it.  He is not an outsider of our business; he is a part of it.  We are not doing him a favor by serving him; he is doing us a favor by allowing us to serve him.”In order to do whatever it takes to make the client happy, Mr. Lerner advises his employees to maintain pro-active communication and satisfaction for each and every client. Providing answers and resolution in an effective and efficient manner allows each team to best address clients’ concerns/issues.  Providing the best and most qualified staff, and the level of knowledge provided throughout each team allows Glen Lerner's attorneys to “do whatever it takes” to provide satisfaction.The creation of the exit surveys and addition of the administrative and supporting staff have been some results from the complaints made on Ripoff Report.  Additional training and expanded expectations have also been directly related to the complaints.It means a great deal to Glen Lerner to be part of the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program; it is a huge benefit to the company.  Mr. Lerner stated that it is the essence of the business and its practices.This national law firm for injured people's owner, Mr. Lerner, has informed us that a majority of the law firm's clients are hardworking individuals who deserve to be treated with understanding and respect.  As a successful business owner, Mr. Lerner feels it is important to listen and address each client's concerns and questions in a timely manner. By making client concerns a priority, Mr. Lerner hopes to create lasting relationships with clients and their loved ones for many years to come. ”Another top employee of the law firm told us that Mr. Lerner's philosophy on client treatment is based on the premise that ""Most of the people the law firm represents are hardworking individuals who are seeking assistance after they have been harmed due to no fault of their own. Our clients already feel victimized. Once they contact us it is our job to try and help relieve some of their anxiety, not create more.  That is why the attorneys and support staff of the law firm are required to work hard and do their best to represent clients in their time of need."" Some of the other things Ripoff Report learned in the course of its review: typical customer feedback reads:  “I contacted Mr. Lerner's office (Glen Lerner Injury Attorneys and they set up a free consultation the day I called. Everyone was super helpful and started working on my case immediately. I was surprised at how fast everything was taken care of and the fact that it is free for them to file your lawsuit. I was skeptical about hiring an attorney at first, but I felt like I was left with no option; I tore some tendons and the hotel (where the injury occured) did nothing to help.  I highly recommend Mr. Lerner's personal injury law office."" GLEN LERNER INJURY ATTORNEYS / STATEMENT FROM THE OWNER ""I learned what it takes to create a successful business and law firm from scratch.  In 1991 I started my own law practice working 18 – 20 hour days.  I wrote and typed out my own letters, answered my own phone calls and handled each of my client’s cases from start to finish.  All of those long hours and hard work allows a person to be able to train their staff to also be able to do everything and to know that nothing but 100% is acceptable in handling a client’s case.  That is why when I hire people I stress how important it is that they go above and beyond to provide the best possible service to our clients after they have been hurt by the negligence action or inaction of another.  This basic business philosophy of hiring people who care about other people has also contributed to the growth of my one man law firm turning into one of the largest plaintiff’s personal injury law firms in the country with over 35 lawyers and 125 support staff working in Nevada, Arizona, Illinois, Florida, Minnesota, and Louisiana.  My national personal injury law firm wouldn’t be where it is today if we didn’t care enough to help those in their time of need.”STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM THIS NATIONAL PERSONAL INJURY LAW FIRMGlen Lerner Injury Attorneys recognize that complaints posted on Ripoff Report (whether true or not) are issues that need to be addressed, not ignored.

Rip Off Report has determined the following Report against GLEN LERNER INJURY ATTORNEYS to be false and absolutely untrue. Unfortunately, this post could have been written by a competitor, as many in this business are at each other’s throats.    Ripoff Report based this determination on the findings of a 3rd party verifier we hired to inspect the offices of GLEN LERNER INJURY ATTORNEYS.  Based on that inspection, we found the accusations/statements in the report below to be both false and misleading, and should not be considered when evaluating the reputation of Glen Lerner Injury Attorneys August 19, 2013 Las Vegas Nevada September 1, 2012 I was hit by a car. The woman was Texting. I was taken to the hospital.  Sustained injuries that will take time to heal. THANK GOD I AM ALIVE. Sept. 8, 9, I called for Mr. Glen Lerner, whom I had seen on television, the internet.  He always says ""GET GLEN"" DONT GET ANOTHER ATTORNEY,  GET THE HEAVY HITTER.  GET THE MONEY YOU DESERVE""  So I called the number 702-877-1500. Each time I asked for Mr. Lerner, I was told ""he is out of the city, the state, the country, on a sabbatical"".  Finally, the last time I called, I was asked ""what do you want to talk to Mr. Lerner about""?  I told the man that I had been hit by the car and wanted to interview and attorney to see if he would be a match for my case.  ""OH, WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THAT, he said. AT NO CHARGE TO YOU WE WILL SEND AN INVESTIGATOR TO YOU, TO TAKE YOUR INFORMATION AND THEN WE WILL CALL YOU TO MEET YOU""  He went on to say ""WE WORK ON A CONTINGENCY, SO YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO PAY IF WE DON'T WIN YOUR CASE"".  At that point, I agreed to meet with the ""investigator"".  So, we set up an appointment to meet at a small Mexican Cafe on the patio under an umbrella.  When the ""investigator"" arrived, I was sitting there.  He introduced himself and then immediately handed me ""papers"" to sign.  I asked ""WHAT ARE THESE PAPERS?  NO ONE TOLD ME I WOULD SIGN ANYTHING"".  ""I DIDN'T BRING MY GLASSES WITH ME SO I CAN'T READ THEM.  WILL YOU READ THEM TO ME""?   He replied ""I NEED THESE PAPERS SIGNED TO GIVE ME PERMISSION TO TAKE YOUR INFORMATION BACK TO THE ATTORNEY.  IT IS NOT MY JOB TO READ THE PAPERS TO YOU; THE ATTORNEY WILL READ THEM TO YOU AND EXPLAIN EVERYTHING WHEN THEY CALL YOU TO COME IN TO MEET WITH THEM"".  Then, in the conversation, I said ""THANK GOD, THAT AN ANGEL PULLED ME BACK. I COULD HAVE FALLEN UNDER THE CAR"".  In that conversation, he said ""I AM A SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER"" ;  YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SIGNING THESE PAPERS.  YOU WON'T HAVE AN ATTORNEY UNTIL THEY CALL YOU AND MEET WITH YOU TO EXPLAIN THE POLICIES AND FIND OUT ABOUT YOU"".  He gained my confidence and I SIGNED THE PAPERS.  I asked him for his business card and he told me ""I DON'T HAVE ONE WITH ME, BUT YOU WON'T SEE ME AGAIN"".  (Well about 3 weeks a go I found him through one of my medical practitioners and I went unexpectedly to see him.  He pretended not to know me at first, but I refreshed his memoray about ""being a Sunday School Teacher"".  Then he told me , ""I will call JUSTIN RANDALL, the attorney whom I had just met in March, 2013 and tell him to take the Lien off and I will call you"".  HE NEVER CALLED, BUT I CALLED HIM AND HE SAID ""JUSTIN RANDALL TOLD ME NOT TO TALK TO YOU AND HUNG UP THE PHONE"". After I had signed those papers in Sept. 2012, I never had a phone call from an Attorney until March, 2013. At that time, I insisted on meeting the attorney, who said his name is JUSTIN RANDALL.  He REFUSED to meet me UNTIL AFTER he got an offer from the Insurance company.  He called me back and said ""I have an offer of $30,000.; you will get about $1000., we will get 1/3 and the medical bills of $22,000. will be paid"".  I REFUSED THAT OFFER.  He called a second time and said ""the insurancae company willl pay $37,000. and you will get about $2000. and IF YOU CALL THE MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS, THEY MANY REDUCE THEIR BILLS AND YOU WILL END UP WITH ABOUT $6,000.  I REFUSED AND SAID ""NO, I WANT TO GO TO COURT"".  JUSTIN RANDALL REPLIED "" YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING IF YOU GO TO COURT"". The next day being April 2, 2013, I received an email from the insurance company advising me that ""GLEN LERNER INJURY ATTORNEYS HAVE ""ELECTED"" TO DROP THIS CASE"".  On April 11, I received my file with a letter ""AS PER YOUR REQUEST"" this file is sent to you.    I NEVER REQUESTED THE FILE!!!  I NEVER HAD A DISCUSSION WITH JUSTIN RANDALL OR ANY ATTORNEY ABOUT MY ACCIDENT, MY CASE OR ANY EXPLANATION OF ANY KIND. On April 2, 2013, JUSTIN RANDALL SENT THE INSURANCE COMPANY A ""LIEN"" AGAINST MY NAME FOR $14,276.64, CHANGING IT FROM $12,000( some odd figures sent prior to that one on the same day).  JUSTIN RANDALL WROTE A PHONE CALL FOR $400. AND A LETTER FOR $2000. on that LIEN the same day.  I can prove the phone call did NOT exist for that amount of time and I NEVER RECEIVED A LETTER. This is bad for me, but if anyone googles REVIEWS ON GLEN LERNER, they will find that he is doing this all over the USA; ASSOCIATING HIMSELF WITH OTHER ""CROOKS"" IN THE FILED OF LAW.  VICTIMS ARE BEING 'VICTIMIZED'. I have found one in a Walmart Store in a Wheel Chair; another one whose mother was victimized in her 90's by those crooks. I would ask everyone who reads this and has been made a VICTIM BY GLEN LERNER, HIS ATTORNEYS OR ANY ATTORNEY TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO REPORT IT TO RIPOFFREPORTS.COM AND OTHER SITES, PLUS CALL YOUR SENATORS, CONGRESSMAN AND THE PRESIDENT, IF NECESSARY.  CONTACT THE  MAJOR TELEVISION STATIONS, BLOG ON THE INTERNET.  MAKE SURE YOU STAND FOR ""PRINCIPLE"" AS THE GOAL IS TO ""CLEAN UP"" OUR WORLD.  DON'T JOIN THE CROOKS IN THEIR DARKNESS.  THEY WILL STUMBLE AND FALL SOONER OR LATER.  IN THE MEANTIME, WE MUST PROTECT OURSELVES. I MUST GET THAT LIEN OFF MY NAME...AND NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW OR WILL TELL YOU HOW TO DO IT.  I HAVE FOUND A WAY AND I WILL UPDATE RIPOFFREPORTS AFTER IT IS COMPLETED. STAND FOR PRINCIPLE - RESEARCH EVERY COMPANY AND SERVICE BEFORE MEETING WITH THEM.

Not so with Glen Lerner. Someone will always keep you informed. EDitor’s UPDATE: Positive rating and recognition has been given to  Glen Lerner Injury Attorneys for their commitment to excellence in customer service.The information provided in this report is based on comments made by Brian Prezgay and Kevin Rowe during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Glen Lerner.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..Glen Lerner's law firm employs injury attorneys. They focus mainly on personal injury claims which include automobile accidents, tractor trailer accidents, motorcycle accidents, and personal property accidents (i.e. slips, falls, etc.). They also handle social security and disability claims. Glen Lerner's injury attorney's also extend their services to include criminal defense, DUI defense, bankruptcy, and real estate sales.Glen Lerner's attorneys set themselves apart from other competitors by the level of commitment and compassion from the entire team.  Kevin Rowe, of Lerner and Rowe, is not only a boss, but an active team member; he prides himself on his passion and desire to help every person that he is able to.  Mr. Rowe has a motto that the way things are now are “never enough,” meaning that he pushes his team to strive for better.  He wants a “volume based company with a boutique feel for the customer” so each and every client feels as though they are the only client and receive full and satisfying attention from the entire team.  The desire to help people and provide special attention to each case as it comes into the business is the basis for the level of customer service provided for each and every person who comes through the door.  There is a wealth of knowledge and experience among the team members, with some holding 40 years of experience.  Mr. Rowe stated that he wants everyone to be able to learn something new every day just from interacting with each other.  The team members will also go to clients if they are unable to come into the office, ensuring that they can help in any way possible.  Exit reviews/surveys are completed for every client once their case is settled or resolved, to find out any problems the client had with the process and/or what positive experiences the client had.  Mr. Rowe stated that he wants to know the good and the bad so the company can continue to improve their practices.  Glen Lerner and Lerner & Rowe also contributes and volunteers with a large charity base throughout Arizona, making donations, volunteering time, attending events and participating as much as possible.  Mr. Rowe discussed his own personal experiences with several local charities and explained that the entire office gets involved as well.  He has been involved with Phoenix Children’s Hospital, Phoenix Rescue Mission, Susan G. Komen, and Arizona Chapter for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, as well as several others.  Lerner and Rowe have setup a webpage giving information on events and charities they are involved with for anyone who is interested: lernerandrowegivesback.com.  Glen Lerner's attorneys acquire clients through their multi-media advertising campaigns, and from referrals from past and present clients.  The company advertises on television, radio, internet, billboards, bus stops and cabs.  Mr. Lerner stated that many clients come to them due to hearing the jingle on the radio or seeing the commercials, but a large amount of clients are through referrals.  The clients speak with one of the In-take Specialists when they first come into the office or when the call is received, discussing the issue and proceeding from there.The typical experience a client should expect to receive is individual attention and a feeling that they are the only client.  Each client is provided with a knowledgeable team, who are available at any time to answer questions or concerns, to provide updates and just to check to see how the client is doing.  Glen Lerner's attorneys strive to provide a satisfying experience for each client and to give a sense of relief and assurance of help, so the client can focus on getting better and on their recovery, not having to worry about the case details.When the client comes in to the office, calls, or makes contact with any of Glen Lerner's offices, initially they speak with an Intake specialist, who takes some details and then assigns the case to a specific team.  This is the team that the client will work with through the entire process, consisting of a Case Manager (paralegal), Attorney, Associate Attorney, Co-Case Manager, and Accounting Team.  The client receives communication and information from the Case Manager and Attorney primarily; the other team members are supportive and administrative roles, helping the Case Manager and Attorney.  The Case Manager and Attorney are expected to provide consistent communication throughout the entire process, no matter how long the case takes.  If there is any kind of delay in the case or time while waiting for information from Medical Providers or Insurance, the Case Manager and Attorney are responsible for reviewing the case and contacting the client at least once a month. ”During the onsite interview with Kevin Rowe, of Lerner & Rowe, we asked Mr. Rowe to describe their standard process for taking care of a complaint: “The standard process for taking care of a complaint is a little different depending on if it is a current client or a past client.  If a current client has a complaint about the Case Manager, Co-Case Manager or Associate Attorney, the supervising Attorney will speak with the client for resolution.  If unable to provide resolution or if the complaint is about the Attorney, it is reviewed by me and my team of Executive Assistants.  I will speak with the client directly, in person or by phone, to find out more information about the complaint and to find the best resolution for the situation.  If a past client has a complaint, I will call the client to speak about the situation and try to provide a resolution.  Each case is notated each time it is accessed, for conversations with the client to updates in the case.  Each notation gives a detailed explanation of what was discussed, any offer made or information that was given regarding the case.  When I speak with a client regarding a complaint I review all of the information to find out if something went wrong or if a client is upset because the outcome was not what they were expecting or wanting.  I try to understand what caused the complaint and to provide the best resolution to the situation at hand.  Through utilization of exit surveys for current clients many complaints or concerns are resolved before the client leaves allowing for resolution and communication at the time it occurred.  I take every concern or complaint to heart and try to provide resolution for situations as quickly as possible; sometimes I am unable to provide complete resolution depending on the situation.  I take all concerns or complaints personally and work tirelessly to provide satisfaction and closure for my clients, past and present.”In addition to how their office handles complaints, Mr. Rowe was asked to describe a specific situation where a client was not satisfied with the level of service they received: “The client was upset with a situation regarding the settlement; there was a discrepancy from what was offered originally and what was received.  I called the client to discuss the situation, while speaking with the client and with the review of the notes and information regarding the case, the discrepancy was found.  I was able to correct the issue and made an offer of resolution for the situation.  The resolution was accepted by the client and they expressed deep satisfaction for the quick resolution.  The client has since referred friends and family to us, stating that he is very thankful for our help and sincerity for the entire process.” ”The process for dealing with insurance company requests starts with obtaining all necessary information from the client, requesting medical records/bills for any doctor/hospital visits.  Glen Lerner's attorneys are at the mercy of the medical providers to send the information as quickly as possible, it can take several weeks, months sometimes for the records to be received.  Once everything is received, the information is provided to the insurance company for review and determination.  The insurance company can take between 30-45 days for review.  The delays and time it takes that has spurred complaints about how insurance claims are handled are due to the length of time medical providers and insurance company review takes, it is not something that can be controlled by Glen Lerner's attorneys.  Mr. Lerner stated that the company is not able to go pick up medical records or force the insurance review process to move faster or keep to the time frame given when the reports are sent.  He stated, “We do not gain anything from delaying the process, it is better for the company for the process to run smoothly and quickly.”Some internal processes needing improvement include the size of caseloads each team handles; the company is in process and has already seen improvement of hiring additional staff to lessen the case loads.  The teams are already benefitting from the increase in people and are able to better help clients efficiently and effectively.  Also needing some additional improvement was general training and expectations of the company for newer employees.  Improved training and learning expectations for the company have contributed to better communication with clients and between team members.  Mr. Lerner strives to have pro-active client contact and communication, instead of re-active, he wants to have the teams reach out to the clients and make sure everything is going okay, not to have the clients calling concerned with the process.The changes seen have been better communication with clients and lessened case load for the teams, allowing more efficiency and effective client interaction.  Additional supportive and administrative staff allows more functionality of the office and allows the teams to focus on the clients more.  Concerns are easier to address and resolve and no client is being overlooked or falling through the cracks.  Mr. Lerner stated that he has a quote that he found a few years ago that he sends to his teams to remind everyone that the client is the most important part of this business, without them we have no business.  The quote he gives; “A client is the most important visitor on our premises, he is not dependent on us, we are dependent on him.  He is not an interruption of our work; he is the purpose of it.  He is not an outsider of our business; he is a part of it.  We are not doing him a favor by serving him; he is doing us a favor by allowing us to serve him.”In order to do whatever it takes to make the client happy, Mr. Lerner advises his employees to maintain pro-active communication and satisfaction for each and every client. Providing answers and resolution in an effective and efficient manner allows each team to best address clients’ concerns/issues.  Providing the best and most qualified staff, and the level of knowledge provided throughout each team allows Glen Lerner's attorneys to “do whatever it takes” to provide satisfaction.The creation of the exit surveys and addition of the administrative and supporting staff have been some results from the complaints made on Ripoff Report.  Additional training and expanded expectations have also been directly related to the complaints.It means a great deal to Glen Lerner to be part of the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program; it is a huge benefit to the company.  Mr. Lerner stated that it is the essence of the business and its practices.This national law firm for injured people's owner, Mr. Lerner, has informed us that a majority of the law firm's clients are hardworking individuals who deserve to be treated with understanding and respect.  As a successful business owner, Mr. Lerner feels it is important to listen and address each client's concerns and questions in a timely manner. By making client concerns a priority, Mr. Lerner hopes to create lasting relationships with clients and their loved ones for many years to come. ”Another top employee of the law firm told us that Mr. Lerner's philosophy on client treatment is based on the premise that ""Most of the people the law firm represents are hardworking individuals who are seeking assistance after they have been harmed due to no fault of their own. Our clients already feel victimized. Once they contact us it is our job to try and help relieve some of their anxiety, not create more.  That is why the attorneys and support staff of the law firm are required to work hard and do their best to represent clients in their time of need."" Some of the other things Ripoff Report learned in the course of its review: typical customer feedback reads:  “I contacted Mr. Lerner's office (Glen Lerner Injury Attorneys and they set up a free consultation the day I called. Everyone was super helpful and started working on my case immediately. I was surprised at how fast everything was taken care of and the fact that it is free for them to file your lawsuit. I was skeptical about hiring an attorney at first, but I felt like I was left with no option; I tore some tendons and the hotel (where the injury occured) did nothing to help.  I highly recommend Mr. Lerner's personal injury law office."" GLEN LERNER INJURY ATTORNEYS / STATEMENT FROM THE OWNER ""I learned what it takes to create a successful business and law firm from scratch.  In 1991 I started my own law practice working 18 – 20 hour days.  I wrote and typed out my own letters, answered my own phone calls and handled each of my client’s cases from start to finish.  All of those long hours and hard work allows a person to be able to train their staff to also be able to do everything and to know that nothing but 100% is acceptable in handling a client’s case.  That is why when I hire people I stress how important it is that they go above and beyond to provide the best possible service to our clients after they have been hurt by the negligence action or inaction of another.  This basic business philosophy of hiring people who care about other people has also contributed to the growth of my one man law firm turning into one of the largest plaintiff’s personal injury law firms in the country with over 35 lawyers and 125 support staff working in Nevada, Arizona, Illinois, Florida, Minnesota, and Louisiana.  My national personal injury law firm wouldn’t be where it is today if we didn’t care enough to help those in their time of need.”STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM THIS NATIONAL PERSONAL INJURY LAW FIRMGlen Lerner Injury Attorneys recognize that complaints posted on Ripoff Report (whether true or not) are issues that need to be addressed, not ignored.  If handled correctly, complaints can be valuable learning opportunities. With the feedback generated by Ripoff Report’s review, this Glen Lerner's national personal injury law firm for the injured has made organizational changes that provide clients and employees a more streamlined resolution process and improved customer service experience.In summary, after our review, which included discussions with Mr. Lerner, Ripoff Report is convinced that Glen Lerner's national personal injury law firm for the injured is committed to delivering a quality of service which will result in an increase level of total client satisfaction.Read more about why consumers should feel confident when doing business with a member of Ripoff Report's Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.

Of course, being an attorney, he was smart enough to deny the allegations even though there were TWO witnesses that saw him drop his pants and squeeze one out into someone's swimming pool.  It would have been taped but the homeowners' watched in disbelief while one tried to find a cell phone or video camera, knowing that Temrowski would deny charges to the police.

 Attilio D ,"  Attilio D  141 Bellair Drive Dobbs Ferry, New York USA ","", ,"","  Attorney Attilio A. D'Oro otherwise known at Tillo is a blatant liar. He is also very obnoxious. When he was in court and asked by an adversary if he had a business card he said that the didn't have one. But then when the court report reporter asked him for one, he whipped out a business card. He had one all the time. Atitillio is a blatant liar who should be ashamed of himself. His parents should be ashamed that he has forgotten all that they taught him about telling the truth. Also, he has a total disregard for the court rules. He is required to update his registration with the court when he changes his affiliation with his employment. He left the law firm of Nicoletti, Gonson, Spinnes and Owen, LLP more than a year ago but still lists them on his registration. A complaint is being lodged against him for this transgression with the Departmental Disciplinary Committee, 2nd Department. Attillio lives at 141 Bellair Drive in Dobbs Ferry, New York and graduated from Fordham University Law School. He apparently ekes out a living doing per diem work.

 FRIEDMAN & MOSES ,"  FRIEDMAN & MOSES  233 Broadway New York, New York USA ","", (212) 732-5800 ,""," COMPLAINT AGAINST THE LAW FIRM MARGOLIS , FRIEDMAN & MOSES (FRIEDMAN & MOSES) LLP, and  GORMAN& RANKIN PC.   (ACCOMPLICES WITH GLENCORD BUILDING CORP., GISTIZIA AGRESSIVO, CONSTANCE CINCOTTA , who poisoned me with Carbon Monoxide and Toxic gases). In 2002 I hired the law firm Margolis , Friedman & Moses LLP, to represent me in a WC case.   Attorney Mitchell R. Friedman from this law firm handled my case, and did nothing until 2010  when I fired him( no insurance, no medicine). In 2003, I did a huge mistake to hire the same law firm for another personal injury case with a broken left ankle and left hip due to the landlord’s negligence. Mr. friedman was not fighting for my justice; he was working for my adversary, the insurance’s carrier-Risk Management Planning Group and his illegal interests. He hate me. I was afraid to go in his office when he invited me. Always he yelled at me, screamed at me, verbally and sexually abused me.  Once a young lawyer from his office tried to stop him. No way.             Mr.  Friedman did not respect the Courts’ Orders, betrayed me, manipulated the deposition of Dr. Kosovich ( now fugitive), Dr. Head and Portnow at his mercy. Refused to submit my Reply Affidavit at Dr. Head, Dr. Portnow false affirmation in their medical reports and deposition done under oath.               My lawyer was very active to destroy my case, to humiliate me, to harass me, to insulted me, to put me down every time. He never was happy when I brought evidences. Now I understand very well why he was so unprofessional with me.  He invited me many times in his office only to verbally and sexually to harass me. I have to survive with the doctors sympathy, sample for medicine, and later with the Governmental help.  He invited me in his office in 2009, and told me if I want to win the case , I must to come in his office “ afternoons   to work at my case”.  I refused. Than  Mr. Friedman  started to terrorize me  with his vocabulary, screaming at me, with his threatening that  all my doctors will betrayed me, that  the judge did not like me .  He told me Dr.  Kosovich will betrayed me, and many doctors also because they lost my  file. Additionally, he mentioned from my money provided from settlement I have to pay him and the lawyer who started the case on 1997. On December 7, 2009, I wrote to my lawyer, Mr. Friedman a letter because he did not stop the harass me, to abuse me, where I said:             “ …Please handle professional my case. As I wrote I refuse any   settlement. The insurances wants now settlement. Where was the  insurance in all this years? What knows the insurances about my                 disparate depression, about my pain, humiliation, nightmares, and insomnia? I am broken and broke. The emotional and physical scars and traumas of stigma as a person with veteran history in antidepressant ……. , are the fabric on my bad life.              Once energetic and confident, I have become unsure, and a battle apathy, full of disparate thoughts. Please do not insult my sad situation. To be more familiar with my reality,  send you in exhibit a very clear situation( Exhibit 1,2,3,4,5,6). I want to know why Dr. Portnow and Dr. Head saw in me a“ wealthy woman, wealthy“? …… be aggressive with the insurance who sent me in this miserable situation.             Do you have any idea what means to be accepted by doctors (some) only by sympathy for years? Where was the insurance? You really hurt me with this insistent settlement. Are you on my side? I want the judge‘s Decision!....“. ( Claimant‘s EXHIBIT R- Pg. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10). Mr. Friedman continued to call me , to scream at me , to harass me and to threaten me  that I will lose my case. On December 28, 2009, I wrote to Mr. Friedman:                         “ I received your letter dated December 21, 2009. I am very ill, and I do  not have sincere energy to talk with you, or met you. You only scream at     me, tried to intimidate , to threaten, and put me down in front of your   staff.                          I apologies, but for third time when I wrote you, I refuse any settlement(  first $ 30, 000, and after $ 5, 000). I want judge’s justice, and  if you feel    malpractice( as Dr. Portnow at all., ) .....                       It is enough to be very sick and with a lot of personal  problems. I do   not have power to faith with my lawyer  for my rights. After my court  deposition , you are changed 180 grade…..         I did not understand why Dr.   Caronna did not give deposition? If some doctors lost the file is not a   crime, you have their reports which I provided you.   .... ( Claimant EXHIBIT R, Pg. 1B). And Mr. Friedman started aggressively to sabotage my case. Only a few example: In 2002 the Risk Managing Planning Group ( The  Respondent, The adversary)  , paid Dr. Miskin to evaluate me for two times. The doctor  filed a report in my favor. My lawyer,  in retaliation because I did not answer at his sexual advances,  after 7 years in cross examination precluded my adversary   insurance ‘doctor’s report which was in my favor as: Questions did by Mr. Friedman[ my lawyer, my adversary]:  Q:        Doctor, when you took your history from the claimant, did you    take into account her presentation to you regarding her mental  status?  A:        Yes. Q.        Okay. And did you believe her. A:        Yes. Mr. Friedman:             “ Okay. I have no more questions of the doctor, except that  we’re reserving our right to   have the doctor’s reports and his   testimony stricken.  I believe that based the  filling    dates at the          board for both reports, that they were not filed within ten    business days of the date of the examination required by Section   137 of the Worker’s Compensation Board. Under the  circumstances we reserve our right to have those reports stricken  as a matter of right and the doctor’s testimony”.              (WC -Deposition Document ID # 159851567- Pg. 10.  L. 2 to 10. And Pg. 11. L9 to 23).  The Insurance’s Carrier lawyer said:    “At the request of claimant’s counsel to cross examine Dr. Miskin, the doctor was scheduled to be deposed on 11/30/09. It is noteworthy that Mr. Friedman questioned the doctor solely on the filling of his reports. He has requested the preclusion of his reports“. Gorman& Rankin PC- Rebuttal Application-  Page ,  Paragraph , April 2, 2010.    My ex- lawyer instead to fight for my justice, he was fighting to destroy    my case.  In this way he  corrupted my 7 years doctor, Dr. Kosovich ( now fugitive) to do false affirmations under oath inclusive with self-incrimination.   The Insurance’s Carrier lawyer said:    “ The facts already in evidence are in direct conflict with his testimony” Gorman& Rankin PC- Rebuttal Application- Page 7 ,  Fifth  Paragraph , April 2, 2010.         “Dr. Kosovich was deposed on 12/2/09. ….After deposition of this witness, we were able to secure his office notes“. Gorman& Rankin PC- Rebuttal Application-  Page 6, Seventh Paragraph , April 2, 2010.                                      Why this conflict? Who paid for this false testimony?   Why Dr. Kosovich assumed so much risk? Who is interested in this “conflict with his testimony?” This conflict  of testimony confirm the Dr. Kosovich diagnosis.  After  the decision was done, I went in court and I read the deposition. I was petrified. After, in the same day I saw Dr. Kosovich and Mr. Friedman and secretly I recorded the conversation. Mr. Friedman accused Dr. Kosovich by  killing my case, and Dr. Kosovich accused Mr. Friedman to be a bad lawyer, and because did false affirmation under oath, inclusive with self incrimination , now is fugitive from United States. I did an Appeal as Pro Se, and I submitted documents ignored, or not filed by Mr. Friedman. The Insurance’s Carrier lawyer said:        “ We further respectfully submit that as this claimant has submitted 587 pages of documentation to the Board, any new evidence she has submitted should not be considered………that she and her lawyer attorney had ample opportunity to do so and that no good reason having been shown for said evidence not being produced earlier;…  Gorman& Rankin PC- Rebuttal Application-  Page 3, Fourth Paragraph , April 2, 2010.     I pledged the evidence to be accepted, and I asked that Mr. Friedman  to explain why he orchestrate this charade with my case, why he ignored the court’s orders, why he did not submitted all my evidences ?, why he was protective with the doctors false affirmation,  as Dr. Head, Dr. Portnov, Dr. Kosovich who falsifieed bthe truth under oath?, Why he gave to the insurances carrier possibility to say: “was offered in a complete vacuum”.               Mr. Friedman did not represented me, he asked me to work for his interests, otherwise no make sense why he did not use and filed my Reply Affidavit at doctors false affirmations, why did not filed my  Affidavit with work search, my résumé, per court order, or the Dr. Mooney medical report ? WHY? And as intentional obstruction of justice, ex-lawyer refused to submit Dr. Mooney medical reports sent him by fax and brought also personally in his office. He was so full of anger, hate, discrimination, malpractice, unprofessionally when he saw because Dr. Mooney treated me before 2003. Also, Doctor Cocioba sent me in 2002 at his friend Mr. Friedman to take my case.  Now Mr. Freidman together with the insurances carrier precluded and Dr. Cocioba’s medical reports to ruined my case, and who refused to give deposition. The insurances carrier said:    “ Dr. Cocioba was scheduled to be deposes on 1/8/10.…….The claimant’s attorney has disputed the method of service on the doctor……A formal record had been made seeking the doctor’s preclusion and requesting that all of his reports on file be stricken from record”…..  Gorman& Rankin PC- Rebuttal Application- Page  9 , Third, Fourth, Fifth  Paragraph , April 2, 2010”        My lawyer, together with the Insurances lawyer tendentiously, and illegally,  ignored my robust evidence to destroy my case:     The Insurance’s Carrier lawyer said:    “We submit the doctor’s opinion on casual relationship was offered in a complete vacuum… Gorman& Rankin PC- Rebuttal Application- Page 7, Sixth  Paragraph , April 2, 2010.    The vacuum was created by my lawyer and the insurance lawyer who refused to see the evidences filed a few years ago, and refused to take deposition from my doctors who treated me for years, but took deposition from one who saw me once , and did not have any medical record, and my lawyer did not provided a copy from the file. The Insurance’s Carrier lawyer said:        “ …..The claimant also indicated that she received psychiatric treatment at North General Hospital. Those  records have never been produced. …… Gorman& Rankin PC- Rebuttal Application-  Page 5, Fifth Paragraph , April 2, 2010.    The Insurance’s  Carrier lawyer  must to have a huge courage to  insult the  court with false affirmations.  How the insurances lawyer can afford to say: ”Those  records have never been produced.”?, and must be punished for her acts.             The North General Hospital’s document was submitted in Board’s file on September 5, 2006 under Document  ID # 118755300), Dr Scott Ira and Dr. Komissarowa Document ID  # 118755299, 118770148 content 68 pages.             How was possible the insurances‘ lawyer did not see this evidences on file, ( over 100 pages), instead they[ Mr. Friedman and  Gorman& Rankin PC ]saw Dr. Konecky’s  report, only 3 pages ? This doctor saw me only one time on 2001. Unfortunately , as I said before, I am not a celebrity, or a beauty. How was possible this doctor (who shredded     already the medical evidence from 2001) to remember me in 2010?   Why my lawyer did not fax him his report for recollection since the WC paid him $400 for deposition? Why did not ask the doctor about his report? Why? From Deposition:       Q:        Doctor in the course of your profession practice did you have occasion to see the   claimant ………? A:        I don’t recall. Q:        Do you have any record with respect to this lady? A:        No. Q:        Do you have something possible under the name ……..? A:        No. Q:        Do you have recollection of ever treating such a person? A:        No. Q:        Okay. A:                    Mr. Friedman: I don’t think I have any…..  Dr. Knoecky Deposition Pg. 6, L 14 to 25 and Pg. 7, L. 1 to 3.  WCB # 161104…)               Maybe the Insurance’s lawyers consider to be above the law, to falsify so visible  the truth,  and has a “special and hyper nerves“  to lie about the North General Hospital medical reports.              Mr. Friedman  was not fighting for my justice, he was working for the Insurance’s Carrier and his illegal interests. He hate me. I was afraid to go in his office when he invited me. Always he yelled at me, screamed at me, verbally abused me. Once a young lawyer from his office tried to stop him. No way.                                 My lawyer was very active to destroy my case, to humiliate me, to harass  me, to insulted me, to put me down every time. He never was happy when I brought evidences. Now is light in my brain why he was so unprofessional with me. My WC lawyer Mr. Mitchell R. Friedman sabotaged totally unprofessionally my case. He precluded the insurances’ doctor who was in my favor.  He ignored the court’s orders  to bring my Work Search ( I sent him as Affidavit). He refused to file my Reply Affidavit at Dr. Head.ad and Dr. Portnow false medical report. He  manipulated Dr. Kosovich ( now fugitive) who falsified his deposition inclusive with self-incrimination . Same with Dr. Portnow, Dr. Head. Attorney Mitchell Friedman verbally and sexually harassed me.  He used me as a credit card, as his asset. For this from a proposal settlement of $30, 000.00 in final I got nothing due my lawyer and the insurances's lawyer. Supplementary, after I fired my  lawyer, the insurances lawyer  had  the courage under oath to falsify the truth by saying  they served me a true copy  of Rebuttal  WCB Document ID  # 207822299. I was NEVER served with any Rebuttal from the Law Office Gorman & Rankin as I mentioned in my Letter  sent to Office of Appeal on April 12, 2013 .                           REGARDING 2003 ACCIDENT.    I felt on the steers my building in 2003,  due the negligence of the constructor’s  company. I have broken left ankle and hip since. The Lenox Hill hospital under Mr. Friedman direction falsified the medical report.   Later the neighbors told me another women fail a week before me.  Both of us had Mr. Michael Friedman as lawyer. After, a year and ½ . Mr. Friedman,  “ miraculously” breached the contract with me and keep only the WC . I do not know about another woman because she left the building immediately.              The case was taken by another lawyer who again “ miraculously” lost the statute of limitation. Maybe they have any knowledge I must to die , and for this reason  did not file evidence as affidavits in court, and my landlord continue to intoxicate me.   In 2011 after MRI , the doctors asked me to bring my 2003 X Ray at left ankle, and they saw broken ankle. I contacted the hospital who gave me their insurances The RISK MANAGEMENT PLANING GROPUP, same with my WC  carrier  insurances.  I was contacted by the RISK MANAGEMENT PLANING GROPUP’s  lawyer, who told me that she will help me if I will bring my X Rays. I said “ no problem” and I went at TD Bank , at my safe deposit box to take my X rays. BAD SURPRIZE ! WAS STOLEN!.  ( I have an open complaint with Consumer Financial product).  After repeated violations at  my Safe Deposit Box at TD Bank I closed the account. After a while, “ good people “ put  part of the stolen evidences from my safe deposit box in storage.  I called the RISK MANAGEMENT PLANING GROPUP’ s  lawyer and I told her  that I found the X Ray. And she told me : “ Sorry, is too late.  The statute of limitation from when you discovered the malpractice is over”. I anticipated this answer, because all my evidences with broken ankle and hip disappeared by being  stolen by interested people.  Mr. Friedman, the RISK MANAGEMENT PLANING GROPUP’s  lawyer, and the landlord ( GLENCORD BUILDING CORP who poisoned me with Carbon Monoxide and toxic gases), are not strangers in all these illegal acts.  At this time I still have medical bill for physical therapy  l unpaid. Otherwise my ex- lawyers could provide the building’s  insurance for  treatment. But they  did not, also Mr. Friedman  did not for my WC case .             Attorney Mitchell R. Friedman  pushed me in bankruptcy, eviction, collection, and now again in collection.  He did not care about my broken ankle and hip about my heath problems. He cared about his subjective and illegal interests. He  orchestrates all my lawyers to do illegal acts ( inclusive 3 lawsuit with forgery in my name, a life insurances and assets for half millions also with forgery in my name- what I know at this time). I decribed it before in Ripoff reports about GLENCORD and MERCK. He was sure I will pass away (I will died ) with the GLENCORD BUILDING CORPORATION criminal acts to poison me with Carbon Monoxide and Toxic gases. He calculate everything to fraud American Government. Nor my WC case is took by SpECIAL FOUND, who filed also an appeal  because was an mistrial at Mr. Friedman and Gorman& Rankin PC MERCY.   Because of the deliberate, unjustifiable, unethical, without integrity, and bad intentional nature ( criminal),  in conspiracy I pledge for Justice and People with Power to set appropriate punitive damages in an amount sufficient to punish Attorney Mitchell R. Friedman, the Gorman& Rankin PC and the doctors who falsified the truth under oath ( in my WC  case) for theirs  conduct , and to establish an example to deter others attorneys, doctors, insurances from similar conduct.    Sincerely,   ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Was promised it would take no longer than 4-6 months, insisted we were perfect candidates and that they could guarantee we could save at least $700 a month on our mortgage. We paid them $3,500 and we're told that was the fee for the entire process. Well all was going well during the time we were making monthly payments for the $3,500 to retain their services. In June of 2012 the last payment was made and all phone calls stopped. The person we were dealing with no longer for the company, They assigned 2 other ""account reps"" who of course didn't know what was going on. They lost our paper work. We needed to send all the documents several times. No contact for over 2 months. Then after calling daily and threatening to come to the offices to discuss the situation ( we live 10 miles away) miraculously a new representive for us appears and is requesting all the original documents we filled out over 5 times due to the fact that our file was mistakeningly closed. But informing us maybe we would get $200-300 of our payment, can't guarentee etc. That is when we received the first ""maintenance fee"" of $150 which if wasn't paid our account would be closed.  We of course disputed it due to the fact that our file was closed in June and not reopened until September.  Why are we being charged for a maintenence fee when no maintenance on our case was done!!!! This is where is gets even more ridiculous. These ""professionals"" all the while are telling us that citimortage is holding up the process, it's the bank asking for all the paper work over and over again etc.. While we are being told this we get a letter from Fannie Mae offering us a trial modification and stating to us that our mortagage was sold to them nearly 6 months ago. I called the law office who had no idea what I was talking about and that they don't understand how we got the offer. They had no idea that Fannie Mae was involved, which of course would have changed the whole dynamic. They asked for all the letters from the bank and kept attempting to contact telling us we still need to have them be the go between the bank and us because they have ""seen to many times how the homeowner is mislead.""  We never needed to deal with them again. Long story short we got our modification through Sallie Mae. These unethical, unprofesssional scammers continued to threaten us that we had to pay maintenance fees because they did all the work!!! In fact we got our modification in April 2013, told them ( in march) we no longer needed them and reminded tham that they did nothing of us since November 2012 and to close our file. We got a charge on our credit care for $150 in June!! Of course we are disputing it and are ready and willing to go directly to the office and demand it back. They thought they were dealing with idiots. We are 2 professional people who wanted to lessen our home payment and basically got scammed!. It really is our fault because we didn't investigate them properly. That is why I am writting this to warn any potential clients of theirs to not  deal with them.

Bamberger of the firm Brickman & Bamberger, 317 Madison Avenue, New York, NY, persists in engaging in deceit, dishonesty, misrepresentation and deception in his practice of law despite being advised that it is a misdemeanor punishable by a year incarceration as well as the imposition of treble civil penalties to the injured party pursuant to Judiciary Law 487 for an attorney to engage in deceit with the intention to deceive the court or a party to a judicial action. David Bamberger doesn't get it and commits deceit and outright prevarication in his Memo's of Law with abandon in order to prevail in a case he should lose. For example, he bolds entire passages and sentences of his adversaries emails and letters which he includes in his papers without adding ""emphasis added"" to deceive the court into the erroneous believe that these boldings are in the original with the intent of sullying his adversary by making him look indecent with the intent of prejudicing the court against him. He also cites an erroneous decision of a judge in another case which he knows is wrong to prejudice the court against his adversary as well as falsely claiming that the case before the court which is a simple contract dispute is a ""revenge case"" falsely calling the plaintiff a ""Master of Revenge"" and that ""revenge"" is ""a leading vocation of his"" in yet further effort to prejudice the court against his adversary. David Bamberger knows full well that he has a losing case where his client is in the wrong so he engages in this conduct such as described above to seek to win at any cost despite being warned that this will bring him a Judiciary Law 487 action against him. This is very stupid of him. However David is a very stupid attorney. He complained to the court in his Memo of Law that his adversary told his client, wine educator Harriet Lembeck, that he is the stupidest lawyer he had ever encountered in his forty years of litigation for his putting her last name as his last name in the RJI, among other things. Even more stupid and proving this is that in his motion to dismiss, he stupidly neglected to include the Complaint rendering his motion defective making a denial a virtual certainty. David Bamberger is a pettifogger who is pure evil incarnate. His adversary is an well-known author of nine books, one of which David has read himself and highly regards, yet David calls him ""once respected"" in his Memo of Law. Then when this was complained of he admitted that he is wrong and says that he will amend his papers to fix this yet with more than a week going by he has done nothing with his Memo of Law e-filed on the Internet with the potential of it going viral with this evil statement in it. Shame on him. David Bamberger knows full well that his evil manner of lawyering has potential repercussions on his client but he does not seem to care. Slamming his adversary with derogatory stuff in his papers is more important to him than the concerns of his client, wine educator Harriet Lembeck David Bamberger is a very bad man. Harriet Lembeck is a lawless, common criminal (albeit uncharged or convicted) who has broken the liquor laws for some thirty years by serving wine at her Wine & Spirits Program wine school at 203 E 29th Street New York City without a liquor license committing upwards of thirty criminal misdemeanors a year for which she can be arrested and go to jail. She conducts her commercial enterprise out of a building owned by her husband, William Lembeck, which is a residential townhouse which they falsely registered as residential some thirty years ago when they should have obtained a Commercial Certificate of Occupancy as they intended to use it for her wine school. Harriet and her husband, William, have little regard for the laws, rules and regulations of our civilized society, so it seems. Harriet Lembeck has been asked numerous times if she intends to obey the law and relocate her wine school to a licensed premises and still has not answered the question despite these numerous requests. The conclusion is inescapable that she intends to conduct the classes she lists on her Internet web site, www.wineandspiritsprogram.com as scheduled starting on September 9, 2013 serving wine without a license as has been her practice for some thirty years. Readers of this posting are urged to determine if she will be conducting the class by calling Harriet at the number listed below and if she is they should contact the 17th precinct of the New York Police Department at 7 p.m. on September 9, 2013 and demand that a police officer be sent to the location and that Harriet Lembeck be arrested and taken away in handcuffs for liquor law violations.

Furthermore, your case is not uncontested, no matter how much you protest that it is. I can see that we are getting nowhere here and you have no intention of paying your bill.  Unfortunately, you leave us no choice but to withdraw.Sincerely,Benjamin J. Heimerl""Now, who in their right mind would sign up for an option that ended up costing over $10,000.00 when a $1,750.00 flat-fee was available?!?  In my opinion, this firm baited and switched on me, having me sign papers that were completely different from what I had been quoted.I sent an email to the other partner Katie Lammers explaining my displeasure with in my opinion being scammed by their firm and baited and switched and I received this response: ""Hi AfraidOfRetaliationFromUnethicalFirm,Per our conversation today, here is a copy of your retainer agreement.  Please note that this agreement clearly lays out how you will be billed and how the fee agreement works.  I have also included a signed copy of our retainer policy. To recap, I understand that you feel that Kelsey told you that the divorce would be handled as a flat fee of $1,750.  She recalls the meeting differently.  While you and Kelsey did discuss the possibility of a flat-fee uncontested divorce, you ultimately chose the $3,000 hourly option and that is the retainer agreement that you signed. It's unfortunate that you seem to have a different understanding of the agreement than what I have in writing.  Kelsey and I will take a look at the invoices this afternoon.  I will have an answer for you today about your options for proceeding. You, of course, retain the right to terminate representation at any time.  I hope we can work something out, but I have to honor the signed agreement which states that yours was an hourly case.Please direct any questions regarding your matter to me. Thanks,Katie Lammers""In other words - they are claiming that I happily signed a FAR more expensive hourly option when a far cheaper flat rate option was talked about and presented to me.  In my opinion, this is simple bait and switch - I will also be filing a claim with the Minnesota Bar association and also the Attorney General of Minnesota for their activities.Since I was desperate and in the middle of a divorce (and since I again made in my opinion the mistake of trusting Heimerl and Lammers) I maxed out my credit card to pay the amount current.  At the end of the case, I received ANOTHER bill from them for ANOTHER balance over $5,900.00!!!  (Now remember Katie's written word in her response that I had chosen the ""$3,000.00 Hourly Option"" - and that this was an uncontested divorce).Needless to say, now being totally broke I could not afford this additional amount that they in my opinion were trying to milk from me.  Seeing no other choice, I have to file a bankruptcy.  I  received a call from an attorney at Heimerl and Lammers named Maxim Zawojski.  He was attempting to collect the debt for the amount owed.  I informed him that I was declaring Bankruptcy (a chapter 7 to be specific).  He said ok and that the collection efforts would stop (as is required by Federal Bankruptcy Law).Today (July 27th) I was just served papers filed by Heimerl and Lammers and signed by Maxim Zawojski to appear in court next month.  They are suing me in small claims court for the $5,719.50 of additional fees from the ""$3,000.00 hourly option"".  I am still doing the Bankruptcy and needless to say they won't be receiving the money - because I don't have it.  I am also looking into legal violations I feel that they have committed by filing suit while they had been informed of the Bankruptcy.  SO, IN SUMMARY...In my opinion one would never EVER use Heimerl and Lammers.  The lack of ethics shown in my opinion in the bait and switch they did to me as well as - in my opinion - the unprofessional treatment, in my opinion EXCESSIVE billing (I actually have a record of where I was billed for 6 emails that happened over a period of 35 minutes... I was billed at 10 minutes EACH for the emails - who would have guessed that Heimerl and Lammers had a time machine and could shove 60 minutes into only 35!!!!!  That is the only way that could happen, right?) and in my opinion the harassment after being forced by their actions into a bankruptcy and financial ruin are something that no one should EVER have to suffer.  Hopefully the Bar association and the Attorney General can help me with this.So to sum my opinion of my experience with the firm up in one word: AVOID!

He should be ashamed of himself. He is the husband of famous New York Times writer Florence Fabricant who is 76 years old and looks it.        ""This letter constitutes a disciplinary complaint against Richard Fabricant of the prestigious law firm Wohl Loewe Stettner Fabricant & Deitzand Fabricant.        In a matter titled Tastemaster v. Lynn Roberts and Peter Locker in United States Federal Court, Southern District of New York, several years ago Richard Fabricant committed perjury in his own affidavit in advancing his client case.        This case involved the principal of his client, REDACTED, who sued his former mistress, Lynn Roberts and her then new boyfriend, Peter Locker, for allegedly stealing a gourmet event, The View From the Vineyard, that REDACTED ran for several years with the invaluable assistance of Ms. Roberts. Mr. Locker, a fellow gourmet and wine expert, had formerly been REDACTED's closest friend. Mr. Fabricant and his former wife are also close friends of REDACTED and his wife.        In his affidavit submitted to the court, Mr. Fabricant stated that Ms. Roberts was merely an employee who helped out in a minor capacity and that she was barely known to REDACTED. This was blatantly untrue and known to be untrue inasmuch as Richard Fabricant frequently socialized with REDACTED and Ms. Roberts as well as REDACTED and his former wife and was aware of REDACTED's ten year relationship with Ms. Roberts as his mistress (which was also an open secret in gourmet circles). Upon information and belief, Mr. Fabricant and his wife also socialized with REDACTED in the company of both his former wife and Ms. Roberts (yes, this is the stuff movies and novels are made of!).        Mr. Fabricant sought to deliberately deceive and mislead the court as to Ms. Roberts' participation as a vital and invaluable figure in the running of the gourmet event as well as her relationship with REDACTED. Furthermore, Mr. Fabricant encouraged the court to find Mr. Locker in contempt of court resulting in his incarceration when Mr. Locker gave as his address a cemetery in New Jersey owned by his family - an address officially used by Mr. Locker for more than twenty years and which mail, deliveries, etc., could be successfully made with no delay. Although Mr. Fabricant was aware of circumstances that forbade Mr. Locker from revealing where he ""slept"" the night before, he persisted in his quest to see Mr. Locker incarcerated. Mr. Fabricant sat mute when the judge accused Mr. Locker of delusions regarding affiliations with government agencies.        It may be significant in this regard that the court apologized to Mr. Locker the following morning for having had him incarcerated and subsequently dismissed the action against him following a modest settlement payment.        Mr. Fabricant's conduct is of such a wanton nature so as to manifest a blatant disregard for the welfare and health of his adversary. Had Mr. Fabricant been candid with the court, Mr. Locker would not have been incarcerated for contempt of court. As stated above, Mr. Fabricant demonstrated a wanton disregard for the truth of his affidavit when characterizing Ms. Roberts as a virtual stranger to REDACTED. His affidavit to that effect constituted deliberate, intentional and knowing perjury.""        From the above there can be no doubt that Richard Fabricant committed blatant perjury and that he has utter contempt for the truth in legal matters.Richard Fabriacnt is an utter disgrace to the legal profession for which he should hide his head in shame.

Attorney Joe Young has treated me and my case unethically and it's sad that an attorney, who has the ability to make money honestly in the second largest city in the US, has resorted to ripping off clients to fatten up his bank account. READ THE ONLINE REVIEWS! Joe Young has numerous negative online reviews that elaborate on his unethical and immoral behavior reuslting in the loss of his cleints retainer with absolutely no progress in their cases. I did not read his reviews before opening my checkbook to Mr. Young and I'm sorry I didn't. That falls entirely on my own shoulders and have no one to blame except myself! I hired Joe young 12 months ago to handle a simple Wage and Penalties claim with my former employer. I found Joe Young through Bill Handel's ""Handel on the Law"" website advertised on radio station KFI in Los Angeles. I mistakenly believed that Bill Handel's team would have vetted this attorney before allowing him to advertise on his site, however I was very wrong.  In my personal opinion Joe Young is nothing more than a shark on the prowl constantly looking for unsuspecting prey to chew up and spit out. I was treated with the utmost disrespect and was cursed at and told to shut up on the phone by this joker. I was actually hung up on twice by Young when I confronted him about the lies he was perpetuating with regards to my case . Since my case required action on the part of the Labor Commissioner's Office in Los Angeles, I finally contacted the Commissioner's office myself to get an update on my case. I could never get a straight answer from Young and was always told by his minions that they were waiting for a response from the Commissioner's office. When I finally got a hold of the Labor Commissioner I was told that a response to my case had been submitted to my attorney over two months ago. Yet neither Joe Young or any of his staff ever called to provide me that information. They skirted the issue constantly and continuously lied to me telling me that they were still waiting for a rsponse from the Commissioner's office. The reason he never informed me was obvious. The Labor Commissioner had no jurisdiction over my case and the letter clearly illustrated that. Because Young DID NOT KNOW THE LAW, he had no recdourse but to lie his way through it constantly telling me that they were waiting for a response from the Labor Commissioner's office. The Commissioner actually told me the following; ""And you said your lawyer practiced labor law? Wow, you would have thought he would have known the law and explained that to you before he filed the claim""! At best his ignorance on cases his firm is handling is a travesty of justice, at worst he his a liar and his staff has been trained to follow in his footsteps. I must reiterate the fact that this review is based on my personal opinion and experince with Young, I don't know if there are others who have experienced the same. Here I am a year later with absolutely no progress or resolution on my ""slam dunk"" Wage and Penalties claim, as Young put it. I have never heard of an attorney that tells his clents in an email that ""things are moving slowly at his law firm because he's going through a divorce which is occupying much of his time"". Seriously Mr. Young, are you frikken kidding me? Who gives a rats ass about your divorce? I went through a divorce too but never used that as an excuse for poor service or unethical behavior toward my clients. Like I told Mr. Young, I am now on a mission. I asked that he return my unused portion of my retainer but he just laughed that off. That's fine Mr. Young, no problem. I will use every legal resource avaialble to me to make sre not one more person falls prey to your ploys. I am a honest, hard working individual that doesn't have an enemy in the world!

 Law Offices of Eugene Kinsey ,"  Law Offices of Eugene Kinsey  Main Street/ PCH Seal Beach , Select State/Province USA ","", ,""," Contacted this attorney who quoted me a $1000 fee In August 2012. He called the case ""a slamdunk."" It was. Three weeks after the suit was filed, by the end of November, judgment by default was awarded. I began calling at Thanksgiving time, trying to send  funny messages ""Gene,  it's Thanksgiving, throw me a bone."" After about six phone calls and a few text messages, (I got to be very friendly with his answering service) & email, lo and behold Mr. Kinsey called with a promise to check it out. Remember: by this time the judgment had been rendered, was waiting to be collcted, and the debtor was still in sight. The holidays came and went, January, February: ""Gene, have a heart and tell me what's going on with my case!"" was my message, one of at least a dozen I left. It took him about three weeks to respond, once again assuring me that he would check and see what was going on down there. Easter, Mother's Day ""Gene, please see if the judgment has come down yet, I want to get this ""mother"" while he s still around."" No response at all. All along I was able to verify that my debtor was in place. However, I noticed at the end of May that he appeared to have moved. Finally mid-June, after receiving a form letter from Mr. Kinsey infoming all he was moving his offices, I barraged him with phone calls. Mr. Kinsey was more than happy to tell me all about how busy he band with his volunteer activities and finally admitted that he had not really checked and he would do it the following week. By the end of that week I had the judgment in my hand and was furious that it had taken so long for him to even bother to find it. I let  Mr. Kinsey know how unhappy I was with his service. In subsequent emails Mr. Kinsey stated that he ""guessed his mistake""  was assuming that that the courts were going to mail the judgment to him. Then he told me that he wanted me to be happy and he would return the $1000 fee, because he ""does not need the money."" He also offered to help me collect, and then proceeded to give me reasons why he couldn't start to work on it until the next week. In the same conversation he told me that I would have to ""be there in the middle of the night"" with a sheriff to identify the debtor. He also ordered me to buy a background check online which I did, for 20 bucks. After lookinh around I realized that I could sell the judgment and be done with the whole matter. When I informed Mr. Kinsey of my decision, he walked back his offer to refund my fee, informing me he was going to have to ""review his files to see how much time he actually put in on the case."" In this public forum I challenge Mr. Kinsey to even locate the files from my case. He blamed the court system and the budget cutbacks for his neglect to make phone calls or a personal visit to find out what was happening. But it was obvious to both of us that Eugene Kinsey, my hired attorney, had made ZERO attempt to locate the judgement from November 2012 until June 2013, though he had been assuring me for eight months, he had not. Please, Do yourself a favor, take your time when you're looking for an attorney, if he doesn't keep office hours, if he doesn't return your phone calls within 24 hours the first couple of contacts, find someone who will. And pay attention to reviews! If you dig deep enough - despite the probability that Mr. Kinsey has had a reputation compvery bury them - you will find several recent reviews mentioning that Mr. Kinsey is very good at collecting fees but very casual about your legal & fiduciary interests. If you go to Mr. Kinsey's website, you will see a picture of him from about 30 years ago. Perhaps back then he was a man of integrity. If you hire him be prepared to have about a 15 to 1 ratio of your phone calls: his response. It's apparent that he does not give a good gosh darn about his clients, especially ""the small potatoes"" ones like me.   ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

 Lanphier & Associates ,"  Lanphier & Associates  2817 I St #3 Sacramento, California USA ",www.lanphierlaw.com, (916) 447-0222,""," The State Bar of California, while performing its due diligence during an investigation of Attorney Steele Lanphier, failed to uncover extremely pertinent information that should be a matter of public record.       A dozen years ago, Lanphier was experiencing financial difficulities when he was approached by Luis Vargas, a convicted drug dealer AND FEDERAL INFORMANT that served time in Federal prison. Vargas is related to nefarious members of a Mexican Mafia-led drug cartel. He has been heard stating that he has millions of dollars readily available and is known for routinely lying to anyone for any reason to elicit even more money.  Vargas is a self-proclaimed “gangster”; he recruited Lanphier by advancing him a large sum of money to pay off his personal debts as well as additional funds to allow him to promote and advertise his law firm. Vargas insisted that his girlfriend, Norma Guzman, handle all monetary transactions and perform legal duties within Lanphier’s firm.  Vargas directs Ms. Guzman to falsify amounts on the bankruptcy forms required to be filed for their clients to federal bankruptcy courts avoid detection. Many of the other attorneys have left the firm and ran for cover. They are expected to testify about their dealings with Vargas and Lanphier. The IRS and State authorities are expected to have an interest in this parternership as well. Vargas gained complete authority of all business aspects of the firm and makes all the decisions while Lanphier makes none; even though he had entered into an equitable financial fee-split 50-50 arrangement with Lanphier, Vargas insisted on pilfering even more money from the firm. Vargas has brazenly stated “I am the the (expletive) owner, I am (expletive) Lanphier.”  In partnership with some non-attorney “associates”, including David Silva and Caesar (last name unknown), Vargas has managed to gain complete control and administration of Lanphier’s firm.  As of this writing, Lanphier & Associates is under investigation by both Federal Authorities and the California State bar for misappropriation of trust fund monies.    Vargas is both a user and supplier of illegal steroids, methamphetamine and other narcotics.  He routinely threatens and intimidates anyone who questions or fails to follow his orders. Lanphier is in fear of unpredictable retribution from Vargas as he believes him to be not only capable, but more than willing, to carry out his threats of physical harm. Vargas is a known informant for the Federal Government. Who is protecting this drug dealer?       Luis Vargas has several aliases, including, but not limited to, Joseph Guzman and Joseph Lopez.  Together with his girlfriend, Norma Guzman, they own several trust accounts, solely for the purpose of veiling their funds from Electronic Data Discovery and the Internal Revenue Service.  Vargas and others are routinely paid in cash to avoid detection by the State Bar and the IRS.  It is entirely unfortunate that Steele Lanphier chose NOT to testify truthfully at State Bar Proceedings, ultimately giving his consent to this criminal enterprise that is an obvious formidable threat to the general public. It appears that the State bar of California has been ineffective in their efforts thus far to investigate this law firm.        If you had a negative experience with Lanphier and Associates, it is STRONGLY ADVISED that you phone the California State Bar Association at 1-800-843-9053 to file a formal complaint.

Vargas insisted that his girlfriend, Norma Guzman, handle all monetary transactions and perform legal duties within Lanphier’s firm.  Vargas directs Ms. Guzman to falsify amounts on the bankruptcy forms required to be filed for their clients to federal bankruptcy courts avoid detection. Many of the other attorneys have left the firm and ran for cover. They are expected to testify about their dealings with Vargas and Lanphier. The IRS and State authorities are expected to have an interest in this parternership as well. Vargas gained complete authority of all business aspects of the firm and makes all the decisions while Lanphier makes none; even though he had entered into an equitable financial fee-split 50-50 arrangement with Lanphier, Vargas insisted on pilfering even more money from the firm. Vargas has brazenly stated “I am the the (expletive) owner, I am (expletive) Lanphier.”  In partnership with some non-attorney “associates”, including David Silva and Caesar (last name unknown), Vargas has managed to gain complete control and administration of Lanphier’s firm.  As of this writing, Lanphier & Associates is under investigation by both Federal Authorities and the California State bar for misappropriation of trust fund monies.    Vargas is both a user and supplier of illegal steroids, methamphetamine and other narcotics.  He routinely threatens and intimidates anyone who questions or fails to follow his orders. Lanphier is in fear of unpredictable retribution from Vargas as he believes him to be not only capable, but more than willing, to carry out his threats of physical harm. Vargas is a known informant for the Federal Government. Who is protecting this drug dealer?       Luis Vargas has several aliases, including, but not limited to, Joseph Guzman and Joseph Lopez.  Together with his girlfriend, Norma Guzman, they own several trust accounts, solely for the purpose of veiling their funds from Electronic Data Discovery and the Internal Revenue Service.  Vargas and others are routinely paid in cash to avoid detection by the State Bar and the IRS.  It is entirely unfortunate that Steele Lanphier chose NOT to testify truthfully at State Bar Proceedings, ultimately giving his consent to this criminal enterprise that is an obvious formidable threat to the general public. It appears that the State bar of California has been ineffective in their efforts thus far to investigate this law firm.        If you had a negative experience with Lanphier and Associates, it is STRONGLY ADVISED that you phone the California State Bar Association at 1-800-843-9053 to file a formal complaint.

He said that balance is negative - that's all what matters and that decision won’t be based on the amount of balance – it’s just formality. You want to trust your lawyer. As a result I got a rediculously low support for Pendente Lite.  He wouldn’t say things he was supposed to protect me as his client.

I still was hoping that it might work and I couldn’t quite afford to pay to another attorney. We met once to file one more document and then he disappeared again. He also wanted me to sigh separation agreement from Defendant's attorney, where I would just waive all my rights. It left very little time before final hearing and I was trying to contact him.

He could take oath on one date and submit documents on another, which wouldn’t match information you gave him. He was late on all terms and all important documents were filed in favor of Defendant. Pendente Lite order was never signed and wasn't even in file. I had to go to his office again and he resentfully gave me unsigned one. It wasn't mentioned about health expenses coverage Defendant was supposed to pay. I havent received a cent on that order untill I filed everything by myself to go to final Trial.

 Andrew Spinnell ,"  Andrew Spinnell  275 Madison Avenue New York, New York USA ",www.andrewjspinnellaw.com, ,""," ANDREW J. SPINNELL - DISCIPLINARY COMPLAINT LETTER                                In a September 20  letter to the Disciplinary Committee of the New York State Appellate Court, First Department written by a partner of a well known Wall Street law firm of which excerpts are reproduced below, Andrew J. Spinnell is accused of lying and committing perjury. Here are the experts from the letter to the Disciplinary Committee.  ""I am writing this committee with respect to certain testimony Andrew J. Spinnell recently gave in the trial of his defamation action against my client which I believe was false and made with knowledge that said testimony was false. Mr. Spinnell also gave testimony which led me to believe that he either failed to report discipline imposed in Connecticut, or that he gave false testimony regarding whether he has been disciplined in New York. Furthermore, Mr. Spinnell testified he failed to keep a copy of his retainer agreement with my client for seven years. Finally, I believe Mr. Spinnell's testimony involved dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, prejudiced the administration of justice and cast doubt on his fitness to practice law. Therefore, I believe I am bound by 22 NYCRR § 1200.4 (DR 1-103) to report Mr. Spinnell's conduct."" ""I believe Mr. Spinnell's trial testimony contained at least two instances of perjury. . . ."" ""Mr. Spinnell also lied when he testified about why he failed to pay unemployment taxes. Prior to trial, Mr. Spinnell testified at his deposition that he believed his student employees were exempt because there was an exemption for students who's employment was primarily to enrich their school curriculum, which had been amended sometime after the edition of McKinney's that was located in his library. A copy of the relevant pages of Mr. Spinnell's deposition is annexed hereto as Exhibit ""E"". Indeed, Mr. Spinnell wrote a letter to the Unemployment Insurance Tax division in 1998 making this argument in writing, relying on Labor Law § 511(15). A copy of Mr. Spinnell's July 1, 1998 letter in evidence is annexed hereto as Exhibit ""F"". At trial, Mr. Spinnell testified that he relied on § 511(15) before the Unemployment Insurance Tax division. A copy of the relevant page of the trial transcript is annexed hereto as Exhibit ""G"". This exemption, however, applies only to students employed by educational institutions, exempting educational institutions from paying unemployment insurance taxes for their student employees. Moreover, although this paragraph was amended once, in 1998, it has always applied exclusively to educational institutions. Thus, it is clear that Mr. Spinnell could never have reasonably relied on this exemption as the basis for failing to pay unemployment insurance taxes.  When he testified at trial, however, Mr. Spinnell said he believed his student employees were exempt under a different exemption, one that exempted all day students and had been amended to exempt only elementary and secondary school students. A copy of the relevant page of the trial transcript is annexed hereto as Exhibit ""H"". That paragraph, § 511(9), was amended in 1969 from an exemption for a part-time worker ""actually in regular attendance during the day time as a student in an institution of learning,"" to ""actually in regular attendance during the day time as a student in an elementary or secondary school."" I would note that Mr. Spinnell's reliance on a pre-1969 McKinney's in the 1990's casts doubt on his fitness to practice law. 22 NYCRR § 1200.3(a)(7). In any case, Mr. Spinnell could not have had a good faith belief that his all student employees were exempt under this exemption, which applies only to day students, since he identified two of his student employees as evening students in his July 1998 letter.  Moreover, since Labor Law § 511(15) was enacted in 1971, Mr. Spinnell could not have cited this provision unless his edition of McKinney's was published after 1972. However, since Mr. Spinnell's reliance on § 511(9) depends on his edition predating the statute's amendment in 1969, his reference to § 511(15) is proof that he never relied on the pre-amendment version of § 511(9), contrary to his trial testimony. Thus, not only is there a substantial basis for believing Mr. Spinnell's testimony was knowingly false, there is a substantial basis for believing Mr. Spinnell failure to pay unemployment insurance taxes was not the result of an honest mistake but that instead, he simply invented a sham explanation for his failure to pay after the fact, ""as a creative lawyer"". A copy of the relevant pages of the trial transcript is annexed hereto as Exhibit ""I"". Indeed, Mr. Spinnell's contention that his student paralegals were independent contractors showed he was either not fit to be a lawyer because he failed to adequately supervise untrained students assisting him in legal matters or that he simply invented a sham excuse after failing to pay taxes. At the very least, Mr. Spinnell's testimony was dishonest, fraudulent, deceitful, or a misrepresentation, and prejudiced the administration of justice, violating 22 NYCRR § 1200.3(a)(4) and (5). ""On the other hand, if this committee did discipline Mr. Spinnell in the past, then he lied under oath, yet again. Therefore, I believe there is a substantial likelihood that Mr. Spinnell either lied under oath about the absence of any disciplinary sanctions against him in New York, or that he never reported the disciplinary sanction in Connecticut in violation of 22 NYCRR § 603.3(d) and 22 NYCRR § 1200.3(a)(5), requiring discipline for that failure as well as reciprocal discipline for the conduct underlying the Connecticut reprimand.  ""Finally, and purely for this committee's information, Esther Yang, a subpoenaed non-party witness, testified that Mr. Spinnell lied to the court while representing her ex-husband, and threatened both Ms. Yang and her mother, allegations which, if true, prove Mr. Spinnell violated 22 NYCRR § 1200.3(a)(4), (5) and (7) among other disciplinary rules. A copy of the relevant pages of the trial transcript is annexed hereto as Exhibit ""P""."" As you can see from the above, a prominent lawyer from a Wall Street law firm has demonstrated that Andrew J. Spinnell has engaged in testimony that involved dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, prejudiced the administration of justice and cast doubt on his fitness to practice law. You should also know that Andrew Spinnell says that his reprimand is no big deal as it is the lowest form of discipline that can be imposed. Andrew simply does not get it. He does not understand that a discipline against an attorney is a black mark for unethical conduct that never disappears from his reputation. He was sanctioned in the amount of $5,000 by Judge Martin for frivolous motion practice in Federal Court He sued Toshiba for a minor hearing loss from use of its headphones and was sanctioned in New York State Supreme Court in that lawsuit. He was found by the Appellate Court to have not paid his employee's unemployment insurance taxes Andrew J. Spinnell was sued for legal malpractice three times. One case for $250,000 involving his handling of a breach of contract action for which he did not carry malpractice insurance was dismissed as being time barred as it was brought too late. Another case for for big bucks for which he did not carry malpractice insurance was settled before a trial date was set. We hear that the plaintiff is very happy with all the money he received. The third case is presently open in New York State Supreme Court, New York County. We do not know if he is insured in this case since he won't answer the question on this point when asked in a letter offering a legal referral. Andrew J. Spinnell is a very bad man. I wouldn't use him as my attorney, certainly after he was sued for malpractice three times. Nor should you. ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

If the State Bar can't assist with returning my fees, I will ignore the clauses in my contract that bind me to ""mediation and arbitration"" because you can't do either without the other party.  I will follow up with the State Bar next week before I file in Small Claims court.  I just pray my work is not futile.  I can only imagine how many people are standing in line to be reimbursed by this Ripoff Attorney.

" Brett A. Elam, P.A. ","  Brett A. Elam, P.A.  105 South Narcissus Avenue West Palm Beach, Florida USA ",www.brettelamlaw.com, 561-833-1115,""," My family hired The Law Offices of Brett A. Elam in May after our mortgage company made errors in our mortgage payment. We were desperate and needed help fast. I deeply regret not spending more time doing additional research on a few other lawfirms before hiring Mr. Elam's firm. Brett A. Elam requires you pay his entire fee upfront which should have been my first big red flag. Once that fee was paid Mr. Elam would take days to return emails and texts. My wife sent an email previously and it took him 3 days to get back with her. I reached out to Brett A. Elam on the morning of Wednesday 6/27/13 inquiring about our case. We hadn't heard from him in awhile and we wanted an update. I waited patiently for 24 hours and never heard back. I sent Brett A. Elam a second email on 6/28/13 telling him this was not acceptable and that I was going to be writing a review about his services. I would say towards the end of the day I got a very troubling email back which included this:  ""First, I was on vacation and returned last night.   I have just now returned to my office. Second, this is absolutely the last email you will send me like this, am I crystal clear?   I will respond when I get to my office and get tomorrow this matter."" -Brett A. Elam  The first thing that struck me was his grammar. The last sentence didn't even make since and we just paid him a lot of money to handle our case. The second thing is how he spoke to me. We hired The Law Offices of Brett A. Elam not the other way around. And most importantly, if Brett A. Elam was on vacation why wasn't there an autoreponder letting people know at the very least or a secretary managing his account during his absence? What would have happened if our mortgage company would have reached out during his vacation? The bottom line, I should have taken more time and researched my options before hiring The Law Offices of Brett A. Elam ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Lerner and Rowe strives to provide a satisfying experience for each client and to give a sense of relief and assurance of help, so the client can focus on getting better and on their recovery, not having to worry about the case details.When the client comes in to the office, calls or makes contact with Lerner and Rowe initially, they speak with an In-take Specialist, who takes some details and then assigns the case to a specific team.  This is the team that the client will work with through the entire process, consisting of a Case Manager (paralegal), Attorney, Associate Attorney, Co-Case Manager, and Accounting Team.  The client receives communication and information from the Case Manager and Attorney primarily; the other team members are supportive and administrative roles, helping the Case Manager and Attorney.

""During the onsite interview Kevin Rowe was asked to describe their standard process for taking care of a complaint: “The standard process for taking care of a complaint is a little different depending on if it is a current client or a past client.  If a current client has a complaint about the Case Manager, Co-Case Manager or Associate Attorney, the supervising Attorney will speak with the client for resolution.  If unable to provide resolution or if the complaint is about the Attorney, it is reviewed by me and my team of Executive Assistants.  I will speak with the client directly, in person or by phone, to find out more information about the complaint and to find the best resolution for the situation.  If a past client has a complaint, I will call the client to speak about the situation and try to provide a resolution.  Each case is notated each time it is accessed, for conversations with the client to updates in the case.  Each notation gives a detailed explanation of what was discussed, any offer made or information that was given regarding the case.  When I speak with a client regarding a complaint I review all of the information to find out if something went wrong or if a client is upset because the outcome was not what they were expecting or wanting.  I try to understand what caused the complaint and to provide the best resolution to the situation at hand.  Through utilization of exit surveys for current clients many complaints or concerns are resolved before the client leaves allowing for resolution and communication at the time it occurred.  I take every concern or complaint to heart and try to provide resolution for situations as quickly as possible; sometimes I am unable to provide complete resolution depending on the situation.  I take all concerns or complaints personally and work tirelessly to provide satisfaction and closure for my clients, past and present.”In addition to how their office handles complaints, Mr. Rowe was asked to describe a specific situation where a client was not satisfied with the level of service they received: “The client was upset with a situation regarding the settlement; there was a discrepancy from what was offered originally and what was received.  I called the client to discuss the situation, while speaking with the client and with the review of the notes and information regarding the case, the discrepancy was found.  I was able to correct the issue and made an offer of resolution for the situation.  The resolution was accepted by the client and they expressed deep satisfaction for the quick resolution.  The client has since referred friends and family to Lerner and Rowe, stating that he is very thankful for our help and sincerity for the entire process.”The process for dealing with insurance company requests starts with obtaining all necessary information from the client, requesting medical records/bills for any doctor/hospital visits.  Lerner and Rowe is at the mercy of the medical providers to send the information as quickly as possible, it can take several weeks, months sometimes for the records to be received.  Once everything is received, the information is provided to the insurance company for review and determination.  The insurance company can take between 30-45 days for review.  The delays and time it takes that has spurred complaints about how insurance claims are handled are due to the length of time medical providers and insurance company review takes, it is not something that can be controlled by Lerner and Rowe.  Mr. Rowe stated that the company is not able to go pick up medical records or force the insurance review process to move faster or keep to the time frame given when the reports are sent.  He stated, “Lerner and Rowe do not gain anything from delaying the process, it is better for the company for the process to run smoothly and quickly.”Some internal processes needing improvement include the size of caseloads each team handles; the company is in process and has already seen improvement of hiring additional staff to lessen the case loads.  The teams are already benefitting from the increase in people and are able to better help clients efficiently and effectively.  Also needing some additional improvement was general training and expectations of the company for newer employees.  Improved training and learning expectations for the company have contributed to better communication with clients and between team members.  Mr. Rowe strives to have pro-active client contact and communication, instead of re-active, he wants to have the teams reach out to the clients and make sure everything is going okay, not to have the clients calling concerned with the process.The changes seen have been better communication with clients and lessened case load for the teams, allowing more efficiency and effective client interaction.  Additional supportive and administrative staff allows more functionality of the office and allows the teams to focus on the clients more.  Concerns are easier to address and resolve and no client is being overlooked or falling through the cracks.  Mr. Rowe stated that he has a quote that he found a few years ago that he sends to his teams to remind everyone that the client is the most important part of this business, without them we have no business.  The quote he gives; “A client is the most important visitor on our premises, he is not dependent on us, we are dependent on him.  He is not an interruption of our work; he is the purpose of it.  He is not an outsider of our business; he is a part of it.  We are not doing him a favor by serving him; he is doing us a favor by allowing us to serve him.”In order to do whatever it takes to make the client happy, Mr. Rowe advises his employees to maintain pro-active communication and satisfaction for each and every client. Providing answers and resolution in an effective and efficient manner allows each team to best address clients’ concerns/issues.  Providing the best and most qualified staff, and the level of knowledge provided throughout each team allows Lerner and Rowe to “do whatever it takes” to provide satisfaction.The creation of the exit surveys and addition of the administrative and supporting staff have been some results from the complaints made on Ripoff Report.

 Rowdy Williams Law Firm ,"  Rowdy Williams Law Firm  1117 wabash ave Terre Haute, Indiana USA ","", 8122323622,""," I had to leave my home due to going through a ten year marriage that turned very mentally abusive over his alcohol and addictions. Went to CODA cause he moved to his mothers house prior to this so i could keep me and my boys mentally stable and in school and seeking counseling for these issues. While in process of this my exhusband made a courtdate in sullivan county,in in superior court and lied to the judge to get my children from me.Being in CODA i was never served with paperwork about this courtdate they say i missed twice. So when i became aware of this situation in divorce court in Terre Haute when i met residency that he filed in Sullivan. I was told that jurisdiction lied in Sullivan Superior court even though he resided in Greene county with his mother since feburary of 2010. Im a diabled mother of two due to going through an arson fire in 2001,having lost my son and niece in that fire while trying to get them out.I live on a fixed income and still made ends meet for my children without any help from their father. I left CODA and rented a house in Terre Haute on south 17th street. Children were in school and we were recieving counseling in school as well as getting prepared to start counseling through hamilton center for our well being through this divorce. I wanted stability for my children and I as their mom that their father couldn't interfere with. We were doing really well and i still met in public places for our children to see him cause they didnt understand why they couldnt see daddy. only for short periods where no fighting could occur or him trying to take my children in a drunken rage or anything.They had their own bedrooms and so did i. No cps was involved or anything. I was told to appear in court Dec.15th,2011, just ten days before christmas so i did and could not afford counsel so i went anyway. Without any investigations or anything the judge ordered for me to give my children to their father at 4pm that day. I then was just heartbroken cause i know the abuse we had been through but he had a lawyer and i didnt. So then in February of 2011 hired Rowdy Williams Law Firm with the help of my mother and made a down payment and started making payments in order to go through divorce and regain my custody of my children. I was appointed Matthew Dailey from the lawfirm.He was keeping my children away from me because he said it was because of a past history of a friend. not a child molester/ sex offender just a friend who i met and our children went to church together(also friends with the mother of this child). This friend and I were not living together. However,somehow it was held against me in court for some reason and he kept my children from me for five weeks pror to final courtdate in Sept 2012 and nothing was done about that and because they say my children said they seen my friend i was in contempt of court and went to jail for 30 days. in that time i did not hear from my attorney nor did they file an appeal on the decisions or anything. Upon my release from sullivan county jail Oct 2012 i was allowed visitations for five weeks on saturdays 10am-5pm with supervision of my mother.

I did not agree to that and spoke to the cancellation department.  The woman in the cancellation department told me that she would file the necessary paperwork and the attorney would review and and then decide what kind of refund I would be eligible for.  She stated that this would take 1 month and someone would call me back.  This was in April.  I never heard anything back.  In the second week of May I called and left messages for the cancellation department that were again not returned.  When I finally was able to speak with someone, he informed me that the woman in the cancellation department was fired and that no one was getting refunds because there ""was no money"".  He also told me that David Wroblewski was in some type of legal trouble, because he was accepting cases and taking client's money knowing that he wasn't going to perform any work, and he was planning on resolving these issues so that he wouldn't get in trouble with the bar association.  It is now June, and I have left numerous messages, all which have not been returned.   ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

I was assured by Mr QUESADA that all would be well . To please have patience. I would be contacted periodically with ststus of my case. She also explained that i would be assigned a case worker CARMEN . I've pretty much never heard from CARMEN since. ""I've NEVER received one call from anyone at HDLG for ANYTHING after this, unless I called first""! After about a month of not hearing anything from anybody at HDLG I called to find out the status of my case. I was told that my case worker CARMEN would call me back. I also want to state that I have never been able to get MS. CARMEN on the phone on the first try. I was usually called back late that afternoon or more commonly the next day. When I finally did get her on the phone she would commence to tell me how these things take time and that everything was fine. I asked for some kind of documentation or acknowledgemnt by Bank of Ameerica that HDLG was my representative in my foreclosure case or just anything to let me know that the case was growing some kind of momentum. She explained that there was nothing she had for me to look at. To please trust that all will be ok. ""FIRST RED FLAG""! I tried to call at least once a month. I would usually get a call back the next day,if at all, or even worse if anyone answered the phone at all. She asked me to send copies of bills, bank statements, etc. twice in this six month period, which I always got back to her right away. This same senerio of smoke blowing continued until December. By this time in December I was tired of ****** blowing smoke up my rear and very fustrated with the lack of customer service and lack of proof that HDLG had done anything for my case at all. So I requested a meeting with her and RAFAEL MATOS ( OWNER ). She agreed to meet with me. We met in Janurary at the offices of HDLG. This was in Janurary. MATOS never showed up. During our meeting I expressed my discontent with the way my case was being handled. She apologized once again began her explanation of how these things take time, and how they were working on it. I said ""Fine, do you have some sort of file on my case?""""I want some proof that that you've been working with my lender."" She leaves the room for a minute and shows up with a file. But she refuses to let me look in it.I told her that I wanted to see.1) Proof of Acklowgement by my Lender B.O.A that HDLG is my representative in this case.2) Case number with B.O.A3) Contact/Laison at B.O.A4) Any documentation sent between HDLG and B.O.A cocerning my case. Once again Ms. CARMEN AND Mr MATOS refuses to let me see the file right then and there. But she did agree to get everthing I asked for together and email it to me that same afternoon. I was not happy but I half heartedly agreed. The next day she sent me an email with an EMPTY attachment. Very upset I immidiately sent her a reply that there was nothing attached and to please resend. I havent' t heard from her or anyone from HDLG since. On 4/6/13 I sent an email to Ms. CARMEN and Mr MATOS stating my intent to report HDLG to BBB and seek legal representation against them unless i heard back within 24 hrs.

 Ticketbust.com ,"  Ticketbust.com  5716 Corsa Ave, Ste 104 Westlake Village, California USA ",www.ticketbust.com, ,""," Ticketbust.com was USELESS. They lost my court decision for a red light camera even after multiple assurances that I had a solid case. As a result, I spent $250 more than my already-unsightly $554 ticket + traffic school decision, and for nothing. But that’s not all. Here is the scam: You know the ""money-back guarantee"" if they are unsuccessful in defending you? First of all, it's only for the $100 service fee, and not for the $150 filing fee. This they make clear, as long as you click over to the next page. But second, YOU HAVE TO GO TO COURT FOR A SECOND TRY TO BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE $100 BACK!!! In other words, you have to waste a whole day in court, with little prospect of success (for what can you argue that Ticketbust did not already argue anyway?). Ticketbust does not make this at all clear on their website, and in my case, their agent on the phone told me verbally that I was eligible for the refund since I had turned in to them my paperwork within 2 weeks of getting my ticket in the mail – nothing about the requirement for a 2nd day in court. You have to read the fine print in the terms and conditions, which is easy to miss (I saw the 14 day requirement, but not the second day in court requirement). Ticketbust does this for precisely one reason: to make it extremely inconvenient with the intent of disqualifying you for their (so-called) refund. They want to make it so much trouble that you just won't bother and will drop the issue. After all, can't most of us make over $100 by putting in a normal day's work, which we forfeit in this so-called 2nd try at court? Also, they hide the requirement from plain view so that you will use their services and not be discouraged by this ridiculous requirement. Just think of it this way: if they lose your case, you lose $250 on top of the hundreds you already cut the government for your moving violation—because you’re not going to go to court and spend all day to get a mere $100 back. In essence, you’re giving money away to Ticketbust. Bottom line is: DO NOT USE TICKETBUST. They are worthless and they are a scam. They deserve zero stars but there is no such rating on this website. I fully regret using them and wasting my time and money. When all is said and done I spent over $800, still have to spend an entire day in traffic school, and went through all this hassle for nothing. Ticketbust made something bad much worse.

Mr. Martin held my hand and promised an investigation that will result in asnwers after I explained to him the events leading up to and following my sons unexplained death. He was 4 months and 19 days old, died at his care givers home according to the statemtns I got frm EMS and their report he had been gone for at least 3 hours.

I couldn't enter the room at the ER, they said ""family only and theres already too many people in there) I responded with I'M THE ONLY FAMILY HERE, THAT'S MY SON! Come to find out she called her siblings before even calling me to leave work & see about him. The only one who questioned her was the Medical Examiner, no law enforcement. Needless to say once the funneral passed & I came to some sort of normalcy and had a sense of what was going on, I started asking EVERYONE questions. Once she found this out she fled the state, leaving a fully furnished appartment and a few of her 5 children behind.   There was also the situation with his Dr. Joselita Rodriguez, he was only 4 months old and you see this could never be a SIDS case becuase I had taken him to the hospital 5 times in the last month of him living and complained about his breathing. She gave him medicine for astmah (later found out he never had astmah) also for Bronchitis and I demanded exrays and he didn't have that either. Unfortunatly then I was a single mother at 21 and he was on Medicaid; so this is the care you get. Though the Dr. came on the list from the nursery when he was born as one of the top docs in that area, she had prescribed him a total on 9 drugs to take simuntaniosuly up untill the day before he died. YES, I had taken hiim to her the afteroon befor he dies & she told me ""It's just something in that air, it will pass"". But when the medical Examiner called her for his records, her office repeatedly told her he was never a patient there & they had no info on him. My mother in her state of shock had to walk in ther & demand them herself!   So weeks turned into months, and months turned into years....no phone calls form these attourneys...I was only ever allowed to leave messages. They were also working on a case for a car accident that involved my mother and when they called her to suggest more treatment for her back she told them she wouldn't do antoher thing for them untill they gave me some information on my case. They confeessed that my file (including all the info I provided them) was lost in storage when they got their new building...that I should just ""write the care giver a letter & that should provide closure"" and that there could never be a case against the Dr. because she works for the state (accepts medicaid) so its not just a case against her that I am building but against the state too and ""way too much to go against"".   Later in my mothers suit she was only offered $10k for the hit and run from a drunk driver that totaled her Jaguar and left her in pain....so like I said, NO justice, NO answers, JUST SETTLERS (whether they settle for money, lies or their do nothing approach).

Waited for 7+ months to get the ""job done"" just to be presented with an empty template of a standard agreement between partners (Downloadable from Google) Spend days fixing the template and plugging in information pertinent to my business.  Sent the correction back to the company, and was presented with an asinine quote to make the corrections to a template which was never customized for my business to begin with. Once I voiced my concern to the company that the money was paid for a service that was not rendered, I got a reply back that no further work will be done unless I pay them more money again. Overall this is the worst, and the most irritating and least professional experience I had with ANY company. When I asked for a refund for the “provided services” I was presented with a breakdown of charges that never happened. Items were added to my order that were never requested or delivered…and when I spoke to the main attorney at the company Mr. Larry Spiegel about the issue I am having, and presented him with a copy of my actual order VS. what the company claims it was, he went out of his way to antagonize me further until he eventually said that no work or refunds will be issued for me no matter what i do.   SAVE YOUR TIME, MONEY AND NERVOUS SYSTEM.....NEVER GO TO AMERILAWYER.COM / SPIEGEL AND UTRERA FOR ANYTHING LAW RELATED !!!!

 law office of nelson meeks. ,"  law office of nelson meeks.  870 market,sf,ca,94102 sf, California USA ","", ,""," Do not retain this lawyer.I was referred to Mr. Meeks by the San Francisco Bay area attorney referral service. I submitted my declaration through Nelson Meeks, and I learned to regret it. My ex-wife submitted her declaration, and it included as witnesses individuals who had criminal pasts who would not be taken seriously in a court of law. When Nelson Meeks received my ex-wife's declaration he pounded it on his desk and yelled at me I'm not going into court with that! He looked at me very crossly as his staff was shocked or displaying a sensation of shock at the way he was talking to me he quickly turned to them put on a cartoonish smile, went back to me a cartoonish frown whip back to his staff cartoonish grin, it was awful! Mr. Meeks was taking advantage of my mental state at the time, I was in shock I was very unhappy about the state of affairs I was unhappy that my marriage and family life was over. I had a legally obtained recording audio of my wife beating me and in a rage! Mr. Meeks listened to it and after maybe 5 seconds he laughed saying shut it off it's not good for you!Mr. Meeks worked with my ex-wife's attorney to make sure that she got every item on her list of demands from me. Nelson Meeks did not attack a single demand, he made sure that I complied with them all. This mainly included me in signing a 2year restraining  order to not contact her or the children. Mind you I have been convicted of no crime, the police and the district attorney filed no charges against me! I signed this restraining order. Nelson MeeKs at that time had taken $3500 worth of my money and it was so hard to save that money up in order to retain his services in order to give my opponent every single thing that she wanted!? A month later I started calling other attorneys and each and every attorney started off asking why he should sign a restraining order!? We've been in business for 15 years we've never asked the client to sign a restraining order at that point you face your users in the COURT, you do not sign a restraining order! About about 13 or 15 attorneys I called said exactly that! I didn't realize that by signing that restraining order I where I signed away the custody of my children!! I repeat I did not know that, even in my sad and shocked state I would not have signed over the custody of my children! A man who's been in my position can understand my state of mind you're really behind the eight ball you need a lawyer to get you out of a jam you haven't seen your kids for about six months, well this restraining order led to me not seeing my children for four years! My ex-wife in the vehicle of the restraining order drove the case, according to the family court psychologist that I was forced to pay for their services, one after another refused to take me seriously while my ex-wife told a number of lies to them, I had no credibility with the psychologists who already were politically motivated to be on the side of women, the people in this system do not like men anyway, and a number of men have said that from all walks of life in all parts of America. I was guilty in lieu of signing a restraining order, and according to the judge I was guilty because I signed a restraining order! My ex-wife's attorney stalled, we did not go to court until four years later, the trial took a year. During the trial, the witness is whose declarations and Elscint meets held in a high degree, wherein P. just one after another by a number of witnesses from San Francisco and Los Angeles spoke of their methamphetamine use etc.!? In the judge's decision they were not even mentioned because a number of people I come into court talking about their methamphetamine use, a methamphetamine lab, and adults who and know the quality of these people and they lived in San Francisco and Los Angeles, they came into court to impeach their testimony! They did impeach their testimony the judge didn't even mention them in her decision, which came a year later by the way so now it's five years away from my children, she mentioned  Nelson Meeks client signing a restraining order shaped her decision in this matte.we need to understand that Nelson meets client signed a lease training order. And I was then handed a set of very unfavorable terms, which are bleeding me of money! My new lawyer told me that it was such a shame that I no longer had possession of the audio of my ex-wife attacking me and screaming at me,she said repeatedly in scorn how could Nelson Meeks have allowed you not to submit this data into evidence!!?it would have proved a record of her violence that the judge would have to look at recognize, and the family court psychologist, who in virtue of me signing a res training order voluntarily under Nelson meeks assistance they viewed me as the wrongdoer in this case and the family court psychologist costs were more than $25,000!         ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

U.S Tax Shield is a tax resolution service located in Woodland Hills, CA. According to their staff, their main service is “to obtain valid payment agreements with the IRS and other tax authorities for our clients, as well as file any missing tax return documents for them in our efforts to resolve their outstanding tax issues.” When asked about U.S. Tax Shield’s relationship with Intercard Payments, Inc., the representative replied that Intercard Payments is dba U.S. Tax Shield, meaning they are the same company. The representative for U.S. Tax Shield states that their dedication to service sets them apart from their competition. “We go the extra mile to communicate directly with the IRS with the prospective client on the phone, so they can hear from the IRS about the specific problem.”  The representative says this approach is different because most companies only rely on what the client says, whereas U.S. Tax Shield (USTS) verifies all relevant details in the beginning with the client and the IRS. This helps them avoid issues with both parties, since they are aware of multiple situations where the IRS has not provided their prospective client with comprehensive information about their specific tax issues. “Having the prospective client on the phone when we obtain the full story from the IRS helps to enhance our credibility in demonstrating to the prospective client that we intend to work for their best interests 100% of the time.” The company acquires leads for services through standard advertising, such as television, radio, and internet/search engine ads. When potential clients call in, the phone operators are responsible for confirming that the prospect has a situation where the services of USTS would be appropriate, and if the initial screening is successful, the prospect is transferred to one of the salespeople who gathers information.The client will most likely speak with several experts in the office throughout the life of their case, but USTS tries to maintain a single point-of-contact throughout the life of the case, while it is in their office. “Additionally, we start out with having a second call with the IRS and the client to again confirm the specific situation we need to resolve for our client; this helps us because the IRS, and many state-level tax authorities, are notorious for incorrectly documenting taxpayer issues.” USTS continues by obtaining power of attorney from the client so they can speak directly with tax authorities on the issues. If the client has an issue, they are encouraged to call their point-of-contact anytime throughout the process, and the USTS representative says they try to ensure calls never go to voicemail and the client always speaks with someone, even if they have to leave a message.When questioned about their process for dealing with a complaint, the USTS representative stated, “We have a client services department which focuses solely on issues related to customer dissatisfaction. Their objective is to find out what went wrong, and to promptly fix the problem.”  However, the representative made it clear that a primary challenge in their industry is working with customers who are typically ineffective at dealing with paperwork (such as not opening their mail, waiting for problems to go away, etc.) Because of this, the USTS representative states that many of the people who reach out to their firm believe they will not have to pay any taxes or penalties, and they are selective in what they hear. Most people are dissatisfied because they believe USTS will make the situation disappear without required payments to the tax authorities. “Most times, clients do not understand that our ability to resolve their tax issues is directly related to their financial ability to pay monies to the tax authorities.”One such situation involved a client living in an upscale area of Manhattan; he had a high income that he supplemented with global speaking engagements.  While the appropriate W2 deductions were made by his employer, he was not making personal quarterly tax payments on the significant income his speaking engagements brought in. “Once we were able to effectively communicate this necessary financial responsibility to our client, he was able to understand that our services are valuable to him and his family in many ways.”To resolve such issues, USTS sets aside additional time to review the situation with the client again, discuss the communication they have had with the tax authorities, and help them understand the solution that has been applied to their situation. The USTS representative says that they typically resolve such complaints. To ensure better customer service, USTS began a training program for all customer service representatives (which includes a reference handbook); each representative must complete this training before they are allowed to speak with their first client. There have been specific complaints on Ripoff Report by customers who claimed there was no progress on their case, despite their financial commitment to the services of USTS. When the USTS representative was asked about these complaints and what they were doing to resolve them, they replied that these instances have to do with gaps in communication. This difficulty is being resolved by the implementation of a policy requiring that every call is answered, instead of allowing it to go to voicemail. Then the issue is investigated by the appropriate point-of-contact, who follows up with the client. The USTS representative gave an example of a current client who has successfully fulfilled all their obligations, USTS has fulfilled everything, as well, and it is simply a matter of waiting on the IRS to respond so a payment plan can be implemented.The USTS representative believes that they “do whatever it takes” to make things right for the consumer because, unlike their competitors, they do not require full payment before they address client issues; they simply begin working with the client and the IRS as soon as the client is approved for services. They often end up waiting to be paid long after the resolution. “We lead and manage the business with a hands-on approach. We remain intimately involved with nearly all client issues, and we make ourselves available to help our employees resolve any and all issues to the satisfaction of our clients.” ”Ripoff Report Program differentiate our service offerings from our competitors:In regard to their participation in the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program, the USTS representative said: “It is very important to us that we are able to participate in these programs to further differentiate our service offerings from our competitors, and to work toward having our firm identified as an industry leader. We want every taxpayer to be happy with our services at all points throughout the resolution process.” US Tax Shield's management team has informed us that they consider all customer concerns as constructive criticism and use them as a tool to improve customer service. They stress that their clients are the face of their business, and therefore they know that customer satisfaction is of the utmost importance. US Tax Shield uses all feedback as a valuable tool to continually improve so that the experience of all present and future customers is strong, consistent, and positive.One top executive of the company tells us how they respond to constructive feedback from customers: ""We have improved our commitment to customer service excellence by ensuring we have dedicated enough personnel resources to each case. We have also installed a more rigorous set of checks and balances to ensure that all present and future clients are properly served throughout every step of the tax resolution process."" US TAX SHIELD / Statements from past clients US Tax Shield boasts thousands of satisfied clients from across the United States. One past customer wrote in to say, ""I wanted to take a few minutes to thank you for the very effective services that your company gave to me during a difficult time. As soon as I received a notice from the IRS stating that there were taxes owed from 2009, I became very nervous. US Tax Shield was referred to me by my sister and as soon as I called they were very thorough with my case. Everything they told me to do I did! They communicated bi weekly with me, and it only took 4 months to resolve my case. I would recommend US Tax Shield to any friend or family member if they ever needed IRS debt help.""Another client told US Tax Shield, ""I have been very pleased with my experience with this company. They got me through a pretty tough time with my business. Business has been slow for the past couple of years and unfortunately I just couldn't cover the payroll taxes. When I contacted them I was scheduled to have a meeting with an IRS officer. They were able to handle the meeting for me and I didn't have to appear. Ultimately, my attorney was able to get my situation resolved and I'm happy to say that my business has picked up a bit. I can tell you that I sleep better at night now.""STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM US TAX SHIELDUS Tax Shield recognizes that complaints posted on Ripoff Report (whether true or not) are issues that need to be addressed, not ignored.

Because of the money, TN took his deal.  My niece went back to him because of his promised that he will do all paperwork for Eviction us and get the house for TN with no charges at all and he will pay to TN big money.  I knew that because during we argued with them, Huan said that he will take care for TN include to clear his credit history and if we did not take $20,000.00 to move out and took of the name on title, then later we will get nothing even money or house.  We did not want money.  We wanted our house.  Moreover, how can we believe those people because the amount of $20,000.00 was just on verbal with no signed paperwork (Maybe illegal money?) Also I was an owner to make all payments before and I also cost a lot of money to build the House.  I also cost more money to go with another Agent to keep the House; so, how could I walk away.  Therefore, Huan & TN cooperate to Eviction and steal our House.  They signed my name to transfer the Title without my authorization.  They also evicted us without sending us “summon”; therefore, on the day sheriff evicted us, I still had an appointment going to the court for extension.  We had kids; we need more time to move out.  However, we still lost the House because we have no more money to hire a lawyer.  Although, we already reported to the police for the signature on the title did not my signature, but I believe the police or judge cannot do anything to help us?  Now, we lost everything and we still have to pay all debts that we paid to Agent for helping us keep the House.  Now Huan & TN took over our house and letting another family rents out the house.  What do you think? So, be carefully, don’t trust anybody; because of money, they can turn their back any time on you.  In this world is nothing fairly if you have no money. DHTK Garden Grove, CA.

That was my first appearance in front of Judge Mardi Levey Cohen on the 21st of February 2013 were they asked for a defense continuance which was granted for the 21st of March 2013. On March 21, 2013 I arrived to the court and after several attempts to contact Mr. Kaufman to no avail I was called in front of the judge with no representation Judge Cohen did give me some time to try contacting Mr. Kaufman and after several calls to his office none of his office officials had no idea where he was. After relaying this to the Judge she granted me with a final continuance. Once I left the court I called Mr. Kaufman’s office one last time and then his secretary stated that he was ill and that is why he did not show so I informed them of the new court date that was issued by the judge and was told that someone will be there to provide representation on the new date of April 25, 2013. On the 25th of April again I showed up for court and again no Attorney and no explanation on why he is not there my court appearance was set for 9 am and the judge gave me until 2pm to get in contact with Mr. Kaufman again none of his office officials had no idea where he was or if he was going to show up. By this time the Judge as well as I was getting aggravated at the lack of communication from Mr. Kaufman so the Judge set a status date for the 17th of May 2013. On May 17, 2013 again no attorney and no explanation on were Mr. Kaufman is, so I requested that the Judge remove Mr. Kaufman from my case which she granted(exhibit A) as well as I had to settle my case that day. After contacting Mr. Kaufman’s office and letting them know that I would like to have my money refunded due to lack of representation I was told that Mr. Kaufman was the only one that can authorize a refund. I made many attempts to contact Mr. Kaufman still with no return communication. I have a contract (exhibit B) with Mr. Kaufman that states “There is a $250.00 fee if a client fails to appear in court when noticed and court date has to be reset.” I feel that this should also apply to the attorney as well.  Altogether I am filing this complaint due to the lack of representation I received from Mr. Kaufman as well as him now pirating my funds and refusing to refund my money for the work he did not do.

I was never contacted by Ms. Reed nor did I have any communication iniated by her, even though the documents I received from FLC listed her as a Texas Bar Member.

I was told by FLC not to speak to my lender, and not to answer any phone calls from them, during the loan modification process, which could take up to 10 months. I finally did speak with my lender and told them that I was being represented by an attorney. They told me that I should ask for a refund since they had no record of any attorney acting on my behalf. They also told me that an attorney could not do anything for me that I could not do myself. All an attorney might be able to do is submit modification request. I knew at that point that I had been scammed. See MARS Rule for attorney's ( below).

Codilis & Associates, P.C.,contracts, hire rogue agents, like Meeker Real Estate Inc., that registered their corporation with the state of Illinois, however, they did not obtain a business license since the date they opened their doorsin the Village of Lansing a few years ago.  Then there is Team Reo Inc., also a registered Illinois corporation, however, they too, did not obtain a business license from the Village of lansing. Both companies are owned by Steve Miller, a Indiana resident. Codilis & Associates, P.C., have the hook up on rogue agents, that aid them in wrongfully evicting tenants, home owners from residential properties, done specifically by their eviction agents, Team Reo, Inc., incognito. They wear no uniforms, carry no employee identifiication, have no business cards, give no names and drive personal vehicles.  No one knows who they are, or where they come from, they do a quick job and quickly disapear.  They need no license to do evictions! The agents of Codilis & Associates, P.C., come in different disguises aiding/abetting them in their ruthless, reckless deeds.  They do business with a foreign Texas Corporation, National Mortgage Association Inc,, that has not registered their business in Illinois.  Through the works of Codilis & Associates, P.C., some foreclosed real estate is deeded to this unregistered foreign corporation through agents, Judicial Sales Inc..  Real Estate attorneys very well know that a corporation has to be registered with the Secretary of State in Illinois in order to do business in this state, file foreclosures and own real estate.  They think they are invisible and above the law and are exempt, when in fact they are not.  They have been exposed to the light, the truth!  Codilis & Associiates, P.C., will stop at nothing to make a buck seperating some wrongfully foreclosed real estate owners from their property and rights.  They are also known act through their above named agents to hire illegal Mexican immigrants and pay them to baby sit vacant foreclosed houses when they see that they have a problem foreclosed owner on their tails.   They recorded a deed to Mr Sanchez, did not state that he is married and may have taken $39,000 in untraceable cash from him for the Phoenix property:  841  E 152nd Street, Phoenix, IL  60426, There is no mortgage lien recorded and they neglected to pay off my $100,000 lien, through their other agents Attorneys' Title Guarranty Fund Inc, in Illinois.  This title company and Judicial Sales Corporation Inc., are both owned by Illinois attorney Augusta Butera.   I hope some day soon, the court will enter an order forcing banks through their agents named herein, to turn over possession of all wrongfully foreclosed homes back to it's owners due to fraud and harassment.  Perhaps a class action might be put on the table for damages, loss, grief, etc., they caused to others.                                                               No Justice, No Peace!

 Andrew Spinnell - malpractice ,"  Andrew Spinnell - malpractice  295 Madison Avenue - 10th Floor New York, New York USA ",www.andrewjspinnell.com, ,""," Andrew J. Spinnell was recently asked if he had legal malpractice insurance and failed to answer. We don't know if that means that he doesn't have malpractice insurance now but for two other cases he was not insured. Andrew J. Spinnell was sued for legal malpractice three times. One case for $250,000 involving his handling of a breach of contract action was dismissed as being time barred as it was brought too late. Another case for big bucks was settled before a trial date was set. We hear that the plaintiff is very happy with all the money he received. The third case is presently open in New York State Supreme Court, New York County. We do not know if he is insured in this case since he won't answer the question on this point when asked in a letter offering a legal referral. How many lawyers have been sued for legal malpractice three times? If you are a former client of Andrew J. Spinnell and were talked into accepting a settlement that was less than you knew the case was worth you may have a claim for legal malpractice against Mr. Spinnell. In this regard, we have a lawyer ready and anxious to sue him on your behalf on a contingency fee basis. If your attorney advocated a settlement that was far less that what he established the case was worth he may have committed legal malpractice. When an attorney fails to acknowledge the value of a case and advocates settlement for far less than what the case is worth, that is malpractice. Popescu v. McCarthy, 271 A.D.2d 204 (ld Dept. 2000). When an attorney's misconduct forces a client to settle for less than the case is worth, that is malpractice. Rapp v. Lauer, 229 A.D.2d 383 (2d Dept. 1996).

Spinnell or simply just want to learn the latest information about his malpractice case contact the Andrew Spinnell Malpractice Information Hotline at 877-697-4577 for free information. You should also know that: Andrew J. Spinnell was reprimanded by the State of Connecticut for unethical conduct. Andrew Spinnell says that this reprimand is no big deal as it is the lowest form of discipline that can be imposed. Andrew simply does not get it. He does not understand that a discipline against an attorney is a black mark for unethical conduct that never disappears from his reputation. He was sanctioned in the amount of $5,000 by Judge Martin for frivolous motion practice in Federal Court He sued Toshiba for a minor hearing loss from use of its headphones and was sanctioned in New York State Supreme Court in that lawsuit. He was found by the Appellate Court to have not paid his employee's unemployment insurance taxes Andrew J. Spinnell is a very bad man. I wouldn't use him as my attorney, certainly after he was sued for malpractice three times. Nor should you.　 ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

We were advised by the owner of the home to deal with her insurance company and meet with them to see if her adjuster agreed with our company to replace the roof. They did in fact give the home owner 26k to replace the roof and gutters. The home owner diecided to pocket the insurance money. Since we were buying the home and moving in, the home owner (Tracy Begue) waited for us to move in, make several repairs to the home and then told us if we wanted a new roof she would only spend 14k for the roof replacement. (this means she was trying to pocket over 10k) of insurance proceeds. Tammy filed the whole suit under our business name and come to find out should have been filed under us personally. We gave her a $1500 retainer and she never gave us a bill to show where any of that money was spent. When we went to court to get reimbursed for the repairs made to the house Tammy showed up empty handed. She did not submit any of the receipts I had given her. Now claims she never received them.

Angela quoted me a price of $150 for her services.

I told her if she didn't want to help me then I was going to hire an attorney.

 Ryan Russman ,"  Ryan Russman  14 Center St Exeter, New Hampshire USA ",www.russmanlaw.com, ,"","  My experience with Ryan Russman was poor to say the least. Russman was easy to find with the extensive marketing he has done, so I setup a meeting with him to discuss my case. I was being charged with DWI first offense. When convicted, I was going to become a habitual offender. During our meeting, Ryan seemed very caring and genuine. He spoke very positive about my case and made me feel very hopeful. I ended up hiring him that day. A couple weeks went by, so I gave him a call to get an update on my case. He informed me that he negotiated a deal where I would plead guilty to a first offense DWI and undergo a 5 month loss of license. What he seemed to forget was that this would deem me a habitual offender. When I asked him how he was going to handle this, he jumped around the question and couldn't give me a straight answer. When asking him specifics about laws, his answers constantly changed which made me question how well he knew them. Eventually I came to find out he had never requested a copy of my driving record from the state and chose to not take notes during our initial meeting, so he was clueless that this plea bargain he negotiated was setting me up for failure. Soon after, my dad and I scheduled a meeting with him to try to get to the bottom of this confusion. During the meeting he became very cocky and belittling. He informed me that dealing with a habitual offender charge was ""out of his realm of specialty"". This was funny to me, because he assured me from the start that he was seasoned in this area of law. To add to his dishonesty, lack of drive, and sheer unprofessionalism, he also added if I wanted some sort of life I had to move to a city away from my family because I would not be driving for at least six years and there was absolutely nothing him or myself could do about it. Along with this, he made jokes to my father about my mother having relationships with police officers, told me he didn't understand why I had these issues because pretty girls don't get in trouble, told me I have a problem with alcohol (I made an appointment with a licensed alcohol counselor at my own digression and was told my priorities in life are great and I was far from having a problem), and to top it off, he rudely cut us off when talking to him to make phone calls to other clients that he was trying to take on and later told us he didn't have time for us after paying him $5000. After leaving his office that night my dad and I made the decision we would not be dealing with him anymore. We found another lawyer willing to tackle my case. My new lawyer sent numerous notices via email, snail mail, and telephone to inform Russman that he was taking over the case. Russman avoided all forms of communication. When asked about it he lied and said he never received any notice and that we were mailing to the wrong address. Mail was sent to both offices and a P.O. box, so it is beyond me how he was not receiving any of it. I can't say enough about my current attorney. He got my ""6 year"" loss down to 9 months. Unfortunately he had to be blindsided by Russman in this process. Russman chose to make phone calls to the prosecutor in efforts to skew his judgment. The prosecutor informed us that Russman told him that I thought past negotiations that there made weren't good enough and that I was nothing more than a ""f***ing drunk"". In summary, Russman has proven to me that the NH legal system is a corrupt system. There are some great people out there who actually want to help you. That is something that my current lawyer proved to me. If any person knows what is good for them they will avoid this person at all costs - do not fall for his self funded advertisements. The only words that can be used to describe Russman are greedy, backstabbing, and unprofessional. ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Anyone can request a tourist visa without signing any contracts and wasting their hard-earned money. [continued below]....																			.....  The client pays an additional 60 Euros to the Italian Embassy and $160.00 to the U.S. Embassy, in addition to what they have already paid Delavari. Most clients are not given a tourist visa to the U.S.!!!  In short, Delavari gets $8000/person and the client may or may not be given a Visa to the U.S.  If they don't get a Visa, too bad. Delavari does not return any portion of the money (even though it is clearly stated in the contract) and he blocks all future phone calls from this client. He also threatens these clients with physical harm if they complain about him. If the client obtains a Visa, Delavari asks for the remainder of the money ($5000/person) and the client is responsible for all travel costs to the U.S. In short, the client pays more than $13,000/person to Delavari while also paying for all travel costs.   He also promises his clients that once they get to the U.S. on their tourist's visa, he will ask for a green card for them by requesting assylum status. This is completely illegal.  And because it is illegal, he can't make good on this promise.  Clients must then pay for a real attorney to do their case. He has many complaints filed against him for his fraudulent work practices and repeatedly changes his phone number and employees in order to keep himself in business. He says he has a license to do this type work, but good luck getting a copy of his license.  His license number on contracts keeps changing.  He says he has been in this line of work for 15 years, but this is a lie.   In short, he eats people's money and doesn't have the right credentials to help people with their immigration problems.

 Henry Wasserstein ,"  Henry Wasserstein  Four Times Square New York, New York USA ","", 212-735-3000,""," Henry P. Wasserstein's mishandling of his client Harriet Lembeck's representation led to devastation of her wine school business and her career. He is a former long time partner and now of counsel of the prestigious ""fearsome foursome"" law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP law firm. A partner in a Wall Street law firm is of the view that his may constitute legal malpractice. See for yourself from the letter below. Henry has not given Harriet consent to enter into a friendly lawsuit against him and his firm nor has he cut her a check from his personal bank account as of this posting. ""Your former colleague, David Bamberger, called me the other day to inform me that he was representing the Lembeck's. We established an immediate rapport and amicable relationship and had an hour long conversation which I believe will lead to an amicable out-of-court resolution of all the issues concluding once and for all the forty year old saga between the parties if only the Lembeck's follow David's advice. He said that he didn't mind being tape recorded. Its a shame that you did not learn from David when he worked for you and behaved similarly as you could have spared the Lembeck's the considerable pain and heartbreak that stemmed from your representation. I suggested to David that as part of our settlement, that the Lembeck's assign to me their legal claims against you and the Skadden firm for legal malpractice. I conferred with a well respected Wall Street law firm over my theory of legal malpractice against you and your firm and was informed that there may very well be a colorable claim. The claim is as follows: You thoroughly researched my background on the Internet and in the Court records and were fully aware of everything about me, who I was and what I was capable of. You saw the Internet posting that I was the ""High priest of revenge."" That not withstanding, you proceeded to irk, irritate, disparage and annoy me by ignoring my communications with the consequence of demeaning and disparaging me and furthermore unfairly cited the Lewis Brisbois case after being warned not to do so after it was demonstrated to you that the ruling was unwarranted. The consequence of your behavior was extremely adverse and devastating to the Lembeck's as you were advised it would be. Your persistence in your egoistic behavior toward me constituted legal malpractice. Your failure to advise Harriet to revise her book constituted legal malpractice. Your refusal to respond to my communications to the detriment of your client constituted legal malpractice. The consequences of the foregoing to the Lembeck's included the following: Following your refusal to inform me as to whether or not Harriet Lembeck would revise her manuscript including answering the ""yes"" or ""no"" questions, a solicitation was sent to more than 300 wine writers including the membership of the Wine Media Guild requesting a quote to revise the manuscript. The solicitation included for the writers' analysis the story of the Smart Guide Publication's episode, the Pen and Pencil Publication's episode, a copy of Harriet's manuscript, a copy of the Smart Guide editor's reader report, the sale of the contract to me and my becoming Harriet's savior discontinuing the book's publication on the Internet as ""the worst wine book ever written"" and my deciding to publish it as a good book, hence the solicitation for a ghostwriter. I was able to find a ghostwriter who would create a Second Edition of the book for $29,000. You should have advised Harriet to revise the book and avoid this expense. Thus, you are guilty of legal malpractice on two fronts. Harriet's damage in this regard is $29,000. Your inappropriate citation of the Lewis Brisbois case prompted me to explore the legality of Harriet's wine and spirits school with the following consequences. Harriet has been illegally serving wine and spirits at her school without a wine license at her building at 203 E. 29th Street which is a residential apartment for twenty-three years. She can not obtain a wine or spirits license for that location. Consequently, she will have to discontinue her classes at that location and move them to a licensed facility such as a hotel or restaurant at significant expense. The cost of such a facility might make conducting her classes economically unfeasible and she may have to discontinue her courses. A complaint was lodged with the New York State Liquor Authority. She may be fined or imprisoned. This is all your fault. Similarly, the Certificate of Occupancy for the building is for a two family residence. This precludes business use. As such, she can not conduct her school from the premises at 203 E 29th Street. Furthermore, William will owe some twenty-three years in back taxes for the difference between residential tax assessment and commercial tax assessment for the building for which there will probably be a significant penalty. A complaint was made to the New York City Building Department as a consequence of your behavior. This is all your fault. A complaint was filed with the New York City Fire Department for fire code violations at 203 E. 29th Street. This is all you fault. David tells me that you and the Lembeck's go back a long way and that they will never sue you because they care about you. It you care about them like they care about you and give a damn about the fact that you have cost them a large amount of money, damages in the significant six figures, you should care enough to volunteer your firm's legal malpractice insurance to cover their losses by telling them that they have your approval to sue you and the firm in a friendly legal malpractice lawsuit. Alternatively, you can just write the Lembeck's a check from your personal bank account. You are a very wealthy attorney, having been a partner at Skadden since its early days. The several hundred thousand dollars involved should be considered well spent considering the enormous satisfaction you received in irking, irritating, diminishing, belittling and disparaging me in your efforts to make me your supplicant, albeit unsuccessfully. One way or another, you need to make it up to the Lembeck's for bringing all this upon them with your untoward behavior. Don't arrogantly write to me that this is not all your fault. It was. I was there and know it for a fact. But for you, none of this would have occured. ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

By the lack of his knowledge/intelligence in just how he spoke on the phone I knew right away it must have been a solicitation call.David, or ""Allen"", claimed he was handling a case for a client and noticed I had filed a lien on the same property as well. In fact, he like most collection agencies just look up liens and try to get business by acting like they have a case pending already and they have attorneys and/or private investigators involved etc when really it is all a line of b.s.!What Mr. David Pitt did not realize when he contacted me is that I had already resolved my issue pertaining to the lien I had filed a while back and naturally I was completely aware of what was going on with that particular job as I was the ONLY person who had done work there. Not to mention, the work was done for my brother in-law. I played along with Mr. Pitt's call to see what he would say and from there I discovered just how much of a hill-billy moron this guy was.First of all, he is extremely unproffesional and has a tendency to not only stutter but say ""uhhh"" and ""umm"" after every other word that comes out of his mouth. He sounds like he has been raised in the back woods of North Carolina or perhaps a family member of the hillbillys on the movie ""The Deliverance"".Secondly, he made up all this b.s. about having other clients that did work on the same property as I had (my brother in-laws) etc and have not yet got paid hence why his Firm was involved. Like I said, B.S.!! No one ever did any work at my in-laws accept for me wich my in-law can validate as truth as well.Lastly, Mr. Pitt will come off as an attorney when he contacts you. FALSE!! He is a nobody just trying to work as a salesman/collection agent. As I did a little bit of research on him after receiving his phone call I found out some very interesting facts about Mr. David Allen Pitt.David Allen Pitt has an extensive criminal record from small misdemeanor cases all the way to multiple Felony charges. He has served multiple prison sentences in the state of texas as well as multiple County jail stents. His charges range from Burglary conviction to Assault convictions to back child support.

Around 4:30 Craig emailed me back to tell me my debt owed was $16,000 and he would not unfreeze my account until it was paid in full. My account is still frozen and no one has returned my emails.

Plaintiff then claims Hillgardner abandoned her and mistreated her and her son while she and her son were living in a family shelter.DETAILS: A complaint has been filed with Tenant Protection Services against Mr. Hillgardner by a former client for his solicitation of the client in Court, abandonment and for mistreatment. The Disciplinary Committee is being informed and an attorney is being hired to determine whether there is a claim for legal malpractice. [continued below]....																			..... Mr. Hillgardner knew that his former client and her sone were living in a family shelter and her lawsuit was to get her and her son back into an apartment she lived in for the last 29 years and for damages.The Disciplinary rules read as follows:DR 2-103 [1200.08] Solicitation and Recommendation of Professional Employment.A. A lawyer shall not engage in solicitation: 1.by in-person or telephone contact, or by real-time or interactive computer-accessed communication unless the recipient is a close friend, relative, former client or existing clientNY DR 7-101(A)(1) further states that a lawyer shall not intentionally . . . fail to seek the lawful objectives of [his or her] client through reasonably available means permitted by law and the Disciplinary Rules. NY DR 7-101(A)(3) prohibits a lawyer from intentionally . . . prejudic[ing] or damag[ing] [his or her] client during the course of the relationship. Referring link: http://www.law.cornell.edu/ethics/ny/narr/NY_NARR_1_03.HTM COMPLAINT AGAINST THOMAS HILLGARDNER BY FORMER CLIENT:April 15, 2013Reference:Mr. HillgardnerMr. Mehmet, As per our conversation on 4/10/13 when I emailed you about seeking another lawyer, I am stating my case briefly to you so can help me.On June 14, 2010 I was in Civil Court for a Travis Hearing to be reinstated back to my home of 29years, when I was called in for the hearing was first when I came across Mr. Hillgardner. Before I went into the hearing Mr. Hillgardner approached me and asked me could he sit in on my hearing and that he was an Attorney. At the time I wasvery distressed, confused and did not think twice about Mr. Hillgardner sitting in on my hearing since he presented himself to me as an Attorney. After the hearing I had to return after lunch for the decision. After I won the decision he asked me could he represent me as his client. I had agreed to him being my Attorney because I did not know any better at the time.Since June 14, 2010 he became my Attorney and I thought that he was going to represent me in a professional manner. During the first year I had many problems with getting in contact with him, and when I did he seemed to be very disrespectful most of the time. He talked very nasty to me and my son on numerous of occasion. I lived at the time from one family relative to another until March 2011. Due to the seriousness of me being homeless I was unable to deal with anyone especially my Attorney that made me feel worse than I did. By May of 2011 he pushed me to the limit and I decided not to call him for awhile. I stopped calling October 2011 up until December 2012 a little over a year later. I have not heard anything from him for nothing. The last time I heard from him was when I was waiting to hear from an Appeal from Supreme Applet Courts.When I called him December 2012 he stated, Ms. Porter I was just thinking of you, I just got the decision for your Civil Court Case and you won the decision. He also stated, That something was wrong with his phone back in July of 20112 and he could not contact me. I did not understand because I still have the same number and I never received a call from him nor did I get a missed called neither. OK, I felt that all was water under the bridge something good is about to happen with my case. Still his attitude was rude and unbearable to deal with for me and my son. So when he hung up the phone on me this time I decided to GOOGLE him to find out what kind of Attorney record he has and only then I realized that I made the biggest mistake by signing a retainer with him. I also found out on March 28, 2013 that my Supreme Court case was removed of the calendar because when I was called to appear in Court sometime in July of 2012 he (when I decided because of his disrespectful manner not to call him) never contact me until I called him in December 2012.He stated to me that he was putting a motion into the court and I was to wait for his call the week of April 8. 2013 and he did not called me. When I called him April 10, 2013 he was very disrespectful to me and told me, you are not paying me any money. I stated, Why would you say that when I signed a retainer so you would get paid. He stated, I can not call him when ever I wanted to and expect him to talk to me, and if I do not like what he is saying then I can find another Attorney. Besides you get more from a person being sweet as honey bees, than sour like vinegar. He then hung up the phone and I have not heard anything from him since then. I only called him because he never returned my call and it is important to speak with him ASAP to get my case back on the calendar.PLEASE HELP me I have a case in Civil Court with Judge Badio for NYCH to restore me back into a place. I am currently living in a family shelter for 2 years and need to get out.. I also have a Supreme Court case for damages that I need to be restored back to the calendar. I can be reached anytime at 347 617 1187.

Failed to take responsibility for their negligence and then failed to compensate me for the NSF my account accrued due to their incompetence Temple, Texas","										On April 3, 2013, I called the child support agency to inquire about not getting my child support for April, because since 2005, I have ALWAYS received my daughters child support payment around the 3rd and no later than the 5th, because my ex husband is in the military and there is a wage withholding in place with DFAS.  I was told by the worker that my account was froze, because they were updating my file with the new order, which they received January 24, 2013.  I really did not understand what they were saying, because I had worked child support in the past, and I HAVE NEVER in my days, heard of this.  I asked politely to speak with someone else about this, and was told quite rudely that I would have to wait to call back on the 5th, because it was flagged to be released on the 4th.  Right after I got off the phone, I sent an email to the state office in response to an earlier email telling me that they would be ""UPDATING"" my file next week. But mind you, no notice that they would be freezing the money at this time. On April 5th, I attempted to call, but why of course, could not get through.  Considering I had just moved into my new apartment, I did not have access to internet, so I went to a friends to use their wifi to check my account.  At this time...no update.  The money they received on the 1st of the month, like they always have had been received yet, they money had not been dispersed like it should have, according to Federal law. On Monday the 8th I attempted to call again, and got the run around, so I called State Representative Aycock's office.  I also called the OAG's office and spoke to a very rude lady there.  Never did hear back from the Child support Office, so I called Mr. Aycock's office on the 9th and let them know that nobody had returned my call.  About an hour later, I received a phone call from the Temple Office, Finance Officer, Barbara Macek, who basically told me a bunch of excuses, that in all honesty, had absolutely nothing to do with my case. She said the money would be released on the 10th.  I asked about the NSF fees and she avoided at all cost the subject, and the answers I asked.  In the meantime, I had called my bank asking them what would be the best course of action.  I was told that if I was to stop payment, then I would not be able to have an automatic draft to those companies again, and advised me against it since the child support was suppose to be released. At this time close to $300.00 had already racked up in NSF fees.  On April 12, I received the money, but as I thought, the amount was close to $400.00 less than I normally get.  So, today April 15, 2013 I made it to the child support office in Temple, and was told through this child support officer that the Unit Supervisor, Valerie Richards, would not give me the fees back, because I was told on the 3rd that the money was froze, and that was ample of enough time to stop the payment, which is so not true.  Never an apology or even an answer as to why they froze the account.  I am a disabled vet, and have been very sick for the past 2 and 1/2 years.  Not able to work, so my daughter does depend on this money.  This lady Valerie Richards did not even bother to meet me.  I have never seen such unprofessional nor lack of compassion or empathy from someone who ultimately has a job because they depend on court order child support to ensure they have a job.Prior to this new order that they received on January 24, 2013, I never had a problem, why?  Because my case was not in a local office, it was automatically coming out so a human never had to touch it.  My attorney's office initialized the current support but could not address the back support that was due.  I am writing this report because they believe they are exempt from taking responsibility for their actions and believe that I should just eat the NSF that my bank account accrued.  But for an incompetent worker in their office who did not analyze the case before taking action, this would have NEVER HAPPENED.",  Attorneys & Legal Services

The man on the phone and the money back told me this was reputable, and I could trust Scotts Valley, California","										On April 17th 2012, I called Tax Lifeboat and spoke to a man who listened intently to my fears and tears as I explained to him how I got into the mess of my taxes.  I gave him all the details of what my case was about.  He asked me what I wanted him to do for me.  I told him what I wanted, and that was to reduce the taxes owed, and cancel out on the penalties I was being charged with for my 2011 tax year.  He told me he thought the company could help me and suggested I take the time to research the company, asked how I had heard about them, and said the other companies only wanted my money, so I should be careful.  He assured me this was a reputable company, and said that after I research the company on line, and if I am happy with it, I will need to give them 5800.00 up front over the phone to retain the services.  He also said it would do me no good to call the IRS because they are not interested in helping.  He said no matter what I needed an attourney due to the amount I owed.  And he felt they would be my best bet.  Fool me, I believed him.  I did go on line and do the research and could find no bad reports and they sounded so sincere. SAD!!I hired Tax Lifeboat that day by doing a bank transaction over the phone.  It was about a week later, I got a call to get some forms filled out and sent back.  Which I did, and again I stated the same information on the forms that I stated to the guy on the phone.  Almost word for word. About another week went by and I got another call from a gal who told me the name of the attorney that would be asigned to me.  Once I got with her, I was given the tasks that I needed to do, and I did them and returned them.  I also gave her the same information I had given the previous two times.  Now a month has gone by and no word on anything.  So I am thinking that must be a good thing.  The attorney called me again and told me I needed to apply for a loan and get the letter  showing I do not qualify for one, then send it to her.  I did that and tried for a line of credit.  I got the letter and sent it as requested. A few weeks later like in July, the attorney called to tell me there was nothing she could do for me, and the best thing for me would be to take my money out of my retirement to pay it off. I told her I could do that but it would put me in the same boat I am currently in, but only this time I would not be able to recover, and I would lose everything again, only this time for good.   She said ""I am sorry, I do not know what to tell you"". SAD!!!  I called the IRS and state and talked to them myself several time to try and take care of it.  The state would not budge, not because they wouldn't, but because the law prohibits it.  The IRS said my penalties were waved on the late payment automatically because it was a first time incident for me.  Go figure!!! I let the attorney know I was not happy or satisfied and I wanted my money back.  She said she was sorry I felt that way, and that she would pass the word on to the collection department.  She gave me the name of the person and left it at that.  I gave it a month, and when I did not hear anything I filed a complaint with the BBB and was asigned a case number.  I waited a couple weeks and did not hear from the BBB, so I e-mailed them. The BBB responed and said the company had 30 days to respond to the filed complaint.  After the thirty days, BBB contacted me and said they had not gotten a response and wanted to know if I had heard anything.  I had not. BBB said they would keep me informed if they heard anything and asked me to do the same.On Feb 4 2013 I received  a call from Tax Lifeboat telling  me I would be getting a full refund, it was being processed  and I should see the check by the end of February.  The middle of March and I still had no check.I had e-mailed the attorney who had my case asking her about it, and after a few weeks she responed that she had been out of  the office and she would check into it.  I gave it another week and no response, I e-mailed again and she responed that she had placed a call to the gal who does the refunds and had not gotten a call back.  I replied and asked for the e-mail address of the person who left me the message and the person who does the refunds.  NO RESPONSE.  Go figure.  I e-mailed her again and told her I did not appreciate getting jerked around, and if I had to seek legal help, I would be asking for more then the money I gave them.  They have had my money for nearly a year now.  Collecting interest I should have, I had to pay penalties to the state I otherwise would not have had to pay, had they been honest up front, and I would be asking they pay for my legal fees having to deal with the matter in this way.  I am appauled at the lack of moral conduct on thier part.  I know no wonder she did not respond.  But I did not set the presidence for the company, and I do not work for the company as a represative.  I believe I am a justifiabley dissatisfied customer.I then went to 7 on your side to see if they would be of any help, as they were a great big help for me when I had a bad deal with a major retail store years back.  I have not gotten a response yet.  The public needs to know The Tax Lifeboat does not stand behind what they advertise. They need to know not to trust them.  And I want my money back!!!!									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

We may pursue a criminal complaint once we receive the findings from the Fl. Bar Ass'n. In my professional opinion you couldn't have a worse attorney represent you than Greg Showers. This man is everything that gave lawyers a bad reputation. As an individual, he has ZERO INTEGRITY, and is a spineless coward in the courtroom, and in person. He accomplished absolutely no legal defense for our fees. Obtaining the truth about anything from this man is nearly impossible. Lying is his first language.   He was retained for several thousand dollars to represent my husband on a false accusation from a tenant who was being evicted. Mr.Showers bungled every issue with this case starting with his fee agreement. He began by giving us an agreement with another party's name on it and requested we sign it. Most of his filings were rejected by the court as incorrectly prepared. Greg Showers lied to both myself and my husband about almost everything we discussed. He missed court appearances, failed to provide any legal defense, and backed out minutes before the trial, leaving my husband to plead guilty or represent himself in his own trial after paying thousands of dollars.  Hard To Believe, but this idiot tried to withdraw from the court case literally 5 minutes before trial, in an attempt to force a guilty plea from my husband. He lied to us, stating he and the judge agreed he could withdraw. This was a lie. The judge refused his lame unethical attempt. The judge later confirmed on the record that Greg Showers was lying.... What a low life. This unethical stunt was the last straw for us.  He literally forced our formal complaint with the Florida Bar to have his license to practice law revoked. This man should not be licensed to practice law. CONSUMERS BEWARE. If you hire this man to represent you legally, expect the worst. He will undoubtedly ruin your case, and turn a minor situation into the worst possible scenario. Be Forewarned!             									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

On later contemplation I realized that you had you had lied to my Mother!  You also told me that because of this promise you could not bring it up in Court! I told you clearly that honesty was the most important thing to me and that I despise dishonesty! Well, moving ahead a little bit, in Court in front of me and my sister you asked her in about question number three if she remembered the phone call and you stated the details of that conversation and your broken promise to her and me, thats saying it nicely, the truth of the matter you lied to her twice and me once!  Ok, back to our Sunday meeting, I saw all of the nice documents that I had diligently prepared for my case and I could tell that they were never looked because of the lack of a fold mark by the staples or any other marks or wrinkles! In fact every document was still neatly in order as I had sent them to you! You told me that you didnt want to spend the time looking at all the documentation unless you really needed to! That didnt sit right with me but you insured me that you had a strategy which we briefly went over. In retrospect I put together all of that information in anticipation of you reading it and being prepared for Court and I expected to pay you the professional for it.  After all, I gave you a $ 5,000.00 retainer and expected to have to pay more if necessary! I departed after about one hour and we agreed that we would meet about a half hour before the Court session the next day in the parking lot!  About 45 minutes before Court I called you on your Cell phone three times to tell you that I was in the parking lot waiting for you and each time you answered with I cant hear you, I am on my way to court and if you need to leave me a message and I will call you back! Shortly thereafter I say at a distance a rather unsightly old car pull up and park and it looks like you getting out but I just said no, it cant be, he would have called me to say where are you because we agreed to meet in the parking lot!  Several minutes later you call me and ask me where I am and I told you waiting for you in the parking lot as we had discussed.  You told me you were already inside waiting for me! Strange, very strange! At the end of our loss in Court, I said to you lets talk as we walked out to the parking lot. You saidno, I need to go talk to the clerk! It was obvious to me that you did not want me to see your vehicle! We parted and I went to the car to make some phone calls!  And what to my surprise, thereyou go to your car, the one I saw you get out of earlier! So, lets recap, so far your office as represented by your web-site doesnt exist, your picture is very old, you didnt even look at the documentation (3 or 4 hundred pages) that I sent you over the previous months, you lied to me and my Mother despite the fact you teach discipleship classes, you lied about hearing me on the phone and you hide your car because you are embarrassed!Now lets go back to us going inside the Court room! We file in together with the Attorneys for about 7 or 8 cases and they all sit in the Gallery with their clients but not you, you open the gate to the area in front of the Judge and sit at a desk leaving me, your employer behind!  All the rest of the Attorneys are sitting with their clients, I am sure discussing their cases! Then we get called up and the first issue was Attorney Behlmann representing both my Mother and Edasi, the issue where you had quoted so many State statutes which would disallow this, and within less than two minutes that motion was denied and the judge says that was a ridiculous and then you put my 86 year old Mother on the stand. Well the case was really about all of the self-serving issues with my sister who you never called to the stand! The case was a joke and your job was pathetic! I trusted you based on phone conversations and web site representations particularly your being a teacher of discipleship at your Church. If you had presented a good solid case with all of the facts that I had carefully and completely prepared for you and we still lost, there would be no question but that it is Gods will and I have to accept it!Did you earn what I paid you? No way! Were you honest with me? No way! Were you honest to my Mother? No way! Were you well prepared for Court? No way! Did you live up to your mission statement? Not even close! As a Disciple of Christ in view of what you say you teach others were you and are you as a believer responding to the Holy Spirits prompting to examine your thoughts, words and actions and compare them with the Word of God. Something for you to ponder on and you know the right answer!I spent a lot of Money for nothing!God bless you Brother and I pray that you take this in the way it was intended. Be real Brother and act in Gods image as a teacher of his Word should!									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

I do not base that on my negative end result, but rather on Robert Zarcos professional performance. I think Robert Zarcos legal filings were poorly drafted and off point. I am not an attorney and I can see that, but the judge confirmed that in his ruling. I dont think hes very honest either. [continued below]....																			.....

I was told to distribute other bad checks to fellow employees and to our independent contractors. I was also told to write bad checks and submit them to federal and state courts, while the owners knew the checks would not clear and could possibly get our clients documents rejected by the court.As employees quit due to bounced checks. I was coerced into picking up the extra work until I was working 70+ hours a week at my salary, which averaged out to less then the federal minimum hourly wage. Many of our employees were not able to use their health insurance because the money deducted from their check was not paid to the insurance company. When I quit, our office was close to $10,000 behind in our office rent and our San Jose office had just gotten evicted for not paying rent in 6 months. This resulted in daily visits from our landlord and threats to have my and other employees cars towed away.I also learned that Williams Cole Inc. DBA Attorney's Diversified Services had not paid taxes since 2007. It seems that what is going on is similar to what some capital management firms do on a larger scale. Buy a business, load it up with debt by borrowing money the company doesn't need, use that money to help pay yourself way too much, then finally walk away when your pockets are full and the company can't function.

I told him to call me before he made any charges above $500 and he did not. And so, I got billed for another $218. Then he asked for a second $500 retainer to work on drafting a settlement. I paid the $218 I owed plus an additional $141 to go toward the retainer for drafting a settlement. I told him I would send him the other portion of the $500 retainer if a settlement is reached and a settlement letter needs to be drafted. AGAIN, I told him to please contact me before making any future charges and he failed to contact me once again and now he says I owe $309! No settlement was reached! He charged me for the day of cancellation and AFTER! Got the bill today and told him I was going to file a complaint and he is threatening to put a lien on my property TODAY!Robert Pavelko is not trustworthy. I trusted that I could give him money in advance and that he wouldn't make any unauthorized charges, but he did.Robert Pavelko is not responsive. After I paid him the $218 plus $141 for the retainer for future services, he did not contact me for a full two weeks. Then all of a sudden I get a forwarded email that my landlord sent to him saying, ""Please call to discuss"" and then I also got a voicemail saying the same thing except he added, ""to discuss a settlement"". I called back his office phone, left a message. I called his cell phone, left a message. 48 hours goes by when he said he would get back to me in 24 hours. I got fed up with him and my landlord and said via voicemail and email that there will be no settlement and I am canceling my services.Instead of this garbage referral to Robert Pavelko that I got through a employee assistance program, I go see a professional lawyer for a $100 consultation. The consultation was free with Robert Pavelko as a benefit through my employer. His presentation during the consultation was poor, but I had trust that my employer would refer me to someone ethical and professional. Robert Pavelko upholds neither of those qualities, and is simply a licensed attorney that should have his license revoked.Robert Pavelko is not knowledgeable. He told my husband that my landlord could illegally evict because we were on a month to month lease. I relayed this information to a second professional attorney and she told me that was absolutely false!Please do not trust this attorney with your hard earned money. He will try to Rob you blind with unauthorized/inaccurate charges. He won't return your phone calls in a timely manner and will most definitely not keep you informed about your case.Robert Pavelko has a very rude and disrespectful demeanor as he will not let you finish when talking and will talk over you and every time he talks over you, he will raise his voice a notch to the point of yelling at you. This occurred during the consultation  as well but I trusted the services provided by my employer and overlooked his sour demeanor.On the contrary, Kara Noack, Denver, is a fantastic attorney for landlord/tenant cases. She truly listens to your entire story to understand the full picture and she demonstrates her knowledge through relaying the information back to you within her responses. Her fees were very reasonable. Robert Pavelko charged me $718 to write one letter to my landlord and Cara charges $200 for the same service...just one flat hourly based fee. Robert Pavelko charged for every phone call and every email...one email alone cost $75!!! Cara Noack does not charge people for talking to them through a 10 min phone call nor does she charge them for every email she sends.Robert Pavelko said it would cost me $7500 for his representation in a countersuit against my landlord. Cara Noack said it would be a flat $1500 fee for her representation.Stay Away from Robert Pavelko.  Innocent families, such as ours, are getting robbed blind and lied to by this attorney who is in a position of trust. I absolutely do not recommend this attorney. If you need a lawyer to represent you for landlord/tenant matters, I highly recommend Kara Noack. She actually truly cares about the livelihood of her clients and she makes sure her responses are accurate. The consultation was only supposed to be for an hour but Kara Noack spent an extra 30 mins with me just to make sure I had a clear path forward. I came out of the consultation with Kara Noack rejuvenated and refreshed. The feeling of doom that Robert Pavelko continuously pushed upon me really dragged me down physically and mentally over the span of 2 1/2 months and the darkness was finally lifted after talking over my case with Kara Noack.

His lack of knowledge was only too obvious when questions would be asked. The 3rd time he spoke to a small group of investors; and my business manager told me Jimmie was hurting the credibility of our company.  Jimmie had come to the meeting at our  office wearing a tight t-shirt.  The thrust of his presentation was him bragging about how much he charged for services and how much money he was making.  It was a complete embarrassment.   I agreed that we had to terminate his services which made Jimmie very angry.  Jimmie had gotten very friendly with my secretary who was my right hand person. The next event was my trusted secretary had taken a number of our trust files to work on at home.  She said she had parked at a hotel late one evening and someone had broken into her vehicle and had stolen all of the trust files.  This was a very serious matter and  I called the next evening to her home at approximately 11pm to discuss pressing resulting crises that needed to be dealt with early the next morning.  When I called she was clearly drunk;  completely smashed and laughing and having a grand old time.  To my surprise I could hear Jimmie Brown laughing and hooting in the background.Needless to say I had to fire my secretary.  I found it appalling that she was unmarried & getting drunk with my fired  attorney, who is married.  What is Jimmie doing at her apartment?  Then the truth became clear.  No one had stolen the confidential trust files.  She had given them to Jimmie Brown.  Jimmie took these confidential trust files and retained them to use in a blackmail campaign that occurred shortly thereafter.Jimmie Brown filed suit against me on a ridiculous issue.  When his wife was able to refinance the home I had provided for him, he thought the closing costs were too high and demanded that I pay the $4,500 that he was questioning.  Of course it is not up to me to pay his closing costs; I had never entered into any such agreement.  Jimmie had no case whatsoever.But as an attorney representing himself he had the ability to force me to hire an attorney to defend against the lawsuit.  I proceeded to hire an attorney to defend me who turned out to be just as unscroupulous as Jimmie.  As it happens they both graduated from Texas Southern University.  They became friendly and Jimmie Brown offered my attorney, Luro Taylor, $5,000 to not tell me about a hearing to allow Jimmie Brown to get a default judgment for treble damages and attorney costs totaling $27,883.  About 6 months later I had met my Attorney in  heart to heart conversation telling him about how Jimmie Brown was harrassing me and asking how he could have failed to let me know about the hearing.  I just wanted the truth.  Luro told me that Jimmie had befriended him and that Jimmie had promised that if Luro would cooperate that he would get $5,000.  Then as things developed Luro found that Jimmie would lie and deceive him and others without a thought.  In fact Luro said that Jimmie was a person of extremely low character and that he was very untrustworthy.  Luro said that I could file a Bill of Attainder and overcome the judgment.  I asked if Luro would put these facts on paper and sign a sworn affidavit as to their truth.  Luro said he would because he wanted to be straight with God and get forgiveness.  He signed an affidavit in blue ink and gave it to me.  Confident that I could overturn the judgment I began interviewing attorneys.  When attorneys would hear the story and see the evidence they would be amazed.  Finally I found an attorney that agreed to handle the work for $5,000. I discussed suing Jimmie Brown with my attorney.  An asset search showed that jimmie was broke; with no significant assets and even no insurance!  Getting a judgment against Jimmie Brown would be a waste of money and time. That $5,000 expense grew into $10,000 and then my attorney wanted more money again.  It took a year to get the case heard.  By that time I had no more money to pay my attorney and I had to represent myself at the hearing.   The judge said that I had done a good presentation and he looked at the sworn affidavit where Luro admitted that Jimmie Brown bribed him to not tell me about the hearing.  The judge said that unfortunately Texas case law says that if your attorney misrepresents the client that is not a defense.  You are responsible for who you hire.  Getting a Bill of Attainder to overcome a judgment is extremely rare.  So Jimmie Brown got away with his fraud.      Jimmie Brown that puts a lis pindis on all of my homes and my wifes homes.  So I let them go to foreclosure rather than let Jimmie Brown get one red cent that he does not deserve.    Infuriated, now Jimmie decides to get money by blackmailing my clients.  Somehow Jimmie gets access to the ""stolen"" confidential trust documents.  Jimmie asserts that because my company has a 1% beneficial interest in the trust that he can put a lis pendis on the real estate and get free money.  My clients were shocked that Jimmie used to work for them, and now he is taking their confidential data and putting liens on their assets.  What a tremendous conflict of interest and a breach of fiduciary trust.Can you imagine putting trust in an attorney to work for you to protect your assets in  trust; and then he says the company owes him money and he wants to get it from you?  That's what he did.  He would negotiate with each investor and agree to release the lien for $3500 or $4500; whatever he could get.This caused some investors to lose their property to foreclosure as I did; and other clients like George Charnota bit the bullet and paid the scoundel off.   Jimmie has continued a vendetta against me for almost 10 years now.  He repeatedly harrasses me demanding production of checking accounts, tax returns etc.  Even though he can see there is no money and no assets he cannot accept the fact that I am broke. The sad part for Jimmie is that he is too stupid to understand you can't get blood out of a turnip.  When people have no money and lots of time -  thank goodness the internet is a tool where people can fight back against injustice.  I have nothing else to lose so I am committed to fight back against this jackal.      I see other people telling their stories about Jimmie Brown on the internet.  I encourage anyone reading this that has had bad experiences with Jimmie Brown to post them on the internet.  Everyone he works with in the public needs to know about him.  Everyone in his neighborhood needs to beware of him.  Anyone at his church -  every judge or attorney that knows him; only the truth can stop Mr. Brown from continuing to abuse people.  We need his deeds posted on facebook, and any other domain that can shame him into stopping his evil ways.

Each member of our team has extensive experience in the mortgage restructuring, and debt settlement and consolidation.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..The information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Brent Philips and Robert Newton in an interview held by a third party visit, by an on-site verification company with no biases toward Philips Law Center. The offices of Phillips Law Center are located in Costa Mesa, CA in a multi-tenant property. There is no marquee on the property, and no company signs were present on the door or in the building. The main office is a call Center with cubicles, and five private offices are occupied by Brent Phillips (Attorney at Law), Robert Newton (Resolution Manager) and several generic managers. The marketing consultant, Anthony Terah, does not have an office on-site. Two separate interviews were conducted with company representatives:  The first was with Robert Newton and Anthony Terah, and was followed by a second interview with Brent Phillips. Per Brent Phillips, (the purported namesake of the company) his office relocated from Newport Beach, CA in October of 2012. Phillips Law Center (or PLC) has no relation to Phillips Professional Law Corporation, which is a California corporation with separate offices. Although Farmer’s Law Center and Forest Law are both names that complainants have attributed to Brent’s business, he states that the name “Farmer’s Law Center” was a domain name created by a former employee that they never used (he thought the name was cheesy), and confirmed that they have never had any association with a Forest Law Center. According to Brent Phillips, his business is an Arizona corporation that does general litigation and foreclosure prevention, although there is no restructuring available in California because it is against the law to take advanced fees for Mortgage Restructuring in that state. This is a federal law, and is referred to as the Mars rule. There is an exception if you are a licensed attorney in the state and the fees have to be deposited in an attorney/client trust fund in uniformity with that states rule of responsibility. Brent is licensed in CA, AZ, and MD and has attorneys working for him in other states that work on the specific mortgage restructuring. According to Anthony Terah, leads are obtained by purchasing data and information from credit bureaus such as Experian and Equifax, and then a “legal ad” is sent to the potential client via regular mail. Per both Brent and Anthony, when a potential client calls in, “The needs of the client are evaluated, as there are many factors to determine, like when the home is purchased, the debt to income ratio, loan to value of the home and any personal hardships.” Mr. Phillips reviews the files before a client is taken on. If the client agrees to work with them, funds are deposited into a trust account in uniformity with the state rules. Mr. Phillips and Mr. Terah had consistent responses when they were asked about the typical experience a client receives with their company.  Mr. Phillips made it clear that “No experience is typical. A lot of it’s just financial, and it’s a lot like doing your taxes or bankruptcy, it’s not greater legal theory. We hone the financials, draft the appropriate hardship letters. Those are sent out (to the potential clients); they call in and speak with an intake agent. Intake agents are directed to qualify the client, not waste time. You can figure it out in ten minutes, by asking key questions. Then someone senior reviews it and it if is something that meets the criteria set out, or if there are questions, they call me right away. If the file meets criteria, we’ll have them sign a retainer, I’ll review it, and once I approve it the processing begins. The client sends in documents, and if they do not send in the complete documents, more time goes by. Also, Lenders are not as diligent about the restructuring in the loss mitigation room as they are in making new loans. In loss mitigation, they are losing money; on the other end, they’re making money. Restructuring is not their top priority.” This can often cause delays in the restructuring process. In regard to complaint resolution, Mr. Phillip’s gave the following example to illustrate how he deals with complaints: “One gentleman we accepted looked good initially. We started drilling into it, uncovered some factors that didn’t look so good. We called him, and told him the issues we saw, asked if he would like us to proceed even though it is a bit of a difficult file. If you want us to proceed, we’d be more than happy to submit your file, or it’s ok – if you would like us to cancel we will send your money back. He chose to have his money sent back. Plenty of other clients with a similar scenario want to proceed.” When asked how the client reacted, Brent responded: “Clients who are dealing with financial hardship are only as happy as they allow themselves to be. There are less than one percent who are not happy with their outcome.” Brent feels that he creates more friends and positive outcomes than the few that insist on being dissatisfied no matter what service is given.“As long as you disclose the problems in the file, it’s up to the client to make the decision. Many times they don’t have other options, they are in a bad loan, and they are upside down. For instance, they are not a Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae loan where they have a Harp loan that allows for negative equity. There is a protocol, homes affordable refinance program, which allows people with negative equity up to any amount to refinance. No other lender has that program. You go anywhere else, you generally need 20% equity. There has been a precipitous drop in home values.” Brent said he will sometimes charge the client half for services, and tell the client that if they are successful, he will charge the other half. The retainer that the client signs at the beginning of the process states what they will be doing, and they acknowledge that they have no guarantees. In the last six months, they have started recording interviews.  People hear what they want to hear, and we now have a recorded interview where they were told and acknowledge that there are no guarantees.” Anthony Terah’s approach to explaining complaint resolution was more specific about the process. He said that all accounts are updated every fourteen days in a system that the clients can see, and that all calls are returned within 24-48 hours. Because each processor handles around 155 files a piece, they do their best to accommodate the clients; however, they have assigned one person to specifically monitor all communications for all files to make sure calls are returned. If a complaint cannot be resolved by the processing staff, resolution manager Robert Newton speaks to them.  In some cases, Newton will refer cases on to Mr. Phillips to deal with personally. “We always settle in a way that is amicable,” says Newton.” If a client is not happy, they are referred to speak with the attorney assigned to their state.Brent explains that there are a number of factors that will affect results: besides the loan companies, clients are not always compliant. “We get great results. I’ve probably had 5,000 clients over the years, but you’re going to have the 1%. I understand. People, when they don’t achieve the results they desire, they complain. And the unfortunate part is, people you get results for, they never write anything. I’m not saying every file we have worked on has been perfect, no business can say that. But we send them their money back. We’ve given refunds because people complain or there are cancellations. So we try to do our best, to get what I think is fair. Simply because they didn’t get a good result, we still give them something back so they don’t leave on a bad note.”Brent and his representatives, in separate interviews, were asked about their responses to the specific complaints on Ripoff Report by former clients who claimed they were forced into foreclosure because of bad advice, or they were charged for services they did not receive. Mr. Phillips was very adamant in his response: “No one is forced into foreclosure! No one told them not to make their payments.” Mr. Phillips explained that with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loans, the process is straightforward, but if someone has a “Harper” loan, (which he describes as the high-interest loans that caused the mortgage bubble to break) they have negative equity. For instance, Mr. Phillips worked with a 74-year old widow who was given a negative amortization loan. It took 54% of her income to make her mortgage payment, which never went to her principal but only paid interest. She had the option to use her life savings to work with the original company, who had her loan, but her life savings would be depleted and the company would still foreclose, which, Brent alludes, has happened frequently when people work with these companies on their own. He helps people resubmit, and informs the customers about what is going to happen. Brent continued, “If they’re going to foreclose, (as the widow) I’d rather keep my $50,000 in savings. At that point, we re-submitted it (when she was in hardship) and got it approved. When we first submitted it, because she was not behind, the lender Indy Mac likes to play this little game. Since you’re not behind, we’re not going to do it (the restructure).” However, some customers take that warning about their original loan companies and voluntarily decide to stop making their payments. Brent says he never tells people to stop making their payments. He lets them know that lenders are more inclined to do something if they are behind, and that they need to sit down with their family and decide what they need to do, because the lender can foreclose, and it takes up to a year in Maryland, for instance, for a foreclosure to go through and he encourages clients to do what they think is best in regard to saving money in payments so they can get another house after the eventual foreclosure.According to Anthony, many of them are also applying for restructuring on their own with their company, apart from hiring Phillips Law Center, and they withdraw their request for help when they are successful on their own and expect not to have to pay anything for services.   Brent says, “A misunderstanding occurs when people say, ‘I hired you to do my mortgage restructure’, but my reply is, ‘No; you hired me to perform services;’ there are no guarantees to the outcome.”Brent made it clear that their service is to give the legal advice and help for applying for loan restructuring; however, the lenders can say no, and depending on the type of loan they have, the likelihood of success obviously affects the outcome, as well as the level of customer cooperation. In a separate interview, Anthony Terah said “You cannot promise or guarantee your lender will approve the modification application. As required by state law, they are directed to make their payments while the modification is in progress. What’s online is not accurate. It is also easy to track Brent through the state bar, where his cell phone number is on file.” Terah reiterated that clients sign an extensive retainer agreement, and calls with the customers are recorded to verify their compliance with the terms because so many erroneous complaints have come through. Terah says that Mr. Phillips does quite a bit of Pro-bono work for elderly clients, but this is never noted on the Ripoff Reports.ANY BUSINESS THAT CAN ADMIT THEY MADE MISTAKES AND CORRECTS THOSE MISTAKES IS A BUSINESS YOU CAN TRUST AND WORTH DOING BUSINESS WITH .To deal with their level of service, improvements have been made in the process to make clients feel more comfortable and informed; Phillips Law Center has hired more customer service representatives, and has mandated that every possible attempt to contact the client during developments is made. Terah stated that “All complaints are handled with a refund, even the unfounded ones. Some clients submit their own file while in process with us, and then withdraw their request, and they are refunded.” Mr. Phillips, in his effort to “do whatever it takes” to satisfy his customers and deal with complaints, had this to say: “If the file is not handled properly a refund is made. I’ve started bringing in more customer service people and keeping customers more apprised, getting back with clients in a timely fashion.”Mr. Phillips’ response on being part of the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program for Ripoff report was, simply, “We adhere to a higher ethical and business standard. We also take a personal interest in each client.” Also, he said that what sets their business apart is that they have experienced staff and follow the law. “We have licensed attorneys in every state; Maryland, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, and Pennsylvania. Most other businesses (of their type) do not have hands-on attorneys.

The offices of Phillips Law Center are located in Costa Mesa, CA in a multi-tenant property. There is no marquee on the property, and no company signs were present on the door or in the building. The main office is a call Center with cubicles, and five private offices are occupied by Brent Phillips (Attorney at Law), Robert Newton (Resolution Manager) and several generic managers. The marketing consultant, Anthony Terah, does not have an office on-site. Two separate interviews were conducted with company representatives:  The first was with Robert Newton and Anthony Terah, and was followed by a second interview with Brent Phillips. Per Brent Phillips, (the purported namesake of the company) his office relocated from Newport Beach, CA in October of 2012. Phillips Law Center (or PLC) has no relation to Phillips Professional Law Corporation, which is a California corporation with separate offices. Although Farmer’s Law Center and Forest Law are both names that complainants have attributed to Brent’s business, he states that the name “Farmer’s Law Center” was a domain name created by a former employee that they never used (he thought the name was cheesy), and confirmed that they have never had any association with a Forest Law Center. According to Brent Phillips, his business is an Arizona corporation that does general litigation and foreclosure prevention, although there is no restructuring available in California because it is against the law to take advanced fees for Mortgage Restructuring in that state. This is a federal law, and is referred to as the Mars rule. There is an exception if you are a licensed attorney in the state and the fees have to be deposited in an attorney/client trust fund in uniformity with that states rule of responsibility. Brent is licensed in CA, AZ, and MD and has attorneys working for him in other states that work on the specific mortgage restructuring. According to Anthony Terah, leads are obtained by purchasing data and information from credit bureaus such as Experian and Equifax, and then a “legal ad” is sent to the potential client via regular mail. Per both Brent and Anthony, when a potential client calls in, “The needs of the client are evaluated, as there are many factors to determine, like when the home is purchased, the debt to income ratio, loan to value of the home and any personal hardships.” Mr. Phillips reviews the files before a client is taken on. If the client agrees to work with them, funds are deposited into a trust account in uniformity with the state rules. Mr. Phillips and Mr. Terah had consistent responses when they were asked about the typical experience a client receives with their company.  Mr. Phillips made it clear that “No experience is typical. A lot of it’s just financial, and it’s a lot like doing your taxes or bankruptcy, it’s not greater legal theory. We hone the financials, draft the appropriate hardship letters. Those are sent out (to the potential clients); they call in and speak with an intake agent. Intake agents are directed to qualify the client, not waste time. You can figure it out in ten minutes, by asking key questions. Then someone senior reviews it and it if is something that meets the criteria set out, or if there are questions, they call me right away. If the file meets criteria, we’ll have them sign a retainer, I’ll review it, and once I approve it the processing begins. The client sends in documents, and if they do not send in the complete documents, more time goes by. Also, Lenders are not as diligent about the restructuring in the loss mitigation room as they are in making new loans. In loss mitigation, they are losing money; on the other end, they’re making money. Restructuring is not their top priority.” This can often cause delays in the restructuring process. In regard to complaint resolution, Mr. Phillip’s gave the following example to illustrate how he deals with complaints: “One gentleman we accepted looked good initially. We started drilling into it, uncovered some factors that didn’t look so good. We called him, and told him the issues we saw, asked if he would like us to proceed even though it is a bit of a difficult file. If you want us to proceed, we’d be more than happy to submit your file, or it’s ok – if you would like us to cancel we will send your money back. He chose to have his money sent back. Plenty of other clients with a similar scenario want to proceed.” When asked how the client reacted, Brent responded: “Clients who are dealing with financial hardship are only as happy as they allow themselves to be. There are less than one percent who are not happy with their outcome.” Brent feels that he creates more friends and positive outcomes than the few that insist on being dissatisfied no matter what service is given.“As long as you disclose the problems in the file, it’s up to the client to make the decision. Many times they don’t have other options, they are in a bad loan, and they are upside down. For instance, they are not a Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae loan where they have a Harp loan that allows for negative equity. There is a protocol, homes affordable refinance program, which allows people with negative equity up to any amount to refinance. No other lender has that program. You go anywhere else, you generally need 20% equity. There has been a precipitous drop in home values.” Brent said he will sometimes charge the client half for services, and tell the client that if they are successful, he will charge the other half. The retainer that the client signs at the beginning of the process states what they will be doing, and they acknowledge that they have no guarantees. In the last six months, they have started recording interviews.  People hear what they want to hear, and we now have a recorded interview where they were told and acknowledge that there are no guarantees.” Anthony Terah’s approach to explaining complaint resolution was more specific about the process. He said that all accounts are updated every fourteen days in a system that the clients can see, and that all calls are returned within 24-48 hours. Because each processor handles around 155 files a piece, they do their best to accommodate the clients; however, they have assigned one person to specifically monitor all communications for all files to make sure calls are returned. If a complaint cannot be resolved by the processing staff, resolution manager Robert Newton speaks to them.  In some cases, Newton will refer cases on to Mr. Phillips to deal with personally. “We always settle in a way that is amicable,” says Newton.” If a client is not happy, they are referred to speak with the attorney assigned to their state.Brent explains that there are a number of factors that will affect results: besides the loan companies, clients are not always compliant. “We get great results. I’ve probably had 5,000 clients over the years, but you’re going to have the 1%. I understand. People, when they don’t achieve the results they desire, they complain. And the unfortunate part is, people you get results for, they never write anything. I’m not saying every file we have worked on has been perfect, no business can say that. But we send them their money back. We’ve given refunds because people complain or there are cancellations. So we try to do our best, to get what I think is fair. Simply because they didn’t get a good result, we still give them something back so they don’t leave on a bad note.”Brent and his representatives, in separate interviews, were asked about their responses to the specific complaints on Ripoff Report by former clients who claimed they were forced into foreclosure because of bad advice, or they were charged for services they did not receive. Mr. Phillips was very adamant in his response: “No one is forced into foreclosure! No one told them not to make their payments.” Mr. Phillips explained that with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loans, the process is straightforward, but if someone has a “Harper” loan, (which he describes as the high-interest loans that caused the mortgage bubble to break) they have negative equity. For instance, Mr. Phillips worked with a 74-year old widow who was given a negative amortization loan. It took 54% of her income to make her mortgage payment, which never went to her principal but only paid interest. She had the option to use her life savings to work with the original company, who had her loan, but her life savings would be depleted and the company would still foreclose, which, Brent alludes, has happened frequently when people work with these companies on their own. He helps people resubmit, and informs the customers about what is going to happen. Brent continued, “If they’re going to foreclose, (as the widow) I’d rather keep my $50,000 in savings. At that point, we re-submitted it (when she was in hardship) and got it approved. When we first submitted it, because she was not behind, the lender Indy Mac likes to play this little game. Since you’re not behind, we’re not going to do it (the restructure).” However, some customers take that warning about their original loan companies and voluntarily decide to stop making their payments. Brent says he never tells people to stop making their payments. He lets them know that lenders are more inclined to do something if they are behind, and that they need to sit down with their family and decide what they need to do, because the lender can foreclose, and it takes up to a year in Maryland, for instance, for a foreclosure to go through and he encourages clients to do what they think is best in regard to saving money in payments so they can get another house after the eventual foreclosure.According to Anthony, many of them are also applying for restructuring on their own with their company, apart from hiring Phillips Law Center, and they withdraw their request for help when they are successful on their own and expect not to have to pay anything for services.   Brent says, “A misunderstanding occurs when people say, ‘I hired you to do my mortgage restructure’, but my reply is, ‘No; you hired me to perform services;’ there are no guarantees to the outcome.”Brent made it clear that their service is to give the legal advice and help for applying for loan restructuring; however, the lenders can say no, and depending on the type of loan they have, the likelihood of success obviously affects the outcome, as well as the level of customer cooperation. In a separate interview, Anthony Terah said “You cannot promise or guarantee your lender will approve the modification application. As required by state law, they are directed to make their payments while the modification is in progress. What’s online is not accurate. It is also easy to track Brent through the state bar, where his cell phone number is on file.” Terah reiterated that clients sign an extensive retainer agreement, and calls with the customers are recorded to verify their compliance with the terms because so many erroneous complaints have come through. Terah says that Mr. Phillips does quite a bit of Pro-bono work for elderly clients, but this is never noted on the Ripoff Reports.ANY BUSINESS THAT CAN ADMIT THEY MADE MISTAKES AND CORRECTS THOSE MISTAKES IS A BUSINESS YOU CAN TRUST AND WORTH DOING BUSINESS WITH .To deal with their level of service, improvements have been made in the process to make clients feel more comfortable and informed; Phillips Law Center has hired more customer service representatives, and has mandated that every possible attempt to contact the client during developments is made. Terah stated that “All complaints are handled with a refund, even the unfounded ones. Some clients submit their own file while in process with us, and then withdraw their request, and they are refunded.” Mr. Phillips, in his effort to “do whatever it takes” to satisfy his customers and deal with complaints, had this to say: “If the file is not handled properly a refund is made. I’ve started bringing in more customer service people and keeping customers more apprised, getting back with clients in a timely fashion.”Mr. Phillips’ response on being part of the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program for Ripoff report was, simply, “We adhere to a higher ethical and business standard. We also take a personal interest in each client.” Also, he said that what sets their business apart is that they have experienced staff and follow the law. “We have licensed attorneys in every state; Maryland, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, and Pennsylvania. Most other businesses (of their type) do not have hands-on attorneys.

 Child Protective Services ,"  Child Protective Services    San Antonio, Texas United States of America ", , ,"Child Protective Services DFPS I need help as to find ways to not allow CPS to terminate my rights San Antonio, Texas","										Here is my story, back in 2005 my daughter was removed by Child Protective Services from my home for allegations of drug abuse. I did their service plan and I passed every drug test because I was not doing any drugs. I did refuse to receive drug rehab because I explained to the nurse at the rehabilitation center that I am not a drug user. She reported it to my case worker about my refusal and the caseworker had me do a random drug test and told me that if I passed she will remove drug rehab from my service plan. I did of course passed, so she had rehab removed off my service plan. I felt that if I passed every drug test and I was under investigation of drug abuse, it should have raised a red flag with these allegations that were brought upon me.I did hold a good job as CPS requested but I was in an abusive relationship, which I did remove myself from and moved into a stable home where it was an adequate home for my daughter to live in according to an investigator from CPS. I did complete my service plan but the caseworker dragged this case out for 18 months till I ended up losing guardianship over my daughter, but had my uncle as managing conservator.Shortly after the case was closed, I did take care and support my daughter without any child support from my ex-husband. I remarried where now my husband has been helping me raise my two daughters since my youngest was 6 weeks old. My husband serves in the U.S Army and is getting ready to deploy to Afghanistan in the next 6 weeks.Well in September of 2012, CPS got involved again due to physical abuse on my oldest daughter. But after reading the affidavit I noticed that there have been more allegations on me that are completely false. At the time that CPS investigated, my neighbor was helping me care for my children since I just received surgery 2 weeks prior to this investigation.According to the affidavit, it states that I burned my daughter's pictures, threatened to kill my daughter, had a gun (which I do not own), and made terroristic threats on the school where she was attending. Well because of those allegations, both my children were removed from my home. As I mentioned before, my neighbor was with me through all this commotion, and she went to court with me and told the caseworkers, and the attorneys that I never made any threats. I have been doing the service plan, and been more than co-operative with my caseworker.I never heard anything from the school district about the terroistic threats so I felt that that matter is closed. But a lot of the allegations were taken way out of context. I have been showing up to my visitations with my kids and showing up to all my appointments and classes working on re-unification with my daughters. I thought I was doing okay but I did raise some concern with my attorney and the caseworker when I found out that that CPS is working on my oldest daughter communicating with her biological father. He has been an absent parent and has never seen nor talked to her ever since she was born. I've been protecting her from him due to the fact that he has an abusive history and my marriage was dissolved on the grounds of cruelty.As I mentioned before, I raised some concern and felt like I'm being ignored. The caseworker has come into contact with my husband, and now he has to do a service plan with CPS as well even though I do have his deployment papers.I went to my hearing with CPS yesterday, and to be honest with you, I was in a state of shock when I heard the caseworker's testimony. As of March 14, 2013 he had decided to be looking at termination of my rights and stated that he has spoken to both mine and the children's therapists and they both feel that CPS should terminate my visitations with my daughters.But since he cannot provide any proof on what the therapists' recommendations, the judge did not honor the caseworker's request. The caseworker also stated that I have been inappropriate with my children during visitations, which the caseworker never mentioned to me until the hearing and as I mentioned before is looking for termination. I felt that I've been more than co-operative with CPS regarding their service plan but I feel as if CPS is not co-operating with me as to helping my with re-unification.I ask that someone please help me because my voice was not heard in the last case with the drug allegations, and I'm very afraid of losing my children. My final hearing is set for July 22, 2013 @ 9:00 AM, so any legal advice will be most appreciative. Thank you for taking the time in reading this. My name is Jackie and I currently reside in San Antonio, but because of this case, I couldn't move to Ft. Campbell with my husband since I am dealing with my battle as to fighting for my kids.

 Eugene Edward Kinsey ,"  Eugene Edward Kinsey  323 main street ,seal beach california 90740 Internet United States of America ",kinseylaw.com, 5625968177,Eugene Edward Kinsey  UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR OF EUGENE KINSEY Internet,"										I retained Mr Kinsey on 6 Dec 2011 and handed all the paperwork from my previous counsel. Gave all the demographic details of my spouse. My trial was set for May 3 2012 and Final Status Conference was set for April 26,2012.Discovery cut off date was March 26,2012.I constantly requested and reminded Mr Kinsey to send the Notice of Deposition to the other party. But Mr Kinsey did not pay any attention until the last moment .On February 21 2012 Mr Kinsey mailed the Notice of Deposition setting the Respondents deposition on March 30 2012 at his Office in Seal Beach Ca.The opposing counsel objected to the deposition on March 12 2012 based on C.C.P Section 2025.26(a),which is true as my spouse resides in Santa Clara almost 500 miles from his Office and this thing was told to Mr Kinsey on the very first day.To cover his mistake Mr Kinsey filed an EX PARTE on March 26 2012 for ORDERS COMPELLING THE ATTENDANCE OF THE RESPONDENT AT HER DEPOSITION CURRENTLY SET FOR MARCH 30,2012 IN THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY FOR THE PETITIONER OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE FOR ORDERS SETTING THE DATE,TIME AND PLACE OF THE RESPONDENTS DEPOSITION.The EX PARTE was denied but the Court ordered April 11 2012 as a hearing date for the Motion to Compel deposition of the Respondent. Mr Kinsey Judged that the matter would be going to the Trial and demanded $5,000.00 more as retainer which I transferred on April 4 2012.On April 9 Mr Kinsey emailed me to continue sending him the Exhibits but when he went to the hearing on April 11 2012 instead of discussing about his motion to compel Respondents deposition Mr Kinsey proposed Mediation and the Judge transferred the matter to the ADR.The Judge also advised Mr Kinsey to file a motion to reopen discovery as the discovery is not automatically re-opened with the new trial date.When I questioned ,Mr Kinsey told me lie that the Court had proposed mediation WHAT HE DID 1)He was lazy to propound the Notice of Deposition and when he did it was objected because of his mistake as she lives more than 150 miles from his Office. 2) Because of his action the discovery cut-off date of March 26 2012 was passed and he incurred me $3450.00 for the EX PARTE and motion to compel her deposition. 3) On April 11 2012 hearing he proposed that both the lawyers have opted for mediation ,whereas he never disclosed this thing to me on the contrary he took 2nd retainer of $5000.00 from me as he told me that the case would go to the trial. WHAT HE DID NOT DO 1) He did not talk about his Motion to Compel her deposition on April 11 2012,instead proposed mediation which hampered my case for 1 year from April 11 2012 to March 22 2013. As a result of his action April 11 2012 hearing will be done on March 22 2013. 2). He did not file a motion to re-open discovery as advised to him by the Judge Mark Borenstein on April 11 2012.As a result of his action now I can no longer perform any discovery on my case.He did irreparable damage to my case. 3) He proposed mediation but did not take any step to mature it nor did he informed or updated me by any means. I was kept in total darkness as to what is going on in my case from April 11 2012 to time I decided to fire him in October 2012. 4).When the opposing party disqualified the judge he did not do anything for 4 months.,whenever I called him to take some action to bring dates back on calendar he would state that ,""Rapinder tomorrow is your day"" and unfortunately ""tomorrow"" never came and I had to fire him to take the case in my hands. How did I uncover everything I had a hearing on Motion to Compel Request for Admission on February 13 2013 .At that hearing the Judge wanted to see the transcript form the last hearing.

Valle BURBANK, California United States of America ",http://www.mcc-construction.com/, 818-843-2010,"MCCORMICK ADR AMERICAN MEDIATION CONCILATION CENTER, STEVEN W.MCCORMICK, MCCORMICK CONSTRUCTION, MCCORMICK  CONSULTATION CRUCIFIXTION, CHEATED, SCREWED,  BURBANK, California","										I'm not going to get into details because I'm taking this to court.  I install a roof for a customer who was just looking for an installer.  No one knew about the roof because the company was new. Unfortunately for the lame customer I've had to deal with, the company who made the roofing product went bankrupt after only 2 years. I installed the roof to factory specs.  I tried to talk this customer out of this crap roof that weighed 70Lbs per sq. But he kept insisting this is what he wanted. The states paid roofing expert wrote in his report that I had put it on incorrectly.  The report changed from being my fault at arbitration when we sat across from one another. At arbitration the expert tore the manufacturer up and told us what a cheap product it was.  Before closing the arbitration I asked the state's expert, ""But I did put the roof on to the factory specifications right?""  He replied, ""yes, unfortunately your the installer. That proves no negligence on my part. So why did I lose a case on a roof I put on correctly over 4 years ago?  It's the same as the owner buying a Delorean car, then he sees it doesn't perform like he thought and since Delorean is bankrupt he has no recourse but too turn around and sue the assembly line workers and win.  How ludicrous can this be?  Then Steven McCormick gives the stubborn old cuss double the amount the roof would cost to replace.  Straight up he screwed me and I still don't know why.My only advice to anyone out there is that unless your a member of the Mason's, Shriners or Royal Order of Jesters, don't use this firm because you never quite know who the other person is your going up against.If you want to know the rest of this SNAFU let me know.

 Ann Herrera Atty ,"  Ann Herrera Atty  201 Swanton Way Atlanta, Georgia United States of America ", , ,"Ann Herrera Atty  Legal Services Atlanta, Georgia"," Ann Attorney Herrera whose specialty is Probate law. of the law firm Russell & Herrera, PC  ,AtlantaGA the Conservator of my wife appointed by the Fulton County Probate Court Jane Grant did the following.A $350,000 bill made up of 3 law firms was charged against my wifes estate which Ann Herrera is the Conservator for up to this date is a tremendous rip off and now I am going to say why. She Ann Herrera the Conservatordid not raise one question over the bills and agreed to the payment of them.  Her job is to protect the assets not squanderingthem. And did not question one billing item. In other words, its a big club. 3 Law firms Michael Lambros Esq.  Catherine Packwood, Esq of the Lambros firm Emory Schwall Esq. Stephen Carley Esq. handled the probate activities. For some unknown reason they created an irrevocable trust. I asked Steven Carley in writing a dozen times what are the benefits, of an irrevocable trust. He never answered once. Imto understand that Emory Schwall is the attorney that proposed an irrevocable trust and thats his specialty.An irrevocable trust can be gotten off the web from West Law for 5 minutes of time. There was no reason for this bill to be rendered and I stood up in court Jerome D Hoffman and told the judge that this is a rip off and I would not have consented to signing the settlement agreement. After I signed the settlement agreement which Emory Schwall helped prepared. In court, Irealize five minute later that there were paragraphs in there that should have been taken out and he told me they were out.These three attorneys collectively, over the months fees are being milked off the estate of Jane Grant. It is estimated by other lawyers that this work should not have cost more than $15 to $20,000.  Infact, they did not even draw the trust agreement; they had an outside firm draw it and paid them $12,500. Im the only one who has paid for my legal fees since May of 2012 in fighting this action. Janes son Charles and James Grant of Hartwell, GA did not raise one question about the bills. If they would have, I believe that they would have been ostracized by this group. They hired Eric Leavell in one form or another to do the following:Eric, were to understand, has been in-and-out of mental hospitals for the last ten years.  People that know him say that he is psychotic and potentially very dangerous.  There aretwo police investigations in Atlanta now taking place about Mr. Leavell.I have been told that Eric Leavell has been in and out ofmental institutions for a number of years.. I believe he is a sadist psychopath who put this on the Web. He worked for our company in Atlanta for three months, and he was paid in full, treated very well, spent a third of his time out of the office doing therapy, and nothing was deducted for his time out.At the beginning of the second month, we raised his pay from $30,000 to $50,000 a year.  He was later discharged for cause of indecent behavior.  Whatever his preference is, that is his business, it is not to be carried out in my office.Our in-house attorney, Phil Craig, told everyone in the office to be fearful of him because he thought he could be very dangerous.  Eric has said to many people, I am the meanest son of a b**ch alive.  He has stated many times that when he goes out, he will go out with a big bang, whatever that means.Eric has done this to other people as well, I have been told, including an executive of Walmart. There are two police investigations taking place in Atlanta over Eric Leavell at this time.  Shortly there will be a very extensive reportpublished on the Web of his activities done by a private detective agency.What this is all about, is that my wife, Jane Grant, for twenty-five years invested in my companies over the years.  She has not talked to her sons, Charles and James Grant, for over two years, because she said, They are only after my money.An agreement was made in Probate Court, Fulton County, Georgia,that her sons would get none of the money from the investment in my company. Janeand I have an agreement that we would give our share to a Foundation to thegood people of Atlanta, which could amount to Tens of Millions of Dollars or more.Charles and James Grant, Janes sons, by her first marriage, hired Eric Leavell in one form or another, to discredit me.  Shortly, there will be on the Web, a two thousand page document explaining in great detail with court papers this wholeunfortunate incident.One of Eric Leavells cohorts is Paul Rinko, attorney-at-law.  I would like to quote one of his e-mails to me, plus, three mails from Eric Leavell to me that will explain his psychotic behavior.One can see that Eric has severe problems.  Eric has done this to others, and they will testify in Court when litigation begins. Janes sons, Charles and Jimmy, put Eric Leavell up to this.  We have a complete history of Eric Leavell,from his fraudulent bankruptcy, and much more.Creditors are prepared to testify about Mr. Leavell.  We have some thirty e-mails from Mr. Leavell,which I would like to print the text of three which will tell you his mental state.Paul J. Rinko, a licensed attorney in the State of New York, registration number 2365211, formerly with the Kiley Law Firm, Utica, New York, has written me over seventy e-mails in the past three years, and is a collaborator of Eric Leavell.  I wouldlike to quote from one of Paul Rinkos e-mails, and the others can be broughtup on this Website which is now being organized. some two thousand pages.Note:    We have not displayed email addresses due to the rules of the website. But the following testimonialsprovide examples of events that have taken place. They all have been verified. Testimonial 1 Convict:  Get on your knees B**tard, I am your Master, you are my Slave.  You will obey me.  I will not let you become successful. I will hunt you down for the rest of your life.  You will obey me.  This is what you get for suing me.  If Mr. Rinko feels that this is not true, why doesnt he sue me? He knows that there are about seventy similar e-mails.  Mr. Rinko is an attorney nowliving in Richmond, Virginia, working for his brothers firm, which is ColonialScientific, Inc., 2121 Hamilton Street, #1, Richmond, Virginia.  He is vice president of the corporation.  A copy of this e-mail was sent to his brother, his former law firm, and others.I have sent all seventy of his e-mails to fifty State Bar Associations, and asked if it is the proper behavior of an attorney who may wish to obtain a license in your state.The response from the Bar Associations were astoundingthat an attorney licensed in NY could send approximately 70 emails over a 3 yearperiod that are sexually an d sadistically and masochistically phrased. We are now going to present a number of e-mails from EricLeavell, which I believe will explain his mental state and our rebuttal.Testimonial 2Convict Hoffman You have no money except for about 700 a month in Social Security.  You signed Janes name to checks which is a felony for each check. You exploited even more money from her by having her sign blank checks.  You are lookingto serve about 50 years in jail.I am the reason you lost today.  I am the reason that the authorities have the checks where you signed Janes name. I am the reason you have no more access to Janes money.  I am the reason FOX news was at the hearing today. I am the reason East West Bank knows about your dealings and wont do business with you.  I am the reason your efforts toChinese immigrants have failed to raise money. I will be the reason you go to jail.  I win.  You lose.  Jane is free of you forever.Erik .This man is insane and having hallucinations.  Let me see one check on which I have signed Janes name, and he should take it to the authorities.Testimonial 3Jerold: After careful thought and serious consideration, I am tendering my two week notice and resignation; my last daywith the company will be February 10, 2012. I had every intention of making a career with GFH/Todays Market and still believe you will redefine the retail food industry, however I can no longer be part of this company and your vision.Unfortunately, the events of today compounded by the conversation tonight at 10:15pm lead me to oneconclusion; our boundaries became, at some point, so muddled that itwill only continue to erode our working relationship and I want to leave before that happens. I will continue to fully perform my role for you during the next two weeks and assistwith the transition in any and all ways possible.  If you wish for me to leave at an earlier date, then I will respect that request.Please know that I am grateful for the opportunity you gave me; I learned a tremendous amount from you in a short time.  I was also thrilled with the 45% raise you gave me in my first 30 days. However, neither of those can overcome the increasingly derogatory and demeaning conversations that are becoming regularinteractions within the office. I am not sure if you ever listen to the words you say to me, but I find it offensive. For example, you will ask me to hold off on sending an email and then go into a tirade an hour later about the email notbeing sent or tell me to send one specific piece of information to a person andthen go into a tirade that other information should have been sent even thoughyou were specific that only one piece of information be sent and it is neveryour practice to send supplemental information to individuals.There was also the time you were reading a copy of a sent email that I typed from your dictation and stormedinto my office telling me that by inadvertently adding the word then to a sentence that I am re-writing your entire email and that my job should be replaced by someone more talented in New York.There have also been incidents when you tell me that if I use a particular job board again that  I will be fired and then spend 10 minutes belittling me when I ask you if you want to use that job board after you were clear to never use it again.In no way do I claim to be perfect you helped show me many ways that I could do a task in a better way  I simply dont havethe fortitude to keep enduring this treatment. There is no waiting job for me.  I tender this resignation will enterthe unemployed masses; I will remain unemployed for however long it takes to find another job.  In fact, there is a good chance that I will make less in my next job, but some things are not about money and, this is one of those times.I will let you tell whomever in whatever timeline you wish about my departure.  I will not discuss this with workcolleagues.  I copied Phil on this email so he may prepare whatever exist paperwork you wish for me to review and signprior to my last day. Obviously, I will respect the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and have nothing disparaging to sayabout the company or anyone associated with it so will have no issue signing additional paperwork to that effect.It was a hard decision to say goodbye to this opportunity, but in my heart I knew it would be harder for me to stay.Best of luck with TodaysMarket.It was on January 27, that I found Eric Leavell having oral sex in the office and told him this could notcontinue.  What is his preference is his business, but not in the company office. Testimonial 4Convict Hoffman-It is my understanding that the Marshall served you with a summons at Janes house (not your home since younever contribute any money to the home as you are a loser and financialfailure) to appear on May 21, 2012, in Fulton County Court for the Criminal Warrant Hearing with regard to the matter I reported and your statement to me that youwere going to get me  Stacie confirms that the summons is at the house.Also I wanted to share with you that I contacted the Chinese Embassy, reported your outstanding warrantnumber, sent over a copy of the police report itemizing your theft as wellas the US Court of Appeals verdict holding you personally liable for more than$500,000 in claims so that you could not get a visa to talk with Chinese investors. Since you only have 600 a month to live on from Social Security  what a joke  I didnt think it was fair for you towaste a visa application fee for no reason. You are a model to the world in how to avoid failure by doing the exact opposite of whatever choice youmake.  Maybe that is your one purpose and contribution to life.Anyone can put anything on the web.  In your case its all true.Warmest Regards,ErikPS  I also sent over the excerpt from your deposition in the appeal in which you state the business hasno money and no credit line therefore violating the two key provisions forhaving a business visa to solicit investors. Ha!Eric Leavell is insane.  Let him show one document to verify any of these allegations. I repeat, Eric Leavell is insane, let him show one document to verify any of these e-mails to me, including the AppealsCourt Record, etc.James and Charlie Grant, Janes children by her first marriage, who will receive no moneyfrom my and Janes companies, put Eric Leavell up to this.I alsobelieve that Michael Lambros and Patricia Packwood, attorneys for the Grantboys, helped to facilitate this enormous fabrication that Eric Leavell put on the Web.  I have been physically threatened twice by Michael Lambros, Esq., on two differentoccasions.  On the first occasion, SteveCarly, Esq., Janes attorney, was present and had to step in between Mr.Lambros and I, when he was ready to strike me. This incident took place in the Honorable Judge Pinkie Toomers Court Room in Probate Court,Fulton County, Georgia. at the Hearing for Settlement Agreement about two years ago.  The second incident was when I was in Court on the 19th of October, 2012 andthere were four witnesses, Gary Spencer, Esq., Bertram Boley, Jr., Esq., JaneGrant, and the Court Officer who I do not know by name.  The Court Officer had to physically step-in between Mr. Lambros and me because he wasready to attack me and raised his hand to strike my face.  This is the attorney for James and Charles Grant.At that time, my wife was in the Court Room, and she said to me, They told me  you were dead.  I love you, come home like it used to be.The warrant that Eric refers to is that he swore out a warrant for my arrest that Ithreatened his life and had a witness to verify this by the name of ThomasMattas, who worked in our office.  At the Court Hearing Thomas Mattas, did not show up, the judge read some of the above anddismissed the case, and the warrant was for a misdemeanor, not a felony.  Gary Spencer, of Atlanta, Georgia, was myattorney of record at the Hearing.A two-thousand page report that will shortly be on the Web will treat with this rebuttal.  I urge anyone interested to see the complete report that will give you a comprehensive view of what has taken place.Fox News, owned by News Corp. did two stories on me.  One was donethree years ago, when I had a physical fight with the anchor man, Randy Travis,which is on tape, facilitated by Paul Rinko. Mr. Travis tried to break-in to our office forcing the door open and Ikicked him in the groin. He had no right to come on to our property and force the door open. Court records, Cobb County SuperiorCourt, Georgia, will verify the incident and I sued Fox News for invasion ofprivacy.  For some strange reason, when the trial date was to take place our attorney did not show up, and the case was dismissed.  And the other story, a few months ago, which Eric Leavell helped facilitate, which is described in hise-mail to me quoted in this document.  At that time, I had another physical encounter with Randy Travis, the reporter onFox News, who swore out a warrant for my arrest. Mr. Travis is some thirty years younger than me.  I might point outthat this was a misdemeanor under Georgia law and not a criminal act.  He reported on the news that I was afugitive. Randy Travis stalked me with a cameraman for over two hundred yards when I was going to a garage to pick upmy care, he stated in Court that I broke his camera.The reason I am stating these two incidents of Fox News is that they are famous for this type of reporting inthis country and abroad.  The scandal of London is now the scandal in the USA.Rupert Murdoch, President of News Corporation, which owns Fox News, I believe is a decent and fair man, andhe is set about cleaning up the scandal reporting that has taken place in his organization.  As you may know, one hundred reporters have been arrested in London over accepting bribes, bribing ScotlandYard, tapping the Queens phones, and closing one of the oldest newspapers inLondon, The Sunday Times.The scandal is now coming to the States.  He has promised to cleanthis up, and the reporting of his other companies in America.An Index of every document will be listed on the Website and its origin of which will allow interestedparties to digitally search for any information about this case.  In reading these documents, it will give youa more comprehensive background of this unfortunate episode.This is a public document. In answering these allegations by Eric Leavell, let it be known that a foundation in the name ofJane Grant is now being established.Our company is building stores throughout the nation. For everystore we build, a Half-Million Dollars of hers and my share will go to herfoundation in her name, and will be given to the good citizens of greater Atlanta.Now please explore the website.This document will be furnished to the media.It is a shame and tragic that in todays world anybody can put anything on the web. All complaints were written by the same people in this memorandum.They are Eric Leavell and Paul Rinko. ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

They all have been verified. Testimonial 1  Convict:  Get on your knees B******, I am your Master, you are my Slave.  You will obey me.  I will not let you become successful.I will hunt you down for the rest of your life.  You will obey me.  This is what you get for suing me.   If Mr. Rinko feels that this is not true, why doesnt he sue me?  He knows that there are about seventy similare-mails.  Mr. Rinko is an attorney now living in Richmond, Virginia, working for his brothers firm, which is ColonialScientific, Inc., 2121 Hamilton Street, #1, Richmond, Virginia.  He is vice president of the corporation.  A copy of this e-mail was sent to his brother, his former law firm, and others. I have sent all seventy of his e-mails to fifty State Bar Associations, and asked if it is the proper behavior of an attorney who may wish to obtain a license in your state.  The response from the Bar Associations were astounding that an attorney licensed in NY could send approximately 70 emails over a 3 year period that are sexually an d sadistically and masochistically phrased.   We are now going to present a number of e-mails from Eric Leavell, which I believe will explain his mental state and our rebuttal.  Testimonial 2Convict Hoffman You have no money except for about 700 a month in Social Security.  You signed Janes name to checks which is a felonyfor each check.  You exploited even more money from her by having her sign blank checks.  You are looking to serve about 50 years in jail.I am the reason you lost today.  I am the reason that the authorities have the checks where you signed Janes name. I am the reason you have no more access to Janes money.  I am the reason FOX news was at the hearing today. I am the reason East West Bank knows about your dealings and wont do business with you.  I am the reason your efforts to Chinese immigrants have failed to raise money. I will be the reason you go to jail.  I win.  You lose.  Jane is free of you forever. Erik .. . . . . . . . . . .. This man is insane and having hallucinations.  Let me see one check on which I have signed Janes name, and he should take it to the authorities. Testimonial 3Jerold:  After careful thought and serious consideration, I am tendering my two week notice and resignation; my last daywith the company will be February 10, 2012. I had every intention of making a career with GFH/Todays Market and still believe you will redefine the retail food industry, however I can no longer be part of this company and your vision. Unfortunately, the events of today compounded by the conversation tonight at 10:15pm lead me to one conclusion; our boundaries became, at some point, so muddled that it will only continue to erode our working relationship and I want to leave before that happens. I will continue to fully perform my role for you during the next two weeks and assist with the transition in any and all ways possible.  If you wish for me to leave at an earlier date, then I will respect that request.Please know that I am grateful for the opportunity you gave me; I learned a tremendous amount from you in a short time.  I was also thrilled with the 45% raise you gave me in my first 30 days.  However, neither of those can overcome the increasingly derogatory and demeaning conversations that are becoming regular interactions within the office. I am not sure if you ever listen to the words you say to me, but I find it offensive.  For example, you will ask me to hold off on sending an email and then go into a tirade an hour later about the email notbeing sent or tell me to send one specific piece of information to a person and then go into a tirade that other information should have been sent even though you were specific that only one piece of information be sent and it is never your practice to send supplemental information to individuals.There was also the time you were reading a copy of a sent email that I typed from your dictation and stormedinto my office telling me that  by inadvertently adding the word then to a sentence that I am re-writing your entire email and that my job should be replaced by someone more talented in New York.There have also been incidents when you tell me that if I use a particular job board again that  I will be fired and then spend 10 minutes belittling me when I ask you if you want to use that job board after you were clear to never use it again. In no way do I claim to be perfect you helped show me many ways that I could do a task in a better way  I simply dont have the fortitude to keep enduring this treatment.  There is no waiting job for me.  I tender this resignation will enter the unemployed masses; I will remain unemployed for however long it takes to find another job.  In fact, there is a good chance that I will make less in my next job, but some things are not about money and, this is one of those times.  I will let you tell whomever in whatever timeline you wish about my departure.  I will not discuss this with workcolleagues.  I copied Phil on this email so he may prepare whatever exist paperwork you wish for me to review and signprior to my last day.   Obviously, I will respect the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and have nothing disparaging to say about the company or anyone associated with it so will have no issue signing additional paperwork to that effect. It was a hard decision to say goodbye to this opportunity, but in my heart I knew it would be harder for me to stay. Best of luck with Todays Market. It was on January 27, that I found Eric Leavell having oral sex in the office and told him this could not continue.  What is his preference is his business, but not in the company office.  Testimonial 4 Convict Hoffman- It is my understanding that the Marshall served you with a summons at Janes house (not your home since you never contribute any money to the home as you are a loser and financial failure) to appear on May 21, 2012, in Fulton County Court  for the Criminal Warrant Hearing with regard to the matter I reported and your statement to me that youwere going to get me  Stacie confirms that the summons is at the house.Also I wanted to share with you that I contacted the Chinese Embassy, reported your outstanding warrant number, sent over a copy of the police report  itemizing your theft as well as the US Court of Appeals verdict holding you personally liable for more than $500,000 in claims so that you could not get a visa to talk with Chinese investors. Since you only have 600 a month to live on from Social Security  what a joke  I didnt think it was fair for you towaste a visa application fee for no reason.  You are a model to the world in how to avoid failure by doing the exact opposite of whatever choice you make.  Maybe that is your one purpose and contribution to life.Anyone can put anything on the web.  In your case its all true. Warmest Regards,ErikPS  I also sent over the excerpt from your deposition in the appeal in which you state the business has no money and no credit line therefore violating the two key provisions for having a business visa to solicit investors. Ha! Eric Leavell is insane.  Let him show one document to verify any of these allegations. I repeat, Eric Leavell is insane, let him show one document to verify any of these e-mails to me, including the AppealsCourt Record, etc. James and Charlie Grant, Janes children by her first marriage, who will receive no money from my and Janes companies, put Eric Leavell up to this. I also believe that Michael Lambros and Patricia Packwood, attorneys for the Grant boys, helped to facilitate this enormous fabrication that Eric Leavell put on the Web.   I have been physically threatened twice by Michael Lambros, Esq., on two different occasions.  On the first occasion, Steve Carly, Esq., Janes attorney, was present and had to step in between Mr. Lambros and I, when he was ready to strike me. This incident took place in the Honorable Judge Pinkie Toomers Court Room in Probate Court, Fulton County, Georgia. at the Hearing for Settlement Agreement about two years ago.   The second incident was when I was in Court on the 19th of October, 2012 and there were four witnesses, Gary Spencer, Esq., Bertram Boley, Jr., Esq., Jane Grant, and the Court Officer who I do not know by name.   The Court Officer had to physically step-in between Mr. Lambros and me because he was ready to attack me and raised his hand to strike my face.  This is the attorney for James and Charles Grant. At that time, my wife was in the Court Room, and she said to me, They told me  you were dead.  I love you, come home like it used to be. The warrant that Eric refers to is that he swore out a warrant for my arrest that I threatened his life and had a witness to verify this by the name of Thomas Mattas, who worked in our office.   At the Court Hearing Thomas Mattas, did not show up, the judge read some of the above and dismissed the case, and the warrant was for a misdemeanor, not a felony.  Gary Spencer, of Atlanta, Georgia, was my attorney of record at the Hearing. A two-thousand page report that will shortly be on the Web will treat with this rebuttal.  I urge anyone interested to see the complete report that will give you a comprehensive view of what has taken place. Fox News, owned by News Corp. did two stories on me.  One was done three years ago, when I had a physical fight with the anchor man, Randy Travis, which is on tape, facilitated by Paul Rinko. Mr. Travis tried to break-in to our office forcing the door open and I kicked him in the groin.  He had no right to come on to our property and force the door open. Court records, Cobb County Superior Court, Georgia, will verify the incident and I sued Fox News for invasion of privacy.  For some strange reason, whenthe trial date was to take place our attorney did not show up, and the case was dismissed.   And the other story, a few months ago, which Eric Leavell helped facilitate, which is described in his e-mail to me quoted in this document.  At that time, I had another physical encounter with Randy Travis, the reporter on Fox News, who swore out a warrant for my arrest.  Mr. Travis is some thirty years younger than me.  I might point out that this was a misdemeanor under Georgia law and not a criminal act.  He reported on the news that I was a fugitive.   Randy Travis stalked me with a cameraman for over two hundred yards when I was going to a garage to pick upmy care, he stated in Court that I broke his camera.  The reason I am stating these two incidents of Fox News is that they are famous for this type of reporting in this country and abroad.  The scandal of London is now the scandal in the USA. Rupert Murdoch, President of News Corporation, which owns Fox News, I believe is a decent and fair man, and he is set about cleaning up the scandal reporting that has taken place in his organization.  As you may know, one hundred reporters have been arrested in London over accepting bribes, bribing ScotlandYard, tapping the Queens phones, and closing one of the oldest newspapers in London, The Sunday Times. The scandal is now coming to the States.  He has promised to clean this up, and the reporting of his other companies in America. An Index of every document will be listed on the Website and its origin of which will allow interested parties to digitally search for any information about this case.  In reading these documents, it will give you a more comprehensive background of this unfortunate episode. This is a public document.  In answering these allegations by Eric Leavell, let it be known that a foundation in the name of Jane Grant is now being established. Our company is building stores throughout the nation. For every store we build, a Half-Million Dollars of hers and my share will go to her foundation in her name, and will be given to the good citizens of greater Atlanta. Now please explore the website.  This document will be furnished to the media.It is a shame and tragic that in todays world anybody can put anything on the web.   All complaints were written by the same people in this memorandum.They are Eric Leavell and Paul Rinko.

Brown, Jr.  Texas Bar No. 03141210 3102 Cherry Creek Drive    Missouri City, TX  77459 My name is Luro T. Barry Powell provided financial services to help  attorney Jimmie L.J. Brown Jr. acquire a home because Brown could not qualify for a loan.   Shortly thereafter Powell employed Brown as his in house attorney. Powell said he terminated the employment of Brown  due to unprofessional conduct and extremely poor legal work.  When Brown had his wife refinance the home a dispute arose concerning a $4500 prepayment penalty.  Brown claimed he should not have to pay and he demanded that Powell pay it.  Shortly thereafter Brown filed suit against Powell. Powell contacted me and asked me and asked me to defend him in the lawsuit.   After reviewing the facts in the case, I was confident that Brown had no case and no chance of winning. Powell paid me a retainer. As things developed, Brown became friendly with me and we made some money together on unrelated cases.  I learned that Brown had been angrily waging an uncanny personal vendetta against Powell and that Brown held a tremendous amount of resentment.  In my dealings with Brown I repeatedly witnessed him profit by engaging in unethical and unscrupulous business practices.   Regretfully, I participated with him to dmage Powell.  Brown set a hearing for a summary judgment against Powell.  In order to get a judgment Brown offered me $5,000 not to tell Powell about the hearing.  I regret to say that I did not tell Powell about the hearing and neither of us attended  the hearing.  As a result a summary judgment against Powell was won by Brown for triple damages and attorney fees for approximately $26,000. I signed a sworn affidavit attesting to this fact because I am a God fearing man and I want to be right with God and do the right thing.  This admission contributed to me having my license to practice law suspended. ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Barbara took a look at what we had presented and confirmed that they could handle our case, however, she said she could not begin the process until she had at least $1300 up front.  My husband and I were caught off guard as the representative we spoke with prior to meeting Barbara said we would not need to give any money right away.  All we would need to do is compile the necessary documents and allow Barbara some time to review and provide the guidance on the next steps.  Needless to say we gave her cash and the only receipt we have showing that we gave her cash does not have her signature as a recipient.  Barbara said she would send us a receipt and provide us on the next steps we should take.  That was in April 2012.  As instructed on the receipt and expressed verbally by Barbara we would need to send two additional payments of $1300 each made out to Claremont Funding.  One in May and the other in June.  We followed these instructions and eagerly awaited to hear from the lawyer.  We were told not to contact our mortgage company but to contact them should our mortgage company call us....so they could handle the calls.  We signed a letter authorizing Claremont Funding to speak on our behalf.  We never received any correspondence from Claremont.  No phone calls.  No mail.  Each time we contacted Barbara to follow up on our case she made excuses that she was either out of town, sick or ""will get back to us"".  If we got a hold of a representative we were told that we needed to submit additional paperwork not limited to paperwork that we had previously sent.  We have avoided making contact with our bank because we sincerely thought they were handling everything but boy did we get snowed!  We spoke to our bank today, March 7, 2013.  They never heard of Claremont!  There is nothing on file stating that we gave Claremont or anyone else for that matter the authority to speak on our behalf!  We are in foreclosure and the only way we might be able to avoid that is by being reviewed for a modification.  My husband became very furious at the thought that we have been scammed and called Barbara...who conveniently said that she is going to have surgery.  Barbara also told my husband that she was no longer with the company.  When he asked her where the office was located she said there was no office and that they all work out of their homes.  Well....when were we going to be notified about this?   When my husband asked for a refund, she said you only get refunds when you get rejected.  How can we be rejected if nothing was ever done on our case?  About 2 hours after his conversation with Barbara someone named Albert called him back to reiterate that we are not in foreclosure and everything is going along as planned.  Albert said he had just spoken to our mortgage company, blah, blah, blah.  When my husband asked Albert for his name the man hung up.  Mind you he called my husband from a restricted number.  I don't know what's more disturbing...the fact that our most personal and confidential information is lying around in someone's house or the fact that we are not the only people that have been scammed!  If there is ever a lawsuit to be filed against these people we would be more than willing to sign the petition.

Do not use this company, Fred will ""rip you off.""  Pompano Beach, Florida","										Asset Discovery was contacted to conduct a bank search. I informed ""Fred"" that I was in a rush (as everyone is) and he informed me that it would take 3-5 business days. I had already used another company to obtain the bank search information for my client but was just  looking for ""Fred"" to confirm what I already had (I did not inform Fred of this). I received information from him simply listing the name of a random bank, no further information. I knew that he was a fraud at that point because I already knew the (3) banks from my first bank search and the bank that he gave me was not one of them. Also, the client was aware of the 3 banks that came up in the bank search. The first company that I used informed me that they 100% guarantee that they did not miss any banks. I called Fred on this and he kept saying that it is still being worked on. He then said that if the name of the bank is the only information that is out there, ""It is what it is."" He also stated that many people are not satisfied with the results but he has plenty of business and did not need mine.At that time, I informed him that I already had the bank information from another company and was looking for him to just verify, which he did not. He said that he is still working on it and I would have it by the weekend, which would make it 19 days. He then stated that it takes up to 17 banking days. I laughed at him and told him that he is a fraud. He said that he did a better job than the first banbk search company because he came up with a bank that they did not. LOL ! That was a great line. What a con man and a fraud. I cannot believe that this guy is still in business. Hopefully the District Attorney charges this guy with fraud and puts him out of business. Don't make the same mistake that I did, check out the business. I was in a hurry and did not.    									",  Attorneys & Legal Services 
 Cordell and Cordell ,"  Cordell and Cordell  111 East Kilbourne Ave Suite 1650 Milwaukee, Wisconsin United States of America ", , 4149823787,"Cordell and Cordell  Cordell and Cordell will drain you of all your money and leave you the second it runs out Milwaukee, Wisconsin","										When I arrived at Cordell and Cordell I had already filed for divorce and also had my ex served. I was assured by my first lawyer Daniel Lambert that my case did not sound complicated given there was no property to divide and the only issue was support and placement. I was told my case would not exceed a few thousand dollars. From that point on I was raped by this lawyer on a regular basis. He assigned numerous legal aids to my case along with his fee and they ran through 3,000 in two weeks and we hadent even gone to court yet. At the point I hired Cordell my first court date had already happened. After a botched contempt of court charge my lawyer tried to bring to my ex I was almost 8,000 in the whole. After complaining to them about the ridiculous amount of money they were costing I threatened to leave and god I wish I did but they talked me into staying and gave me a new lawyer. I  made it clear to this lawyer Trisha Festerling I was running out of money and could not take the financial raping my first lawyer did to me. She reassured me she would not and gave me the impression she cared about my case. This was all a ploy as she went on to drain me of another 10,000 and the second I ran out of money she threatened me with a law suit and dropped me as a client. Not to mention the sub par job she did in my case where any other lawyer would have probably gotten me full placement and custody given the details involved. So this is Cordell and Cordell. If you do not have a lot of money they assign a sub par lawyer and a host of legal aids that will drain you of every penny you have and than dump you like you are a bum. My case is costing me over 20,000 and for what. We did not go to trial and all the filing and serving of my ex and our first temp hearing I did without them.  Please for your own sake stay clear of this firm.

Another year goes by and they ask for more info which i tell them i can't remember the info they want seeing as it was over 20 years ago but they insisted i either get the info or they wont do anything more on it. I again told them i had no recollection of what they were asking (specific court dates etc) and no way to get it and that was their job to call around not mine and that I was told you would do all the work involved.When I mentioned this to the girl at Canadian Pardon Services( signs only as Michelle)she said "" Do you want me to work on it at all?"" and then threatened to put my file at the bottom of the heap unless I lost my attitude and based on how long it's taken I believe she did.A year later still nothing. More time goes by and they contact me again to have me phone court houses etc to get more info for them - work they'd told me they would be doing. I inquire again and they tell me they are still waiting on me finding out this court info and begin to advise me how I might get it although there was no guarantee I would get it they said! So I called the courthouses until I found out what they wanted and sent it in. Then they didnt send it in in time and i had to redo apay again to have my criminal background check done again as apparently it expired before they sent it in. 2 years go by still nothing.

They informed us that Tax Crisis Institiute had done absolutly nothing but file saying they were our attorney and that was it! I of course fuming at this point called Angelique Ronald and very nicely let her know what was going on and told her we were going to go ahead and find a new attorney. I asked about getting a refund she said she would need to talk to her dad. I waited for about 4 days and heard nothing. So today I call and I actually get a hold of the man himself! Dana Ronald.

That's usually how they are because its less to pack up when the go to the next address to steal from you.  I'm sure someone with rebuttal this, but know it is the office employees themselves who do it and act like a client or just themselves.  I know for a fact because my neighbor worked for them as well.  I saved EVERY receipt I demanded from them.  I made numerous copies.  I have handed them into all the necessary departments shall I say.  I'm fighting hard and going in every direction I can and more to close the doors on this scammer and take away his license and much more.  I wont let them intimidaite me in anyway.  The stole from us what we worked hard for and we deserve every penny returned.  The took from the wrong family!!!

DARWIN F. JOHNSON BETRAYED MY TRUST. DARWIN WAS MORE CONCERNED WITH HELPING THE OPPOSING ATTORNEY (AT&T) GET THEIR NEEDS MET THEN REPRESENT HIS CLIENTS NEEDS. atlanta, Georgia","										I had the misfortune to be misrepresented by Mr. Darwin F. Johnson in 2008-2009. I was working for AT&T at that time. I routinely took F.M.L.A. and certain management made it known that they didn't care much for me doing it. When exercising my rights under article 8 (P.M.R.) of the labor contract for diagnosed repetitive motion injuries I was betrayed by A.T.& T and C.W.A. local 3204 and went outside the company to get representation for my job related injuries. After the 2004 5 yr. labor contract the union local 3204 leadership wasn't worth the union dues. The local 3204 leadership wasn't worth much even before that. Any way I contacted Louis B. Lusk who referred Darwin F. Johnson as my council. Don't get me wrong. D.F.J. did get me some compensation for my injuries, I got disability payments which I wasn't getting. Some coworkers had informed me that they had received $5k for each surgery they had for the same condition I have. I had got nothing, even after two surgeries on my dominant hand. My misrepresentation by D.F.J. consisted of not going to trial, not getting company paid medical benefits and severance pay covered under the contract as requested. Having to sign multiple resignations and documents to please the A.T.&T. attorney. Not listening to me when I said I was in pain and would likely need surgery in the near future. Darwin said go to work and keep your head down and collect the checks until the case settles, which would takes months. Two weeks later the case settled and the disability payments stopped. D.F.J. refused to furnish my with my case file and requested documents. Darwin simply ignored my request. Then I began seeing D.F.J. advertising on television as often as A.T.&T. If I wasn't under the influences of multiple medications including lyrica, fluoxetine, meloxicam I might of detected this misrepresentation sooner. A.T.&T has influenced doctors, lawyers, many managers and others and they will continue to until the government bodies take ethics seriously.

 John Temrowski begs judge for default decision ,"  John Temrowski begs judge for default decision  45109 Van Dyke Utica, Michigan United States of America ", , ,"John Temrowski begs judge for default decision  Temrowski begs judge for a default decision, waiting nearly three hours Utica, Michigan","										February 11th, 8:30 AM, here is attorney John Temrowski sitting in a courtroom getting ready to beg the judge, case 2012-004154-NZ, for a $150,000 against an individual that he claims to have made defamatory statements against him.   His reason for his claim is that his character and name was defamed because he was referred to as an idiot and someone dared to speak the truth about his activities and comments in a courtroom one day.   The real amusing thing about the whole thing is that I admitted to having made the comments, he even told the Attorney Grievance Commission that he believes I made the comments, yet he decided to sue a completely different individual.  I might also note, that his most clever move was to try and get granted a default decision because he knew the defendant wasn't even living in the state of Michigan and most likely wouldn't show. According to Temrowski, he has lost his entire business because of one person, although now it's suppose to be a husband and wife, posting his name on an internet site.  Wow, sure didn't take much to ruin such an illustrious career.If I didn't know this man, and sought to hire his services, I would be concerned about where he is spending his time as opposed to working on my case.  Apparently, Temrowski must have a lot of free time to waste these days.  I overheard him in the hallway discussing car pooling with his colleague/brother in the hallway.  I guess that's why he picked the date February 11, 2012.  His brother actually had a client so I guess he figured he would tag along.  I guess someone in the family still has a law practice.  Notice Mr. John Temrowski, I don't use your colleague's name.  At least not the for the time being.  The problem is, the more you try and use your fraudulent tactics, insults, and threatening a person and their entire family, it's possible that at one point, they could do the same to you.  And you do have a big family; brothers, sons, etc.  I hope things pick up for you, John.  I know that you still have a mortgage that you need to pay off and you're not getting any younger.  Unless, you have some plan to pay it off with beads.I might also add, that it appears a judge has finally at least read into this type of suit.  I'm surprised that all of the people you spoke to about 'burying' your name in Google searches, not one of them informed you about the Communications Decency Act.  At least, I think this judge seems to have read into it a little.  Clearly, you don't know much about 'computers and the internet' as you have told judges.   If a case like yours were to prevail, I would hate to see the flood in the courts.  I can't wait to see a girl sue her boyfriend for calling her a slut on Facebook.   Just wait until that day comes.Either way, we can keep this battle going.  You keep your end going by your bias story-telling, or what I call lying,  in the courts and continuing to give them your money for motions and other filings.  I'll continue my end on this site and a new one that I am looking into.  I find this to be much more cost-efficient and convenient.I was curious though, for the case that your partner had on 2-11-13, did you get a retainer from the plaintiff or are you taking something like a third of the settlement?  Never mind, I know the answer.  Of course, you got a retainer because we both know that the guy will never collect on the suit. What a coincidence that it was another DEFAULT case.   It might take a while but we both know that he'll actually end up losing on that deal when it's all said and done.  Did you teach him to grunt and wince in pain as he sat down?  That was a cute touch but you should have told him that it wasn't necessary.  Hell, he already won.  I kind of sensed even the judge wasn't buying it but she had a job to do and since the defendant didn't even bother to show.  It was even more amusing that the client couldn't even remember his lines and had to have your partner basically read them for him while he just said, 'yes', 'yes', 'yes'.  But I guess that's what your firm gets paid for.You should have at least included my wife's case with your DEAL that you proposed about me going  online and publishing things that state what a great guy and attorney you are.  Everyone I know and I mean everyone, told me that a deal with you wouldn't even be worth the paper it was written on.  Besides, what would I have to gain either way?  I hope to see you in court with a client of your own soon, John.",  Attorneys & Legal Services

 Keith Mandelski ,"  Keith Mandelski    Gunnison, Colorado United States of America ", , ,"Keith Mandelski Hinsdale County District Attorney Severely Damaged My Life with Unsupported and Untrue Charges that He Later Dismissed Gunnison, Colorado","										I attempted to help the former owner of 30-Mile Resort, Charlotte Trego, recoup something from her years of operation, but ultimately was unsuccessful.  I was repaid with a criminal action.  I was charged by the Hinsdale County District Attorney, Keith Mandelski, with the very serious charges of Felony Theft and Felony Filing of a False Document.  This resulted in my arrest.  Within days of his arrest those charges were reduced, within months all of the Theft charges were voluntarily dismissed and a Misdemeanor Count was added.  This led to a plea to the misdemeanor.  At sentencing, Mr. Mandelski argued for the maximum sentence250 hours of Useful Public Service and 30 months of probation.  To support his argument he spoke only to the unproven allegations in the Theft count that he had abandoned.  Unable to prove his case he was attempting to get his sentence through the misdemeanor. This led to me having to state the true facts of the Theft case in his defense.  In 2006 Mr. Mandelski was fired from his position as District Attorney for defying office policy and allowing an Archuleta County Commissioner plea bargain for lesser charges in violation of office policy. ""This was the most important case on his (Mandelski's) plate. He negotiated a plea agreement against my wishes. It was a transgression of such magnitude that I had no alternative but to terminate his employment,"" District Attorney Craig Westberg said. ""I don't do this lightly.""The following is the text of a statement made I made in the sentencing phase of the Hinsdale County District Attorneys action against him.  The plea that he entered did not admit guilt nor admit the materiality of the alleged false document charge.  The plea was entered to end the case and avoid a possible trial where a felony would be one jury option.  He clearly did not believe that there was any real chance of a conviction but the draconian possibility of a felony left him no choice.  Members of the community who have wondered about the resort and those concerned about the actions of your District Attorneys Office will find this interesting.I am a 61-year old living in Aurora, Colorado who has never been in trouble in his lifejust the opposite, I am a homeowner, have lived in Colorado for 30 years, am a respected member of the community, have owned small businesses and have been a management consultant for the last 15 years putting to use my 20 years of education.  I formed a non-profit organization that provides management consulting through Metro State University where I currently volunteer.  I am a father of five with four grandchildren and one more on the way.  My most serious transgressions are traffic tickets.  A year ago last fall, I spent three months working with an 80 year-old woman, Charlotte Trego.  Her family had operated 30-Mile Resort for some 65 years.  Four years previous she had allowed it to fall into disrepair and then by refusing to make the needed repairs and by so alienating the forest service, they had revoked her operating permit and closed it.  They were however allowing her to find a buyer for whatever she owned.  For the first month that I worked with her, her story was that she needed a buyer by October 1st or she would lose her right to sell.  This was verified through my discussions with the forest service, so I spent September going through the permit process, creating a management plan, and making estimates of projected revenue and expenses.  I viewed the venture as extremely speculative as there was no way to know what would have to be done to even reopen the resort.  After working for a month to prepare this offer, she announced that she had another buyer who was going to pay her significantly more and pay it in cash.  I spent the next month encouraging her to take that deal as it was well beyond what I believed her interest was worth, however she continued to call me and express her concern that that deal was going to fall apart.  I assured her that if it did, my offer would still be there for her but that it was clearly in her financial interests to do all that she could do to make it happen.Then things started to change. The buyers had been given an extension of their time to close from October 1st to November 1st but still had not closed.  She told me that the deadline had again been extended to December 1st.  The forest service again verified this to me but also made it clear that this was the final extension and if there was no sale by December 1st they were taking back the property.  She was now telling me repeatedly that she did not want to sell to this other buyer. Finally she produced what she had told me was the other buyers offerturns out it was not an offer at all but a Bill of Sale.  Charlotte had actually already sold her interest to these people with no contingencies. Quite frankly I could not understand why the buyers were not enforcing their agreement and the sale had not been completed but other discrepancies in her story were also arisingshe had lied about the condition of the property and we discovered a $30,000 lien on the property due un-paid contractors. What was becoming clear is that Ms Trego had such emotional ties to the property that she simply could not bear selling to anyone and that she was the one stopping the sale from taking place.  I attempted to find out if the deal was real and if the buyers were going to perform for if the property didnt close this time, Charlotte would lose everything.  I had watched my parents lose my mothers family farm which had been in that family for over 100 years and I was seeing the same fate in Charlotte.Fearing that Charlotte was not working in her best interests I prepared a Purchase Agreement under which she would sell the property to us but retain an option to sell to a third party for the next year.  My reasoning was that if this were completed by December 1st, we could move forward with our deal which paid her a percentage of the revenue for her lifetime, and if a cash buyer could be foundor if the previous buyer still wanted itCharlotte could take the next year to finish her sale.  I also strongly urged her to hire an attorney.She did hire an attorney.  Mr. Patrick Tooley of Denver law firm Dill and Dill, the son of the long time District Attorney in Arapahoe County, was familiar with the resort from his familys past visits.  He had previously provided Ms. Trego with the form for the poorly drafted Bill of Sale and should have been familiar with the issues. He came to her home and like me, tried to get her to complete the previous buyers deal.  He also rightly looked at my offer as significantly worse than the first buyers offer.  It had never been represented as anything other than a fall back should her sale fall through.  However, without ever contacting me, he instead set out on a personal vendetta to discredit me.  He simply had no idea of what I was trying todo and no interest in finding out.  Finally on November 28th, despite having consulted with Tooley, Charlotte called me and left a voice mail telling me that she was going to sign a Quit Claim Deed to me.  Even after we met again and discussed it and again attempting to get her to complete her sale, she was adamant in her irrational reasoning that she would not sell to the other buyer.  She closed her bank account to protect her from the buyer just transferring the money to her to complete the sale and I did not speak to her again for 3-4 days.  Given her changing stories, I seriously doubted that she would accept my offer.  December 1st was a major Denver snowstorm and I assumed that she had done nothing.  I was wrong. She went out in that snowstorm with a Quit Claim Deed, signed and had it notarized.  I was unaware of this and unable to reach her for another couple days as she didnt answer her phone.  When we met she gave me a file with the Deed dated December 1st but without the Purchase Agreement.  Knowing that the forest service needed the December 1st date met, I immediately sent to the Hinsdale County Clerk the Deed that she had signed and notarized together with my latest copy of the Purchase Agreement.  As the Quit Claim Deed referenced the Purchase Agreement, I wanted there to be no misunderstanding regarding the Purchase Agreement terms.  If, as the DA now alleges, I had been trying to mislead or hide anything, no additional document would have been filed.  There had been numerous forms of that Purchase Agreement and the copy that I had did not have signature lines.  Charlotte had the only copy that did contain signature lines but the terms and wording were otherwise identical.  I also immediately contacted the forest service and the previous buyers and let both the forest service and the other buyers know that if the other buyers were still interested I would act only as a straw man and allow them to take possession.  They declined.To say that Mr. Tooley went berserk is probably an understatement.  In a flurry of emails and text messages followed causing me to twice have to tell him to stop, he rose to the level of threatening criminal actionproceed at your own risk was how he was signing his correspondence.  I believed this to be a direct threat of criminal prosecution and notified the Grievance Committee.  He then convinced the forest service that since my Deed included Charlottes option to sell it was therefore void.  They agreed with him, treated the Deed as void, and of course took back the property.  His actions resulted in Charlotte being cut out completely.A few days later Charlotte contacted the City of Lakewood police and needing someone to blame for her actions, filed a complaint against me!  I can only surmise that it was encouraged by the attorney who, only days prior, had threatened criminal action against me.  She blatantly lied to the officer but after their investigation no charges were filed.  However Mr. Tooley was not satisfied.  He set up a meeting with people he knew at the Jefferson County District Attorneys OfficeMs Trego failed to appear at this meeting but Mr. Tooley let them know that he would do all he could to assist. Jefferson County also refused to file any charges.  Then an improved version of the story went to the Hinsdale County District Attorney.  The Hinsdale County District Attorneys office then declared me the most dangerous criminal in the state that day and issued warrant for a Felony 2 threatening to put me in jail for the rest of my life.If this were actionable at all, it is a civil caseand probably mine against Charlotte.  At best an overly zealous DA might find a potential misdemeanor charge.  Instead of charging correctly and sending a summons for me to appear before their court, the District Attorney filed charges which were so serious and vial as to require an immediate arrest and a $60,000 cash bond.  Despite the fact that the allegations could never have survived a preliminary hearing, a warrant was issued for a Felony 2 causing my arrest. Within days the charges were significantly reduced and a few months later the core of the case was dismissed outright but by now damage had been done.  Had the District Attorney filed the charges that he reduced them to three days later, it would have resulted in a summons be served upon me to appear rather than the despicable event of the arrest.The mere filing of the arrest warrant has severely impacted my life.  I was pulling out of my driveway on Good Friday afternoon with my wife when the Aurora Police pulled in behind me.  They dragged me out of my car in front of my daughter, my grandchildren and my neighbors, searched me for guns, handcuffed me, and hauled me off in the back of their car.  I then spent 36 hours on the floor of holding cells.  I was on the floor in a holding cell of the Aurora City Jail for 17 hours until I was driven in chains 250 miles to Gunnison.  Finally, 24 hours later I was able to call my wife and let her know where I was.  They had no ideathe family just sat around in silence and panic.  Thereafter I spent another 12 hours in the dark, on the floor of their holding cell treated like a dog.  I spent a total of six days in jailincluding Easter because of the $60,000 cash bond the charges carried.  Finally, after two 500-mile trips to Gunnison made by my wife I was released with a $2500 bond on a significantly lesser charge.  Upon release my punishment continued. The arrest warrant appears on the internet.  Having this on the internet stopped a local investment firm from hiring me to a $12,000 per month job.  My existing clients cancelled their consulting engagements leaving us with basically no income for the past year.  I have not to sleep a full night for the past 317 nights.  Now at 61 I have to rebuild my career and spend countless hours defending information readily available to all on the internet.  Ironically, all this was generated from Hinsdale Countydespite the fact that I have not even been in Hinsdale County for the past 20 years! I stand before the court now on my second sentencing on this misdemeanor.  The first sentence was imposed arbitrarily by the District Attorney. Their sentence consisted of six days in jail, public humiliation, 317 sleepless nights, denied job opportunities, a year of probation and public internet scorning for the rest of my life.  Please these factors into account when you complete this second sentence.  I have consented to the entry of this plea to avoid an extremely unlikely but conceivably possible conviction of a felonythat risk is simply too great. In your sentencing I urge the court to consider the punishment that I have already received and which will continue on forever.  I do not need rehabilitation.  I do not need further punitive actionthe punishment that I have already received far exceeds the misdemeanor to which I plead.  Effectively I have already been on probation for the past year.  I would also request that the Court immediately seal the arrest record in regard to the dismissed felony charges.  I do wish to thank the Public Defenders office, particularly Mr. Stephen Dooley, for their representation.  And for the record, I forgive Charlotte Trego.The District Attorney was quite agitated with this statement and immediately represented to the court that he had never spoken to Mr. Tooley.  This is interesting.  Other than the sheriff and members of the forest service, Mr. Mandelski listed only two witnesses for the trial scheduled next weekCharlotte Trego and Patrick Tooley.  Since he listed Mr. Tooley as a witness in his case, was he not forthcoming with the court or doesnt he even talk to the witnesses that he lists in his cases?  Additionally he claimed that the file had arrived from Jefferson County without even a cover letter and that they had independently decided to file the charges.  The file consisted of approximately 70 pages of text summarizing the investigations of Lakewood and Jefferson County.  The only source of information in those 70 pages who had first-hand (non-hearsay) information regarding the case was Charlotte Trego.  A phone call to the Hinsdale County Sheriff would have revealed that he was on tape agreeing to the statement, Charlotte Trego lives in an alternative reality.  The vast majority of the file was based upon information provided by Patrick Tooley, who never had met the defendant, had threatened the defendant, did not even get involved in the relationship until after all of the events had been completed and who is the lawyer for Ms Trego.  Following meeting with Mr. Tooley, Ms Trego had signed the Quit Claim Deed independently and, it was Mr. Tooley who caused the forest service to void the transaction causing the forfeiture of the property.  So, without any independent verification of the allegations in the file, Mr. Mandelski simply had him arrested.Judge Patrick heard the arguments and ignored Mr. Mandelskis recommendations. He used the standard guidelines for the nominal misdemeanor charge: unsupervised probation and 98 hours of Useful Public Service, and declined to levy a fine.  ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Douglas Wilder represented me in a DWI case in 2008. I was naive about how the court system worked and just assumed I was handling the situation right by paying an attorney $5000, especially one who claimed to be the best, and that he felt he could handle the case. I tried many times prior to the trial to discuss the case with him, but he continued to put me off, and never took notes regarding my scenario. I was only able to speak with his receptionist, who always seemed put out when I would have a question or want to just discuss an issue which I felt may be important to the case. He never got my messages, never returned the calls, and came to court totally unprepared!In turn, on the day of court, I was supposed to be seen at 8 am. He asked I be there promptly so we could discuss the case. In effect, he did not show up until after 10 am. [continued below]....																			..... He said this was because he had another trail to attend to. I paid Mr. Wilder $5000 to handle my case; the least I could expect is that he would be at my trial on time. After 10 am, he came out of the court room having made a totally unsatisfactory settlement with the judge without my presence. Why, because he did not even know all the facts. When he came out the first time and told me the decision he had made with the judge, I asked him if he even mention some important facts regarding the case. He forgot! He then went back in by himself, only to come back out with a verdict that still was not satisfactory. Finally, I asked if I could go in and talk with the judge as well. When I went in, I explained to the judge that, I was not even driving, my vehicle was parked, it was turned off, the flashers were on, the keys were in my pocket, and the officer pulled on to the street before I had even gotten back in my vehicle. When he did approach my vehicle I still had the vehicle turned off, and was just eating a taco to get something in my stomach.  In turn, when I had a chance to speak with the judge, and explain my version of everything, he decided to drop most all charges.However, being the expert that Doug Wilder claimed to be, you would think he would have requested I get a PI rather than a DWI at that time since it was understood that I was not operating a vehicle, or even had the vehicle turned on. He did not think to do it. In fact, he didnt even attempt to do anything to assist in my favor. He just accepted the first sentence the judge first proclaimed, because he had better things to do, and he was not aware of the existing facts; WHY? Becausehe never even reviewed my case in the first place. This was just another slice of pie ($5,000) for him to rob another person that was naive of how to handle being charged with an offense in court. I definitely should have shopped aroundbefore hiring him. He just painted a picture of himself as being the best in the field, and that he has handled much more difficult charges then mine.Furthermore, he tells me he is in a hurry to present on another case, and told me to just sign two documents and was out of there.  I was just initially excited about getting most of the fine, and charges dropped; I assumed it was safe to sign what hehad presented to me. It was not explained to me what I was signing because he said he had to hurry for a court appointment in Denton.. What he had me sign was a plea that I was guilty of a DWI (which is contrary to what I had hired him for), and that I cannot appeal the case ever. Why would I pay him $5000 to have me sign a document stating that I was guilty of DWI? What was the $5,000 for.I thought he would have at least had some kind of defense arranged. That is what I hired him for in the first place was to convey what exactly happened, and attempt have the DWI charge removed, or to at least have arranged to be havethe charges lessened to a PI. The reason being for all this devastation to my rights was because Doug Wilder never even prepared for the case in advance. He showed up, and did not even have any the facts until I started to explain them again on the day of court. I basically went in, did his job, and got a majority of the initial restitutions taken off, but was still charged. JUST FOREWARNING:If you want an attorney who rides on his ego rather than properly serving his clients, this is your man. If you go to his office and he claims to be Texas Best DWI Attorney, he is only claiming that because he paid Texas Monthly to publish that. If you want an attorney who will listen to you, and work for you, especially after you pay them $5000, do yourself a favor, be smart and go elsewhere besides Doug Wilder!

It looks like we were not his first victims.

I think buffoons was one of the words used in one of the reports. I'll use it again here, because it's accurate. They're buffoons. They're only interested in themselves, not their clients. They inflate their billable hours, I guess because they're tired ofbeing associated with a sandwich shop (their office is directly above one) and they're trying to raise enough money to move out. Maybe they're trying to avoid using their furniture as collateral again.  Perhaps they'd be better off joining forces with the shop below them and selling sandwiches instead of shoveling out subpoenas. Here's how you take care of your reputation and avoid Ripoff Report: you over-deliver on expectations.

He assured us that is what would be required to have our issue resolved. He also said that we have the most defendable case he ever had and he falsely represented that he has extensive experience in dealing with our specific problem. In actuality he had zero experience in dealing with that specific problem.We hired Harry  Nelson for $5,000.00 to represent us at the preliminary meeting with the state representatives. He assured us that is what it would cost to accomplish our goal and we would have further discussion if any additional work and fees would be required.At the meeting with the state, Harry Nelson was not prepared, completely  misrepresented us by not having the right facts or names, and acted unprofessionally by arguing with the state doctor presenting the wrong facts. Our issues were not resolved at this meeting. This misrepresentation caused us to close down resulting in disastrous financial consequences in over a million dollars.After that we fired Harry Nelson and hired a consultant who informed us that all the things that Harry Nelson had done were incorrect and that the meeting was not even necessary and the discussion with the state could taken place over the phone. With the advice of the consultant all the original problems as well as the additional problems that Harry Nelson caused which were much more extensive that the original problem were resolved.The consultant informed us that the additional problems that Harry Nelson caused when he began arguing with the State representative would only lead to a stale mate. The consultant also had informed us that if Harry Nelson had the experience he claimed he had, Harry Nelson would have known that he shouldve tried to reach a settlement agreement as opposed to arguing the issue with the state which just wasted time and money.As a direct result of Harry Nelsons misrepresentations and the subsequent financial hardship that we endured, we were not in a position to defend ourselves from Harry Nelsons law suit against us for an additional fee resulting from nowhere.It is our strong belief that it is unethical for an attorney to be allowed to misrepresent their expertise and cause such extensive damage to their client. It is also unethical for an attorney to charge fees for a service which was never rendered.His lack of expertise is still costing to this very day and some sort of compensation is in order, the lease of which is a judgment of $10,622.51 not only that but punitive measures for Harry Nelsons actions.",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Heaven forbid, I get sued.  I don't know the woman personally.  I do know, however, she must have her hands full with John Temrowski as her husband.Today was my big 'Case Evaluation' day.  I had to meet with three Case Evaluators or attorneys.  No problem there.  Three gentlemen that had a job to do.  I won't hold any ill will against them.   Somehow, Temrowski pulled some strings and I was told that I was held responsible for having made the comments about his wife and that the Evaluators had to made their decision based on that fact.  How he pulled that one off is beyond me? Heck, I know a dozen people that think he's a crook so how they pinned the comments on me is a little hard to swallow but I'll take it.   All I know is that Macomb County is a big scam.  Civil cases are particularly a big scam.  Notices don't have to be confirmed.  Attorneys are just assumed to be honest when I believe not all are, especially Temrowski.(MY OPINION)If it works to his advantage, then it seems like notices just somehow seem to disappear in the mail.Anyways, rather than speaking to the Evaluators about the case in hand, Temrowski goes on and on about my history with him, claiming that I just came out of the blue in 2010 and attacked him, not true, why I can't get a job(not true), and how all of his depositions show that I lied.  I didn't but he chooses to interpret his own questions and answers the way he chooses.  The things he claims I lied about were so stupid and minute, I wasn't quite sure where he was going anyways.  Again, not a big deal, but I wish he would let me explain my LIES but he just goes off on a tangent.  I have never lied in court.  Then he goes on about his mother dying, and my ex-wife, blah, blah, blah.  Finally, one evaluator cuts him off and tells him to get to the point. Temrowski has a hard time with this. None of this has anything to do with the case either way.  Apparently, John got into a lot of trouble with his wife.  She was 'livid' as he told the story.  His wife has some kind of BEAD business, lol, a bead business which I thought kind of went hand and hand, with the ripoffreport that was filed on her, but, of course, he claims this to not be the case.  Sounded to me like she got in over her head.  Then this guy pulls out pictures of all his wife's bead art.  Yes, he is showing a panel of attorneys pictures of his wife's beads. Again, not sure where this guys head is but I guess he's into beads.Now how can I compete with that? I just had to laugh my ass off inside;  Angelica Morales Temrowski and her million dollar BEAD business.  Temrowski must not be doing too well, in my opinion if his wife has to sell beads.  So here these evaluators have to come up with an amount of which to settle upon.  Of course, I'm not settling for any amount.  All I'm thinking is what he and his wife can do with their beads, lol.   So I am asked to leave the room.  Temrowski is in the room crying and moaning about how broke he is and how he has to keep his brothers law business afloat.  Then I am asked to come in.  How much do I think his BEAD case is worth, I am asked, promptly I tell them NOTHING?  So I get a judgement against me for $6,000. Keep in mind that Temrowski probably chats with these guys at least once every week so I wasn't expecting much.  I think you're beginning to see how the courts work.  Of course, big surprise. That must be the cost of beads, lol, that Temrowski needs to buy for his wife.  Needless to say, I will decline the judgement.  Personally, it sounds to me like Mr. Temrowski threw his own wife under the bus just to get something out of me because I know that I never said anything about his wife.  I could care less about this woman and her beads.  I just want Mr. Temrowski to see that I am not going away.  I have done research and see that there are other sites that can make consumers aware of lawyers and unethical business practices.I am sure more will come from Temrowski.  My next date is the Big Trial, January 29th.  Yes, it's all a big joke but I go for the humor.  I've got the proof to at least give the judge more than enough proof but courts seldomly have the time to even really care.  Civil suits are all about who knows who and who can get away with what.  Little do they know, I'm laughing inside.  I find the most humor to just sit and listen.  I shall report back soon.  I have been laughing half the day about John Temrowski and his wife's beads so I need to regain some composure.It's pathetic to see where your taxpayers' dollars are going in Macomb County.

Temrowski is at it again.  He has filed another suit, Macomb County 2012-004154-NZ. By this time next week, only God knows how many people will have pending lawsuits against them.  It is in my OPINION that he did not like the results that he was getting from his other suits.  Plus, he undoubtedly wasn't happy with Judge Switalski's decision that he could not deposition my wife to actually be a witness against me, based on a motion that was filed.  So he has done what appears to be the next best thing, sue her.  What better way to compel someone to give a deposition under the circumstances?He believes, now yet another defendant has defamed his name and character.  Oddly enough though, in his recent response that to the Attorney Grievance Commission, he admits the fact that he believes one person and one person ONLY to have been the author of any and all defamatory statements made against him yet he chooses to sue multiple defendants.  Okay, then why attempt to sue someone when you have admitted YOURSELF that you do not believe them to be the author?I can give you my opinion on that one.  That's just JOHN TEMROWSKI!!!!!!!!!!  This man, I suspect, has contacted so many people, and made so many promises that it has prompted at least a few of his so called 'witnesses' to tell him to buzz off.  One witness even told me that he felt his feelings were hurt by how they felt about him.  Yes, Mr. Temrowski, your feelings will get hurt when you drag people into little rooms and force them to state facts for you to be vindictive and vengeful towards them and people they care about.  Do you expect them to thank you???   It took a while but people are beginning to believe what I have said about this man.As everyone can see, I am still giving my daily journal on the daily tasks of Mr. John Temrowski so it appears that my FREEDOM OF FREE SPEECH has not been revoked quite yet.  If anyone has considered hiring this man, you should do your research on how many HOURS and POUNDS of papers this attorney has invested in just three cases that only seek to benefit himself and no one else.  If you've ever dealt with an attorney before, you know that most are hard enough to get a hold of.  I can only imagine how much time this man would have for a new client.I wish I could post the statement that this man has claimed to be defamatory in case 12-4154-NZ.  I'm not quite sure what part of it is any way not true.  I read the complaint and every precise item is true as I was there.  I question whether this man even KNOWS what DEFAMATION OF CHARACTER is; particularly by his last complaint.  In my opinion, this one is a real laugh-er. I'll be back MONDAY!!!!!  									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

What does that mean?  It means that Ripoff Report expects that members of our CAP program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. [continued below]....																			.....  It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect.

Orlando, Florida","										1339 West Colonial DrOrlando, Florida-32804407-915-4836           ""LAFE PURCELLE""           ACCIDENT/SLIP AND FALL ATTORNEY            ATTORNEY RIPS OFF AND ABANDONDS THOUSANDS OF CLIENTS: CHECK THIS OUT!!!!!     Lafe Purcelle is a slip & fall/accident attorney who took in thousands of clients then closed his doors, fell off the face of earth, left all these clients including me without money for or getting treatments or therapy. Check out my story:     Day before Thanksgiving, 2008 I recieved a letter from SSI in my interpretation said: ""Mary Stamper"":  You are losing your mind, daughter, home, belongings, truck and money.  All this came from Pamela Boone & Mischelle Marie Shaffer when I signed permission on a piece of paper from the HRS giving Mischelle permission to stay at Pamela Boone's house.  Mischelle thought she would gain the money which was her dad's death benefits.  When a child turns 16 the benefits go down to $750.00 per month and is comes in the child's name.  Mine were going to be coming in my name with Mischelle's listed secondary.  This was not Pamela Boone's nor Mischelle's plans.  Mischelle thought she would get someone either Pamela Boone or Dona Rizzano to take over guardianship so that she would gain the check and get to do whatever she wanted which at the time was go to Ohio to join her lesbian lover, Brandy.  Mischelle was violated and caught with Jesse James Thorne so many times after his release from prison for armed bank robbery in Lake County.  She lost the money, Pamela Boone kicked her out, supposedly Mischelle is somewhere in Ocoee and so she says she is pregnant due soon.  Pamela Boone and Mischelle took my signature from that one piece of paper giving her permission to stay across the street because she was getting violent towards me.  You can refer to all these stories also within this site about Pamela Boone and Mischelle Marie Shaffer.  Both of these women, because my daughter to me became a woman when she had sex at 9 years old while I was working night shift training manegers and cooks at Dennys.  Then when she took the money, my husband's, her dad's death benefits across the street to help another family, a crack head, meth head family, with their meals, bills etc...These women took my signature to doctors, dentists, schools, clinics etc...to gain guardianship so that they can and did go to the SSI office and get the death benefits to go across the street in Pamela Boone and Mischelle Marie Shaffer's names.  When I got the letter it immediately started sinking in that my own daughter, Mischelle Marie Shaffer and Pamela Boone are taking the death benefits across the street, they or she is not going to help her own mother with the bills till I either get my disability or get rehired at Dennys.  I was three months ahead in the rent but Pamela Boone, Mischelle Marie Shaffer and the owner of the park were working together on getting rid of me, getting me evicted.  Jim Free used to try to rape me in my home and was even caught a few times my my bff at the time, Phyllis Quoma who worked for the SSI office for many years came in and caught him trying to rape me.  I told Jim Free to go to Crissy, Pamela Boone's daughter.  She will give oral sex for a few dollars.  Jim was the manager of the park at the time and Michael Wiedemeyer's whiskey and beer drinking buddies.  All of them worked together to take my house, scam, trick me however possible to get rid of me and Mischelle had them all believing I was abusing her but a good friend and angel I have in the HRS office will testify to all the investigations and false accusations these two came up with which all closed successfully, thank GOD!  I loaded all my belongings in my old 95 Dodge and a wagon.  Took everything to the woods which down the road made good bon fires out in the woods.  While I was loading all my belongings out of a home that Mischelle grew up in, which I built from the joist up.  I laid floors, subfloors, insulation, walls, ceilings, then carpet, tiles, lenoleum, a gorgeous master bath I was building and the first bath was allready done.  The entire house was done.  One really huge room as you walk in, a huge living room, seperate dining area, gorgeous counters I built, beautiful kitchen with all new appliances, trim work looked pro.  Three bedrooms which I spent over $600.00 for each room for the carpet.  Didn't know I was going to have to give up another house I built.  Mischelle, Pam and all their friends were out in the street laughing, dancing and chanting:  We took your daughter, we took your money and now we are taking your house and making you homeless.  I wanted to end them if you know what I mean.  I was through fighting the park, Jim Free, Michael Wiedemeyer, Pamela Boone and Mischelle Marie Shaffer over the death benefits and house I built.  I walked out the gate to where they were all partying together and laughing at me and handed the title/deed signed over to Mischelle Marie Shaffer to Mischelle and said now the fight is over.  I went to the woods and had a mental and physical breakdown.  Someone finally called an abulance and caught my boyfriend Michael Eugene Nash kicking me in the face because I was getting sick over everything that had happened and throwing up.  I was accused of purposely ruining his life and his families Hollidays.  I didn't know what really happened because for three days I could see a huge black man always staring at me.  I assumed he was my one on one.  He was assigned to watch over me while I was staring at him for three days and couldn't move or talk nor tell anyone what happened.  The lot rent was not due for another month, I was three months ahead, yet Mischelle and Pam handed the title/deed over to Michael Wiedemeyer and he wanted $3,000.00 straight up for my house.  I even made the skirting all around it from scratch siding.  Didn't get to even take a second look at all my work.  All the memories of her growing up there, birthdays, Easters, Christmas', Halloweens, Thanksgivings etc...gone.  Wiped out in one day!           November 27, 2008.  Starting to comprehend what all had happened and realizing I had a physical, mental and medical breakdown.  I was not the same person anymore.  If I hated life and people before I now hated them even more.  Finally coherant I wanted to get a shower but there was a lot of water on the bedroom floor and bathroom floor.  The water was so much it overflowed into the bedroom.  I kept asking the male nurse to please get someone to clean it up.  It was nasty, had been there for days, had tons of black curley hairs in it and was stagnated.  After asking four times I decided to take my only wash cloth and clean it up.  They only give you one bath towel so I had to make the wash cloth work.  I knew it would take hours like this but eventually I would get to take a shower.  I stepped into the water that was overflowing into the bedroom and this changed my life for the worse forever.  I laid in that nasty water for about 45 minutes or so yelling for someone to come help.  No one showed up.  Eventually I was able to get to my feet and limp, pull myself or hobble to the front desk the best I could covered in nasty water.  I told them what happened and they didn't seem to care.  I kept telling the mail nurse over and over what happened but he continued ignoring me.  The next day was a Monday when the doctor came to see me.  I told him what happened.  He was furious.  He wrote up his entire staff and the male nurse then told them to get me to a hospital as fast as possible.  Still no shower I went in an ambulance to the hospital.  I had not been prescribed any medications up to that point so no one could say I was medicated.  I was admitted into the Eatonville Lakeside Alternatives for mental/physical and medical depression/a breakdown.  The hospital did tons of test and MRIs.  They found 4 herniated disk in my lower back, 4 herniated disk in my neck, bone degenerate & joint degenerate which all of this radiates to my legs and feet.  The docs said I would be bed ridden for the rest of my life, no walking, no ladders, no bending/stooping-life as I knew it was gone.  I was going back to Lakeside after all the test etc...They still needed to do the paperwork and prescribe meds and refer me to an attorney and get me into therapy.  An accident/slip and fall attorney came to Lakeside and met with me in a private room and told me he was taking on my slip and fall case if I wanted him to.  I signed everything and gave him permission to proceed because he said he could get me into see a doctor and therapy and order all the MRIs they need etc...I was put into therapy and under a docs care for 18 months then was released because not only was 18 months all he prescribed for me but there was still no improvement only getting worse and therapy was making everything worse.  Today is December 25, 2012.  The 4 year anniversary of the slip and fall has passed.  I am now prectically bed ridden.  Aside from bathroom and grocery trips I'm bed ridden/a shut in.  No knows and no one cares.  I've been to quite a few pain specialist and pain manegements but because of the Medicare co-pay I never get to stay with them.  The last one wanted to do three epidurals in my lower back and three in my neck.  Thank God I backed out because of the co-pay.  I wasn't looing forward to that and am happy it didn't happen.  I called Lafe Purcelle's office every week for the past four years and now their office has closed/fell off the face of the earth/missing in action or D:  got thousands of settlements and hauled butt.  Does anyone out there know anything about this attorney and his where abouts or is there any attorneys on this earth that can pick this case up and help me?  I still have all the MRIs and my doctor has all the records of all the specialist, MRIs, test etc...I thought this settlement was going to help me get into treatment, therapy or any surgeries or epidurals or whatever else I need to help me get out of this bed.  What happens to the thousands of clients?  I'm just a small pea in that huge pod.  After all this happened to me a 12000 pound shed fell on me I was trying to move it into the woods to have something to ive in then I was on TV for having the worse case of mirsa in history because my boyfriend at the time Michael Eugene Nash would not let me call an ambulance because he was sick of me ruining his hollidays and life by getting hurt and sick.  There was tons of tragedies that happened to me during all this time and life might have been different for me if everyone eg: all my friend/enemies had not stolen my SSI settlement or I would have gotten this slip and fall money so I could go into treatment and therapy long term.                                                  Signed:  Mary Stamper                                                   SMALL PEA IN HUGE POD     									",  Attorneys & Legal

 Clear Creek ,"  Clear Creek    Charlotte, North Carolina United States of America ",Taxhelp.com, ,"Clear Creek  Liars, Frauds, Aggressive, Misrepresentative Charlotte, North Carolina","										Clear Creek is a high pressure company that tries very hard to make one call closes by pressuring persons with tax problems into paying a very high fee to do little to remedy the tax problem. They try one call closing because they must build urgency into their ""pitch"". Additionally they tell three blatant lies: 1. ""Forceable Collection"" is a made up term they use to infer that the IRS is ready to seize accounts or property. Clear Creek has no information as to the status of a tax lien, and yes their info is often very old. 2. ""We are a part of a government program to reduce your tax"", they are not part of any government program. There may be programs they can help you appeal IRS collections,  but to imply they are PART of the government is, I believe, illegal. 3. They tell clients ""our lawyers are certified"" which is specifically forbidden by IRS statute, but commonly used to make their victim, I mean, client feel more comfortable.The only way to be successful at a boiler room like Clear Creek is to leave your ethics at the door daily and then go home and wash the scummy feeling off with whatever poison you can find. I've seen employees yell, harass, intimidate, and badger ""clients"". If you are being called by them, they won't stop even if you tell them you have paid it off or you've gotten another company to negotiate with the IRS... Why won't they stop? Because they are told you are a liar and a tax cheat and the solicitor is required to continue calling you to break you down.Good luck, they are relentless.									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Failed to show up to a hearing, never submitted court requested documents, billed a forged statement of actions preformed. Lied,knowingly when answering Bar Association complaint filed against him.Sto Grove, Oklahoma","										To all whom I can protect!,I am writing and have evidence that  Brandon Watkins, attorney of law in Grove OK  is dishonest and will torment and cause harm and damage to your life if retained for legal matters!! In my case(s) he failed to represent me terribly, he lied cheated and withdrew???? The fact also exists, believe it A process server, when I was at the Jay OK,  court house, served  me with  court order to appear for an Eviction hearing. As I glanced at it and my witnesses asked what in the world this was, Brandon Watkins snatched this document  from me and told me to Relax and he would take care of this. That the manager at The Grove Village Apartments was breaking the law. She could not have me evicted, a) no guilty verdict had been determined in my case. B) That I had to have admitted I committed a crime. I am innocent and remember sighing a sigh of relief and feeling good to be able to trust and have a good attorney. Then I asked  witnesses, what they remembered about this time in court and there response was, I (we)   saw Brandon Watkins, snatch the served papers out of your hands as you were reading over them for understanding. The date for appearing in court was set for April 30, 2012, and his exact words,, they stated, Brandon Said,Dont worry about it, I will take care of it. To date I have received no copy and nothing ever mailed to me. !Even when he unethically failed to disclose why he was a mad embarrassed temper tantrum immature man about report of wrong doing and misconduct was reported by me, Watkins became more deceitful, harming in every way in court! Lawyers are to have diligence? Well,   his misconduct shone brightly he again made promises he failed to keep.!! He then in return withdrew from one case on July 25, 2012.  Yes he Withdrew 5 days, prior and I was devastated on grounds that my actions prevented him from representing me non bias!! Asking for direction here,,,,This really doesnt happen in the year of 2012.. DOES it? God help anyone that can look in the mirror, make up more slander and lies, and go to church and proclaim they are Christians!!! Lawyers have oaths and ethics and conduct guidelines.. What is the delay in investigating Brandon Watkins? Please time is of the Essence!! Thank you. J N before my hearing!!!!! The second case he withdrew day of court on July 31, 2012.. The day of my hearing and then not until October 2012 did he then finally withdraw from my custody case and protection order case!! Yet he and staff threatened to have me arrested for harassment. When trying to communicate and get answers to my Life changing Questions!!! He failed over and over to return any emails nor phone calls and his lack of dedication and his opposition of being mad at me reporting him for a NO show to court, He turned tail and used offensive behavior. Lied on correspondences. and the lowest ethical action of all is LIED about the Billing history of our endeavor!! I need to protect people seeking competent representation...They will be abused, slandered, and spit on by a hand you feed Thousands and Thousands of dollars too!!!The bill he sent is a complete falsely documented bill. For example : January 27,2012 he billed me for consultation. I did not ever talk to an employee of or  Mr Watkins, until, Feb 2, 2012Then his phone calls to court house to change appearance date(s) charged me 400.00 and 600.00 dollars???  For 10 minutes?? Are his actions for Real???Complete over charge and some meetings that never took place. And the most awful lie of all was having the nerve to tell me he did not show up for apartment hearing because I needed to just move,, the landlord just did not like me and why would I want to stay there??When I expressed my concern and sadness of what an eviction would do to my ability to rent again!!! He responded with Oh just tell new landlord that you just didnt get along. I was in utter shock!! I had no just lost my home due to the negligence of an Attorney whom I trusted and took the appearance paper I was served from my hand minutes after I was served at the court house during an appearance for my custody case. He later had his secretary Lisa lie and state, I told her not to have Brandon Show up!!! Why?! I now was homeless!!!!!!  He withdrew with no ethical conduct and I had been misrepresented, Brandon was dishonest. Deceitful and non-professional. Brandon withheld a report from my daughters counselor written in approx March 2012, I received a copy of this after he withdrew around July 31, 2012. He told me I was considered a flight risk by the counselor, and she did not recommend shared parenting time at this time. The letter had not one mention of me being considered a flight risk!!! Please let justice and dignity bring this unworthy attorney to be disciplined and not devastate nor destroy another clients life!Brandon is also in fault of telling me  my visits with my daughter were suspended do to me missing one visit. There is nothing entered in the On demand court records that indicate and visits were canceled. What do I do now? I have no money to hire another attorney? For custody case?Brandon withdrew because of me reporting him to you about the NO Show for April 30, 2012Help this is unbelievable.So now he never reported a hair follicle test I completed in Feb 2012 to the court and the court had a due date of March 6, 2012, to the court..... Never entered that I have had no visits with my daughter since April 2012, and they granted a 5 year protective order to my daughters father when I was sick in CO and had doctors report of not being able to travel.. He obtained this after raping me in Sept 2011, stealing all my court papers, belongings, and dignity and was not ever ordered to return anything!!! took all clothes I had purchased for our daughter, my prescription glasses and only returned half of each bathing suit and earrings I owned. Never gave back an appraised ring valued at 1,863.00. I resided in a Safe House in Grove Ok for 5 days  and then with Gods grace found my apartment in Oct 2011 and then I was evicted on May 2.2012 Brandon never set my case for TrialHe only waived the preliminary hearing, and mis-lead me on this as well.. I am innocent and will right letters, Have contacted the ACLU, the women rights advocates and am now corresponding with Media and will in near future contact Ms.  Glory Alred... This cant happen as I have done nothing wrong but be at the disposal of my daughters wealthy father who will pay any amount of money to anyone to try and keep me from my rights as a mother. I have to grown college graduate sons, wonderful Mom and Dad, and am done with the one sided even my attorney worked against meThis needs investigated and Brandon needs to refund 1,800.00 from my payment of 2,500.00.. We had one hearing for custody and Watkins appearance at preliminary took 12 minutes not over 3 hours as billed!!! proof is pulling the court minutes and showing his demoralized values!!.He also said above and beyond his ethical duties? Ask about his assistant running down the school bus when they forgot a visit? Ask why they just happened to make a  courtesy call to my land lord, days before hearing was scheduled?? Then lie and say, not handling case? I told him not to go!!!   By making a few calls that established my confidence of my attorney handling this.. I was never told at any time he could not be at that hearing?! I havent even gone to court again.   He is wrong and I can not rent now!! He needs to be held accountable   I am not a scholar nor can type completely correct.. But I need to help society by having Brandon Watkins answer to his Unethical, Misconduct and False billing practices. The thought of another church going, God fearing single mother, relocated from Colorado ..alone in Oct 2009, be treated like this.. The justice system in this case needs to look at Brandon Watkins and his highly fraudulent and unethical practicing of the LAW in Oklahoma .God Speed.God Bless									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

She turned in her opinion letter the evening before the court hearing and failed to protect a sexually abused child from the step father who abused her and the mother who neglected her. Instead of making sure court orders protected the abused, she made sure the court ordered she receive monthly payments for her services. The sexually abused and neglected child received no child support what so ever. She ran up thousands of dollars of time yet produced one letter and made one phone call to DCFS. Tisha got her money and the abused/neglected child got no financial support. She separated two sisters and failed to look at the step father's alcohol abuse that started with a DUI conviction in 1996 and the step father's admitted alcohol consumption several times a week to the LA Co Sheriff's Department in Sept 2009. Thirteen years of drinking and Tisha Harman believed no danger existed with her opinion letter. She stood by and allowed a CLETS restraining order to be watered down yet For The Child determined the step father was taunting the abused child. This required us to relocate to another city for safety. Tisha Harman did nothing. Marsy's Law was ignored all together yet the State of CA determined the child was a victim of crime. The step father was ordered to complete a Sex Abuse Awareness Class yet never completed his obligation. A suicide attempt by the child who was abused and neglected did not seem to matter. Tisha stood by with silence. More than one criminal investigation is now open and active. The State of CA filed a lien against the step father and mother. The parent who neglected the child was caught lying to a United States Bankrutpcy Trustee and was held accountable for hiding assets including the money she stole from her own daughter. Justice does occur when you as the non-offending, custodial parent are your child's advocate. You have to protect your child and persist. Tisha Harman is not attorney you can trust with your children's best interests. Object is she is appointed minor's counsel.

[continued below]....																			.....What makes this such a violation of trust and ethics is when questioned about specific details leading up to the closing of the deal, Mr. Bettencourt became cross and stated that he had no time for such minutia, essentially dismissing our concerns as trivial and not deserving of his time or effort.His petulant behavior persisted when challenged post closing as he became evasively abrupt and terminated the conversation.Despite several attempts to correct the disparity related to our transaction Mr. Bettencourt has closed our file dismissing us and our losses.He has hurt our family tremendously and has demonstrated NO REMORSE for his actions despite his informed knowledge of how greatly this has affected our family.It was shortly after determined that there was indeed no shortfall related to the transaction and that Mr. Bettencourt had miscalculated items already accounted for by the other party, adding incompetence to his character profile.Mr. Bettencourt has made no effort to correct these matters despite several requests to do so by all parties involved.He presents as a professional but is anything but. Mr. Bettencourt cannot be trusted and should be held up for examination by his peers for this gross misconduct and breach of his responsibility to his clients.Be extremely cautious when dealing with Mr. Bettencourt as he clearly only cares about the color that lines his pockets.While I am certain that this matter will never be righted, I am hopeful that this post will serve as a warning to others when given the opportunity to chose whether or not to do business with Mr. Christopher J.

Keegan law firm in 2009 for a loan modification for our property , they started charging us $ 600.00 a month for their services and delayed the process with the courts for more then 2 years all this time we were paying the $600.00 plus court fees every time we would go to court and the attorney will ask the judge for an extension to our case during all this time Mr Keegan and his staff including attorney Alfonso Juarez assured us that everything was well and the process was moving along fine, we trusted his professional opinion and kept paying for their services.

When we began the loan modification my sister in law had outstanding credit and we applied under her name, my sister in law died in 2011 after suffering a stroke and she did leave a will, the bank began to claim that they will not deal with us since we were not on the loan. Mr Keegan as well as Mr. Juarez never informed us of a motion tx hat could had been filed with the court called a Probate that will assign all her debt over to her closest relatives in this case her sister and the bank would had been obligated by law to deal with me and my wife. The bank did put up an ad searching for living relatives thru the publication Daily Business Review a publication that all attorneys receive weekly. This ad was supposed to be answer within 30 days so the proceedings could continue. The attorneys never answered to this ad and thus by default the bank went to the Judge and said that that my sister law did not have any relatives. The judge laid final judgment and we lost our property. For three years Mr. Keegan and Mr. Juarez  assured us that they will work out a deal with the bank and we will be able to keep our house of 15 years. A week before our court appearance before the judge we receive a call from Mr. Juarez telling us that we were going to lose our case and told us not to go to court because if we went to court the judge will have ordered us to vacate our house in 30 days and if we did not go to court the bank will give us 3 months to vacate the house. We reluctantly agreed to this since we have over 15 years of history and many things that make it impossible to move within 30 days. Now we have contacted other attorneys that have reviewed the case and have pointed out the mistakes that Mr Keegan and Mr Juarez did in our case, they also believe that they might have worked a deal with the bank for their own profit.

Atkinson's name also was on the eviction order posting on the front door of Copa. Atkinson is complicit in assisting Kelly Murphy with doing things like recruiting people as ""straw men"" to use them to arrange for things like getting liquor licenses for Murphy, who is unable to legally obtain a such a license under Nevada state law because of his past felony convictions. A match made in heaven, eh?Atkinson's tax lien, courtesy of the IRS, totals almost $50,000 -- $46,227 to be exact -- from more than seven years ago. How exactly do you get away with that for seven years? Atkinson and Murphy: birds of a feather? You be the judge.									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

They had to borrow money against their own furniture to fund their office opening, and they staff it with inexperienced, what I would refer to as, kids. You half expect to see cartoon character lunch boxes at their desks. Nothing beats experience, and this crew doesn't seem to have it. You would think after decades in the legal business as practicing attorneys, they would have a clue, but by every indication I've seen, this is a law firm without a clue. Beware of these guys. They're operating on a shoestring budget and will do pretty much anything for revenue flow -- you know, income, cash, a payday. They'll try to bully you into doing something that may not be in YOUR best interests, but is in THEIR best interest. Don't be intimidated, don't be bullied.

Bronx, New York","										To Whom It May Concern:My name is Nancy Advincola and I reside at 1153 229th Drive South, Apt. 3D, Bronx, NY 10466, home phone 347-427-1329( available during 10:00-1:00 in the morning). The purpose of this email is because my family and I have been living at Edenwald Housing Complex for the past 12 years and as of the last 3 years we haven't been given a lease and we've handed in all the needed documents too. Now we don't owe the NYC Housing Authority a penny; but perhaps it's due to the fact that we continue to address this issue in an educated manner. Such as calling the media, having our story published in the newspapers, especially El Diario la Prensa numerous times and also having our story viewed on Telemundo Channel 47. Once the press started to investigate, the NYC Housing Authority denied that they were going to evict us.Two months ago my family and I experienced the unpleasant encounter with Mr. Johnson, a Edenwald Housing Assist who had the nerve to start banging on our door and yelling at my Husband Carlos R. Advincola Sr. and I in front of our sons. Mr. Johnson was accompanied by another Edenwald Housing Assist and that gentlemen repeated to Mr. Johnson to calm down; but Mr. Johnson refused and at the end had to be dragged away from our apartment door. During all of this unnecessary incident, Mr. Johnson forced upon us documents hand made by Edenwald's Management Office stating that within 30 days we would be evicted. How can tenant be evicted if their paying their rent every month and on time. Instead of continuing to allow Mr. Edwin Rodriguez(Edenwald Manager and Mr. Johnson Housing Assist) bully us, we have continued to make this issue public, using every social website that we have access to ... Such as Facebook, twitter, Myspace, Blogger.com, Tumblr. and a great of others.This menace of an individual called Mr. Johnson also came to pounding on our door on Monday, Nov. 18, 2012, at about 3:45. Since our building has strangers coming in and out of it, I always look out of my peep whole before opening the door. However, this inept individual named Mr. Johnson was covering his face with his hooded coat, pouncing the door with his fist and yelling his name in an angry way and he was also accompanied by a female whom didn't tell me her name. Due to my extremely serious health issues, I wasn't going to open the door. The Edenwald Management Office located at 1145 229th Drive North, Bronx NY 10466, phone number 718-882-6900, especially by the Housing Manager Mr. Edwin Rodriquez that continues to allow an uneducated, unprofessional and is misogynist, I say this because when my husband of 24 yrs. & 6 mos. and our 2 sons went to the Management Office in order to address this matter in an civilized manner; Mr. Johnson was extremely disrepectful to an elderly woman in a wheel chair and after he conducted himself as an animal this ignoramus totally ignored us. After waiting for more than an hour or more we left. The reason why I'm informing you about the going on at the Edenwald Management Office is because my family and I aren't the only tenants ongoings this type of abuse, we've had numerous residents ask what they should do; because Edenwald Management Office is constantly accusing them of not paying their rent, taking them to court and not carefully checking that their rent is PAID. Is this the protocol of the NYC Housing Authority? Or is Mr. Rodriguez(Housing Manager) and Mr. Johnson(Housing Assist) abusing their power? With this I'm going to conclude, all through the past week we've had certified letters and found bogus court paper letters in our mailbox. Monday, Nov. 26, 2012 was the supposed court date; however the copy; because we NEVER received an original document stated that if we don't own housing any money disregard this letter. We feel that Edenwald Management Office has a personal vendetta against us because we're bringing attention to the schizo behavior that's going on at that office.  Thank you for your time and cooperation, we hope & Pray that you find it in your hearts to come to the aid of not only my family; but the other silent tenants that don't wish to undergoing harassing tactics ... My husband and I have been calling your offices for more than a week; however the phones are ALWAYS busy ... We really need your organization's assistance! Can someone PLEASE get back to us RSAP? It will be greatly appreciated. Once again, here's our home phone number 347-427-1329 and our email too ... nancy.advincola@gmail.com									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

These attorney's are dishonest and they have to be brought to justice for their crimes that were committed against me and our justice system.  I already notified the Bar Association,  the New york City District Attorney's office, and the F.B.I.'s office in Melville, New york.  All of them said, that they don't handle these types of  crimes committed by Attorney's.  I have clearly been defrauded by these Attorney's and I am asking you to do a full investigation involving Fraud, Perjury, Misconduct, Payoff's, and Conspiracy.  With all evidence I collected for the last year you will clearly see the ongoing fraud that has been going on for over six years now!

Carman held in the Federal courthouse in Central Islip, New York.  ( R v's LIRR, case # 04-CV-1820.)3.  Before trial was held in July of 2006 their were many pretrial hearings that took place. I was at the pretrial conference at Judge Carman's chambers in Brooklyn, New York on May 24, 2006.  Andrew P. Keaveney offically offered another job on the LIRR as a Ticket Information Clerk because of my ongoing back problem that payed $4 dollars less an hour. On July 12, 2006, my attorney excepted the position in my behalf and Judge Carman Stipulated our agreement. At trial the jury was instructed by Judge Carman, and by the attorney's that the LIRR gave me another job that I was able to do because of my disability that paid $4 dollars less an hour. The Jury was instructed and believed that the LIRR was taking care of me with another position and awarded me the $4 dollar difference for one job to the other for my work life expectancy. After the trial was over Ireported to work and I was sent home without pay.  Three days later I get a letter in the mail for the Long Island Railroad telling me I was TERMINATED.4. I then called my Attorney, Frederic M. Gold, and told him that I was Terminated and that the Railroad broke our Stipulated Agreement. Then Mr. Gold told me that he was going to call Judge Carman to reopen the case. About a week later Mr. Gold called me back and told me that Judge Carman said No,  he will not open the case and that he said to move on to a Breach of Contract lawsuit in state court. After that Mr. Frederic M. Gold sends me a check from the FELA case about a month and a half later. He said this money should hold you over until we get back to court for the Breach of Contract lawsuit.  It took about four and a half years to get back to court.  By then I lost everything.5. Mr. Frederic M. Gold filed a Complaint letter ( Plaintiff Demands Trial By Jury) on September 29, 2006 to the Supreme courts in New York. In paragraph # 8 Mr. Gold explains that we had a Stipulated Agreement that I was going to start a new position as a travel information clerk. The Stipulated agreement was made on July 12, 2006 by both attorney's and Judge Gregory W Carman. It was entered into evidence by my attorney, Frederic M. Gold, as Exhibit # 2 during the FELA trial. Because someone Sealed the Stipulated Agreement,  I am unable to get it at this time.6. Mr Frederic M. Gold filed a sworn affidavit on November 6, 2008, that was notarized by Theresa Mahlstadt esq, for the Breach Of Contract Lawsuit.  In this affidavit Mr. Gold explains in paragraph's3, 4, 5, that Mr. Andrew P. Keaveney offer the new TIC position at the pretrial hearing dated on May 24, 2006, Memorialized Letter, which would minimize his claim for future damages. Mr. gold explains that Andrew P. Keaveney told Judge Carman that the offer was in fact made at the pretrial meeting.  Mr. Gold explains that they both agreed on my future lost earnings in his affidavit and that Andrew P. Keaveney has to testify against his own client, the Long Island Railroad, to be my witness at the Breach of Contract trial.  Mr Gold also said, Judge Carman, in an effort to streamline the lost future earnings figuares and calculation, encouraged Defendent's attorney, Andrew P. Keaveney and I to agree on Mr. Rxxxxs future lost earnings. Then they came to an Agreement. He also explains that the calculation of these number was reached with the assistance of Judge Carman. In this affidavit, Mr Gold admitseverything except the date of the Stipulation Agreement that was made on July 12, 2006 that was in fact Sealed to coverup this Fraud. 7. A week before the Breach Of Contract (case #603453/06),held in the New york Supreme Courthouse, N.Y. ,Held by Judge Shirley Werner Kornreich.  I was told by Mr Frederic M. Gold that he was going to take the witness stand to explain the Stipulated agreement to the Jury. Mr Gold informed me the Mr. Philip Dinhofer was going to be my trial attorney.  I met with Mr. Dinhofer a few days beforetrial and explained to him that we had a Stipulated agreement and that the jury was instructed by Judge Carman that I was starting the TIC position following trial.  The jury relied on the new position less $4 dollars an hour to come up with there verdict at the personal injury trial.                                                        8. A few hours before the Breach of Contract trial started Mr. Gold told me that he Subpoenaed Judge Gregery W. Carman to take the witness stand as my witness. Mr. Gold told me that Judge Carman was going to explain that we had a Stipulated Agreement in detail to the Jury.  The Defense attorney in this case was James M. Woolsey who works in the same law firm as Andrew P. Keaveney from the FELA trial.  Mr. Gold said that he knew Mr. Woolsey for 28 year and they have worked together in many other cases.9. When the Breach of Contract trial started,  my trial attorney, Philip Dinhofer had me go on the witness stand.  He didn't ask me any questions about the Stipulated Agreement that we discussed in his office before trial.  When I came off the witness stand,  I asked him why didn't you ask me any questions about the stipulated agreement.  He told me that Mr. Gold and Judge Carman will explain that part of the case to the jury.10.When Mr. Frederic M. Gold took the witness stand he was questioned first by Philip Dinhofer. Mr. Dinhofer never asked him about the offer from Andrew P. Keaveney or about the Stipulated agreement. Mr. Dinhofer avoided it again.  Next,  Mr. James M. Woolsey questioned Mr. Gold and asked him if the TIC postion was ever offered or talked about at any pretrial hearing for the FELA case and Mr Frederic M.Gold said,  NO,  IT WAS NEVER OFFERED OR DISCUSSED AT ANY PRETRIAL HEARING,  AND THAT HE ASSUMED  I HAD THE TIC POSITION.  I could not believe Mr. Frederic Gold just  lied like that on the witness standunder oath.  When Mr. Gold can off the witness stand I asked him why did you lie.  He said that I was confused and that the TIC position was never offered or documented at any pretrial meeting. I told Mr. Philip Dinhofer that Mr. Gold was lying undre oath.  He didn't do anything about it and went on like nothing happened.  It was obvious that they were in on this fraud together. My hands were tied at that point.11. When Mr. Andrew P. Keaveney took the witness stand he was questioned by Mr. James M. Woolsey, and he said the same thing as Mr.Gold.  Mr. Keaveney also denied that he ever offer the TIC position to me and that they never had any Stipulated Agreement.  Also Mr.Keaveney said that the letters T.I.C was never brought up at any pretrial hearing from the FELA case.  Next, Philip Dinhofer questioned Mr. Keaveney and he again denied everything and then told the jury that he swore an oath when he became a Lawyer to always tell the truth.  Both  Frederic M. Gold and  Andrew P. Keaveney  committed a Federal crime when they took  the oath and then lied on the witness stand to cover up this Fraud. 12. After Mr. Andrew P. Keaveney lied on the witness stand,  I told Mr Dinhofer that I wanted a mistrial because everyone was lying on thewitness stand.  He said he will ask Judge Kornreich and then get back to me.  When Mr Dinhofer came back to me he said that she said, NO. Then I tood up and asked her myself and she said  DON'T TALK TO ME,  TALK TO YOUATTORNEY.  I was trapped and couldn't do anything about the lying that was going on!  It was obvious that all four ofthese attorney's were involved in the Fraud.  The court would only listen to the attorney's and my hands were tied.13. Next thing that happened was Judge Gregory W. Carman was suppose to talk the witness stand and he never showed up.  Mr. Frederic M.Gold said that he called the Judge to come and take the witness stand, but now he refused to come. So Judge Kornreich said,  IfJudge Carman doesn't want to take the witness stand,  he doesn't have to.  I'm not going to sent the Sheriff's after him.  Judge Carman was my last hope for the truth to come out,  and now I knew I was going to lose this case, because everyone was in on this CORRUPTION SCAM.  Of course the jury came back with a not Guity verdict in behalf of the LIRR.14. After court was over I got into a cab with Mr. Gold and Mr.Dinhofer and I was very upset about the Scam that happened at trial. When we got out of the cab Mr. Frederic M. Gold told me not to worry and that there was problem.  Mr. Frederic Gold told to me that Mr.Andrew P. Keaveney's Law firm was in a lot of trouble because of this Breach of Contract Lawsuit.  He said that Mr. Keaveney never had permission for the Railroad to offer the TIC position at the Pretrial hearing!  Then Mr. Gold said he has a lot of money for me from  Mr.James Woolsey and Mr. Dinhofer said he was going to appeal this case.I responded by saying,  YOU CORRUPTED MY CASE. Then Mr.Frederic Gold and Mr. Philip Dinhofer walked away from me.  I stood there in shock and couldn't believe this was going on!  The next Monday after court I tried calling Mr. Gold and he would not respondor call me back. 15. After a few weeks I went to the Federal Courthouse in central Islip, New york and also went to the Supreme Courthouse, N.Y., NewYork and copied all the paperwork that was on file from the Personal Injury case and the Breach of Contract trials.  I found the evidence to prove that both Frederic M. Gold and Andrew P. Keaveney  both lied and Committed Perjury on the witness stand,  because they wereworking together to coverup a Fraud.  Also, someone put a SEAL on all the EXHIBIT'S from the Personal Injury case to cover up our Stipulated Agreement so knowone can get it.  If you look at the History of case number ( 04-CV-1820 ) in the Central Islip, New York,Federal Courthouse,  you will see that(HISTORY #47  is sealed) andall Exhibits were sealed.  When they are UNSEALED you will see the Stipulated Agreement that both attorney's lied about!16. I also contacted the Supreme Courthouse in N.Y. New York and found out the Philip Dinhofer did file the notice of an Appeal on December 22, 2010.  Then I wrote Mr. Dinhofer and asked him what was going on with the Appeal.  Mr Philip Dinhofer wrote me back and said he never filed any Appeal.  I sent him 3 letters asking him about the Appeal and he sent me 3 letters back and denied that he filed any Appeal in my behalf.  The problem is that I have 2 letters that Mr. Dinhofer did file an Appeal,  but he denies that he ever did.  The Notice of Appeal letters are signed and dated with his name( Mr. Philip Dinhofer) and his address is on the notice of Appeal.  Then I get a letter from Mr. Frederic M. Gold telling me that Mr. Philip Dinhoferwent to the Supreme Courthouse and had himself removed from the Appeal.  Like I said,  Mr Dinhofer denied in 3 different letter's that he filed an Appeal in my behalf.  Now I have Mr. Gold telling me Mr Dinhoper had himself removed from the case somehow in which I was never notified by the court of this. LIE AFTER LIE AFTER LIE!!! Now the Appeal has expired because of their actions. This has been an Ongoing Fraud for the last 6 years now and these Attorney's have to be stopped.  How many other people have they done this to and how many people are they going to do this to?17. Because of my own attorney that I retained to represent me,  Mr.Frederic M. Gold was involved in this fraud my family and I have been suffering very badly! I am disabled with no job now and millions of dollars was stolen from me because of this Scam.  I have the evidence to prove that Mr. Frederic M. Gold,  Mr. Philip Dinhofer,  Mr. James M. Woolsey,  and Mr. Andrew P. Keaveney were all involved in this Conspiracy.  I have been going through this ongoing fraud for over 6 years now and until I get justice, I will not stop. These attorney's involved are destroying our justice system with there dishonest ways.Trust me, they think there gonna get away with it. 18. I am asking you to do a full investigation in this matter so I can get justice from these Attorney's that are abusing thereLicense's. There has to be someone overseeing the corruption that goes on in the court's between these attorney's. They are abusing there license's to profit in a dishonest way and need to be stopped. I already have a lot of the evidence you will need to conduct your investigation against these attorney's.  I am sending you the evidence that will clearly prove that what I told you is true. Please Help Me! Everyday is getting harder to deal with this Corruption that destroyed my life!  All I'm asking is for the truth to come out.  You will see that everything I said is true. 19. When I was in court for the  Personal injury trial or theBreach of contract trial everything was in my attorney's hands.I am relying on my attorney to represent me in the best of his ability's, and to find out that Mr. Frederic M. Gold was working for the defense attorney's all along.  Mr. Frederic M. Gold and Andrew P.Keaveney clearly lied on the witness stand to misinform the jury at the Breach Of Contract trial. All the Attorney's involved in this Fraud are trying to cover it up, but I have the evidence in Mr. Frederic Gold's own words that he did have a Stipulated Agreement .  20. Because of my disability, I am suffering everyday with cronic back pain because of the rods and screws in my back.  Now I have to deal with these corrupt attorney's that took advantage of my situation!  I cannot live with what they have done to me!  I will gladly sent you the evidence I have to prove that what I am telling you is true. I desperately need help.  To much time has gone by and my life is destroyed. I can't live with what these attorney's did to me.

Wacker Drive in Chicago.The company, also known as the law firm Macey, Aleman, Hyslip & Searns, charged upfront fees for debt-consolidation services, which became illegal in Illinois last year, the suit alleges. The Debt Settlement Consumer Protection Act forbids debt-settlement companies from charging upfront fees and requires they only collect fees if a consumers debt is actually settled.Attorneys are exempted from the law, allowing them to charge upfront fees.Legal Helpers illegally charged fees upfront under a guise that attorneys were providing the debt-settlement service to consumers, according to the suit. Madigan said attorneys with Legal Helpers served only as a front to the business  that the actual debt-settlement service was contracted out to non-lawyer, third-party companies.They are essentially a referral source for a scavenger industry seeking to profit from peoples debt problems, Madigan said.The firm charges non-refundable fees that include a $500 retainer, $49 monthly charge and 15 percent of the total debt, according to the lawsuit.While the firm promised to make its customers debt free, it never lowered the debt and  often left them worse off financially, the attorney general said.Jason Searns, general counsel and managing partner with the Legal Helpers, said Wednesday his firm has done nothing wrong and is simply providing an alternative for clients who dont want to declare bankruptcy.Were a bona fide law firm providing legal services, he said. Our attorneys review every clients file to determine whats appropriate for them.Searns said Legal Helpers has a different business model than firms that simply rent a lawyer so they can take advantage of the upfront-fee exemption. His firm provides legal counsel to clients and has a strategic alliance with debt-settlement firms to provide debt-management services.Its all under our supervision and our auditing control, Searns said. When the facts come out, it will show were perfectly fine in what were doing with our clients.Legal Helpers has a C-minus rating with the Better Business Bureau. At least 1,117 Illinois consumers signed up with Legal Helpers, as of Oct. 1, 2010, the suit says.Here is the link: http://archive.chicagobreakingbusiness.com/2011/03/illinois-ag-sues-law-firm-for-duping-consumers.htmlhttp://getoutofdebt.org/32351/legal-helpers-debt-resolution-and-jem-group-named-in-ohio-suitA suit filed in Ohio has just been recently remove to Federal Court.

Rather than providing legal help, the lawyers were a ""front"" to collect hefty fees from struggling consumers, Madigan said.Legal Helpers denied wrongdoing but also agreed to stop accepting more Illinois clients under the settlement.Jason Searns, the firm's general counsel, said publicity surrounding the lawsuit and settlement has made it hard for Legal Helpers to attract new customers outside Illinois, and the decision was made to cease operations after servicing its existing clients.

Legal Helpers Debt ResolutionIn this case which was moved to Federal Court on September 23, 2011, Mobley files suit against Legal Helpers Debt Resolution, Macy, Aleman, Hyslip & Searns and Jeffry Hyslip.This is not the typical LHDR case. Here we have an case involving allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault. Mobley was an LHDR employee.The complaint states Sara Mobley began working for Legal Helpers Debt Resolution and Macey, Aleman, Hyslip & Searns in December 2009. Mobley adequately performed her job and in August 2010 Ms. Mobley was sexually harassed by Defendant Jeffrey Hyslip and states that she was subsequently sexually harassed and sexually assaulted by Mark Mancino, and LHDR affiliate.Mobley allegedly complained to supervisors and she was told she was a big girl and should handle the situation herself.In addition, Ms. Mobley expressed concerns regarding the criminal activities of some LHDR partners and affiliates, resulting in further retaliation.When Mobley was hired she was told she would earn approximately $30,000 a month. So Im assuming use must have been a sales representative.In August 2010, Mobley traveled to Chicago to attend a debt settlement conference at the direction of LHDR. It is at that conference, or more specifically at the hotel bar, where Sara says Jeffrey Hyslip made aggressive sexual advances towards her. Mobley states Hyslip asked her what he could get for $500 or $1,000.The complaint says Defendant Hyslip advised Ms. Mobley that she should add some worth to the firm and then grabbed her upper thigh, causing a bruise, and tol her that he wanted to f*k her ever since he had seen her that morning.Later the same evening, Mark Mancino allegedly informed her that she was dangerous and that business and pleasure should not mix but that because they were going to work together for a long time, they were definitely going to mix pleasure into their business relationship.The complaint states:Mr. Mancino stated that he was going to bend [Ms. Mobley] over and f*k [her] right there. When Ms. Mobley rejected those advances, Mr. Mancino dragged her across the bar by the upper arm to the entrance of an employees only closet. Mr. Mancinos sexual assault of Ms. Mobley was interrupted by a hotel employee who saw what was happening and intervened. Mr. Mancinos tight grip on Ms. Mobleys upper arm while he dragged her across the room caused a large bruise around her arm.When Ms. Mobley returned to her office, she reported both of these incidents of unwanted sexual advances to Jason Searns, LHDRs General Counsel and Senior Partner.Mobley states she email Searns and explained Mr. Hyslips sexual harassment and assault and Mr. Mancinos sexual harassment and sexual assault. Mr. Searns responded by email the same day and stated, I realize Mancino is a hound when he drinks, but you are a big girl. You either play it like one of the boys and ignore then, or tell them what they say or attempt to do is inappropriate.The complaint says Mobley subsequently emailed Searns photos of the bruises and received an email that said, [a]s a woman, you always have the power to decide what is acceptable. Even if Jeffrey [Hyslip] or Mancino were intoxicated, as Im sure they were, you should contact them privately regarding their behavior and let them know what will happen if the behavior is repeated EVER.During Ms. Mobleys employment at LHDR and MAHS, she became aware of the criminal associations of some of the people closely associated with, if not employed by, LHDR and MAHS, namely their prior mortgage fraud convictions and ties with organized crime families.  SourceMark Mancino is also named in another Legal Helpers Debt Resolution suit I wrote about recently. In this case Mancino and John Lembo were part of an alleged conspiracy to take income away from another LHDR affiliate, Safeguard, and direct that income to their own company, Nationwide Referral Services aka National Legal Referral Service.

The Senior Citizens project lies in court to allow Jon Norheim and Jared Shafer to drain senior accounts dry.   Its just one crime after another when it concerns Commissioner Jon W Norheim.  Reports will continue to be filed and perhaps someday justice will be the result.

I had a family law matter which, in hindsight, I would have been better off pursuing pro se. The initial meeting was with a paralegal, with an attorney brought in about an hour and a half later. Initial price quote was $3700, reduced to $1500 after I informed them I was underemployed (like so many others these days). They didn't guarantee a favorable outcome - which they are forbidden to do anyway - but intimated strongly that I would win based on legal precedent and the merits of the case. I made a down payment and a payment schedule was established. I was provided with several pages of documentation to fill out and return. Over the course of the next four months the only person with whom I had any regular contact was the accounts receivable rep assigned to my case. She was very pleasant, of course. I spoke with my attorney by phone twice, for a total of less than two hours. He dismissed, rather condescendingly, the 12 pages of paperwork I had filled out, along with two of the three courses of action they had originally agreed to pursue on my behalf. My attorney was confident we would prevail on the remaining issue.I met once with my attorney, five days before the court date. He explained his strategy, the legal basis for it, and that it was as close to a slam dunk as existed in the legal world. He showed up late for our appointment and had to return to his office to retrieve my file. He was not familiar with who I was or the status of my case until he had the file in front of him.My attorney called me after appearing - and losing - in court. He gave me a detailed blow-by-blow account of the proceedings, and expressed his shock and dismay at the court's ruling. He then laid out his strategy for an appeal, as an idea had occurred to him just then that he hadn't considered before the hearing. He was confident his appeal strategy would prevail, and it would only cost me another $1500.Seriously? I'll admit to being an idiot for ever retaining these thieves, but I do eventually figure things out. The deception and incompetence of this firm extend beyond the well-documented issues in their real estate division, and are apparently endemic to the entire organizational culture and operational philosophy. They exist for the sole purpose of separating the public from their money, and one can only hope that sooner rather than later the state will shut them down.									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Each member of our team has extensive experience in the mortgage restructuring, and debt settlement and consolidation.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..The information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Brent Philips and Robert Newton in an interview held by a third party visit, by an on-site verification company with no biases toward Philips Law Center. The offices of Phillips Law Center are located in Costa Mesa, CA in a multi-tenant property. There is no marquee on the property, and no company signs were present on the door or in the building. The main office is a call Center with cubicles, and five private offices are occupied by Brent Phillips (Attorney at Law), Robert Newton (Resolution Manager) and several generic managers. The marketing consultant, Anthony Terah, does not have an office on-site. Two separate interviews were conducted with company representatives:  The first was with Robert Newton and Anthony Terah, and was followed by a second interview with Brent Phillips. Per Brent Phillips, (the purported namesake of the company) his office relocated from Newport Beach, CA in October of 2012. Phillips Law Center (or PLC) has no relation to Phillips Professional Law Corporation, which is a California corporation with separate offices. Although Farmer’s Law Center and Forest Law are both names that complainants have attributed to Brent’s business, he states that the name “Farmer’s Law Center” was a domain name created by a former employee that they never used (he thought the name was cheesy), and confirmed that they have never had any association with a Forest Law Center. According to Brent Phillips, his business is an Arizona corporation that does general litigation and foreclosure prevention, although there is no restructuring available in California because it is against the law to take advanced fees for Mortgage Restructuring in that state. This is a federal law, and is referred to as the Mars rule. There is an exception if you are a licensed attorney in the state and the fees have to be deposited in an attorney/client trust fund in uniformity with that states rule of responsibility. Brent is licensed in CA, AZ, and MD and has attorneys working for him in other states that work on the specific mortgage restructuring. According to Anthony Terah, leads are obtained by purchasing data and information from credit bureaus such as Experian and Equifax, and then a “legal ad” is sent to the potential client via regular mail. Per both Brent and Anthony, when a potential client calls in, “The needs of the client are evaluated, as there are many factors to determine, like when the home is purchased, the debt to income ratio, loan to value of the home and any personal hardships.” Mr. Phillips reviews the files before a client is taken on. If the client agrees to work with them, funds are deposited into a trust account in uniformity with the state rules. Mr. Phillips and Mr. Terah had consistent responses when they were asked about the typical experience a client receives with their company.  Mr. Phillips made it clear that “No experience is typical. A lot of it’s just financial, and it’s a lot like doing your taxes or bankruptcy, it’s not greater legal theory. We hone the financials, draft the appropriate hardship letters. Those are sent out (to the potential clients); they call in and speak with an intake agent. Intake agents are directed to qualify the client, not waste time. You can figure it out in ten minutes, by asking key questions. Then someone senior reviews it and it if is something that meets the criteria set out, or if there are questions, they call me right away. If the file meets criteria, we’ll have them sign a retainer, I’ll review it, and once I approve it the processing begins. The client sends in documents, and if they do not send in the complete documents, more time goes by. Also, Lenders are not as diligent about the restructuring in the loss mitigation room as they are in making new loans. In loss mitigation, they are losing money; on the other end, they’re making money. Restructuring is not their top priority.” This can often cause delays in the restructuring process. In regard to complaint resolution, Mr. Phillip’s gave the following example to illustrate how he deals with complaints: “One gentleman we accepted looked good initially. We started drilling into it, uncovered some factors that didn’t look so good. We called him, and told him the issues we saw, asked if he would like us to proceed even though it is a bit of a difficult file. If you want us to proceed, we’d be more than happy to submit your file, or it’s ok – if you would like us to cancel we will send your money back. He chose to have his money sent back. Plenty of other clients with a similar scenario want to proceed.” When asked how the client reacted, Brent responded: “Clients who are dealing with financial hardship are only as happy as they allow themselves to be. There are less than one percent who are not happy with their outcome.” Brent feels that he creates more friends and positive outcomes than the few that insist on being dissatisfied no matter what service is given.“As long as you disclose the problems in the file, it’s up to the client to make the decision. Many times they don’t have other options, they are in a bad loan, and they are upside down. For instance, they are not a Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae loan where they have a Harp loan that allows for negative equity. There is a protocol, homes affordable refinance program, which allows people with negative equity up to any amount to refinance. No other lender has that program. You go anywhere else, you generally need 20% equity. There has been a precipitous drop in home values.” Brent said he will sometimes charge the client half for services, and tell the client that if they are successful, he will charge the other half. The retainer that the client signs at the beginning of the process states what they will be doing, and they acknowledge that they have no guarantees. In the last six months, they have started recording interviews.  People hear what they want to hear, and we now have a recorded interview where they were told and acknowledge that there are no guarantees.” Anthony Terah’s approach to explaining complaint resolution was more specific about the process. He said that all accounts are updated every fourteen days in a system that the clients can see, and that all calls are returned within 24-48 hours. Because each processor handles around 155 files a piece, they do their best to accommodate the clients; however, they have assigned one person to specifically monitor all communications for all files to make sure calls are returned. If a complaint cannot be resolved by the processing staff, resolution manager Robert Newton speaks to them.  In some cases, Newton will refer cases on to Mr. Phillips to deal with personally. “We always settle in a way that is amicable,” says Newton.” If a client is not happy, they are referred to speak with the attorney assigned to their state.Brent explains that there are a number of factors that will affect results: besides the loan companies, clients are not always compliant. “We get great results. I’ve probably had 5,000 clients over the years, but you’re going to have the 1%. I understand. People, when they don’t achieve the results they desire, they complain. And the unfortunate part is, people you get results for, they never write anything. I’m not saying every file we have worked on has been perfect, no business can say that. But we send them their money back. We’ve given refunds because people complain or there are cancellations. So we try to do our best, to get what I think is fair. Simply because they didn’t get a good result, we still give them something back so they don’t leave on a bad note.”Brent and his representatives, in separate interviews, were asked about their responses to the specific complaints on Ripoff Report by former clients who claimed they were forced into foreclosure because of bad advice, or they were charged for services they did not receive. Mr. Phillips was very adamant in his response: “No one is forced into foreclosure! No one told them not to make their payments.” Mr. Phillips explained that with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loans, the process is straightforward, but if someone has a “Harper” loan, (which he describes as the high-interest loans that caused the mortgage bubble to break) they have negative equity. For instance, Mr. Phillips worked with a 74-year old widow who was given a negative amortization loan. It took 54% of her income to make her mortgage payment, which never went to her principal but only paid interest. She had the option to use her life savings to work with the original company, who had her loan, but her life savings would be depleted and the company would still foreclose, which, Brent alludes, has happened frequently when people work with these companies on their own. He helps people resubmit, and informs the customers about what is going to happen. Brent continued, “If they’re going to foreclose, (as the widow) I’d rather keep my $50,000 in savings. At that point, we re-submitted it (when she was in hardship) and got it approved. When we first submitted it, because she was not behind, the lender Indy Mac likes to play this little game. Since you’re not behind, we’re not going to do it (the restructure).” However, some customers take that warning about their original loan companies and voluntarily decide to stop making their payments. Brent says he never tells people to stop making their payments. He lets them know that lenders are more inclined to do something if they are behind, and that they need to sit down with their family and decide what they need to do, because the lender can foreclose, and it takes up to a year in Maryland, for instance, for a foreclosure to go through and he encourages clients to do what they think is best in regard to saving money in payments so they can get another house after the eventual foreclosure.According to Anthony, many of them are also applying for restructuring on their own with their company, apart from hiring Phillips Law Center, and they withdraw their request for help when they are successful on their own and expect not to have to pay anything for services.   Brent says, “A misunderstanding occurs when people say, ‘I hired you to do my mortgage restructure’, but my reply is, ‘No; you hired me to perform services;’ there are no guarantees to the outcome.”Brent made it clear that their service is to give the legal advice and help for applying for loan restructuring; however, the lenders can say no, and depending on the type of loan they have, the likelihood of success obviously affects the outcome, as well as the level of customer cooperation. In a separate interview, Anthony Terah said “You cannot promise or guarantee your lender will approve the modification application. As required by state law, they are directed to make their payments while the modification is in progress. What’s online is not accurate. It is also easy to track Brent through the state bar, where his cell phone number is on file.” Terah reiterated that clients sign an extensive retainer agreement, and calls with the customers are recorded to verify their compliance with the terms because so many erroneous complaints have come through. Terah says that Mr. Phillips does quite a bit of Pro-bono work for elderly clients, but this is never noted on the Ripoff Reports.ANY BUSINESS THAT CAN ADMIT THEY MADE MISTAKES AND CORRECTS THOSE MISTAKES IS A BUSINESS YOU CAN TRUST AND WORTH DOING BUSINESS WITH .To deal with their level of service, improvements have been made in the process to make clients feel more comfortable and informed; Phillips Law Center has hired more customer service representatives, and has mandated that every possible attempt to contact the client during developments is made. Terah stated that “All complaints are handled with a refund, even the unfounded ones. Some clients submit their own file while in process with us, and then withdraw their request, and they are refunded.” Mr. Phillips, in his effort to “do whatever it takes” to satisfy his customers and deal with complaints, had this to say: “If the file is not handled properly a refund is made. I’ve started bringing in more customer service people and keeping customers more apprised, getting back with clients in a timely fashion.”Mr. Phillips’ response on being part of the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program for Ripoff report was, simply, “We adhere to a higher ethical and business standard. We also take a personal interest in each client.” Also, he said that what sets their business apart is that they have experienced staff and follow the law. “We have licensed attorneys in every state; Maryland, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, and Pennsylvania. Most other businesses (of their type) do not have hands-on attorneys.

NOW TO THE ORIGINAL REPORT THAT WAS FILED    ----------------------------------------------------										 Phillips Law Center Attorneys at Law SCAM!! Be aware PLEASE DO NOT TRUST THEM AND LOSE $3,000 like I did! Newport Beach, California I spoke to the free counsel for the MHA HAMP and HARP governmemt hotline 1888-995 hope (1888-9954673) today and spoke with Kelly Haber, very nice lady. Please call before Phillips Law Center STEALS your money. Do not lose $3,000 like I did. THEY DO NOT GIVE REFUNDS! It is all a lie. Find our the guidelines they don't tell you. They only tell you what you want to hear. They make you trust them and feel safe. In my case they lied saying I would quilify but they Knew I do not but they took my money anyway. They also told me I was going to get a refund in case it did not work. Email me at brunaveneza@yahoo.com for details. DO NOT SIGN THE ONLINE CONTRACT, its is not what they tell you on the phone. The lady at the hotline confirmed all my suspicious about Phillips Law Center. She confirmed the SCAM. They knew I would not qualify at the first phone call for many reasons, I don't qualify for any of the programs at this moment. The lied to me about giving me a refund, they did the negotiations with Chase but they knew I had more than 3 months reserve in my checking account and that my payment was only 18% of my income. Your mortage payment is supposed to be lore than 31% of your net income. They told me not to mention my savings account. They still took my money and said that I would qualify. They said I had expenses to back me up. I did not know the guidelines, only now I am doing so much research I find out they lied to me. The ratios we did today on the phone show that doing the basic simple math it is clear that I don't have a hardship. I only qualify for a traditional refinance. I know another person that is also working with them and she has a similar story, except she has a real big hardship and they just stole her money. They did nothing for her, she is now negotiating with Bank of America on her own, they never returned her calls about her refund either. I met her because Elisabeth Burch from Phillips Law Center emailed me by mistake, she and I have the same first name. We started to talk and figure it out we were victims of a scam. They lie to people on the phone, very persuasive, they told me I would not know the best way to deal with the bank and they were experts, they said 3,000 was not much because it would cost me about the same at the bank. I did not check with the bank if that was true,only to find out now that it would have costed me NOTHING to go to Chase and apply it myself. After I decided to trust them, they seemed very helpful and nice, I just waited and hoped for the great results they promised me. The said they were 99% sure it would be a success when we spoke the first week after reviewing all my information. Than they asked me for $2,995 check in advance and asked me to sign a contract. I don't know if they even have a license to operate in NJ since their address is in CA. THE CONTRACT SAYS that you waive any rights to go to court so now I can't even do that! I wanted to go to small claims court here in NJ but I heard from a lawyer that I would waste my time because they have no assets in NJ. Maybe the contract is not even valid here in NJ.

The offices of Phillips Law Center are located in Costa Mesa, CA in a multi-tenant property. There is no marquee on the property, and no company signs were present on the door or in the building. The main office is a call Center with cubicles, and five private offices are occupied by Brent Phillips (Attorney at Law), Robert Newton (Resolution Manager) and several generic managers. The marketing consultant, Anthony Terah, does not have an office on-site. Two separate interviews were conducted with company representatives:  The first was with Robert Newton and Anthony Terah, and was followed by a second interview with Brent Phillips. Per Brent Phillips, (the purported namesake of the company) his office relocated from Newport Beach, CA in October of 2012. Phillips Law Center (or PLC) has no relation to Phillips Professional Law Corporation, which is a California corporation with separate offices. Although Farmer’s Law Center and Forest Law are both names that complainants have attributed to Brent’s business, he states that the name “Farmer’s Law Center” was a domain name created by a former employee that they never used (he thought the name was cheesy), and confirmed that they have never had any association with a Forest Law Center. According to Brent Phillips, his business is an Arizona corporation that does general litigation and foreclosure prevention, although there is no restructuring available in California because it is against the law to take advanced fees for Mortgage Restructuring in that state. This is a federal law, and is referred to as the Mars rule. There is an exception if you are a licensed attorney in the state and the fees have to be deposited in an attorney/client trust fund in uniformity with that states rule of responsibility. Brent is licensed in CA, AZ, and MD and has attorneys working for him in other states that work on the specific mortgage restructuring. According to Anthony Terah, leads are obtained by purchasing data and information from credit bureaus such as Experian and Equifax, and then a “legal ad” is sent to the potential client via regular mail. Per both Brent and Anthony, when a potential client calls in, “The needs of the client are evaluated, as there are many factors to determine, like when the home is purchased, the debt to income ratio, loan to value of the home and any personal hardships.” Mr. Phillips reviews the files before a client is taken on. If the client agrees to work with them, funds are deposited into a trust account in uniformity with the state rules. Mr. Phillips and Mr. Terah had consistent responses when they were asked about the typical experience a client receives with their company.  Mr. Phillips made it clear that “No experience is typical. A lot of it’s just financial, and it’s a lot like doing your taxes or bankruptcy, it’s not greater legal theory. We hone the financials, draft the appropriate hardship letters. Those are sent out (to the potential clients); they call in and speak with an intake agent. Intake agents are directed to qualify the client, not waste time. You can figure it out in ten minutes, by asking key questions. Then someone senior reviews it and it if is something that meets the criteria set out, or if there are questions, they call me right away. If the file meets criteria, we’ll have them sign a retainer, I’ll review it, and once I approve it the processing begins. The client sends in documents, and if they do not send in the complete documents, more time goes by. Also, Lenders are not as diligent about the restructuring in the loss mitigation room as they are in making new loans. In loss mitigation, they are losing money; on the other end, they’re making money. Restructuring is not their top priority.” This can often cause delays in the restructuring process. In regard to complaint resolution, Mr. Phillip’s gave the following example to illustrate how he deals with complaints: “One gentleman we accepted looked good initially. We started drilling into it, uncovered some factors that didn’t look so good. We called him, and told him the issues we saw, asked if he would like us to proceed even though it is a bit of a difficult file. If you want us to proceed, we’d be more than happy to submit your file, or it’s ok – if you would like us to cancel we will send your money back. He chose to have his money sent back. Plenty of other clients with a similar scenario want to proceed.” When asked how the client reacted, Brent responded: “Clients who are dealing with financial hardship are only as happy as they allow themselves to be. There are less than one percent who are not happy with their outcome.” Brent feels that he creates more friends and positive outcomes than the few that insist on being dissatisfied no matter what service is given.“As long as you disclose the problems in the file, it’s up to the client to make the decision. Many times they don’t have other options, they are in a bad loan, and they are upside down. For instance, they are not a Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae loan where they have a Harp loan that allows for negative equity. There is a protocol, homes affordable refinance program, which allows people with negative equity up to any amount to refinance. No other lender has that program. You go anywhere else, you generally need 20% equity. There has been a precipitous drop in home values.” Brent said he will sometimes charge the client half for services, and tell the client that if they are successful, he will charge the other half. The retainer that the client signs at the beginning of the process states what they will be doing, and they acknowledge that they have no guarantees. In the last six months, they have started recording interviews.  People hear what they want to hear, and we now have a recorded interview where they were told and acknowledge that there are no guarantees.” Anthony Terah’s approach to explaining complaint resolution was more specific about the process. He said that all accounts are updated every fourteen days in a system that the clients can see, and that all calls are returned within 24-48 hours. Because each processor handles around 155 files a piece, they do their best to accommodate the clients; however, they have assigned one person to specifically monitor all communications for all files to make sure calls are returned. If a complaint cannot be resolved by the processing staff, resolution manager Robert Newton speaks to them.  In some cases, Newton will refer cases on to Mr. Phillips to deal with personally. “We always settle in a way that is amicable,” says Newton.” If a client is not happy, they are referred to speak with the attorney assigned to their state.Brent explains that there are a number of factors that will affect results: besides the loan companies, clients are not always compliant. “We get great results. I’ve probably had 5,000 clients over the years, but you’re going to have the 1%. I understand. People, when they don’t achieve the results they desire, they complain. And the unfortunate part is, people you get results for, they never write anything. I’m not saying every file we have worked on has been perfect, no business can say that. But we send them their money back. We’ve given refunds because people complain or there are cancellations. So we try to do our best, to get what I think is fair. Simply because they didn’t get a good result, we still give them something back so they don’t leave on a bad note.”Brent and his representatives, in separate interviews, were asked about their responses to the specific complaints on Ripoff Report by former clients who claimed they were forced into foreclosure because of bad advice, or they were charged for services they did not receive. Mr. Phillips was very adamant in his response: “No one is forced into foreclosure! No one told them not to make their payments.” Mr. Phillips explained that with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loans, the process is straightforward, but if someone has a “Harper” loan, (which he describes as the high-interest loans that caused the mortgage bubble to break) they have negative equity.

(I say S. cause I don't know how to spell his name).  He reassured me that because I was a citizen that everything should go smoothly.  I will need to pay an initial fee to get the process started, $300 to begin the paperwork to look for an I-94 and $250 towards a $500 attorney's fee.  After paying that off, I didn't hear from this attorney for 3 months.  I called and asked for him and was told that he had left the company and that my case had been transferred to a Patricia Barbie who was over the immigration department.  In January 2011, I went in and had an interview with immigration lawyer Noel Suniga through Skype or Telecam.  He said he was in a Dallas office and initially I had to start all over with my case.  (What happened with my initial fee? I don't know.)  They had me fill out a new contract and was told that this will now cost me a total of $4,190 to accomplish this.  I needed to pay them $2,700 by the time I had an interview with Immigration.  I had to pay $500 to get started (again).  So back to square one.  At this point, 2 months went by, I never heard from them for anything.  I went into the Bedford office and asked for my attorney.  I was told that they didn't have any of my information and that I had to fill out another application and contract.  Through the whole year of 2011, I dealt with a secretary or assistant name Vanessa and Christine both very very rude and short with me.  When I asked for my refund Christine would advise me to call back and speak to Noel Suniga.  I was so frustrated with their inability to accomplish anything on my case.  At this point 2012 rolled along and I still demanded for my $500 refund for service they never rendered that I paid to them. Then Noel Suniga called me back and asked (no begged) me to please hang in there with them and that we will be able to accomplish everything this year and if I was to get a refund now then I would have to start all over again. I felt his sincerity that I decided to hang in there with them and was told to continue to pay towards my balance of $2,700 before the immigration interview.  In February 2012, I being a sucker paid $500.  Then in March 2012, I paid another $500 towards my balance.  In April 2012 paid $440 towards my balance and dug up another $60 towards my balance...a total of $1,700.  I was told in May that I will have to find a co-sponsor because I don't make enough money.  I told them well I wasn't told that when I began payment towards my balance.  In June 2012, I called Christine and she specifically told me that they will not do any paperwork until I find a co-sponsor.  In August, I was so tired and fed up with their lies and nothing done that I asked for my refund and this time I wasn't turning back.  I called Christine several times and their office and was told that my attorney Noel Suniga was on vacation.  I asked specifically when will he be back from vacation and I was told to call back next month.  I called back September and asked for my attorney again and was given the same run around answer.  I then called and asked to speak to someone in HR because I wanted an answer about my refund.  I was then referred to Vickie Davis the manager of HR.  She specifically told me that my attorney was fired.  I told her that I was told he was on vacation for a whole month and wasted all my time calling.  I demanded that I have my refund for work that was never rendered.  She promised me that she will definitely get back to me and that she will take care of everything.  She even apologized for the way I was treated.  After a two weeks later of not hearing from her, I called her and left messages. She never returned my call about my refund.  In the end of September, I decided to go directly to the Bedford office and see if someone can get me in touch with Vickie Davis.  The receptionist called her and I was told that the person I need to speak to is Craig Pepper, he was her boss.  I called him up and left a message on his voicemail.  A day went by and no answer back from this person.  I called him again and he finally answered, he was very short with me and asked me what did I want.  I explained to him my dilemma in trying to retrieve my money back since they didn't do anything to my case.  He was very rude and sounded like he was so annoyed that I was asking for my money back.  He said that he can't just take my word for it, but he will talk to the immigration department and will return my call.  He called two days later and told me that he spoke to the immigration department and Christine told him that they did all the paperwork and that I will not be getting my $1,700 back.  I told him that when I spoke with Noel and Christine, they assured me that no paperwork will be done until after I find a co-sponsor.  This man Craig Pepper was so rude to me and interrupted every word that I said and told me that they already processed all the paperwork.  *BEWARE* of this company, they want to take your money for free and not do any work to show for it.

So Jan 2012 I had to retain another lawyer to finish my case.  Internet","										I retained Gordon Nicol as my lawyer during my divorce/custody  July 8th 2010 . Gordon charged me $4500.00 a flat fee. As of today I am still married and my husband is not paying child support. During the beginning of the process 2 years ago I asked Gordon's employees Mya and Adin over the phone if they could file  temporary relief while we wait for the  custody date. They told me I had to wait till the the divorce is final before they could file any relief. However we do go to mediation November  2011. That was a waste of time, when my husband was told he had to pay support of $300.00 he said he wanted to go to court. Now Gordon said if I want to retain him again for him to be my lawyer for trial I would have to pay another 5,000.00. I can't afford my rent,  how am I going to pay him another $5,000.00 when he already has $4500.00 of my money and has nothing to show for it. He has done absolutely nothing for me.I retained him in good faith that he would take my side and help me thru my divorce. He has not shown me anything in writing where my money has gone. So as of now I had no other choice but to find another lawyer. Lee Pickett is my new lawyer and he's great. Mr. Pickett called Gordon to see if he could get my file and Gordon refused to hand it over. I don't understand why he will not let Mr. Pickett get the file. There is no reason for Gordon to have my file . I feel like Gordon Nicol did not full fill his part of the contract.  So I would like this complaint to be addressed with him. I feel it's right that Gordon give me half of my money back. There is no reason for me to still be married 2 years later. He took my money and I received nothing in return. He is a fraud and is only out for money.									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

 Pardons Canada ,"  Pardons Canada  45 St. Clair W., Ste 901 Internet United States of America ",www.pardons.org, ,"Pardons Canada  Pardons Canada is an organization that assists individuals in removing a past criminal offence, Internet","										During Jan, 2011, when trying to get a pardon for an offense i committed in 2000, I looked online to see where to start. I found Pardons Canada, from the website and thier statement ""Pardons Canada is a Federal non-profit organization that assists individuals in removing a past criminal offence from public record"" When i saw the website I was sure i was dealing with a firm that could help me. Honestly by the way things read they were a government service.  For $500.00, they would clear my criminal record in two years or for $650, they could clear my record in one year. So in Feb 2011 I paid them the $644.A month later, i recieved a package that they needed me to gather info, so they could start. They needed me to have my fingerprints done ($70) once this was done they would froward this to the RCMP for a criminal check. They also wanted me to do a local police check. Since the crim took place in a different town I live in, they wanted a police check in both towns.($30 each). Since the crime had taken place 10 yrs ealier in the other town, the police department did it, but laughed as I had no more records thier and it was a waste of time. All this running around was my time and money which i figured should have been payed by pardons canada, after all what was i paying them to do.I had all this info to them by April 2011, i had not heard a thing from them in 4 months. When i called thier 800 number i got voice mail, when i tried to e-mail them i recieved an e-mail that said if i hav any questions to fill out a form online (there fore there would be no e-mail trail, i assume).Finally in October 2011, i recieved a request in the mail from them asking for the Pardons Board fee, claiming that would be another $150.00. I finally got to speak to someone and asked why the $150 is not mentioned up front when I paid the first $650. They said that it is just the way it is. They took my $150 payment oout Nov 2011.In April 2012, I had not heard anything so i filled out an online request. They e-mailed me,""Your Pardon is currently with the Parole Board of Canada for final review and granting of the Pardon. Should you wish to follow up with them to see what the delay is you can contact them at 1-800-874-2652 Ext. 5"".Once again I guees it was up to me to follow up. So I called the Parole Board, and they had told me they had recieved the paperwork Jan 23,2012. They told me it would take 1-2years to process.I have since called my Member of Parliment and have been informed that yes it takes 1-2 years for the Parole Board to process. My MP also informed me that no one should use a company such as Pardons Canada as they can not speed up the process. If the MP's office has forms that you can fill out your self to apply for the pardon on your own.This company implies they will get your pardon, when they infact are not the ones that issue you a pardon and as you can see from my notes( and others that did the same thing) they do not even do anything that would warrant $600. Since this has happened the Parole Board now wanted $600 for the fee, does that mean Pardons Canada will want thier $600 and then $600 later to pay the parole board.I really want my money back as they have done nothing for me. If there is a class action lawsuit out their i would like to know about it. I was mislead from the beginning, I paid $120 more than thier non-urgent fee, and nothing happened quickly. I was lead to believe they would collect what was needed to put the Pardon together, and using the words Federal, made it sound like they were part of the governemnt. They have my money, and yes now my assingnment is waiting to be heard by Parole Board, and Pardons Canada is done with me, I do not have my Pardon, they should not have my money. They should not be allowed to do what they do and promise what they promise.Again, I would love to be involved in a class action lawsuit, I am waiting for this pardon to seek employment, they have cost me money.

Well for starters my nameis wendy and I am 24 years of age. How my situation began was i just gave birth to a baby girl that i named Madison on April 29, 2012 , who is now 5 months old. My adoptive mother who adopted me when i was young, but is not thebiological grandmother to my child was given temporary custody over my child immediately after i gave birth. However this is not a woman i view as safe by any means, she legally adopted me when i was young but was also very abusivephysically towards me growing up, along with my adoptive family and my adoptive mothers friends to whom i was abused by sexually at the ages of 3-8. Right now I am trying to get my five month old away from this her and its been very hard.Due to the way i was treated as an adopted child myself as i mentioned my adoptive mother treated me harshly, i fear now for my daughters safety. I'll explain how she got temporary custody. my adoptive mother and i have not hadany contact with each other going for 6 years. after i graduated in 2006 around 17 or 18 and did some college i moved away from her in philadelphia to go to california because i was tired of my adoptive mother and adopted familymistreating me. She now contacts me 6 years later this past January because she heard i was about to give birth to my first child , she even apologized to me for all the horrible things shes done to me as a child through my teens. so sherequested that i travel from california to new york being that new york was close to her where she lives in philadelphia &for me to give birth to my child close to her. i was very skeptical because this was the same woman who her and her family mistreated me growing up, but i thought that people would change. and she lied however setting me up. I ended up traveling 3000 miles on the greyhound bus and when i finally arrived to new york my adoptive mother never showed i called her and she didnt want to make any arrangements on where i was supposed to go. she left me nine months pregnant in the streets. and this wasnt the first time she has done this , when i was younger after being abused, so she wouldnt deal with getting into trouble by the law if i was to tell on her , she usually threw me out so i wouldnt be around to speak up against her.Due to traveling so far and in the condition that i was in ,not being able to get back to california and nine months pregnant, i asked a maternity house to help me in my travels. the way i got treated by this maternity house after ileft the city to head towards spring valley new york and Westchester new york was very horribly. it was a home for pregnant women. two ladies bullied me requesting that i leave and why was i there if i had enough money to get fromcalifornia to new york when they didnt have much of any they said. i even had my education thrown in my face with two of the mothers stating since i have a diploma and college experience , then what was i doing there with them. when iaddressed it to the staff of the place they did nothing about it and ignored and the two females continued with their pestering. the room i slept in they would play on the door turning the knob back and forth and also opened mybedroom door a few times. i told the staff again and they said that i comes off like i think that im better. i immediately then asked to speak to a higher authority to report the staff for not doing anything  that i would like to speak to their chairman.Immediately when i requested that, instead of answering my need the worker present got on the phone called an ambulance and had me escorted to a hospital.i didnt understand what the logic was or what was in common with what i was looking for by me going to a hospital. i thought i was getting checked out due to being nine months pregnant. Instead the maternity house had me escorted to a mental institution and lied and said that i was causing trouble at their maternity home. The hospital then called the maternity home who was told to pick me up from the hospital and the lady i threatened to report to her chairman refused to come. i ended up staying in the institution for 4 weeks because they said they couldnt let me leave unless i had somewhere to go. once they told me to leave i returned to the maternity home to retrieve my things and they took me to a different maternity house, as soon as i got there , they got on the phone again and had me escorted to a whole new hospital because i told them that i would still report them for not handling the inside of the home and for defamation of character by trying to make it appear like there was something wrong with me because they didnt want to get into trouble. the 2nd house then took me to another hospital to where i was held another 4 weeks until i went into labor they released me. when i gave birth to my child due to not having nowhere to go cps was immediately called to my delivery room. i tried to explain to them that i lived i california and my adoptive mother had requested that i traveled because she wanted to rekindle a relationship with me after my not feeling safe with talking to her for 6 years, but that she lied to me and never showed up. i explained that she wasnt a good parent and does lie alot but i believed her and came anyways. cps basically said if my adoptive mother was the one to ask me to come the least she couldve did was make arrangements and i wouldnt be in this situation and then on top of that had to go to two maternity houses that had me falsely hospitalized as means to cover themselves, for the things that was going on in their homes. when cps seen that documented not only did my adoptive mother messed me up but so did the two maternity houses and i was trying to explain to cps that there is nothing wrong with me and my adopted mother lied as well. Because of the whole situation when it came time for my daughter to have somewhere to go while i was traveling they called my adoptive mother and asked her if she can temporary watch my baby until i see if im going to stay or fly back home then i would have to fight for custody after. and i didnt understand she couldnt come through for me in the beginning, but when it came time to take my baby she came for that and i think shes a sick twisted woman. shes desperate for children when she was a foster parent when i was young that didnt go well. in addition i was adopted by her and i was mistreated by her and my adoptive family and now shes trying to take my baby away. she even went along with the story with the two maternity houses saying theres something wrong with me when there wasnt. im now considering suing my adoptive mother for defamation of character, emotional distress, and the two maternity houses i traveled to. i decided to stay in new york now with my fiance rather than go back to california. we are both in court working on gaining custody of my daughter to which my adoptive mother only has temporary custody over. and after i will continue to stay away from her shes done this before not just with me but other foster children when she does wrong she tries to persuade people that theres something wrong with the kids in her home, to make it look like we have the problems and not her. my mistake is that as a child to my teens i didnt speak up and sometimes my adoptive mother told me not to which she then had me being looked at like there was something wrong with me ;with her manipulating the system. i know not to travel for her ever again after this horrific experience, she even put two false police reports against me when i was younger after she physicaly attacked me stating that i had hit her first when i actually only pushed her off of me on one occasion inself-defense when she was abusing me as a child and shes now using that past information by saying ive only been arrested twice in my life to keep my child. my fiance works with the nassau county fire department and police department &we have now been going to court to get my baby back from adoptive mom. To bring things in closure i read a website on situations like these and was toldto contact my local county board, state legislators& lawyers, i should get my child away from her soon though and will be suing these people ive met in my travels. My adoptive mother even said that shes not trying to keep my baby butbefore i was pregnant , she was calling 24/7 to apologize for all the bad things shes done to me by trying to lure me in. after she lied and took my child now the phone calls have stopped she lied the courts to where my child is, saying that my child is at her house. however my adopted mother is a lesbian& has been hiding my child away at her girlfriends to whom i dont have no idea where the woman resides. my fiance & i are trying to fight for custody of my child and my adoptive mother even withdrew her petition so she wouldnt have to ever come new york ever again after hearing that we are fighting to get our daughter back. My adoptive mother has always been a evil person mistreated me when i was adopted by her and will do anything desperate to have children even if it has to do with luring me in like she did byapologizing for all the mistreatment ,just to get close to take my child away from me.Furthermore i feel that cps did their assesment wrong rather than investigate due to the two girls bullying me at the maternity houses because iargued back with them stating i was going to report them cps wrote that as me being a violent troublemaker, yet it doesnt make sense im 9 months pregnant when i was the one being attacked and due to my adoptive mother not showing up who use to abuse me when i was young, they wrote it as me and my child not having a place. But yet i live with my fiance. I feel that im having injustice done to me for other peoples actions that are trying to cover themselves forthere wrongs and i need immediate advocacy. I also dont feel that due to other individuals lack of care and  irresponsibilities to where i had to advocate for myself when it came to the good counsel maternity house and my adoptive mother was any reason to take my child away. i did nothing wrong to my baby and never even been around my child, my child was taken from me right from the delivery room. the hospital i gave birth in westchester medical center even falsely represented me i had gotten up a few times to use their phone to get ahold of my fiance due to my cell not working and they told cps that me getting up was considered stange behavior.The only time anthing physical ever happened was before i gave birth when my baby wasnt even in the world yet. the maternity house that lied having me falsely institutionalized after i threatened to report them for how they did nothing about the bullying . when i was at the institution i tried to explain to the staff how i was being falsely held there, a few of the workers ignored. i then started writing letters to the board of the hospital explaining my position and the more i did that the workers didnt want to get involved with me. one of the patients reacted to me filing a complaint due to them saying they were friends with the staff members. when that patient reacted and got mad about it me standing for myself they told and atleast 5 of the workers came over and began grabbing me and mind you im pregnant. they said that due to that patient being upset that it was considered as me being a bother. i was very much nine months pregnant they were tackling me very hard to the floor and i kept shouting to them that im not doing anything and stop im pregnant and that they were very much hurting me. when i held onto on the staffs hair to get her to let me go when i got discharged from the hospital ,that staff said she wanted to file charges against me saying that her hair got intentionally pulled. i spoke to a detective explaining how these individals were grabbing me and even ignored me alot when i start writing letters to the board and i was told by the detective not to worry about anything and that nothing bad was going to happen. the detective basically made me feel like i fell trapped into a bad situation with people that only protected themselves and the more i kept speaking up of their misconduct the more trouble it only caused for me. however i dont think that these situations involving other people with myself was no reason to take my baby away, i never did anything wrong to my child.",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Niemela  He's a scam artist and steals from his clients while doing nothing to help them with their case except charge them fees at absurd hourly rates Vancouver, British Columbia","										Glenn John Niemela claims to to be an attorney specializing in civil and commercial litigations. However what He really specializes in is scamming people. He's a professional crook and he should be in jail.Here is a list: charging clients (friends of mine) ridiculous amounts of overages in fees, overtime charges for when his secretary works after hours, photocopies at .50 cent a page and make 2500 copies, charge you every time he makes a call and doesn't get a hold of you and keep doing so until he's racked up 3 hrs of attempted phone calls at 350$ per hour. He claims to do ""Legal searches"" but doesn't even bring the case to court. I am talking Federal court case amounts. Hundreds of thousands of dollars taken and no one knows where it goes.He also purposefully mis calculates hours which he ends up charging several thousand dollars more than he should and his clients never get their money back. I've looked up his history. Niemela has done this every time to previous clients and I'm pissed that he's getting away with it still.  He has 23 of his own personal cases where he's been charged for not paying credit institutions, banks and other business institutions, his own mortgage, car and fails to report taxes and not claiming what he charges in taxes to his clients. He's a thief and a crook! He's steals from innocent people he vows to help and steals from the Government without a second thought about the consequences.Any contract or agreement to charge his rates he adds a clause saying he's allowed to increase his hourly rate at any given time and if you don't pay he will immediately stop working with you. This is total thievery. Honestly, Niemela makes me sick to my stomach. He knows exactly what he's doing. Once he steals from you, you'll never be able to get a hold of him except for his secretary who will tell you he's not in his office or in a business meeting. You may leave a voicemail but there's no point as you'll never hear from him again.He's ignored his court hearing dates, the BC Law Society, CRA, any trials against him and the judgements made against him are pretty much a worthless piece of paper because he hasn't paid what he owes to anyone. DO NOT sign any contracts to hire any services from Glenn J. Niemela as he's committed fraud and has a history of stealing his clients money and premeditatedly does so without any guilt or care in the world for anyone but HIMSELF. He should be stripped of his title as an attorney at law as he defiles the system and the profession used to help others to help himself. For a man getting away with violating every law and not doing his due diligence to the clients he represents Niemela should be removed from his so called profession. I SERIOUSLY advise working with Glenn Niemela. He's the last person anyone should choose to represent them in any matter. I wish I had known so my friends didn't get robbed by him. After 4 years, they are still fighting to get their money back. He's a crook and he knows it.I hope you find this information helpful and save yourself the trouble of being robbed by this terrible person.Spread the word.

 LegalMatch.com ,"  LegalMatch.com    Internet United States of America ",legalmatch.com, ,LegalMatch.com Postacase.com  Scam Company Internet,"										I used this legalmatch.com after finding no one in the Portland, Oregon area to take my case. I went to an attorney who evaluated and assessed the damages in my case and stated that I had a very good case and the damages easily exceed in the millions if not more if proper attention and an investigation is done. In sum, I thought it was my approach as to how I was seeking legal assistance and representation. But, it was not. I would give a simple, one or two line summary. Then, after speaking with other attorneys, they stated that it was not the summary as it was not many Portland, Oregon attorneys really want to take the tough cases and I may have to go to Seattle or other places to seek good representation. Most attorney stated they were not taking new clients or simply their plates were full. In a nutshell, after posting my case on legalmatch.com after one day my case was deactivated and deleted. I did not know why. I read the policies and thought maybe I violated some policy but I did not. This is a scam company. I am a real client with substantial damages who needs legal representation for my daughter and I. Time is of the essence in bringing a lawsuit and this company wastes clients and attorneys time. The summary I posted is below. To date, I have not obtained legal representation. If anyone knows of an attorney who identifies to what is occurring in my case and is willing to take on this case, please let me know. I have contacted the Department of Homeland Security and other governmental agencies and made the proper administrative complaints. No one believes me.Summary posted on Legalmatch.com: There was a CPS case where my daughter was removed from my custody. The allegations were false; yet, the allegations were provided by an unnamed federal government agent who CPS refused to identify. Later when the allegations were proven to be false, the case was dismissed. Before the case was dismissed, I was made to undergo mental health evaluations that pegged me crazy. The court & others felt I was mentally unstable because I complained of being stalked & harassed by hate groups and militia groups approx. 2 years ago in Illinois. During that time, my ex-husband (who I have not seen since 1999 and not contacted since 1999) was arrested and charged in another state (Texas) for molesting his two daughters & his step-daughter. His ex-wife began complaining about being stalked by hate groups and militia groups. Texas believed them & issued a restraining order/stay away order against my ex-husband. Oregon did not believe me and the allegations made by the federal government agent were taken as true and I was deemed mentally ill. The case was later dismissed after the information on my ex-husband was found to be true. CPS quickly dismissed the case and my daughter was returned to me without regard to this information. My family & I have been threatened to not say anything & others involved were told not to say anything about what has occurred. CPS refuses to disclose who provided false information about me. This false information is very specific and I do not have the room to fit it into this posting box. Note: the fact that someone else has complained about being stalked and harassed by hate groups/militia groups and this other person is my ex-husband's ex-wife (who I do not know) and she complained approx. 2-3 years after I complained to authorities about similar issue is proof of my stability. In her case, the Texas court believed her and instituted a restraining order. This is information that was not new but Oregon CPS knew and ignored. This is actual proof of my sanity and that more is going on here than what is presented here. I have tons of evidence to support my claims, including a 2008 false letter sent to me via certified U.S. mail written by someone who now states she did not write this letter but someone else in her office did so (while I resided in another state). This letter was generated to area law enforcement agencies in another state and this information was used as a basis in the Oregon CPS action. I also have evidence of property damage to my vehicle and home when I resided in another state and identity theft to prove that I have been stalked and harassed. I also have a detailed timeline setting forth key events that have occurred in this matter showing a pattern & practice of very clear acts committed against my daughter and I. It is a matter of damages: including being involuntarily committed, loss of pay/job, loss of opportunities, loss of support, emotional distress, mental injuries, side effects of meds from the involuntary commitment, property damage, my potential for gainful employment has been diminished, threats, life endangerment, etc. These actions span over a period of at least 10 years or more (possibly 30 years if an investigation is done on the involvement of others such as my ex-husband, my father, & others connected to this, since my ex-husband's ex-wife made similar allegations on these same people and connections). I am single parent, black, lesbian, I possess a JD & I have been unable to gain licensure because of the false allegations and involuntary commitment. These things caused issues for my moral fitness and character. I have been unable to find suitable representation in Portland. I have a detailed outline available to the attorney that will take this case. It details times, dates, locations, and incriminating evidence of police misconduct/CPS and others, identities of the hate group members, witness identities and statements, etc. It can be made available via Mediafire for confidentiality.

He admitted that he was ""too busy"" to do the paperwork on time and offered to send a refund of the paid amount (not including and court fees). I asked him to send me the refund and the paperwork that was done so that I may find a better suited lawyer for this issue. He agreed.Nothing was ever sent. I kept contacting him for weeks asking for my paperwork and the refund. And even went to his office address, which doesn't exist!After two months he finally replied that he has NOT sent it.But he will by the end of the week.We have yet to receive anything from this scam of a lawyer.

MANCHESTER, New Hampshire","										THIS IS A COPY OF THE ACTUAL COMPLAINT LETTER TO THE NEW HAMPSHIRE SUPREME COURT, THE ATTORNEY DISCIPLINE DIVISION WHICH EXPLAINS EVERYTHING ! October 4, 2012New Hampshire Supreme CourtAttorney Discipline Office4 Chenell Drive, Suite 102Concord, Nh 03301Phone: (603) 224-5828      To whom this letter may concern,I am filing a complaint with your office regarding a recent and unethical treatment I received by an attorney named Edward  W. Stewart, Jr. with the law firm Shaheen & Gordon, P.A., 80 Merrimack street, Manchester, Nh 03103, phone number (603) 669-8080.To try and be brief, I was hurt at work on June 27th, 2012 and was given the run around by the insurance company who kept asking me to do leg work for them in order for them to pay worker's compensation while I was out of work. I fulfilled their wishes on two different occasions and after being led a wild goose chase getting the documents they needed over a two month period, they subsequently denied paying the claim without just cause. It was at this time I went online to inquire the help of an experienced attorney and found the site for Shaheen & Gordon and made an appointment to see Edward W. Stewart, Jr. to discuss the case. He and I met at his office. Mr. Stewart asked me to obtain all of my hospital records and bring them to him.I was advised by Edward Stewart Jr.,  I would need a better letter ( which he wrote for me to give to the my doctor) which stated the doctors opinion above and beyond what she already checked off on the workers compensation form stating my injury was due to my job function at work.I made another trip back to the doctor who wrote a letter on my behalf, explaining her position once again, describing my work being the cause or most likely the cause, as she was not there to see the injury take place.The same week I had been  referred to a surgeon for possible need of surgery and was asked by Ed Stewart Jr. to obtain a workers compensation form from the surgeon as well, showing his position and thoughts into the injury which I also brought to the attorney. This was on Friday , September 28th, 2012 .  I hand delivered the documents he needed to expedite the  situation due to being out of work without income for well over two months and facing possible eviction without a place to live.  The attorney was well aware of the dire situation I was facing because of a dishonest insurance company , only buying time hoping I would just go away.The attorney was not available at the time I delivered these documents, so I left a short letter with the two documents he needed, and asked in the letter to contact me on Monday when he was back in the office.To my dismay, I did not hear back from Mr. Stewart until Thursday, after leaving more messages by phone, asking for a return call.I finally heard from Mr. Stewart who was very monotone with me, after I answered the phone, as if a family member just died. I did not hear any type of reinforcement or support what so ever about the case at the start of our conversation and felt like everything he asked me to get for him for the case would have had a more positive response, especially after having to wait almost a week to even hear back from him.I asked him on the phone if I was correct in sensing there was a problem or something missing he needed before requesting a hearing at the labor board, to go forward. He told me the doctors letter  was not word for word like he wrote it and then he advised me to get an additional letter from the surgeon I went to see, in addition to the workers comp form he already filled out on my -2-behalf which I felt was out of line since considering  I could have got that while I was at the appointment. I had,  at that point,  asked why he was not being a little more positive about the case and he said,  insulting my intelligence, he thought I had a poor attitude , based on my concern,, about his lack of concern on the case.It was at this point, after I questioned his position, he told me, he was very busy and explained this is why it took him a week to get back to me and it was due to backed up cases from months prior and even if I requested an expedited hearing,  like we talked about,  after the first two meetings, he would be too busy to appear anyway, and most likely not be able to appear for at least 2 months !!This infuriated me,  after I had just got the run around from the insurance company, now I'm being misled by this attorney, who had to have known he was too busy to take the case from the start,  if he was claiming he had cases preventing him to representing me at a hearing at the labor board in Concord for more than 2 months !  I expressed my disappointment after just feeling better, having an attorney, who would be there for me, based on everything I already went through with the insurance company. Instead of being professional and understanding of my disappointment, he thought it would be better to try and insult me and told me there was never a written agreement and I should have never assumed he was even taking the case !I feel this was an extremely unprofessional and unethical treatment on the attorney's part and hope by this letter, especially if this has been a pattern of conduct  by this attorney, which may be on record somewhere, this will be added to an existing file where if his continues showing disregard for the public, disciplinary action may be taken by your division over seeing  these unprofessional attorneys.I am so distraught over this, as I am now back in the same position, still without representation,  still facing eviction.  I am forwarding a copy of this letter to the Better Business Bureau and to multiple consumer complaint  websites to inform the public of his thoughtless and unethical practices.Lastly, if you could give any advise as to an obtaining a reputable and professional attorney who specializes in cases such as my own, please  email me with an attorney's name is possible,  who I can contact about my case.  Thank you for your valued time and I appreciate your understanding in this matter.

He listened to my case via the telephone and instructed me to forward to him everything that I had on my case. He promised to call me the following week. My case involves possibly filing suit against another attorney up in Blue Ridge, whom he said he new. He mentioned that it wouldn't be good business for him to go after another attorney in their area, but he would find me attorney outside of the area. The following week came, no call, so I called and spoke with the secretary requesting a call back. She said she gave him the message. I never received a return call. I made subsequent calls to his office and I got a voice message everytime. Having left a couple of messages and receiving no return phone call, I gave up. What's concerning is that I forwarded all my private case information to his office.It's my hope that he has not shared this information with the attorney I may be filing suit against. Had he simply called me back and said he could not help or assist, I would have been ok with that. To ignore a consumers call and leave them wondering is not right. Consumers need to be aware of this type of professionalism that out there, I've had nothing but bad experiences with attornies in the Blue Ridge, GA area.

If you want to call and chase a business to do what you paid for use them!! Otherwise stay away Las Vegas, Nevada","										Simply my main complaint aside from the overselling and overcharging which should be expected with these guys is that I paid for legal and paralegal services that they have yet to complete months later. I have worked with them for about 7 years. It's always been challenging. They are salesmen end of story. The product are things you can find elsewhere. I had opened one S corp , 1 C corp , 2 llc and 3 land trusts with them. I've used their tax service which  is the only good service they offer. I have used their virtual office and nominee services. I had referred people until 2 years go when thy started getting shady with me. Ive paid for many of their services and referred people.The only reason I mention the above is to convey that I have a long standing history and am not a one time client who maybe misunderstood the agreement. Nope I requested legal services knowing the difficulties and addressed them up front. I was promised and assured there would be no problems. In short I have been chasing them for months calling every day. I speak with Jolene the receptionist more than the people who are supposed to be doing the work. For a long time client to be on this forum think how they will treat you the new guy.NSCN is a used car lot. Like used car lots they have cars that work kinda. And depending on your negotiation skills you can pay more for than what is fair or realistic.  They WILL oversell you in price and services. It's what they are supposed to do. My first sales person was Kim. She was simply unprofessional and not too bright despite all the salesmen ship from everyone there saying she is a high volume top agent. SoI asked for another. They gave me Willis Paul McCravey. Nice guy but still a salesman. As long as you know that you will have a head start. He promised me Russ Tornby "" the lawyer"" would provide the services I needed with a problem. He conferred with Russ prior and then I purchased the services. Needless to say that I haven't received the work yet 6 months later. The work takes about 3 weeks tops for everything. The pecking order there is Mr. Zapper the owner. Don't expect to talk to him. I've tried for 3 months. His wife Susan I haven't bothered to contact.  Brent Carlson is the main manager. Sean Olson is another manager below brent. Then you've got our main points of contact the used car salesmen. You want a service you HAVE to go through them.  So in the past if something went wrong I just had to make some noise and complain to Sean or Brent. And things would eventually get worked out. Mind you i hate doing that. If you pay for a service it should get done without a fight. So troubles getting things done there is a norm. I could regale you with the stories of ineptness and incompetence that I have had to endure with  these guys for the last 7 years. Suffice it to say they hire from the bottom of the barrel. So yes I knew the issues here but it's is different evidently Russell Tornby was there during the inception of this company and despite my half year of complaining and calling and rarely being called back long with the many tiered assurances that things would change or go smoother nothing has. Why? Because Russ doesn't answer to none but Me. Zapper who is more difficult to get on the phone than God. Yes all the henchmen that work there chime on bout how he cares about customer service but it's all lip service. If he had he would have been able to find 10 minutes to talk to me in the last 4 months of waiting and calling.  There main goal is to get your money... Don't be fooled. Are they scam artists? Snake oil? No not from the services I mentioned I received bough I read a lot about people who didn't get the results thy wanted from the credit program they have. They are just poorly run, unprofessional, lack a service oriented philosophy and no commitment to doing a good job. If you want to chase them around like you would a child to pick his underwear up off the floor then these guys are for you. I would not hire them for our services as all their services can be had elsewhere.So as it stands I paid good money and they have breeched the contract by not performing it as promised with In a reasonable amount of time. I asked nothing extraordinary from them. Do not use them buyer beware. Hope this helps you.									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

[continued below]....																			.....W. Bradford Wilcox is the director of the Witherspoon program through which Regnerus is chiefly funded. Wilcox is on the editorial board of the Elsevier journal that published Regnerus on June 10, 2012 without benefit of valid peer review; Social Science Research.Regneruss study, published without benefit of valid peer review, features a methodology so inconsistent with minimum standards that a group of 8 professional associations including the American Medical Association filed an amicus briefin which the Regnerus study is analyzed as methodologically unsound. The President of the American Sociological Association has signed a letter  along with over 200 Ph.D.s and M.D.s  to Social Science Research expressing concerns about the Regnerus studys lack of intellectual integrity and the sleazy process through which it was published.The published study  besides being methodologically invalid  contains a whopping lie; Regnerus claims that the funding sources played no role at all in the design or conduct of the study, the analyses, the interpretations of the data, or in the preparation of this manuscript. Witherspoon is making that same false claim on a stand-alone website it created to promote the study. Both Regnerus and his Funders have engaged in a campaign of deception to hoodwink the public into believing that Regnerus did his study independently of influence from his gay-hating funders.In truth, Regneruss Witherspoon funder Wilcox was issued a Regnerus study consulting contract  for data analysis  to which UT assigned the UT EID or Doc ID number ww2897.  The record shows that Wilcox was paid $2,000 for that one contract.A Public Information Act request sent to UT asked for all Regnerus-study-related communications between Regnerus and his Witherspoon funder Brad Wilcox. In response to that request, UTs Carol Longoria sent a letter on university letterhead to the Texas Attorney General  the Republican Greg Abbott -- asking him for authorization not to disclose the requested communications. In that letter, UTs Carol Longoria wrote that Professors Regnerus and Wilcox collaborated on the data collection and analysis that formed the basis of Dr. Regneruss publication.In other words, UT and Ms. Longoria acknowledge that UTs Mark Regnerus wrote a despicable and deliberately deceptive lie into his published study.A university of integrity would not seek to shield a faculty member from accountability for publishing a deliberately misleading lie in a scientific journal.I called Ms. Longoria and told her that at this point, if UT is interested in showing the world that it is more interested in upholding a public image of academic integrity than in shielding a lying-mouthed, gay-bashing professor, it will make a public acknowledgement that UTs Regnerus lied in a published study, and do everything it can to help the public to understand the inappropriate relationships that Regnerus has conducted with his studys funders.Digging in her heels, UTs Longoria said that UT will do no such thing, and that it will wait for the Attorney Generals decision on whether to release the requested communications.UTs and Ms. Longorias behavior subvert the mission of a university, as a university should above all be committed consistently to the highest achievable standards of academic integrity.Ironically, Ms. Longoria wrote in her blog on 9/14/2012 about the difficulties that Hispanic femaleprofessionals can face due to prejudices. Now here she is, taking money from UT to enable gay bashers to continue to use a scientifically invalid study as a weapon against innocent gay human beings in the courts, in politics, on TV, on radio and in magazines, newspapers and online venues.UT and Ms. Longoria are not doing the academically honorable things. The academically honorable things would include, but not be limited to: 1) issuing press releases, acknowledging the fact that UTs Mark Regnerus published a willfully deceptive, documented lie in a hoax study he had published via inappropriate and corrupt procedures involving the funders of his study, and 2) committing -- to the public -- to fully investigating and disclosing all details of Regneruss inappropriate relationships with his studys funders.Longoria is a horrid hypocrite, one minute deploring the impact of prejudice on one minority group, the next minute serving as an enforcer of prejudices against another minority group.As of publication of this report, UT and its Open Records Coordinator Carol Longoria, J.D. are exploiting the laws pertaining to the Public Information Act in ways that violate the intent of that law. The Public Information Act is supposed to help keep tax-funded institutions honest by giving the public access to those institutions records. UT and Carol Longoria instead are abusing the laws in an attempt to shield UTs Mark Regnerus from accountability for having published a lie in a scientific journal. No respectable university would behave this way.As a point of reference, UT professor Charles Groat conducted a study on fracking, concluding that fracking is safe, without disclosing that he is on the board of a fracking industry company and that he holds over $1 million of stock in that company. When watchdog groups brought Groats conflicts of interest to UTs attention, UT at first scoffed. The Public Accountability Initiative then brought extra pressure to bear, whereupon UT agreed to review Groats study.  So the bottom line here is, that left to its own devices vis--vis academic integrity, the University of Texas at Austin can be counted on to do the wrong, morally bankrupt thing, and Carol Longoria, J.D. can be counted on to assist UT in doing the wrong, morally bankrupt thing.

Catch 22- if I switch a Arlington, Texas","										I was rear ended a few years back and contacted David S. Kohm & Associates for representation. The case was what most would call an ""easy win"" because it's clearly the other driver's fault. David Kohm called me himself from his cell phone on the very next day after I contacted the office. Kohm assured me that he'd take care of everything and all I needed to do was make sure I attended all my doctor's appointments. I did exactly as instructed by the attorneys and doctors over the next 9-12 months, which was physical therapy, chiropractors visits, xrays, MRIs, testing and I limited certain activities due to my injuries until released by the doctor. Since I completed all my medical treatments in 2009-2010, the case has still been dragging on years later. My case is being handled by an attorney named Daniel and I've been through a handful of assistants over the years. Right now, an assistant named Amanda is in charge of my file, which isn't saying much. She never returns my calls and she lies about the processes that she thinks I'm ignorant to in order to buy more time. In early 2010, I moved to Illinois and contacted the firm to see how we could move the process along so I wouldn't have to travel back and forth much. They wouldn't return my phone calls unless it was my third or fourth time leaving a message and I had to get aggressive with the receptionist to get any kind of response from them. Finally, I found the cell phone number from when David Kohm called me directly on day one. When I called him, he was not happy that I still had his personal number and he asked me to call the office with my concern. I called the office again and again, leaving messages over and over but it's still the same old stories. When I did hear back from Amanda, she would blame it all on the opposition or the court system. She states that she's trying to set it for trial but the opposition is giving her a hard time or that the court won't return her calls or confirm our trial date. This is obviously a game of patience but I'm running short on mine. Today I called the office and went through the usual nonsense until I told the receptionist that I'd just call Kohm's cell phone again. I hung up and immediately called Kohm's cell phone. By the time I was on the phone with Kohm, who was not happy to get my call again, Amanda was frantically calling me back. Kohm was short with me, didn't really want to listen to a word I had to say, but he did say that he'd look into the situation and see if he could get some answers for me. As soon as I hung up with Kohm, I listened to the voice message that Amanda just left for me. She miraculously just spoke to the court and they gave us a possible trial date again. Same thing she's told me for the past several months. I know if I transfer the case to another attorney, Kohm & Associates won't release my case until they receive payment for the work they've completed thus far on my case. These fees would of course be jacked up because of my leaving their firm and I'd still have to pay the next attorney to correctly handle the case. It's a lose-lose situation, so I'm stuck with them I guess.  									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

He is not to be trusted. He is a very dishonest man who knew how to suck me in during my divorce.  He made all sorts of promises but never lived up to his expectations or promises made. Mr. Berry not only was unprepared during my divorce trial (He didn't even know how many children my ex and I had or their names), but whenever I tried to communicate issues to him, he was busy and never returned my calls.Unless of course it was to ak me for more money. Which he did on several times. And when he did he made sure to sound important which was a great way for him to get me off the phone quickly. But before he did, he would say he had everything under control  It was a lie. He had nothing under control  It seems to me that what he had under control was a way to take money from me.  Outside of the divorce, which I am not bitter about, the actual most horrendous thing about getting divorced was dealing with Mike Berry. I read he knew how to create an insecure sense of fear in his clients. You betcha. This guy is a fear monger. Not only did Mr. Berry take me for a lot of money, but everything he literally promised me we would get in the divorce did not happen. Why? Because this guy didn't know my case.  At trial it was such an embarrassment.  It is a shame that guys like him are allowed to practice. Did he do anything wrong? Yes - he lied to me and made so many false promises. 									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Fort Myers, Florida","										Lee lawyer, care center dispute family's claim that woman with dementia had will changed By AISLING SWIFTPublished Tuesday, September 18, 2012FORT MYERS Thirty days before her death, 84-year-old Audrey Muller was wheeled from a Lee County skilled care nursing unit and back into her bedroom in the assisted living section.It was June 9, 2010, and the retired longtime Edison State College dean had lost 70 pounds, suffered from dementia, three types of cancer and was on heavy painkillers.The civil lawsuit that describes her medical condition in her final days also alleges that two friends who were asked to be witnesses watched as a nursing home employee ""guided"" her hand to sign a new will that amended her 1992 will and trust.""She was almost comatose and she did not acknowledge (the friends) and most importantly, someone had to hold her hand to sign,"" attorney Steven Jaffe told a judge at a recent hearing. [continued below]....																			.....An hour after she was released from Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers on June 25, 2010, and sent home for hospice care to die, the lawsuit says, Muller signed another document that revised her 1992 trust and made a Lee County lawyer the representative of her estate. Two weeks later, she died.Instead of leaving most of her estate to two relatives, trust documents show the bulk was left to Cypress Cove at Healthpark Florida; before that day, court documents show, the adult residential center Cypress Cove wasn't even a beneficiary.Those allegations are at the heart of a lawsuit Linda Brega, 50, and her son, Daniel Muller, 25, of North Miami Beach, filed against Cypress Cove and Fort Myers attorney Kevin A. Kyle. It alleges Muller's physical and mental capacity had declined so much and she was so ill that it left her vulnerable to undue influence and opportunism.The lawsuit, filed last year in Miami-Dade County, was transferred this year, at the defendants' request, to Lee Circuit Court, where the defendants' attorneys and Kyle practice and Kyle's two brothers are judges.The lawsuit alleges that on June 25, 2010, Muller removed Wells Fargo Bank as her trustee, named Kyle trustee and gave him $10,000. Documents show it was Kyle who amended the will and trust. His firm wrote the original will and trust.Jaffe said Brega and Muller couldn't comment until the case is resolved. Josh Levinson, who represents Cypress Cove, and Matthew Linde, Kyle's lawyer, declined to comment, as did Kyle.* * * * *Muller worked from 1973 to 1990 at Edison, initially as a department chair and quickly rose to assistant dean of academic affairs before being named director of the then-Collier Center in Naples in 1981.But in her final days, Muller was in a ""diminished, confused state,"" on heavy painkillers, her mind so controlled by persuasion, pressure and outside influences that she didn't sign the documents voluntarily, doing so instead at the urging of others, the lawsuit alleges.Court records, Daniel Muller's sworn statement, private investigator Mike Fisten's account and arguments during a June 27 court hearing provide this account:Muller, a Catholic school dean before becoming a dean at Edison, never married or had children. She was close to her niece, Brega, who is a nurse, and her son, whom Muller treated like her grandson. In 1992, she set up The Audrey Muller Trust, giving them equal shares after disbursements to Edison College and others.Seven years later, Muller paid $250,000 to move to an independent living condo at Cypress Cove, where she also paid a monthly fee that covered living and medical expenses as she aged.In 2007, after she got lost while driving, Cypress Cove took title to her car. Two years, later, she began to suffer lapses of memory and confusion. As she aged, she moved to the skilled nursing care section, where she received full-time care, often was hospitalized and was placed on painkillers.""In early 2010, Linda Brega received a telephone call from Audrey Muller, who expressed the delusion that she had lost all her money  and feared that (Cypress Cove) was going to remove her,"" the lawsuit says.Brega noticed all of her art work, furniture, jewelry and heirlooms were missing from her room. Afterward, she and her son repeatedly tried to call Muller, but said they were prohibited and weren't told about her declining health.On June 9, 2010, when her will was amended, Muller was under 24-hour nursing care. Days later, she was found on the floor unconscious and taken to Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers.""On June 25, the hospital sent her home to hospice care, to die,"" Fisten said, noting that an hour later, she was placed on a conference call and again signed amendments to her estate papers. ""On the day Kyle made himself the trustee, on the 25th, she was on such heavy pain medication I doubt she knew what she was doing at all.""She died in July 2010 and was sent to a funeral home to be cremated.""The funeral home said they can't cremate without the authorization of family members, but Cypress Cove said she had no relatives or contact with family members,"" Fisten said, adding that Brega and her son visited her, were always listed as her contacts at the nursing home and their numbers never changed.* * * * *The defendants deny the allegations and filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit.Lee Circuit Judge J. Frank Porter rejected the defense motions to dismiss in July. Jaffe has begun taking depositions from nurses, doctors, nursing home employees and outside doctors and nurses.Last month, Cypress Cove filed papers demanding that Brega and Muller prove their allegations, including that they're relatives  and that they'd visited, called or received gifts from Muller. The business' attorney also demanded they provide photos of themselves with Muller.Under court procedures, if a beneficiary like Cypress Cove cannot provide a reasonable explanation about its active role in procuring the will, it's enough for a judge to find undue influence occurred. However, if Cypress Cove has a reasonable explanation, the burden shifts to Brega and her son to provide evidence the will was changed due to undue influence.At the June hearing, Jaffe told the judge Brega and Muller only discovered her death after checking obituaries online. Jaffe argued Kyle intentionally didn't inform them of their rights or provide them with the 1992 papers that gave them the bulk of the estate, so they were unaware that there was anything to contest.Legal papers filed by the defense maintain there was no undue influence by Cypress Cove. The defense contends that because Brega and Muller never challenged the June 9, 2010, will and trust, they can't contest the June 25, 2010, revised trust.Cypress Cove's attorney, Levinson, contended Brega and Muller cashed their $1,000 checks from the estate and never contested the will in probate court.""The will now is what I call uncontestable,"" Levinson argued in court. ""This prevents them from having their cake and eating it too.""For his part, Kyle has denied in court papers that he failed to provide the relatives with the 1992 trust, but admitted he didn't send them a notice to inform them they had 90 days to contest the amended trust. He also denied refusing to provide them with the earlier version of the trust or telling them the 1992 trust never existed.Jaffe contends he has the evidence to prove his case against Cypress Cove and Kyle.""You can't get an incapacitated person to sign legal papers,"" said Fisten, Jaffe's private investigator. ""And a nursing home cannot take anything from a patient, especially one suffering from a medical condition.""If that were the case,"" he said, ""you'd have all these elderly people suffering from dementia turning their money over to nursing homes.""

Sorry so lengthy.September 12, 2012I am asking for assistance from your office. First I must apologize for the length of this letter, there is so much that has to be said. I am writing you because Pam Johnson @ the housing counseling resource center said you are a great resource. I never intended not to pay my debt. In 2009, I became underemployed when I lost one of the two jobs I worked. It happened to be the main source of my income. Meanwhile, my husbands business was slowly growing. This is where I fell behind on my mortage. I continued to send in payments until the mortage company wouldnt accept them any longer. I was also willing to send in partial payments but they said that was not allowed. I filled out a financial analysis form through the mortage company. I then completed counseling on the phone through the HOPE hotline with a company call Springboard who submitted their recommendations to my lender that stated I was able to do a repayment plan. From this information, in December 2011, Nationwide offered us a payment arrangement of $3,000 mthly for one year to get caught up. During this time I was researching a company called RMA legal network. I decided to go with RMA because I felt the $3,000 was a bit too high and I wanted to negotiate a little lower payment. I was advised to submit all correspondence from my lender to the company, and not to contact my lender on my own because that was the job of the negotiator. I paid this company to help us keep our home and in the end I feel like our case was not given the individual attention needed. The negotiator worked my case with the same cookie cutter plan she was accustomed to. I continuously called and emailed to get updates. Phone calls go unanswered or un-returned, I would have to resort to sending multiple faxes, emails, and/ or phone calls to get her attention. I often had to call the customer relations line for a reply and the Sr. Legal Asst. Hugo Rodriguez who enrolled me in the program. As disgusted I am with this company, I feel as equally wronged by my lender Nationwide. The entire time Ive thought we were headed in the right direction, there was no progress made. We were not offered a forbearance, deed in lieu, deed for lease, nor a short sale. The day before my sale date, DoriAnn Wright, the negotiator on my case, suddenly had an epiphany and so called figured out that my lender was only using my income and not my husbands. She also stated that my lender was not following Fannie Mae guidelines. THE DAY BEFORE MY SALE DATE! The plan all along was to show his income as well. She also indicated that the lender was not calculating the income correctly period. She then urged me to find an attorney to file a restraining order on my lender, it could cost upto $2,000. This was @ 4:00 pm on August 28, 2012, the day before my sale date. Eight months, and this was my end result. I feel that from January to now was more than ample time for any issues like these to have been figured out. During this process, I have had two sale dates on my property, one I was advised by the Sr. Atty. Hugo Rodrigez to advised me to file an emergency chapter 13. He referred me to a paralegal by the name of Jeffery Giordano, @ best debt consulting), who also charged me a fee to prepare the paperwork for me and gave me instructions on how to file it @ the court house. They explain that this will buy us a little more time to get a plan worked out with the lender. I communicated this with my negotiator, and now that Ive lost my home she doesnt acknowledge me ever stating this to her.  I would have advised you to stick with it because this is what would have saved your home. Now I am barred from filing any bankruptcy I am eligible for for the next six month. On September 5, 2012 I spoke with Lisa Nicholson, the head of loss mitigation @ Nationwide. She never gave me a break down of the income like I asked. She did state that it was not clear that my husbands income was to be considered as well and that they never received a financial form with his signature on it. When I spoke to another rep. in the loss mitigation dept. on August 28, 2012, by the name of Melinda, she said that she saw where another financial analysis form came through on August 27th, but nothing will be done with it because your sale date is tomorrow. I feel that once it was determined the income was not being processed correctly, this was grounds to postpone my sale date. Supposely Lisa made a request to Fannie Mae to do so and they declined. I was told this decision was reached in less than an hours time @ the end of the business day. However, when I asked her for Fannie Maes phone # during our conversation on September 5th, she had to look it up to give it to me, Ill give you a call back in a couple of minutes, again, 4:56pm. I never got a call back. I called the loss mitigation dept. on the 6th and asked Rory for the number. I had the # already, I wanted to see if they had a different one. Everytime I call Fannie Mae, I dont get straight answers. Lisa states that my home is back with the investor, Fannie Mae, there is nothing they can do @ this point. I am in a redemption stage. Ive been researching, and I see programs where people have been wronged during the foreclosure process and their loans were reinstated. I have definitely been wronged. I have filed complaints on both my lender and RMA with the Atty. General office. I have submitted proof for 8mths that we can afford to pay our note and for 8mths I have been given the run away by both my lender and third party. Congressman, I am not looking for a hand out.I feel in my gut that my case was not treated right. All anyone can tell me now is, think of this as a new start. What??? I have kids who love the schools they go to. My son just started middle school, this is a huge adjustment for him. We can pay our note and both parties have the proof. My lender chose not to extend any other option. Its sad, I got more action and feedback from the housing counsel in one week than I got from RMA or my lender in 8mths and it was free. I am so discouraged. Can you please let direct me in the right direction. I know this letter is long, but believe it or not I still have more to add but just cant put it into words. Please let me know what I can do, or how your office can help. Sincerely,Shannon ScottAugust 28, 2012More to add:I didnt get the housing counsel involved until 8/13/12, I was in touch with the Chicago office. Michelle did my intake and I was forwarded on to Lidiette. Lidiette stated that I wouldnt be eligible for a MHA loan modification because one was done earlier on my and I didnt qualify for a fannie mae modification because I didnt reduction in payment did not meet the requirement. She is the one who argued me right away to contact a local housing counsel. This is when I found Pam Johnson who gave me a grocery list of this to do. Shes been very helpful. She told me to get on the phone and call Nationwide, ask if my acct. was assigned to someone, who, and to ask for my sale date to be postponed and let them know that I had an appt. to meet with a counselor from the housing counsel on Tuesday, 8/28/12. This was the sooniest she Pam could get me in.August 28th 10:00 amSpoke to Malinda@Nationwide. Asked her if they received the additional information I was asked by DoriAnn@rmalegal network to fax to her so she can fax over to Nationwide on 8/27/12( contribution letter from husband, proof of his residency, and bank statements), Malinda stated that she did see another financial form submitted on 8/27/12, but it was too late since the sale date is tomorrow 8/29/12, nothing can be done. I asked about forberrance, the repayment plan that we were originally offered before I started working with RMA and she said there was nothing available for retention. So @ that time I was denied without my husbands income being concerned when during the entire process I was told that we needed my husbands income to qualify.10:16 am In the meanwhile, I sent DoriAnn an email about what I just discussed with Miranda. DoriAnn then called me and explained to me that she is working with someone named Rory @ Nationwide. Malinda is a customer service rep. in the default dept. She also stated the additional items that she requested from me on 8/27/12, ( contribution letter from husband, proof of his residency, and bank statements), according to Rory were in review with the underwriter. I asked her when did she speak to Nationwide? She said this morning. I asked if there was a time line? She said no, unfortunately if she pushes too much, Nationwide would just push it aside.I spent the rest of my morning calling around to different attorneys for advice. Since all of this I was advised to file an emergency chapter 13 back in April by one of the senior advisors @ rma to buy time for them to get a modification done. So, because I look like a chronic filer, I am barred to file any bk I am eligible for for 6mths. I pondered not going to the appt. I had with Pam because I was so discouraged.1:00pm From the time I spoke with DoriAnn @ 10am, I hadnt heard anything new. I decided to keep my appt. with Pam. She took me through the intake process got everything entered into the HOPE portal. She called my lender to get info she needed to fill out one of the docs. She explained to them who she was and asked for a postponement on my behalf still no go. Around 3;30pm, Pam stepped out the room to make copies of my documents. I called DoriAnn and asked if she heard anything. She was hotter than a wet hen.she said that Nationwide denied me even with my husbands income. She also stated that Nationwide had not been following Fannie Mae guidelines nor have they been calulationing the income correctly. Remember, I was told from the beginning my husband income was going to be considered as well, and it wasnt. She stated that Nationwide is to get permission from Fannie Mae every step of the way and it was not done. She said she was told that she had to call Fannie Mae and get ask for an emergency stop sale, she then explained that it is the servicers responsibility to do so. She stated that as she was on the phone with Fannie Mae she had another associate on the phone with Alicia Nichols some manager @ Nationwide walking her through how to ask Fannie Mae for this emergency stop sale. I asked her what time all of this took place? She said since 3:30pm (NewYork time). So now it is 4:30pm her time and she is waiting to hear from Nationwide if the sale is postponed. I get a call from her about 20 mins later, and she said that Nationwide said Fannie Mae didnt approve it. DoriAnn stated that it is her belief they are lying because she has never gotten any answer back that quick from them. She stated she has voiced a compliant with the Kansas Attorney General office, she left a message for both Judge Vino and his Asst. Oh, DoriAnn said she spoke to a Jessica and a Christina @ Fannie Mae.My compliant is against both Nationwide and Rma because:1. Nationwide already knew they were not going to do another modification2. Had RMA been on top of things they would have known if Nationwide was not following Fannie Mae guides.3. I took forever just to get an update, and everything I requested one the requested me to send in the same things no matter if theyve already asked for them or not.4. The advice I got from RMA always cost me money and is always a temporary fix. (Emergency chapter 13).5. Everytime Ive gotten correspondence from Nationwide, it has been after theyve requested RMA to have me send in more doc. EX: I got mail from Nationwide dated 8/13/12 stating they couldnt review my file because it was in complete but I just got a request from RMA on 8/21/12 to something else in but the envelope from Nationwide was stamped 8/23/12. 6. I generally feel like I was just sprung along. I started working with RMA in January 2012. DoriAnn stated today that shes been neogiating my case since April 2012. All this time, money, and no favorable result. I love how the mortage company is quick to say that theyve not received a payment since whatever date, but what they dont say is we stopped accepting her payment such and such date. Nor would they accept a partial payment.I sorry this is so lengthy. Pam told me to makesure I documented everything. I dont know what the outcome will be, but this is my official compliant.Thank You Kindly,",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Each week I will be taking ten random foreclosure cases out of thePalm Beach County court house and picking out the one that has the most fraudulent document in thefile.Be it a Pleading, a BOGUS Assignment, a Fabricated Note, a Forgery, or an Assistant Attorney General thatworks for both the AG Office and a Foreclosure Mill at the same timeTWO ORIGINAL FABRICATED NOTES?In my last Foreclosure Fraud of the Week we talked about Poor Photo Shop skills. This week we will expand on that topic. Hold onto your hats. This one could possibly be a game changer. Below are TWO Original Wet Ink Notes submitted in the same OPEN case by the notorious Florida Default Law Group.One submitted by Ms. Ashleigh Politano Esq and the other by Tamara M. Walters Esq. I am very grateful for this find since it corroborates some theories I have had. I personally believe, that in most cases, the Original notes are purely high quality COPIES. The reason I say this is because almost EVERYOriginal note I examine, the blue wet ink signature is always the same oddcolored blue. You know, the blue that comes off a printer or copy machine. I have yet to find that same elusive blue colored pen in anystationary store.I think that the Foreclosure Mills and the Default Processing firms have electronic copies of the notes and just print them out however they need them, or they just replace the last page with a fabricated one that isendorsed to the plaintiff.Not only that, the last page of the note, in many cases, is a different quality paper then the first few pages.Now I know these are some conspiracy theorist type allegations, so bear with me and see for yourselves below.Most judges do not want to hear those theories, so lets take it a step further to possibly opening their eyes. Remember that these are both Original Notes filed in the same case, both with wet ink signatures, by the Florida Default Law Group, so they should be identical, right?I took the liberty on taking screen shots of the Notes where I thought there might be frauds perpetrated on the court. Examine the full Certified Copies below to compareI labeled them;  NOTE ONE (Submitted by Ashleigh Politano Esq) and NOTE TWO (Submitted by Tamara M.

I began with all positivity and thought this was a legit opportunity, but it is clear that all the sales agents that they are recruiting are merely the consumers that add to Mr. Riches bottom line. Whenever I would ask for questions about how to do something from the Regional manager, I would always get the run around- seems like no one knows what the hell they are doing- they say in order to be a part of their company you have to purchase a legal shield plan in order to convince people to also purchase a plan, but they make even the recruiters purchase it which just proves it is a pyramid scheme. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. I am canceling my Legal Shield membership that i got through them. I even tried to order a Legal Shield associate application off of the HRMC  site in order to get an associate id with Legal shield so I would be able to get commissions if I made personal sales- low and behold i get a telephone call from one of their consultants telling me not to buy an application, instead she gave me the cell phone number of Charles Fields to ""create a game plan""- hmmm, she has his cell phone number, seems like they all know each other. What really set me over the edge is when I had recruited a sales agent and was told I was going to be conferenced in on the call to learn how to interview potential candidates- low and behold, 10 minutes before the call was scheduled I get a call from the regional manager telling me he can't conference me in because he is on his cell phone and he will just talk to the interviewee himself-even though he was aware that the 1-on-1 conference call was going to take place days in advance- SHADY. Basically, you are working to get them Leads and make them money- if that wasn't the case there would not be so much lying and giving of the run around. LOL, and on one of the training audio tapes they say that there are some bad reviews of their company by people and not to believe them, that those people ""need luck with an attitude like that"". Well, my friends, I can tell you that I swear on my grandmother's grave that they are a scam and there is a strong basis for the accusations of them being a pyramid scheme, because that is what it is. It looks legit, but it is just a highly sophisticated pyramid scheme. If you really want to make your own money and go to bed at night knowing you haven't ripped anyone off- go straight to the LegalShield website and go into business for yourself, you don't need HRMC. ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

I explained that I only wanted my childhood home back and he said the banks only listen to Lawyers and that he could help me talk to the banks.  Lucas Garcia sent two letters to the bank and called me twice to tell me that the bank is reviewing my home modification, and believed I should have been given the permanent modification.

Mann Texas Family Attorney Frank Mann Lacks Ethics and Morals Avoid This Attorney! Internet,"										We are extremely disappointed in your firms inability to meet minimal expectations and your hands off approach to dealing with even the most toxic of situations regarding our case and from the members of your firm.  We believe that if Mr. Mann would have taken a more hands on approach to our case, instead of just our payments, we would not be in this position we are in today. Were in a terrible, volatile situation and utter disarray, due to the lack of care and handling of our case and severe, corrosive immediate breakdown of communication regarding minimal facets of this urgent matter. The service has been beyond embarrassing, poor and entirely unacceptable by any means. Simple task such as returning a phone call, answering basic questions via email, supplying correct court appearance times and dates, omitting necessary documentation for the clients discovery process, a proper introduction to the associate attorney that would be representing, more than 1 line sentences from a blackberry to address our sincere concerns, a timely reply to our emails if any at all, respecting the time of the client and the court by at least appearing on time to a hearing, an invoice or description of services rendered, became non-existent. Please know that we did take the requested routes of contact per your policy, but after a week of unanswered emails and a rapidly approaching uncertain court date, we needed answers quickly.It seems from the very beginning we have had to pry repeatedly to get any kind of update or status regarding our case. Please know that for the bulk of the time in which we employed your services, we were made unaware of the most CRUCIAL AND CRITICAL details until the end. Mr. Mann, we trusted you and your team to handle this crisis. You assured us, you were confident in handling our case and we trusted you. This may be true for you, but clearly not of your staff, with the exception of Nicole. After your assurance, we didnt hear from you again. I personally believe that you are a competent attorney and confident that YOU couldve easily handled this case, however, with the exception of 1 individual in your employ, your staff and associate attorney are beyond unprofessional. Throughout this entire experience we are still unsure to who would be our actual point of contact with your firm. We just know that you arent. Please try to imagine my absolute embarrassment when our representing attorney was over an hour late. Our hearing time was promptly at 9AM; we were notified between 8:45-8:50 that she would be 20 minutes late. She arrived at 10:05AM. Please see court records for proof. The judge was absolutely perturbed, shocked and furious as well as my ex-wifes attorney, W. XXXX Jr., who was actually more helpful to me regarding my case than anyone at your firm, including you, has ever been in the history of our relationship. The judge also gave an extreme voice of concern and assistance for me, as Ms. Dara Percely remained quiet- only voicing concerns for her injured finger. Ms. Dara Percely for the most part, said NOTHING. I, Attorney W. XXXX Jr. and the judge, spoke more on my behalf than my own attorney, while my attorney stood blankly by my side. Please keep in mind; I wasnt notified of my mandatory appearance by your staff until 12-14 hours before the time I was to appear in front of the judge.  Due to the fact that we live over 250 miles away, this was extremely stressful to arrange approved time off from work, lodging arrangements, pet and child care, adding extra unnecessary, unexpected expenses. My wife attempted to pose one question to Ms. Dara Percely the day before court. She simply wanted to know who would be our main point of contact at your firm since we have now dealt with 4 separate individuals. Before she could even complete her question Ms. Dara Percely immediately interjected defensively and rudely stating that your firm deals with multiple clients and that as much as she would like to sit here all night and talk its 6:30PM and she has to go. Ms. Dara Percelys defensive rant went on for 20 minutes. She never answered my wifes question. Whats so appalling about this, is given the chance in court for explanation, she didnt say anything- not one word for my benefit or welfare, but to clients or those I believe she thinks she can easily intimidate, she makes it a point to be outright defensive, rude, discourteous, stand-offish and cold when questions are asked, then smile and extend her hand for a handshake in person. We signed documents stating that we would remain courteous and not speak unkindly to any member of your staff. I did so once, and I immediately apologized, Ms. Percely absolutely belittled and spoke abrasively to my wife less than 12 hours before this meeting and made NO genuine apology to her. We were beyond disgusted as Ms. Dara Percely scurried quickly away to the lower level of the courthouse to send text messages.At this point, immediately following the silent commentary of Attorney Ms. Dara Percely, we sincerely wished that Nicole was our attorney and not merely a paralegals assistant. At least Nicole, if nothing else, remained genuine and consistent. Unfortunately, I was not made aware of Nicoles activity regarding our case until less than 4 days before we were to appear. Her information delivery may have been inaccurate, but at least she made an effort to help, return calls, etc., but obviously too late. Mr. Mann, we would sincerely like to seek counsel from another attorney with this matter. I ask that YOU PLEASE DO NOT CANCEL OUR MEDIATION DATE AND PLEASE DO NOT DESTROY, NOR MISPLACE ANY OF MY CURRENT FILES OR RECORDS YOU MAY HAVE REGARDING MY CASE. I will be retaining new legal counsel that will be in need of all case files and any other documentation not communicated to me. There were only 2 occurrences where work was actually being performed on our case to our knowledge, once when you verbally berated your staff during the first 2 weeks of acquiring your services, due to them not properly delivering my documentation to you and the last 4 days prior to going to our embarrassing hearing as my wife was in correspondence with Nicole. I would like to believe I am a fair and just man, with ethics and values, but at no time, should a client ever be treated in the manner that my wife and I have had to suffer under your firms inability to meet minimal expectations. Im not sure exactly how much information was delivered to you or its accuracy of delivery. I am sure you were made aware of the results and the handlings of my case; however, I am not sure that you were made aware in this much detail of how poorly it was handled. Understandably, you may be in question of my explanations of the prior events that have transpired and may even believe that I am attempting to embellish my statements. For this reason and for your records, I am requesting a statement from the presiding HON. BRENDA XXXX and Attorney XXX Moore Jr., both of which aided me on the day of my hearing when your associate attorney could and would not; also a brief statement from a third party, non-biased attorney regarding the level of professionalism and handling of a similar situation.  Again, Id like to reiterate, that I do believe you are a good attorney, but I want to make sure you are fully aware of the inner workings and breakdowns within your firm, not only from my point of view, but from the views of your peers. I am requesting at this time, as you are also a man of ethics and values, that you find just cause to refund me a significant portion of the total monies that I have paid until this point, $1,950									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

I called the company and the phone was answered by yet another individual with a heavy foreign accent. He answered by saying, ""Hello? May I help you?""--no company name was stated.I then told the man what I was calling about and he proceeded to ""read"" me a page listing 3 criminal charges that were being filed against me by his client. I advised him that I had no idea what he was talking about and I have not committed a crime. He was difficult to understand and was extremely rude. At one point he told me that if I was ""claiming to not be a criminal, then [I] would need to explain that to my criminal attorney after the sheriff got my file"". He wound up hanging up on me.I then called MY lawyer and briefed her secretary about what was going on. She said the lawyer would need the law office's name. I called ""Dexter Cruz"" again and asked the man who answered the phone to tell me the name of his law firm and spell it for me. He said it was Johnny Best Law Firm. I then asked him to provide the contact information for the person/company that had supposedly filed criminal charges against me and he hung up on me.

Mr. Paul N. Schaefer would be found in a positive light if his clients thought he was a good attorney and posted him here on on other websites such as ""yelp"" and other websites where attorneys and other businesses conducted businesses.  However,  I googled Paul N. Schaefer and found no such ""positive"" postings about this man...aka...attorney.  No such ""positive"" postings about this ""attorney""  is posted anywhere on the internet about Paul N. Schaefer for someone whom claims he has been practicing law.In fact,  the only thing posted that I've pound on the internet was my own blog and a particular comment which picked up portions out of a blog in which I had written about Mr. Paul N. Schaefer from my own blog quite some time ago back in 2011.  What Mr. Paul  N. Schaefer doesn't realize about Google, inc. is that spiders crawl all over the internet to pick up blogs as well as articles which are written by multiple individuals and Ed Madigedson will write even his own articles, blogs and copies content himself to post on this site, rip off.   Obviously,  Paul N. Schaefer hasn't known this internet game long enough to be well versed in it yet,  like I've been thus far to know how it's played.Well, Paul N. Schaefer!  Welcome to MY whorld!  Of course I spelled the word incorrectly.  On purpose.  You see.  We beings walk within the matrix of chaos.  We do not control what goes on within this matrix.  We merely go along for the ride.  Sit back and enjoy it while it lasts.  Everyone wants a slice of my ""sweet"" pie.   For some reason,  everyone believes I have something ""sweet"" to offer and yet,  I am not a baker.  I've never baked.  Nor do I have anything to offer.  Yet....everyone desires a slice.   It's virtual you see ?   It's all an illusion and yet...everyone desires a slice from me.  Well...... you may all have a slice of it,  if it exists.   Take a slice.   Try as hard as you may... but that slice just doesn't exist.   That delicious granny pie sounds so delicious,  I am sure ! It always does and so do the photos when you think about granny and the images.  But well....we all love granny now don't we ?Now let's talk about this Paul N. Schaefer shall we ?  Let's talk about his enjoyment of his supposed love for typing out letters stating ""pursuant to""  telephonic communications to this and that which never happened with regards to his clients!  How this man enjoys doing this to his clients!  I received many of those types of letters AFTER this man was paid in full of which we verbally came into an agreement of the total sum of $4500 and nothing more!Yet... after Paul N. Schaefer was paid in full by me...suddenly this man aka attorney (in which he is registered with the Florida bar association and if I worked for that Florida bar association..I myself would strip him of that license and yes...I offer that as my own personal opinion because of what this man did to me!!)  he sent multiple well typed letters to my home claiming we had telephonic communication which NEVER happened asking me to send him MORE and more money to his office!!!  Each time I would receive these supposed letters,  I would try and call his office and he would NOT pick up the phone!  I called his office and then I would receive another damned letter similar telling me in ""pursuant to our telephonic agreement"" that I owed him A PHONE BILL !!!!!  FOR X amount of money!!!!  THis continued until I had enough of those ""in pursuant"" letters!!!  I became suspicious of this man in which I felt was a fraud and a fake attorney of whom I felt didn't know his ass from a hole in the ground of LONGWOOD FLorida regarding PROBATE law!  I hired Paul N. Schaefer to try and help my mother...an elderly woman whom was suffering from dementia..to try and get out of the hands of a woman named Sandra F. Johnson.  A woman herself whom was clinically diagnosed with some sort of personality disorder and of whom was just ONE family member that was ripping my mother off from thousands of dollars including taking my mother's personal belongings!  I had sent Paul N. Schaefer several packets of supporting documents to PROVE Sandra F. Johnson was NOT fit to be my mother's legal guardian; that she had been doing wrong by my mother and had been stealing from my mother.Do you know what this man told me by telephone ????  AFTER he took over $5000 from me ???  He told me I was being ""vindictive"" toward my opponent,  Sandra F. Johnson!  Yes!  The very person of whom I was trying to get my mother away from!  How the hell was this man going to try and be my attorney and help me win legal guardianship for my mother IF this man was already taking sides with Sandra F. Johnson ???   He was already on her side AFTER he took me for my $5000 !I called a probate attorney named Caroline Sawyer and this woman was so kind that she helped me free of charge!  She walked me through from the very beginning to see that Sandra F. Johnson's durable power of attorney had already been suspended and Paul N. Schaefer had made multiple blunders!  From the very beginning!    This man not only didn't do the right thing from the very start........ He never even told me Sandra F. Johnson's durable power of attorney had been suspended!  He allowed this woman to continue ripping off my mother's income by NOT notifying this woman's attorney (which he was suppose to do) and he didn't tell this woman's attorney that they were suppose to create a seperate banking account for my mother (which they were suppose to do) the moment I had filed for legal guardianship!  This man,  Paul N. Schaefer told me he had been a probate attorney for multiple years!So okay.  If that was true.........why did this man charge me $4500 and continue asking me for more and more money and NOT obtain that 1st emergency hearing as he promised me ?  Why did I never get one court date ?  Why did he lie to me about court dates that never existed ?  Why did this man make me have to continue to call Winter cuthbert-soloman over and over and over again on my own to obtain my own information at the Orlando Florida court house ?  Why was it ME whom had to obtain the information because this man didn't even know the damned probate information himself  for orange county ?  This individual didn't know the probate laws!  My cousin and I had to google the probate laws ourselves because this individual was telling us shit that didn't make any sense!  The crap coming out of his mouth was b*******t!  He took me on an expensive ride and nothing but!  All I received from this man was bull****!I called nearly 20 attorneys whom I felt were TOP probate attorneys and they told me they would NOT take my case because I was out of the Florida legal juridiction.  A techicality since I was residing in North Carolina.  Paul N Schaefer knew this or at least should have known this.  I think he knew this and he was taking me for one hell of an expensive ride!   This man was me coming like a shoddy used car dealer watching a woman walk into their car lot for the first time!  That's my personal opinion and I am entitled to express it.  For some reason,  Paul N Schaefer believes because he is an attorney,  that people are not allowed to express their personal opinion about him.  Bullshit!  If I don't like how he treated me as his client.... I am allowed to express how he treated me as such!  That is my god given right as an American citizen!  Paul N Schaefer is now trying to tell a circuit court of Florida that he wants me to shut my mouth about posting blogs of how he mistreated ME as a client ?  Who the hell does he think he is ?  Is he kidding ??  As an American Citizen,  it is my right to express my personal opinion about this attorney of whom I feel provided me crappy service (even shoddy if you will)  because of how he took me for what I feel was an expensive ride and I did NOT even see the light of day when it came to a court room appearance for my mother along with this freakin' attorney!!!All this attorney kept doing was stringing me along asking for more and more money! Paul N Schaefer believes he is immune from being written about.  No he is not!  Paul N Schaefer believes he can't be posted about on blogs, articles, over the internet about his service provided as an attorney.  BS!  He wants a court to tell me that I can't post about him.  BS!  Whether positive or negative, anyone and everyone can post about Paul N Schaefer!  IF Paul N Schaefer wants to build good reviews about himself....then provide a better service to others!  He did NOT provide to me...a past client...good service!  He let ME down as well as my mother!This man had the audacity to mail to my home hand-written scribble after I fired him and told him to account for how he spent the money that I sent to his office!!!  Instead of being a professional and type out his accountability,  this man...aka...attorney... sent approx. 15 pages of hand written scribble like some child!  When I received these hand written scribbled notes...myself nor my spouse could not make any sense of what this man sent to our home!I called a probate attorney in Orlando Florida named Frank Nissi.  He asked me to fax him the pages and I did.  Mr. Nissi told me he had never seen anything like it.  The day I went to Orlando Florida for my mother's probate hearing (in December 2011) I actually met Mr. Nissi in person.  What a nice man!  I spoke to him in person about what Paul N. Schaefer had sent to my home.  I had already fired him by then....three different ways!  By telephone; by email and then by certified mail.  A judge had already dismissed him via court as well prior to that probate hearing before I went to the probate hearing for my mother as well.  I attended the probate hearing for my mother,  alone.  No attorney went with me.  I sat alone.  ( Sandra F. Johnson claimed in her blog that I cried during the probate hearing... in jest...I was more than likely maced by her....or was emotionally compromised... hahahah... neither really happened.  She was just being ""vindictive"" as Paul N. Schaefer claimed. hahahah)When I asked Mr. Nissi about the hand written scribbled notes that I had faxed to his office in which Paul N. Schaefer had sent to my home, while awaiting to speak with Judge Bronson,  Mr. Nissi just shook his head.  Neither of us could believe it.   There is no accounting for some attorneys.  Perhaps Paul N Schaefer,  in his head,  feels he is a professional.   Well, in my head,  I feel he is a bamboozler!  This man,  in my head...enjoys taking people for an expensive ride because he will see them coming.   I am quite sure for nearly a year,  he's had time to listen to the cassette tapes I sent to his office.  I am quite sure for nearly a year,  he's now had time to READ the entire packets of evidence I sent to his office that proved Sandra F. Johnson was a nut case and wasn't fit to be a legal guardian for my mother!  I am sure NOW nearly one year later,  this man has had time to go back into the probate courts to read the ""history"" that she's lied and NOT done what she was suppose to do.  NEARLY ONE YEAR LATER!WHY NOW ????   NEARLY ONE YEAR LATER this man... Paul N Schaefer ....which I feel is a scheister attorney ....wants to come at ME to tell me to shut up and NOT complain about him ??  Through the court system ??   Give me a freakin' break!   If your nonsense and YOU shut up!  I consider Paul N Schaefer as a man whom is unprofessional!  Someone whom is a scheister because he should have known the probate laws and claimed he knew the laws yet couldn't even recite them to me properly!  I had to look up those probate laws myself!  I had to do my own homework and do my own footwork!  I had to call the orange county courthouse to get my own packets! Do my own background check! Had to get my own fingerprinting crap done myself!  I had to call Wynter Cuthbert-solomon multiple times asking questions to get my own answers because Paul N Schaefer wasn't around nor would he call me back after I left multiple messages asking him to!  This man charged me for his own clerical mistakes and he made multiple clerical mistakes!    This man had the audacity to never tell me he was charging me for email !  This man never told me he was charging me for more than we had originally agree upon!  Plain and simple this guy IS and WAS a rip off for ME as a client!  That's my personal opinion and I am entitled to post my personal opinions about this man aka attorney where ever and when ever  I want on the internet!  Now Paul N Schaefer is trying to boo hoo to the court system to try and prevent me from posting about how he ripped me off as his client so past and future clients of his won't know how he took advantage of me as a client!  If this man freaking kidding me ????What is this man trying to hide ??? The fact this guy ripped others off or took advantage of people ? Past clients ? How many other clients did he do this same thing to ?  Id like to know Paul N. Schaefer ?  Give me a sum total of how many others did you do this same thing to ?  Was I the ony person whom had the balls to go public with what you did to them ?  People have a right to voice their opinions.  It's called ""FREEDOM OF SPEECH"".   It's protected in the United States Paul N. Schaefer!!!Now take your box of tissue that I am sending your way,  Paul N. Schaefer,  go  dab your tears in the corner, sir like I've done here on rip off report.   Go boo hoo to somebody whom cares about how much you are crying about your losses.   If you want positive reviews to be written about yourself,  then take good care of your clients.  DO NOT hand scribble notes and mail them to your clients! DO NOT take advantage of your clients and lie about what you agreed upon like you did to me! DON'T lie to your clients about court dates that don't exist like you did to me!  Don't tell your clients that you had telephonic conversations when in fact you never did!  Don't charge them for phone calls that never took place especially when your clients are calling YOU from their phones and you are not the one calling THEM back.   Paul N.

Mr. Paul N.

Mr Joseph told me if I made the deposit today he would apply the consultation toward my total deposit. So I paid him on the spot and several days later his assistant Mr Broge Large contacted me to met with him and said they cannot assist me in my matters and that I should seek help elsewhere. They also claimed that the criminal lawyer was rude and they have avoided all contact with me. They have refused to send me a refund or a bill statement and have abused their position of trust.

In Jacksonville FL, me and a Rouge crookett sheriff officer Name Rudy R Hathaway had been at it over a FAKE stop sign ticket that he gave me in April 2011 along with a illegal misdomeanor arrest. The Jacksonville Sheriff office covered up for this officers wrong doing following the incident, I went mad there after and Demanded something be done about this officers actions and also to have my original complaint given to me so i can at least take that to my assigned judge (Charles Cofer) and have my case heard sense the judge put a Withhold adjudication on it and had not converted to final judgement yet. Me and The Jso went at it all year, they refuse to turn over MY DOCUMENTS in december 2011 and had the nerve to ask me for $246 just to request it and thats not even processed the same day. [continued below]....																			..... I flew into a rage and threatened them on the December 29th 2011. Got arrested on Jan 4th 2012. I sat in Jail and WAS PASSED/SKIPPED on my Legal required FIRST APPEARANCE and placed in solitary confinement in a orange jump suit while all the murderes, rapist, pedophiles, arm robbers, got to WEAR A GREEN jumpsuit and see a judge on there first appearance which is the next day after arrest. I simply made threats and i cant see a judge??Anyhow, i finally went to court on 1-26-2012 only to be told it was not my court date, there i meet NATHAN CARTER who was somewhat polite mainly to people not of Color or caucasion decent, one man had a folder with over 35 arrest and been to prison 7 times, nathan was very nice to this man. I ask nathan can he come to the jail and talk with me because he is my assigned lawyer HE SAID YES he would come and see me saturday, i asked him can i have his business card, he REFUSED!! i was very polite to him. Now 1-31-2012 gets here, and im scheduled for arraignment in judge Tyrie Boyers court. Nathan carter's did not come to see me over that past weekend, rather he was waiting for me in court. He frowned at me and said "" Those video's you were posting online about shooting cops"" and blah blah blah. I said its my free speech right to say that people should DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION and stand up for themselves agianst evil be it cops or anybody, not all COPS are good and they were not good to me in 2011 and i was mad at them the JSO. he started studdering and saying but but but this isnt about that, and turn to some pages and finally showed ME THE REAL LEGAL STUFF where i made THREATS to the JSO or Jacksonville Sheriff office by email. I ask why didnt you come to the jail like you were suppose to so we can discuss this. The judge and the prosecuter called my name up, we stood up and i tried to plea NO CONTEST, but carter said NOT GUILTY and the judge said okay let CARTER DO THE TALKING. Carter said i was crazy and needed a mental doctor. the judge said WHAT?? He want this case DISPOSED OF OR IN TRIAL BY MAY 2012. Me and Carter Argued, he claimed the judge can send me to prison TEN YEARS!! YEAH RIGHT!! No person in florida history has ever been sent to prison on a "" Threatening a public servant case!! EVER!!. Only bomb threats, stalking cases. Threatening the police is a silly charge and because of the nature of there job is expected. many of these cases are misdomeanors. But the DEMON SHERIFF paid off the STATE ATTORNEY and had mine listed as a felony for some odd reason with a $300,000 warrant bond. Keep in mind i HAD NO CRIMINAL RECORD!!!! Nathan Carter TOLD THE JUDGE TO PASS ME AT LEAST A MONTH so i can be seen by a doctor!! NATHAN CARTER LIED and never sheduled the doctor to come see me, rather my family called him and he hung up on them and said get a lawyer goodbye. They were forced to get a lawyer for no reason, as many people make threats to police everyday and get taken to jail and pay a fine and go home after no more then 30-90 days, police can protect there own selves!! My case was different, i made threats and EXPOSED THE EVIL JSO FOR WHAT THEY WERE, with over 50 officers arrested sense year 2000 for numerous crimes against the public, over 5 suicides sense 2001 from officer related misconduct when there caught in the wrong they take there life rather then face prison time and loose there careers. I REST MY CASE!! Me VS JSO you take your pick!! Its important to note that this DEMON officer Rudy R Hathway was FIRED from the St Johns Sheriff Office in 2002 for MISCONDUCT!!I believe NATHAN CARTER reiceived payment from the Jacksonville Sheriff Office to not in anyway help me because nathan carter has defended people in MURDER TRIALS and WON!! he was also successful in fighting a CAPITAL attemped MURDER case and WON. Why in the world couldnt he just take my case and get me seen by a doctor and get me a plea, THATS ALL MY HIRED LAWYER DID (Donald B Mairs) and it was a waste of money sense i had to plead GUILTY ANYWAY as i had been telling carter all along. I ended up getting 161days TIME served with a conviction. SHAME ON JACKSONVILLE, CURSE THAT CITY!!Nathan Carter is not a true LAWYER, only a basic certified lawyer. He attended some corner store Coastal law school rather then a respected 4 year university such as FL State Like Donald Mairs did. Carter is a BUM and a JOKE of a excuse wannabe trial lawyer who feeds off the Public defenders office with his $54,000 salary supplied by the tax payers for him to pick and choose what he wants. In reality he is a coward and is Afraid of Rutherford, IM NOT so why should he. Heck the prosecuter ( JAMES JOSEPH BOYLE) stepped down from the case after i wrote him countless letters telling him its a cover up and fraud criminal case against me.  Sheriff Rutherford Paid off Angela Corey and Richard Komando to send me to prison and Apparently paid Carter to do the same because i bet judge Boyer would have just gave me a FINE and sent me on my way after 30days in jail sense i HAD A CLEAN RECORD, but old smartty pants carter going to say im mentally ILL opening up a can of whole new worms forcing the judge to see if im even COMPETENT to stand trial or be released to the public.After hiring Mairs my family had to pay SEPARATELY to the doctor ( Doctor NYADI) who was convince without a doubt i was competent and refuse to let the sheriff pay him off. He did however say i had a borderline personallity but that wasnt enough for the state to hold me. They(the courts) had me scheduled for releasing/plea deal after 110days but here comes EVIL JSO saying i shouldnt be out so early. forcing 41 more days. AFTER ALL THE EVIL THAT THEY DID TO ME. EVIL PIGS CAN BURN IN HELL!!All carter had to do was take my stupid case, HECK the news didnt even know i was in jail??? why not?? Rutherford paid for that too!! My case can be looked up on Duval county's website its case number 2012-CF-000106.  i was the 106th felon taken to jail that day and i didnt see a judge?? its called a secret arrest!! And Nathan Edward Carter was apart of it. If you see this man ( see attach picture) stay away from him. Dont allow him to be your attorney.

They had this option that would check your income and everything to verify if you qualify for the program, which according to them I did qualify and after you qualified I had to pay $2500 of two payments up front in order for them to take my case, and also it was $75 for each months after 4 months if the case lasted longer, which it did. I paid the money and that was it, in order for me to talk to them I would have to call a few times leave a few voice mails and than they would call me back a week latter or whenever they got to it. My case lasted about 8 months, and the reason my case was denied according to my bank, because First American Mitigators wont return my calls anymore to let me know what happen, according to my bank I was denied because I failed to provide the documents they asked for. Which that makes perfect sense because last time I talk to someone there he had no idea about my case, what the situation is, or what are we dealing with. He was confused, he was saying ""I received some income tax information on the mail Im going over it right now"", now to remind you that information was my income taxes that I had mailed to him two weeks prior to that.I worked with them for about eight months, every month or two they would assign someone else to my case, and had no idea what was going on.

Robert Eckley Eckley and Associates are sharks and incompetent Phoenix, Arizona","										When I first came to their office ,Robert Eckley said that my case was easy to win because I took pictures and I properly documented everything in my case . I wanted to sue my landlord for negligence and inattention to the big sewer backup we experienced in a house we were renting. He said"" They are toast"". I paid the retainer deposit they requested but they assigned a less experienced lawyer to my case. The landlord gave us an offer but the offer was just the return of the deposit and they did not want to reimburse us with the hotel and lodging expenses we incurred for a month of being displaced. This younger, inexperienced lawyer wrote me a long narrative discouraging me on filing a lawsuit. He said he will negotiate. We disagreed on everything and he got stuck with the star rating of the hotel which I purchased from Priceline paying a 2 star cost for a 4 star cost. I told him the star rating is immaterial right then and to just go and give them a counter offer. Before we could finish our counter offer, the  law firm slapped with  an additional $4,000 on top of the $2,000 I already paid them. He said that the settlement we may get may be less than what I may have to pay them. That does not make sense. We hired a lawyer to get reimbursement and see some kind of justice. Why would I go ahead with something where I will end up spending more money on their legal fees than the money I will get back? And to top it all, this young attorney said that if I am not happy with a counter offer,then we could file a lawsuit which would cost me anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 and that they needed the $10,000 before they file. This $10,000  is on top of the $2,000 I paid and the additional $4,000 they wanted just by arguing about the star rating and small petty things we could not agree on. This is a delaying tactic and they did it to run charges like a taxi meter. I wanted $20,000 reimbursed for our expenses which are supported with documents and receipts but he said he could not do guarantee it and made me lose my confidence in getting us what we deserve .

Well, if you've been forwarded to the firm of Perona, Langer, Beck, Serbin & Mendoza (PLBSM), please... KEEP LOOKING! I absolutely will not leave you in suspense. Here's the story on the process folks. Here's what happened to me along with a few examples of what happened to others who have wisely acquired new attorneys in their cases.Once you foolishly fill out their online form, within 2-5 minutes, expect a call from someone from their office. The person calling you may or may not be an attorney. They will ask you a few questions about your situation and then tell you they will send someone from their offices right to your home the very next day for you to sign the papers for them to take care of your case. DO NOT SIGN! Once you've signed, the firm gets a percentage of your claim even if you fire them, or they fire you. I am personally aware of both of those circumstances. After you sign, they will open a case on your behalf. In my personal case, they NEVER met with me even once prior to filing my case with the Workers Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB). They never did an indepth interview with me. They had very little actual knowledge of my accident or injury. Of course this means that when they filed my orignal claim, they didn't file it with all of the injured body parts. From there, it just went downhill. The thing is, since they never sent me even one copy of anything they did, I didn't even know they had opened the WCAB case much less that it was wrong until long after I fired them. When I hired a new attorney, who spent nearly 4 hrs interviewing me so as not to be left without any important information, that's when I found out PLBSM had inacturately filed my WCAB claim. To add to the chaos, every time I called their offices, I was put into a phone queue and had to wait 30-45 minutes to get a live person on the line, if able to get a live person at all. On the occasions I was able to speak with a live person, they either provided me no information at all, or provided me incorrect legal advice, despite the fact they were not the attorneys. One of them advised me on a matter that lost me a great deal of money in benefits. Of course, the firm will deny any wrong doing for any of their mistakes. That's why we are all joining forces to go public and to file this Class Action Suit using a very well respected attorney. In addition, we are seriously contemplating our appearance on a well known media outlet. We are not giving up until we are compensated for the errors made in each of our cases. Here's an interesting scenario. When I would call and leave a message requesting a return call from someone from their office so I could get a status on my case, I didn't receive a return call. So, I input information into their webform, this time with a different name to see if I could get someone to call me. Low and behold, the return call came within minutes. That test tells me they will call you immdediately to hook you in, but once you've signed on, it's extremely difficult to get them on the phone for anything. It's considered a Breach of Ethics according to the CA State BAR when your attorney fails to communicate with you about important issues regarding a case. This is just one of the issues I, along with many others with whom I've had contact, have had to deal with once we agreed to allow the PLBSM firm to represent us. We feel strongly that this issue is so egregious it amounts to malpractice. If you're interested in joining forces with us, read the other posts in this category and contact the person listed. Be prepared to provide detailed information from your case if you wish to join us in our pursuit for justice. 									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

When I refused to pay him more money (keep in mind he did not do anything for the original money I paid him.) He had Peyton Freeman put a lien on my house and claimed I owed him 80 thousand dollars! I have never even met this Freeman!! I hope this stops someone from making the same mistake I did, Charles Lincoln destroyed my life, I lost my house, and had to declare bankruptcy please do not trust this man or give him a penny he will destroy your life.

Rackley, Attorney At Law, Guardian Ad Litem Jen Rackley, Jennifer Rackley, J.A. Rackley DO NOT LET THIS GAL WORK YOUR CASE! Who wants to pay $1000 for a Liar? Manipulative, horrible investigation, extremely poor interrogitory skills, poor organization, prays on disabled parents with thre Exeter, New Hampshire","										My experience with Guardian Ad Litem Jennifer A. Rackley began when she was appointed to the child custody portion of my divorce case. I went to my temporary hearing on January 31st 2012 and my ex seemed very adamant on having a GAL appointed to our case. The only reason I was opposed to it, and I was honest with the judge about, was because I have a non verbal learning disability which affects me socially.Being disabled doesn't just mean being in a wheelchair. You can have a disability that's not physical. I told Judge David LaFrancois that due to my disability, my words and actions could possibly be misinterpreted by the GAL. LaFrancois didn't care about my disability whatsoever and assigned Rackley to my case.In my first conversations with Ms. Rackely, she seemed very nice and professional.When I spoke with her over the phone this first time, it was to give her my correct address so she could send me paperwork. [continued below]....																			..... I felt no hostility from her, she seemed like she really cared about her job and doing the best for the child involved. The next time I spoke with Ms. Rackley was to set up a time for her to come to view my home. I had been busy with an audition (I was trying out for a television show) and needed to schedule the home visit either before or after the audition took place.Ms. Rackley was kind, understanding and respected my scheduling needs. When she came to my home, it felt more like she was a friend than an authority. She was very nice and was kind to the roommates I had at the time and to my animals. We got along well and I felt comfortable being honest with her. I thought she was there to help me. The home visit went fine and Ms. Rackley and I had a good conversation about the case.I was honest with Jennifer about my ex husband manipulating the courts and making all kinds of false statements against me.My ex had told Jennifer Rackley I 'did drugs' and had 'mental problems'. Both accusations were not only false, but extremely hurtful. I had starting going to my primary care physician for monthly drug testing on my own free will starting in roughly July of 2011..... EVERY TEST CAME BACK CLEAN.As far as the 'mental problems', my ex isn't qualified to be diagnosing ANYONE with mental problems nor have I EVER had any kind of history of mental problems. My learning disability is NOT a mental problem, it is a neurological problem. More recently,  and I have been suffering depression and anxiety since my ex husband cheated and left for a heroin addict prostitute he met in AA and I visited my doctor for help with the depression. I received an antidepressant, a small dose, and took it reliably under my doctor's care. My ex turned a simple ailment such as situational depression and anxiety and let Rackley to believe I 'had mental problems'. When Ms. Rackley showed up here, I walked my talk. I showed her my papers from my doctor, stating I'm being treated for depression and anxiety, cannot work and am on an antidepressant on a temporary basis. She seemed satisfied with my home, the environment AND the care I took of myself, said home and my daughter. I felt Ms. Rackley saw my sincere honesty that day and I trusted her to make the right decision regarding my daughter...... I was gravely wrong.To the tune of $1000, Ms. Rackley performed a horrifically primitive investigation and was easily persuaded by my ex's money and expensive lawyer..... I was extremely disappointed to see Ms. Rackley's integrity go from who could provide the best home environment for the child to who could financially afford her.My ex offered Rackley nothing but false statements with no proof.... and Rackley bought every bit of it hook, line and sinker.Instead of exercising proper judgment and holding my ex accountable for filing false statements, she decided it was easier to bleed me for an extra $120 I don't even have for a HAIR DRUG TEST, due to my ex's false accusations. She also wrote that 'both parents have criminal records'...Hogwash. My ex had been arrested multiple times since he was a juvenile, got a DUI and was charged with a felony.I, on the other hand, have only been arrested TWO times my entire life!The first time, I told a Portsmouth Police officer ""No, I will NOT have an affair with you behind your wife's back!"" and he falsely arrested me to 'teach me a lesson'..... I was arrested but the charges were mysteriously dropped because the cop didn't want me to tell the judge about his praying on and stalking me. I've been taken advantage of by authority before because my disability makes me an easy target..... The second time I got arrested??? I took the fall for my ex, who was facing a felony charge! If he got arrested, he would have gone to jail and my daughter would have had no father. I took the fall so he wouldn't have to miss time out of his daughter's life.....Pffft. What a stupid woman to compare my two dinky arrests to my ex's extensive criminal record.She didn't do ANY investigating into what was being said, she merely placed her judgment on who could pay their way out of it. For the $1000 fee she was paid, I expected a 5 star investigation and no stones unturned. I was dead wrong.... Not only was I being forced to buy my child back, instead of taking my word and the proof of a drug free lifestyle from my primary care doctor, Rackley demanded I spend the money on a hair drug test to show ""I cared for my daughter"". APPALLING!!I went to my doctor to show her father I was doing NOTHING wrong, now this GAL is telling me my doctor's tests are nothing because I didn't 'spend money on them to prove I care about my daughter'. She cared more about how much I SPENT on my daughter than how much I LOVED her. It didn't matter I loved my daughter more than anything else in this world to Ms. Rackley, what mattered to her was the fact I didn't have a trust fund to buy the authorities like my ex.It didn't matter to Rackley my ex lied to the courts just a year ago when he filed a false statement for the purpose of obtaining a restraining order against me when I had done nothing wrong. He deliberately deprived a child of a wholesome and loving relationship with her mother for no reason other than he felt like hurting me. That was 'acceptable' to Ms. Rackley, she wasn't the slightest but disgusted by the young man whose built an empire of lies. The same man who lied to a judge last year was at it again....and this time he had the money to buy Ms. Rackley's judgment instead of rightfully earning it.Ms. Rackley awarded an equal judgment in her first report but then turned her judgment around on July 3rd 2012. While at court with Rackley, my ex and his lawyer, his lawyer stuck her head in the room I was in and spat lightly on the floor. This is a woman who deliberately provoked me when she kept breathing into my face at a mediation session. The woman knew I had a disability and knew if she kept getting close to my face I would have a problem with it.Well, the lawyer provoked a disabled person at court....and instead of sympathizing with me, Jennifer Rackley discriminated against my having a learning disability, stating she 'didn't like how I behaved' and because she didn't like, she decided she didn't want my daughter around me. I was around adults and there was an adult altercation that occurred, it didn't involve my child whatsoever and here Rackley was making it out to the courts like it had.There was no proof of any wrongdoing on my part, it was my ex's lawyer who shouldn't have deliberately provoked a disabled person in court that day. The lawyer was not reprimanded by anyone for her behavior that day, but I was! Rackley's disposition completed changed. Instead of telling the courts what a wonderful, fine, talented and fit mother I was, Rackley put on her little acting face and told Judge David LaFrancois in a baby voice how ""she was concerned if my daughter saw the courtroom incident.""My child wasn't there, only adults were. And one of the adults did something they shouldn't have and deliberately provoked a person with a disability who was clearly stressed in that situation. Rackley was 100% aware of my person and how I was as a mother. I had been honest with her about the stress of the divorce and look where it got me: childless, penniless and possibly homeless too!Ms. Rackley turned on me the day my ex's money mattered more than my daughter's welfare. It's a shame Ms. Rackley cares more about how much money a parent has compared to how much they care. Ms. Rackley's 'investigation' included calling my then attorney several months ago and obtaining the names and phone numbers of relatives. She got the phone number for my mother and called demanding a complete background on me.My mother had nothing to hide. I was a good kid, never got into trouble but I DID have a non verbal learning disability. It doesn't interfere with my ability to be a parent but it does affect me in social situations such as a court case. However, Ms. Rackley NEVER called my ex's only living parent, his father. If Ms. Rackley called my lawyer and got my mother's name and number, chances are she called my ex's lawyer requesting the same information.... and she was NOT provided with me ex's father's name or number.... and he's very much alive, well and willing to give an honest account of his son's very trouble background....Rackley never spoke with my ex's father and as of this writing, she hasn't returned his calls. My ex's lawyer did NOT want Rackley speaking with her client's father because she knew the father would paint a drastically different picture of him than the one she was painting. Why did Ms. Rackley not call my ex's father? Was she told he was no longer alive? Estranged? Refused to talk? None of that's true. My ex's dad was, is and always was willing to speak with Rackley, whom he met on July 3rd for the first time. She gave him her business card and urged him to call as soon as possible.... July 3rd was the first, last and only time my ex's dad spoke to Rackley. He has called her numerous times since July 3rd to report the seriousness of his son's mental state, Rackley won't return his calls.Since I lost custody of my daughter AND my decision making rights to my child on July 3rd, it's been downhill from there. My ex has been taking minimal care of our daughter, sending her to daycare filthy dirty and greasy hair. There was a complaint with the daycare regarding my ex's bathing of the child and allowing the child to starve at school. The daycare workers assured me they would be calling Rackley about this and they claim they did. However, Rackley on the other hand, did absolutely nothing about it.My mother, the child's maternal grandmother, relayed to Rackley that her investigation has been extremely poor. Rackley will no longer return her calls either. We're asking questions and Rackley is running and hiding . There's no way this situation is in any way right or fair. A special needs child is being deliberately isolated from the mother and grandparents who love her so much. The mother and grandparents who have done NOTHING wrong, we've fallen victim to a narcissistic young man with a wad of money in his pocket.There are no complaints against any of us which would have warranted the temporary termination of my time with my daughter, my decision making as far as she goes, my ability to be a parent has never been questioned. My daughter has always been healthy and happy with me.Since my daughter has been separated from me, I have been issued 'supervised visits' because of the opinion of the end result of my learning disability. If I want to see my daughter, I have to go to her daycare center at certain times OR, GET THIS- I have to PAY a 'parenting support center' to have a 2 hour visit with my own child! This is where sex offenders go when they have children of their own who were not their victim. Here I am, paying to see my own kid alongside all the sex offenders.This is 'perfectly fine' with Ms. Rackley, as she has done NOTHING to help in any way. A special needs child ISN'T going to understand why they have to go to a center to see mommy. If I did something wrong, I would accept this as a consequence, BUUUUUUT! I have done NOTHING wrong, having a disability isn't wrong and under the Americans With Disabilities Act, I have the same rights as any other person. My rights as a mother and as a human, have been violated.My integrity in authority has been violated. The first complaints the daycare had with the care of my daughter when she was turned over to her dad full time went pretty much ignored. However, this past Monday July 23rd 2012 I paid my daughter a visit at the daycare center. I was horrified to find my child petrified in a corner, filthy dirty, greasy hair, blotchy face. I immediately took out my Android cell phone and took pictures of the horror in front of my eyes. I was shocked the daycare workers let my child come into the center looking like that.I have included one picture below, I have placed a white band across my child's eyes to protect her identity. This was taken when I walked in, as I found her.... She was playing by herself, forlorn and disgusting. I had to leave the daycare that day because my ex showed up to pick our daughter up. Wednesday, I went to the daycare again. My daughter was gone for the day at her therapy, they told me. She wasn't at the center.I was still extremely horrified at the sight of my emotionally distraught filthy child on Monday and wanted to show the pictures to her. I asked a teacher named Chandra outside the facility if I could speak with a person of authority while I was there. My daughter was gone for the day, I had a legit complaint and desired to make my concern known in as polite a way as I could.The director of the daycare was of no help.She not only denied what I'd seen on Monday, she also denied the first complaints from 2 and half weeks ago even though the woman who relayed them to ME and my MOTHER at the same time was standing right there. She said nothing at all.They refused to help me, so I left.I got a call from a ""Wendy"", claiming she was a supervisor. I relayed my concerns to her and the new concerns that her workers were not doing their job and being a mandated reporter. She denied her workers were failing to report anything and she hung up on me.Thursday July 26th, I came to the daycare to see my daughter. When I walked in I asked the teacher Chandra for the name and phone number of a supervisor above Wendy. I wasn't going to quit on my complaint. My child's well being was at stake. Chandra said she would get me my requested information, instead she lured me into the director's office, promising me the information I sought was in there.I have filed a separate report for the daycare involved so if you're interested in reading look up Great Bay Kids Company.The director lied to my face, claimed there was never any abuse, denied the previous complaints and the final kicker was when I wasn't satisfied with her lying about the condition of my kid, she called the Exeter Police Department telling them I 'wandered into the facility yelling and screaming'.That was a lie of Holly Davis, Director of the Great Bay Kids Company, I came in quietly, walked into the classroom my daughter was in and asked the teacher politely for the name and number of a person in charge. NO YELLING, NO SCREAMING. I was a concerned parent and crying for my chld's safety at this point.When the police showed, Holly Davis continued to lie to them, she was inconsistent in her story though. One minute, there was 'never any complaints' the next minute she changed her story and said there ""was one complaint filed 'awhile ago' "". It was not even 3 weeks ago this happened, my mother saw it and here is director Holly Davis lying her ass off. She even tried telling the cops that my photo's were taken 'last week, outside, while the child was playing.'I have an Android, when you take a photo, it saves the details including the date and time you took the picture. I showed the police the photos AND the info: The photo was taken inside the facility, not outdoors like Holly said, AND the details corresponded with MONDAY the 23rd, not LAST WEEK! The cops caught Holly in a lie, but it was easier to throw me out instead.The cops treated me horribly and Holly Davis told a false statement to the police right in front of me. The police said this incident was going on file and I could pick up a report in a few days at the station. I will obtain a copy of the report, scan it and place it online for public review. I thought my drama was over..... I was dead wrong.It was 6:21 pm on Thursday, July 26th 2012, I was home alone with my two dogs just trying to relax from my ordeal at the daycare earlier. My phone rang and I recognized Rackley's phone number on the caller ID. Ms. Rackley has talked to Holly Davis, the director who lied to me and the police and denied any complaints had ever been filed about my daughter. I explained to Ms. Rackley I had done nothing wrong and was there relaying a legit complaint to someone in charge. Ms. Rackley explained to me that she had just spoken to Holly and gave the impression the version Holly told her was portraying me as something less than the concerned, fearful parent I was.I fell apart emotionally. I couldn't take it anymore. I began to cry, I was coherent and comprehensive but emotionally from everything from losing my daughter to being discriminated against for being disabled. I told Ms. Rackley I was horrified she allowed this to happen to my poor child, as I was nothing but a fit mother to begin with. I poured my heart out to her that I was being victimized and manipulated by my ex, his lawyer and the courts. I told Rackley I could handle being a mother, I couldn't handle being in a court mess like this the best due to my disability. There was NO PROOF I had no ANYTHING wrong as far as my child went. There were NO COMPLAINTS AGAINST ME. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT RACKLEY'S SUDDEN DECISION TO TAKE MY CHILD FROM ME AND PLACE HER WITH HER ALCOHOLIC, NARCISSISTIC FATHER.  SO WHY WAS MY CHILD TAKEN FROM ME? For my being disabled, it seems.Rackley then said to me ""Are you alone in your house right now?"" I told her yes. She then says to me ""I'm worried about you being in your house alone while you're crying, I think you need someone there with you."" I snapped at Rackley. Who was she to be telling me I 'shouldn't be alone in my house while upset'? Did you think taking my child and my decision making away WOULDN'T make me upset???What self respecting mother wouldn't be DEVASTATED at the loss of her child? Jennifer Rackley expected me to be made of stone?? I told her I was at home with me and my daughter's two therapy dogs. I was never alone in my home, thank you very much. Rackley and I were on the phone for exactly 8 minutes and 57 seconds (thanks Android!) in addition to the above, the conversation ended with Rackley telling me she was 'going to call my mother' and she hung up the phone on me.She said before she hung up that she was going to call my mother, I was still upset so I called another friend for support. at 6:44pm I called the friend, at 6:47pm another call came in from a private number as I was on the other line with my friend. I clicked over the answer it and I was told I was speaking with a Sargent from the Exeter Police Department. I at first thought he was calling me about the daycare incident earlier that day. I told the man I had been home minding my own business for the past couple hours, how could I help him?""Ah, you weren't on the phone with a Jennifer Rackley?"" The Sargent asked. I told him yes, that Ms. Rackley was the GAL in my divorce case and she had called me to discuss what happened at the Great Bay Kids Company. The officer knocked the bottom out of me when he said to me next: ""So you didn't threaten to KILL her??"" I was shocked and STUNNED. I said to him, Of course I hadn't said anything like that to Rackley, I was almost 30 and knew better than to criminally threaten ANYONE, let alone the GAL in my case.""You didn't threaten to 'get her'?"" The Sargent asked me next. No, I hadn't said anything to Ms. Rackley that was anything like that, the word 'kill' wasn't even used during the entire almost 9 minutes I was on the phone with Rackley, crying and pouring my heart out to her about the courts using the fact I am disabled as some sort reason why I 'couldn't be a mother'.Ms. Rackley and I had a conversation about her poor effort and unfairness of the judge involved and my learning disability. Now here she was doing the SAME THING.I told the Officer I hadn't said anything of the sort and I was appalled Ms. Rackley would deliberately call up a law enforcement agency with a false statement against a disabled person for the purpose of harm.  She was was angry at my accurate observations of her horrible job as a GAL and decided to use her authority and the police to frighten me and upset me further. Why would a professional such as Ms. Rackley do this? I am deeply concerned something may not be right if she thinks it's acceptable to do that.Ms. Rackley told me she was 'calling my mother' before she abruptly hung up on me. She never called my mother.... I found this out after I hung up on the Sargent who called me. My mother was never contacted by Jennifer Rackley on Thursday July 26th 2012, Rackley called the police on me instead. I am putting this complaint out in the open as Ms. Rackley is a public employee and should be subjected to a public jury if she's made any violations in her professional or personal life.I am an adult living with Asperger's and I am the proud mother of a beautiful (also autistic) child. I have coped with the stresses of life better than most people without a learning disability and I do no deserve to have my child taken from me because of a neurological disorder I have no control over.Jennifer Rackley deliberately failed in her responsibility to protect my daughter and respect my civil rights as a mother, human and disabled person. The above account is 100% true and correct.  I, the author, have no problems proving my serious allegations against Ms. Rackley and will be glad to speak to the media regarding this truly horrific experience.

We went to see Mark Shalloway who had done a seminar on elder law at their complex.  We didn't see Mark, but did see his father. They explained they wanted to have me, their only child, become the primary person the Powers of Attorney and Health Surrogates and wanted to find some way to protect their assets if one of them had to go into a nursing home. We spent 2.5 hours with Michael Shalloway who made them all kinds of promises and made alot of notes. He explained that for a $6000 fee the firm would take care of all their legal needs for the rest of the their lives. I was skeptical, but they wanted to go ahead. That was in October 2011. The first set of documents we received were nothing more than what we had given them originally for POA and Health Surrogacy. Nothing had been changed. When I called to complain there was a lot of double talk. And they said they would send the documents again. The second set of documents had some correct and some incorrect. In the meantime it was already the end of November and my father was failing rapidly. In the first week of December I took the incorrect documents to the Shalloway offices so they could see what was incorrect. Our ""case manager"" Sharma took me into a conference room and spent an hour being incredibly rude and telling me why the errors were just clerical and I shouldn't be so upset. I told her that I needed the documents done correctly and I couldn't understand why they weren't right in the first place. I asked if anyone checked the documents before they went out. She told me that Michael Shalloway was out of town until the middle of December and he would get back to me when he returned.He didn't. The holidays came and went. In the first week of January, my father died. I called Shalloway to tell them that the new documents needed to reflect this change. Again, our ""case manager"" was incredibly rude and I finally lost my temper and I told her to cancel everything and send us our money back.Mark Shalloway called me himself within an hour. Very apologetic and he would take care of everything himself and I didn't have to talk with anyone but him from then on. We went through what I needed. We agreed that he would send me the completed documents to my address and then he and I would meet offsite to go over them before we met with my mother. I waited about six weeks and never received anything. I called Mark to say I was done and I wanted our money back. He told me that he had been waiting for me to call and didn't seem to remember agreeing to sending my the documents as soon as they were done. He said he would send them out immediately. When we received them, there was a glaring error...AGAIN. I called the office and talked with my new case manager who just brushed it off as a clerical error. How would you feel if at the bottom of your Power of Attorney the work ""genocide"" appeared? Clearly no one was checking any of the work. I then emailed Mark and said I was done and I wanted our money back. He called and left me tens of messages none of which I returned. Finally he got me and I said I didn't think the trust was right anyway and he said I just didn't understand it. I said I wanted my money back. He didn't respond. I am filing a grievance with the Florida Bar Association and suggest anyone who has had the same experience do the same. They are feeding off the elderly and not providing services promised. As soon as they have your money, they just don't care.									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Definitely a newbie lawyer if I ever saw one. These Photo Attorney letters are starting to annoy me and I am starting to see them way too frequently. Similar to the McCormacks extortion letters, there are many issues in the letters that are grounds and deserving of State Bar and Attorney General Complaints. The sad part of this is that nearly all of the Photo Attorneys are relatively young and it will be quite upsetting for them to get such complaints so early in their careers.There are a great many presumptions and accusations that overstep boundaries.

I then asked to speak with a manager, in my firm if I was risking losing business I definitely would want the employee to hand them over to me.  But the employee refused to transfer me.  I was happy with their product, but shocked at how poor their customer service is after the point of sale.  Any company that is willing to throw away thousands of dollars in business for such a minor issue won't remain a viable company long in my opinion.  Stay way from them, saving $500 to create a LLC is not worth the poor customer service and the sly way they try to take advantage of you with these recurring charges.  I don't like to post bad reviews on companies, I wouldn't want anyone to do it to me.  But I gave them many chances to contact me.  I feel like it was my duty to make this known to the general public.

 Marie Haspil / James Ehler / Texas Bar Corruption ,"  Marie Haspil / James Ehler / Texas Bar Corruption  Congress Ave, Austin, TX Austin, Texas United States of America ", , ,"Marie Haspil / James Ehler / Texas Bar Corruption Lanette Joubert / William Dudley / Judge William Adams Patters of Bar Supported Abuse and Corruption / False Allegations / Lying Austin, Texas","										Lanette Joubert started arguing that my client had refused her client June summer visitation. This was a total lie. I had written her a letter agreeing to June visitation. She was just lying like usual. This was a false allegation. This was not a false allegation of the magnitude of false sexual contact but it was still a false allegation. This is the modus operandi of these lawyers.She never presented a witness. This is very common. In the Stanley Rains case, there were many, many hearings before there was ever a witness. I just heard these lawyers make insinuations from their own mouths. This would be unethical according to fabricated Joubert law as discussed earlier (a lawyer is unethical if he doesn't have personal knowledge).  A lawyer is not required to have personal knowledge but a lawyer is required to have a factual basis (e.g. witnesses, documents, etc.). Their supposed factual basis for most of this time was the ""park witnesses."" These park witnesses never actually testified for the longest time. They never would have testified but for my efforts. Normally, the rantings of these professional liars is the only thing that is ever presented. When the park witnesses finally testified, their testimony was absurd. Most importantly, though, they denied ever saying what these lawyers claimed they said (the most damaging part). These lawyers fabricated evidence. James Ehler was OK with that fabrication of evidence that denied a man his child for years. He is utterly immoral and corrupt. We will see later that he is OK also with stealing children through fraud. He is utterly immoral and corrupt.Anyway, back to the supposed denial of June visitation, Lanette Joubert presented not one thing other than her own statements. Her client was in the courtroom but she did not put him on the stand. He actually was remarkably honest in many instances. She couldn't put him on the stand.Of course, Lanette Joubert's testimony was hearsay. She was there when the supposed denial of visitation occurred. She had to be relying on her client. No other known supposed witness to the conversation existed.  It is hard to object to this kind of ""testimony"" in many instances because it is unclear whether the statements are in the nature of opening statement or testimony. It is not really known until later for sure that the lawyer does not intend to actually present any evidence and wants her statements accepted essentially as evidence. This is not proper procedure, of course.I knew Joubert was lying like usual. I had written her a letter expressly agreeing to June summer visitation. She is a sociopathic liar.  James Ehler and his protege Marie Haspil are lovers of lies and liars.I presented my client as a witness. I knew she barely talked to her ex husband. She communicated with him primarily if not exclusively by text message. I strongly suspected the supposed conversation never occurred at all. But, certainly, she was entitled to present her side. I didn't know at the time what she would say but she was entitled to respond.Joubert objected to hearsay. It wasn't hearsay. As every first year law student knows, verbal acts are not hearsay. For example, the words ""I Accept"" in the context of contract formation are not hearsay because in lawyer talk they are not for the truth of the matter asserted. Rather, they are legally operative acts. As another example, the words ""I am going to kill you"" in the context of a verbal assault case are not hearsay. The words are a legally operative act. Every lawyer knows this, and this is something that comes up in every case.  If my client had in fact said ""I deny you visitation"" that is a legally operative act not a statement for the truth of the matter asserted. In contrast, Joubert's statements were hearsay because she was not personally present when the supposed statements occurred. She was not just testifying as to legally operative statements that she personally perceived. She was testifying as to statements made to her by another and asserting the statements were true (e.g. classic  hearsay). This is not just a situation of an incompetent lawyer who does not understand the hearsay rule. Once again, she was denying my client the right to even be heard just like with respect to several other issues. She gets to state the truth even though she doesn't know it (she wasn't there) and no response is allowed. This is like her claiming that I could not believe my client with respect to what happened at the mediation or about whether the homicidal psychotic would be watching the child. This is also like her claiming the child was not entitled to be heard (to a lesser extent because Joubert does have personal knowledge with respect to the restaurant meeting). Essentially, Joubert is the determiner of truth and opposition cannot respond. They are not even allowed to testify. They also are not entitled to legal representation. A lawyer who represents someone and presents evidence contrary to what these lawyers say is attacked.I presented my letter where I told Joubert that June visitation was OK, and she and her client smirked. I am sure if Ehler was there he would have also. These people think lying is funny. It is total corruption, and unfortunately, the bar as represented by James Ehler and Marie Haspil supports it.With respect to the restaurant meeting, Joubert and Judge Adams took the position that it was frivolous to believe the child rather than Lanette Joubert and crew.  Joubert made a big deal that I never called her. Her position was that if I had asked her than I would have known the truth. I was frivolous for not asking her.  First, I did ask her. I sent her very detailed letters immediately and invited response. She never responded. She was lying. Second, the notion that I have to believe her rather than my client is just corrupt. A lawyer is loyal to his client. The bar as represented by James Ehler and Marie Haspil supported this extreme corruption.Another pattern is these lawyers accusing me of what they do. These lawyers testify personally (not just an opening statement) repeatedly and consistently. They accused me of that but identified no specific  instance.These lawyers don't follow rules. They accused me of that yet provided no specific  instance. The bar never follows rules. It is corrupt.Oh, they never make false allegations like the restaurant meeting? This is just one of many, many just less serious than the restuarant. I know personally it was false because I wrote a letter agreeing to June visitation.Lanette Joubert is so confident in the corruption of the bar that she included my brief on the hearsay rule as evidence of my misconduct. My brief was accurate citing treatises and cases. It should not have been necessary because it is black letter law. Why did she include it when it obviously was not misconduct -- it was a professional and accurate statement of the law?The unstated rule is that it is unethical to oppose these lawyers and actually represent your client against them. They are corrupt. The bar is corrupt, and any attempt at genuine representation must be punished.									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

 Penn State University ,"  Penn State University  State College Pennsylvania State College, Pennsylvania United States of America ", , ,"Penn State University Judge William Adams / Marie Haspil / James Ehler Judge William Adams and related indviduals may assist with Sandusky Case State College, Pennsylvania","										Dear President, Trustees,for Penn State University:I understand you have significant legal issues now. Allegedly, one of your football coaches molested children for years.  You did nothing despite knowing of the allegation.I have a solution. It will work nearly 100% but it will require some manipulation behind the scenes.  You will need to strategically place certain individuals in key positions.Judge William Adams is on record as ruling that that it is frivolous to believe outcries of abuse by children.  He calls children ""fantasizers"" even highly competent and intelligent children. He exonerated the alleged abusers and they didn't have to do anything but make conclusory denials. He is a perfect judge for your cases. He agrees with what you did. He believes the outcries of abuse by chidren should be ignored. Further, he sanctions people and lawyers who believe outcries of abuse by children. One nice twist is that the alleged abusers must be believed. If the abusers deny abusing the child, that is the end of the issue according to him.  If any one continues believing the child despite the abusers' denials, that is frivolous. That person will be sanctioned. Judge William Adams has signed a written order stating most of these things expressly. Thus, the first step in the plan of action I propose is you need to get Judge William Adams to preside over your cases.  He is not working now. Use your influence and get him appointed a temporary Pennsylvania Judge or even a permanent one. Texas won't miss him. His salary is about $150,000 not counting benefits.Next, you need to hire Lanette Joubert and William Dudley to represent you.  William Dudley is judge William Adams' personal attorney. Keep that secret. Judge William Adams has no qualms about making rulings in favor of his personal attorney. Actually, even when William Dudley is one of the accused child abusers, Judge William Adams has no problem ruling in favor of William Dudley without disclosure of the conflict of interest (while attacking the mother of the child who heard the child's outcry of abuse and her attorney).  William Dudley and Lanette Joubert have no problem butchering every rule of procedure and law necessary, and Judge William Adams will rule in their favor. The real law is of no importance. The only thing that matters is Joubert and Dudley fabricated law.  They have no shame. They will fabricate whatever law is necessary no matter how erroneous and absurd. Lanette Joubert and William Dudley make $350 an hour as they so proudly repeatedly boast and also they are board certified, so effectively the law and the facts are whatever they claim. This is particularly true when Judge William Adams is the judge presiding.Next, you need to get James  Ehler and Marie Haspil to control the Pennsylvania attorney discipline process. They will attack any attorney who doesn't believe what Wiliam Dudley and Lanette Joubert say. Actually, any attorney who genuinely represents his client against them.  It is believed that James Eholer and William Dudley are involved in a romantic or sexual relationship.  Using the exact words of the witnesses relied upon by William Dudley and Lanette Joubert for many years in denying an innocent father access to his children, ""something just doesn't look right"" between them and they ""run with their butts up in the air"" when together.  Of course, Lanette Joubert and William Dudley will slander opposing counsel with all kinds of lies and James  Ehler and Marie Haspil will support them. James Ehler and Marie Haspil are ethical experts but they don't understand that lying is wrong. Actually, in their view, the truth is wrong when the truth is not politcally correct.  In your case, the truth is politically incorrect, so they in case will certainly take your side. It is outrageous to tell the truth when the truth is not favorable to the influential (according to the ethical dogmas of the Marie Haspil - James Ehler ethical world).  Who cares if a child and often adults also are harmed in the process? This is their motto and creed. Now, I understand that there are some very troublesome emails and other documents like a conviction. No worry. Judge William Adams will find these documents irrelevant. He will also sanction opposing counsel for even mentioning them. Anything that doesn't favor his friends is irrelevant. Also, are there troublesome witnesses? No worry. Judge William Adams will quash the subpoenas, and he will sanction the attorney who issued the subpeonas.  Witnesses who testify against his friends are irrelevant.  He works closely with James Ehler and Marie Haspil. The bottom line is that any attorney who tries to present witnesses or documents against you will be destroyed.  No attorney can even believe a client contrary to your positions. Actually, if an attorney manages to get documents into the open that hurt your, that attorney will be destroyed.I know free advice is generally worth the price, but this advice is the exception.  It will absolutely work. It is priceless. You are responsible for getting these people into the necessary positions. I cannot help you with that. I know you have a lot of political power and influence.  Actually, I have heard there were a lot more pedophiles not just Sandusky which have been concealed. In any event, if you can get these people into the necessary positions, not only will you win for sure, but opposing counsel will be destroyed in the process. One side benefit is that Marie Haspil will effectively become co-counsel with Lanette Joubert.  Even though she is paid by the State of Pennsylvania or its bar she effectively will be working for you. It is a great set up. She will harass opposing counsel endlessly.  I remember reading in the paper about some attorney general lawyer  (I think the guy who tried the criminal case). He said something like: ""who believes children, we do.""  Well, that attorney will be the first to go. He'll be attacked within minutes of placement of your new legal and judicial team. Corruption is a wonderful thing when properly done. I know you tried the corruption thing, but you obviously didn't do it completely right. These guys know how to do it right.  They have many years of experience.Judge William Adams has been slightly distracted by the video of him savagely beating and cursing his daughter, but he'll undoubtedly survive based on corruption.  Maybe, you can put a few good words in for him with the Texas Judicial Conduct Commission. You'll probably have some pedophile friends in high places in Texas. Actually, if you get him appointed as a Pennsylvania judge, I guess he wouldn't have to worry about the Texas Judicial Conduct Commission any more.  The whole thing is a mutual win.

The details will be discussed later. There are real similarities to the corrupt Judge Adams hearing also involving William Dudley in the Jennifer Flores-Lamb case in 2010.There were false orders signed (withdrawn later) and I was accused falsely among other things by William Dudley and Judge Schuble in concert of a crime. An order disappeared from the court file. I produced a certified copy from my file. They started claiming in unison that my certified copy was forged which was a total lie. This didn't stop until a district clerk representative, a retired Marine ""Gunnie"" straight as an arrow, appeared and stopped the fraud. This was not the only time I was threatened. Of course, Stanley Rains was threatened repeatedly.  William Dudley and the others were claiming at the 2010 Jennifer Flores-Lamb hearing that it was absurd to believe that they would do something like the restaurant meeting (which involved according to the child an attempt to create false criminal charges). It was not absurd. These lawyers do this kind of thing. They have done it to me more than once and they have done it to my clients many times. Stanley Rains was repeatedly false accused of being a pedophile. His child was asked to lie about him in that way (she didn't). Discovery which would have proven that was denied (there were videotapes of the relevant interviews). There  are lots of similarities between the Stanley Rains case and the Jennifer Flores Lamb case, and only some are discussed right now.In any event, as part of that sequence of events, William Dudley and Judge Schuble involved the bar similar to what happened in the Jennifer Flores-Lamb case also involving William Dudley but instead of Judge Schuble Judge William Adams.  Judge Schuble smirked at a hearing stating ""we won't have court this afternoon because I know you have an appointment this afternoon"" referencing a grievance hearing.At the grievance hearing, Dr. Barbara Beckham a child psychologist testified about how the Court system had been abusing the child. Also, she had personally witnessed the mother of the child abusing the child. Dr. Beckham testified how the mother denigrated the father of the child in an extreme manner right in front of her. Of course, the mother could assume this was OK because she had witnessed the Court system do this for years. There was never any evidence this man did anything wrong. The supposed evidence was either absurd or fabricated mostly there was just insinuation. Again, this is very similar to the Jennifer Flores-Lamb case where these same lawyers insinuated a sexual relationship between the mother of the child and me based on completely innocent facts, made absurd inferences of mental illness of the mother, etc.  Dr. Beckham testified that William Dudley admitted to personally abusing the child.I was present when William Dudley made this admission. There was supposed to be a deposition of Dr. Beckham in the jury room. Before the deposition started, William Dudley asked her questions informally. After hearing her answers, he obviously elected not to take the deposition. She explained to him how damaging denigration of a parent to a child is to the child. She called it child abuse. He said ""well, then I abused the child.""Dr. Beckham also testified that the mother denigrated the father's lawyer to the child. She told the child that the father's lawyer was ""evil."" Of course, years later in the Jennifer Flores-Lamb case, the child told his mother that he was told that her lawyer was ""evil."" Again, there are huge similarities.After Dr. Beckham's testimony, there was a break. I sat next to Dr. Beckham and talked to her during the break. I know everything she seaid during the break.  Dudley did come by and have some kind of discussion with her. I don't remember  what was said. I do remember what was not said. After the break. Dudley told the grievance panel that Dr. Beckham had withdrawn her testimony during the break. I said that wasn't true. The panel chair was straight. He asked her back into the room. She fortunately had not left. She was asked if she had withdrawn her testimony, She said she had not. Dudley flat out lied in a way designed to corrupt the proceeding. Now, James Ehler was there. He was just a few feet away from me on the other side of the conference table. He was operating a video camera. I distinctly saw him smirk and possibly even chuckle.He was amused by Dudley's lie. I was not amused. The lying behaviors by Dudley and his affiliates Lanette Joubert and William Kelly had cost me countless hours and virtually stopped my life and driven me broke. The Stanley Rains case consumed virtually all my time. I was working almost completely pro bono. Stanley Rains was literally eating crackers. They had driven him broke.  They were abusing him, and they thought it was funny.  The hearings generally had a circus atmosphere. It was horrid. The poor man was arrested for trying to see his child in a completely legal manner. I personally heard the cop rousting him over the cell phone.  I wasn't going to let it stand. The criminal prosecution of Stanley Rains was bizarre. There was no crime. The jury literally laughed at times at the prosecution. The jury fore person gave Stanley Rains a hug after the trial.When Judge Schuble learned that Stanley Rains had been acquitted, his face was red as an apple. His face was the same color as Judge Adams' when he saw me talking to the MHMR ladies in the hall. I am pretty darn sure Judge Adams knew what the MHMR records would say before I told him. he had tried to conceal the extreme mental health issues of the child care provider used by the father. After I presented the records, incredibly, he said they were irrelevant. I wonder if he would want his child watched by a homicidal psychotic, etc. The whole thing was bizarre beyond words. After the hearing, he sent his ex wife a text message stating that she should call the police if she saw me and to not let the child walk home from school alone because I was a risk. There was no basis for that. He was being malicious. He was trying to set me up for arrest at the hands of his ex wife (she calls the police on me when she sees me at the grocery store or whatever). This is similar possibly to how they got Stanley Rains arrested (lies told behind the scenes). Judge Adams is a very dishonest and abusive man. There was no basis for that whatsoever. It was later learned that he had hired William Dudley around this time to represent him against his ex wife in a child custody matter. He had a huge conflict of interest.I digressed. I am apologize. In any event, after I saw James Ehler smirk when Dudley lied obviously enjoying the lie, I knew James Ehler is evil. They call me evil repeatedly for no reason yet I cannot call them evil? That is another double standard. They verbally abuse people without end but oh no if someone tells the truth about them it is unethical? No it isn't. The truth is the truth. They are evil. I filed a grievance against Dudley for lying to the tribunal. It was ignored. I then filed a grievance against Ehler because he has an ethical duty when he personally witnesses ethical misconduct. It was ignored. I learned that Ehler would ignore anything and everything filed by Rains including allegations of ex parte hearings (there were many), fabrication of evidence, etc. Ehler protected the corruption. The same occurred in the Stanley Rains case. According to Ehler, it is OK for a lawyer to physically assault an opposing litigant (among many other things). Lanette Joubert threw a deed at Jennifer Flores-Lamb's face.Judge Schuble was removed from the Stanley Rains case. I have a copy of the letter from Chief Justice Wallace. I don't think I am supposed to have it. I don't remember how I got it. I do remember generally that courthouse staff was appalled at how Stanley Rains was abused and they warned him of ex parte hearings and what not. I think someone gave it to Stanley. He claims Courthouse staff told him Judge Schuble was removed from the bench for two years (except for municipal courts and child support master and possibly a few other exceptions). I don't know about that personally but I know I didn't see Schuble again for several years. I know he had been a regular at the courthouse almost continuously for years.That's another pattern. Judges who do the bidding of the corrupt William Dudley, Lanette Joubert, and William Kelly tend to get hurt. Of course, Judge Adams has been hurt. I protect judges, but he dishonestly went for my throat. He attacked me for believing my child. My client was according to the child being set up for a crime (possibly myself also). The child was being told I was evil. The child was being told to lie in ways not only designed to get my client in trouble but me also. The child was told to lie that he saw his mother and me in bed together (a total lie). This was obvously designed to buttress a lie they had been telling for monts (including several totally corrupt motions of which Ehler approves). In one, the corrupt Lanette Joubert actually said I admitted to having a romantic relationship with my client, and yes I know she was playing word games but any reasonable person would read the motion that way.  The motions were frivolous both factually and legally. Ehler loves this kind of thing. When one judge denied the motion, she filed it with another. Kind of curious because she got an attorney sanctioned over $10,000 for forum shopping (using a judge who happens to be the mother in law of Larry Adams).I guess I digressed again. The point of this was supposed to be that James Ehler has a history of supporting dishonesty and corruption with these particular lawyers. He did it for years. Rains filed countless grievances all ignored (except one). Joubert had consulted with Rains extensively before representing Rains ex wife. Joubert appeared formally on behalf of Rains's ex wife several times but she was informally representing her continuously (these lawyers operate as a corruption team). They finally sanctioned her for that. I believe James Ehler was more involved than just handling the grievance after it was filed, and Judge Adams' text message clearly suggests this. Judge Adams was having communication with the bar according to his text message before he signed his corrupt orders.This case was unusual in that the bar was harassing me throughout the litigation. They essentially became co counsel with Lanette Joubert mimicking her frivolous arguments and asking questions on her behalf. This went on for months. Admittedly, I was not anywhere near at my best at trial because I was hounded for months, and I was very, very angry. Further, at the time of trial, Judge Adams was still assumed honorable, and I was operating under the shadow of his orders which unjustly denigrated me. Ofr course, later the beating video came out, and later it was learned that Judge Adams was operating under extreme conflict of interest (William Dudley was his lawyer at the time to get him custody of his child).These things are the reason I blame James Ehler more than Marie Haspil although I certainly blame her also. She was the point man (or woman), but Ehler was the boss and he has a history.  Ehler's name did appear on one document (I don't remember exactly the document). I complained. His name never appeared again openly, but again I mostly blame him whether right or wrong. I know he has ethical issues, and he is the boss.									",  Attorneys & Legal Services 
 Marie Haspil / James Ehler/ Corrupt Texas Bar ,"  Marie Haspil / James Ehler/ Corrupt Texas Bar  Congress Ave, Austin, Texas United States of America ", , ,"Marie Haspil / James Ehler/ Corrupt Texas Bar Lanette Joubert / William Dudley  Bar Supported Abuse of People Austin, Texas","										I am going to digress from the list of ""little"" lies for a moment and focus on the Bar Supporting the Abuse of People by unethical attorneys.My client suffered a physical condition that embarrasses her (hair loss). The grotesquely abusive mean spirited hateful Lanette Joubert would bring this up repeatedly. She would bring it up more than once in the same hearing. She would ask questions like ""So, you still don't have any hair."" She would repeatedly claim that this hair loss was some kind of evidence of mental illness. According to the abusive sick Lanette Joubert, everybody is mentally ill who opposes her. She for example said this about Stanley Rains even though there was absolutely no evidence of that. There are several points arising from this hateful behavior.  The bar supported this hatefulness. The bar supports this kind of hatefulness. I think James Ehler gets some kind of sick jollies at these lawyers hatefully hurting people. James Ehler found the abuse of Stanley Rains humorous. First, there was absolutely no evidence that hair loss is some how tied to mental illness. My client did suggest once that the stress of Joubert's endless litigation abuses wasn't helping, but suffering stress is a far cry from mental illness. It is hypocritical to say the least for Joubert, the Corrupt Judge Adams, and the Corrupt Texas bar to claim that I had no evidence of the restaurant meeting when I had a perfectly credible child, a child psychologist, restaurant waiters, and lots of facts and circumstances while Joubert is allowed to call a woman mentally ill based on hair loss. Joubert did this both at nonjury hearings and jury trial. Now, my client nearly died during child birth from a rare liver disorder. I did the research that this rare pregnancy related liver disorder does lead to hair loss. Her hair loss started after pregnancy. I presented an article from a respectable medical web site on the issue. Of course, Joubert objected saying it was not admissible which may have been true but the way they play the game is they make accusations based on no evidence whatsoever and then they expect their opponent to spend thousands of tens of thousands of dollars to disprove their dishonest accusation unsupported by any evidence whatsoever. In this instance, the accusation was mean spirited, hateful and totally abusive. The bar was unconcerned, and it ignored my client's complaint. These lawyers are allowed to abuse people with impunity. This is a pattern of abuse by the bar lasting a decade.Now, consistent with my decision to ""join them."" If they are allowed to misbehave this way, I will also. This is the kiind of behavior the bar approves. it disapproves of actual honest representation of clients. So, William Dudley has a long time pattern of needing to ""pee"" every five minutes during depositions. He says there is some kind of medical reason for this. Of course, it wouldn't be a tactic to disrupt depositions. In any event, I think this is evidence of mental illness. I will start saying this every 5 minutes as if it were a fact. The analogy is on point. Joubert took an embarrassing physical condition and made a ludicrous inference and used it to continuously abuse a woman. The corrupt bar couldn't care less.Second, the bar accused me of being abusive for calling Larry Adams and his client a fraud. There is a huge a difference. For one thing, of course, he was a fraud. He stole a child through fraud (his client also). The order written by Adams was materially different than the Order made orally in open court. He created new obligations that my client did not know about. Nobody forwarded the order to my client. The paper trail was perfectly clear that my client did not receive it until expiration of a deadline. My client could not comply with what he did not know about.  Larry Adams and his client refused to extend the deadline. They defrauded my client out of his child. There was a condition in the order created by Larry Adams (not stated orally in open court) that if my client did not comply with the conditions he did not know about he would suffer de facto termination of parental rights.  Larry Adams kept claiming that my client ""just doesn't follow court orders"" and also trying to distract the issue that my client was irresponsible in various ways.  The truth is that my client was defrauded. Larry Adams lied and he made it necessary to show the truth by his lying. Marie Haspil did the same thing. She told a judge that my client ""failed to follow"" the court order. That was a lie and she knew it so it was necessary to show the fraud involved.  It is one thing to gratuitously insult someone abusively and it is another thing to represent a client. The bar is either to stupid to see the distinction or it just supports abusive lawyers like Joubert and Adams. Of course, I think it is the second. The bar is corrupt and abusive and has been for years. James Ehler things calling people pedophiles with fabricated evidence is OK, he thinks lying about a supposed sexual relationship between lawyer and client is OK, abusing a woman about her hair loss is OK, etc.There is a pretty good rule of thumb that can be followed with respect to James Ehler. If he thinks something is ethical, it probably isn't. If he thinks something is unethical, it probably is not. The notion that he has testified in Court as an expert on ethics is obscene. He has no ethics.Actually, I think he knows the difference between right and wrong. He just doesn't care. The kindest explanation is that he is responsive to politics.  I am not sure whether in the Jennifer Flores-Lamb case he initiated the abuse or Judge Adams did because they seem to have been working together.

 Marie Haspil / James Ehler / Texas State Bar Corruption ,"  Marie Haspil / James Ehler / Texas State Bar Corruption  Congress Ave Austin, Texas United States of America ", , ,"Marie Haspil / James Ehler / Texas State Bar Corruption Lanete Joubert / William Dudley / Judge William Adams Lies, Lies, and More Lies Austin, Texas","										We have seen by now the really major instances of dishonesty and corruption by James Ehler and Marie Haspil with respect to the Jennifer Flores-Lamb case. Before moving on to the Larry Adams fraud case and the Stanley Rains corruption case also involving the corrupt bar, some smaller lies will be discussed. The smaller lies have great importance. First, there is the death by a thousand cuts that occurs when nearly everything said is a lie. Second, the smaller lies show the thorough dishonesty and corruption of the bar. Many of these lies are indisputable, and when there are so many the bar's bad faith becomes indisputable. The major lies are summarized.First, James Ehler and Marie Haspil participated in the lie that it is frivolous to believe a child. There is no such law. Children are believed in court, and there was nothing about this child that made him unbelievable. The fact is that the child reported a crime (witness tampering, solicitation of perjury, etc.). The child was very specific. There was a lot of corroboration both third party witnesses and a wide variety of circumstances and facts. The bar was covering up a crime. The bar has repeatedly over the years covered up misconduct by these lawyers. The fact is that an ethical lawyer had a duty to act on his client behalf when the child said these things, and the bar is totally corrupt and even criminal for covering up what the child said and attacking a lawyer who was representing his client. They should be in prison. This is not a small thing. They were setting this woman up for a false sexual allegation which could result in prison and certainly loss of her child. The notion that a lawyer should do nothing under these circumstances is corrupt beyond reason. This child's statements were recorded on video and audio several times, this child was interviewed by a child psychologist who believed the child, third party restaurant waiters confirmed the meeting occurred as described by the child (the day, general time, place, and even the table). The child knew things he could not have otherwise known (names he didn't otherwise know and details like unique boots he didn't otherwise know). The child was asked to lie in ways to support lies already being told (e.g. romantic or sexual relationship between lawyer and client). The bar particularly James Ehler and Marie Haspil were intensely corrupt in attacking a lawyer representing his client under these circumstances. It would have been totally unethical for the lawyer to ignore this woman and her child when there was obviously a very serious threat in progress.  The corrupt bar particularly the corrupt James Ehler has a long history of protecting these same lawyers from their lies, lack of ethics, and crimes.Second, the bar participated in the lie that it is unethical for a lawyer to subpeona obviously relevant witnesses and documents on behalf of his client. Obviously, the people the child identified as requesting that he lie are relevant in a proceeding on that very issue. The lying of these corrupt lawyers is totally shameless. There can be faith in the legitimacy of the legal system so long as such obviously corrupt lawyers are allowed to hold positions of responsibility. This lie of course is related to the first lie. Both lies were designed to cover up the solicitation of perjury reported by the child. This is not the first time this has happened. The same thing happened in the Stanley Rains case. The child reported she was being induced to lie about her father. Discovery was not allowed, and the bar corruptly supported the same corrupt lawyers in a similar manner. In that case, there was videotape of the ""interviews"" of the child at issue. The videotapes were never produced. The truth was concealed as here.Third, the bar participated in the lie that the child care provider used by the father was perfectly OK. The truth was that the child care provider was homicidal, suicidal, psychotic, heavily drugged, etc.  The mother testified that the child care provider had mental issues and explained why she believed that. The mother was ignored, because the proceeding was obviously corrupt. The requested discovery was denied. However, a subpeona had been issued on MHMR and the truth came out despite the lies and corruption (Lanette Joubert lied stating the child care provider was perfectly OK). The bar rather than showing concern at Joubert's dishonest (remember, James Ehler loves lies and liars) rather attacked the lawyer who discovered the truth on behalf of his client (another corrupt cover up).  The bar said he violated an order (he did not violate an order; the order only addressed medical records from the child care provider not from MHMR; further, he suggested that MHMR be addressed in the same order and was ignored). The bar said the records were privileged. They were not. Every arguably relevant privilege has an exception for child custody cases involving the welfare of the child. Most offensively, it attacked me for believing my client when my client had actually been right on this and every other issue including the matter at issue. Specifically, Lanette Joubert lied stating the homicidal psychotic would not be watching the child. This was a new position never taken before. She had previously said the homicidal psychotic had watched the child since birth and would watch the child in the future. You see according to the corrupt dishonest James Ehler and Marie Haspil, not only does Lanette Joubert have the right to lie, but she must be believed even when she changes her position. The bar literally sent me a letter two business days before trial demanding to know why I believed my client. That is corrupt beyond words. The bar doesn't care one flip about the public and the genuineness of representation but rather corrupt bar lawyers like James Ehler and Marie Haspil work to protect liars like Lanette Joubert and the fact that the result is endangerment of a child doen't matter to them. No Texas litigant can really expect genuine representation when you have corrupt bar lawyers behind the scenes attacking their lawyers for believing them. This is nothing short of corruption of the legal process.Fourth, the bar at least tacitly participated in the lie that this mother was involved in a sexual / romantic relationship with her lawyer. These abusive lawyers came very close to calling her a whore paying for attorneys' fees with sex (they certainly implied this). There was no factual basis for this. No, eating dinner together doesn't mean there is a sexual or romantic relationship. These lawyers have a long history of telling sexual lies, and the corrupt dishonest James Ehler has a long history of supporting there lies. This happened for at least years in the Stanley Rains case. The utterly corrupt James Ehler received a complaint from Stanley Rains because evidence was fabricated with respect to his penis (a lie was told that his penis was erect when that would be inappropriate). Specifically, an attorney lied stating that witnesses told her this. When the witnesses were finally cross examined, they denied not only saying this but they denied ever talking to the ad litem (until much later). Further, the lie was absurd on its face. The witnesses would need to have X-Ray Superman Vision to see the status of the penis through the car door, clothing, the child, etc According to the extremely dishonest and corrupt James Ehler, this didn't even state a claim. Fabrication of evidence (in other words lying) doesn't state a claim? James Ehler is corrupt to the core and his corruption hurts real people. In any event, since James Ehler thinks it is perfectly OK to go around lying about sex or making conclusions about sex on the most hair thin evidence or bizarre inferences, my thought right now is to join him not fight him.  At that hearing where he laughed when Dudley lied, attempting to corrupt the proceeding, it seems to me that there were romantic glances exchanged between Ehler and Dudley.  Those who lie and engage in corruption together I infer are sleeping together. There seemed to be an electric romantic and sexual energy in the air between the two of them. They are sexually involved. Go ahead and complain, James Ehler. You think it is  OK for these lawyers to abusively and repeatedly effectively call a woman a whore and a lawyer her John based on no real evidence. What goes around comes around, and you deserve this and a  whole lot more. You deserve no respect no matter how arrogantly you consider yourself respectable. You aren't. This is a good time to announce the romantic and sexual relationship existing between Ehler and Dudley. I don't really have any evidence, other than gut instinct, but like I said Ehler approves of this kind of lying, and I figure now that if I can't beat them I might as well join them. Now, although I may have left out a big lie, I proceed to the first little lie. My client owned the house as her separate property. Her parents gave the down payment to her (not her and her husband). This is documented by a contemporaneous gift affidavit and check.  Her separate property rights in the house were ignored because she was the designated ""screwee."" This was already done by the time I got involved. This was not really an issue because there were other more important issues. Lanette Joubert sent over a deed and asked that my client signed it. She did not send over a deed of trust to secure assumption. I drafted a deed of trust to secure assumption and made a minor revision to the deed.Specifically, I stated that the deed was subject to the deed of trust to secure assumption. The way the deed was drafted the deed of trust to secure assumption arguably would be ineffective if not filed before the deed. This request was entirely reasonable and appropriate.Lanette Joubert files a motion asking that my client and I be sanctioned for refusing to sign the deed. This was a total lie. There was a reasonable request for revision not a refusal to sign the deed. Lanette Joubert is a liar, and the bar supports her lying. She is constantly filing dishonest motions and she files a motion to sanction as part of nearly every filed document.The judge of course didn't grant the motion to sanction. This judge was acting honorably. I asked the judge to resolve the dispute over the wording of the deed. Joubert objected stating there was no motion on file. So, she not only lied about my refusal to sign the deed she obstructed efforts at judicial resolution. I was obviously acting reasonably.The issue was resolved when the two documents were signed simultaneously. I knew my runner was faster than hers and so my document would be filed first which would resolve the potential problem. As part of that meeting, Lanette Joubert threw a document at my client's face. Further, after my client signed a document, Joubert refused to allow my client to have a copy of what she just signed. Her behavior was atrocious.Well, months later, Joubert as part of her grievance to the bar lied again stating that I refused to sign a deed. The judge had not granted that motion. I showed the bar the letter where I agreed to sign the deed with a minor revision. The bar didn't care. James Ehler is a lover of liars.This is just one example of many. The bar loves lying and liars. However, the most shocking thing to me is that even though the bar knows that Joubert is a liar, it demands that I believe her rather than my client who has never lied. What kind of ethics is that? It isn't. It is corruption.									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Of course, if the child participates in their plot, the child's testimony is near gospel. There is no law to support the proposition that child testimony is ""fantasy"" which is exactly what these lawyers and this judge said (with no evidence at all that this child fantasized) and actually a very large amount of evidence indicating that he didn't. We have seen how the Bar represented by James Ehler and Marie Haspil participated in this fraud.The bottom line according to the these crooked lawyers, this crooked judge, and the crooked bar is that a parent who hears an outcry of ""horrific abuse"" (as described by a child psychologist) must ignore that outcry, even when the abuse involves setting the parent up potentially for prison. That of course is nonsense, and no honest lawyer would say such a thing. These lawyers are not honest. They are intentionally dishonest.We have seen a few more examples such as the lie that it is against the rules to subpeona a nonparty witness. Again, no honest lawyer would say such a thing. The only way to reconcile the bizarre positions taken by these lawyers, this judge, and the bar is to realize that they are just dishonest. These lawyers steal children based on fraud and other abuses, and the bar consistently supports them. It is corruption. It goes to the top of the bar. South Texas has been rated by at least one survey as one of the 5 top zones of legal corruption in the United States. It was rated more corrupt than even Chicago (an area legendary for its corruption). This would not be surprising when the top officials in the bar responsible for ethics are corrupt and dishonest to the core.  We will see how James Ehler thought that a lie to a tribunal designed to corrupt the proceeding was funny, how he found that fabrication of evidence was ethical, etc.  It should not be a surprise that one of the largest judicial / attorney corruption scandals in recent history is playing out right now in South Texas.  I personally complained about the District Attorney involved in that scandal. His office abused a client. The abuse included the District Clerk's Office (who would not produce pleadings and affidavits filed of public record). My client in that case committed suicide as a result of the corruption at issue (he killed himself when he was falsely accused of molesting his child). I believe that the opposing counsel in that case is one of the lawyers charged with bribing that judge (I am not absolutely positive -- it may be a lawyer with a similar name). James Ehler and Marie Haspil approved of Larry Adams stealing a child through blatant fraud.That is background. Now, the Jennifer Flores-Lamb case started when she was lied to at mediation by Lannette Joubert and William Kelly. They lied to her about the law. They said she would never be allowed to leave Corpus Christi for Austin. That was a lie. The law involves many factors and the ultimate decision cannot be predicted with certainty. A very good chance exists that she would have been allowed to leave. Lanette Joubert and William Kelly are close affiliates of several decades. Lanette Joubert was opposing counsel and William Kelly was mediator. Their close affiliation was not disclosed. Jennifer Flores-Lamb with my help complained about this lie.Lanette Joubert particularly took the position that I was unethical because I asserted my client's complaint without ""personal knowledge."" In other words, I did not see or hear what happened at the mediation personally. She filed multiple motions to sanction based on this.Of course, lawyers are not required to have personal knowledge. Lawyers generally don't. The prosecutor usually did not see the murder. The personally injury lawyer usually didn't see the accident. Actually, a lawyer with personal knowledge very often should not be involved in the case.  She turned the law absolutely ass backwards which is very common for her.Of course, Lanette Joubert almost never have personal knowledge with respect to her cases.  She claimed that Jennifer Flore-Lamb and her lawyer (me) were sexually or romantically involved (a lie), and she had no personal knowledge of that (she had no evidence at all; she was just lying). It is not really possible for a lawyer to be this incompetent. This kind of position comes from intentional dishonesty.  The legal system requires a certain minimal degree of integrity with respect to law and facts. When the system is working properly, many legal principles and facts are agreed and the focus is on disputed facts and law. There is nothing like that when these lawyers are involved. They create absurd law and complete lies. Yes, this does involve the bar. This was one of many frivolous complaints asserted by Lanette Joubert. It was not one the bar focused on but it was one included among many. This complaint is obviously corrupt. No lawyer acting with integrity would claim that opposing counsel is unethical because he doesn't have ""personal knowledge."" If that were true, nearly every lawyer in nearly every case is unethical. This is absurd. The bar ignored all of Lanette Joubert's abuses. It didn't care it supports her and her affiliates. The truth doesn't matter. This has gone on for over a decade.By this way, Lanette Joubert's position is just another way of saying that Jennifer Flores-Lamb didn't shouldn't be believed. Of course, she shouldn't be believed, her child shouldn't be believed, the restaurant waiters shouldn't be believed. You see, Lanette Joubert is some kind of corrupt nobility and her words cannot be challenged. That is corruption, especially when Lanette Joubert is thoroughly dishonest as this shows among many other examples some will be discussed but not all because that would take nearly the rest of my life because the examples are so numerous. In this very case, she indisputably presented false evidence as discussed (the homicidal psychotic child care giver). The bar of course doesn't care.Now, to make this situation even more absurd, the same Lanette Joubert who said I was unethical because I didn't have personal knowledge many times also many times said I was unethical because I did have personal knowledge. It doesn't matter what you do with these lawyers you will be unethical (unless you sell out your client). The bar is part of this and has been for at least a decade harming many, many children and parents.									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

YOU WILL BE WORSE OFF WHEN YOU HIRE BILL PALMER, Internet","										I made one of the biggest mistakes of my life, by hiring Palmer and Associates (bill palmer) to handle 2 of my personal injury cases. First, he did nothing in way of a settlement without my help. I had to resort to emails, because he would not answer my phone calls.Second, his staff i.e, paralegals? were incompetent. They did not even know how to contact the us bankruptcy court (defendants both filed chapter 7) They told me I was going to trial, and the had already motion the court for a stay (to continue) then, they stopped taking my calls. Third, Palmer did not know how to negotiate a medical lien with rawlings. I had to help him. Just liked I helped his office staff with the BK discharges of the defendants.Fourth, He will take all of your settlement, if he could. Fifth, We settled one, with my help and he billed me for all the costs. In other words, he commingled the costs of the first and second accidents and charged me.  Then he said, he would continue to do so.I fired him. HE would not withdraw as council. I had to file a motion with the court to have him removed.He then files a lien of 40% and costs, against the remaining case and my insurance.I settled with my insurance and the arbitrator award palmer $6,000. He never spoke with my insurance or did any work. SO, how to he manage to rob me of $6,000. The arbitrator is his friend, Mr James Jackson, that is how...Where in america can you get paid without doing any work? If your a lawyer in Las Vegas and have friends that are arbitrator's.The arbitrator should have recused himself.

Schenk I was forced by threay of suing me for these attorneys if i didn't accept a very bad settlement that was the result of a serious fall. They threatened to put a lean on my home if i didn't accept abou Chandler, Arizona","										I was injured about 6 years ago. A friend recommended Wattel & York to help me with my case. They said they'd take 1/3rd if I settled and 40% if I had to go to trial. After 3 years and constant x-rays ,therapy,and numerous other Doctor visits. It was time to either settle or go to court. I've interpreted personal injury cases before so I knew when they offered me only $35k for a legitimate injury that  it was not a fair offer.  I was to receive 2/3rd's but somehow my attorneys found away to up charge me an ex-tra 1/3 leaving me with a little over $12,000 so I told them I'd prefer to go to trial instead.Going to trial was originally given to me by my attorneys as an option. My attorneys threatened me! They said if I didn't accept the settlement that they'd put a lean on my home and then sue me for my home. I had already racked up so many doctor bills! I was affraid I'd lose my health insurance! I was losing work because the injury began to cripple me. I have x-rays to prove my case. I have arthritis thoughout my back due to being knocked down. They ignored my plees. I even said 1/3 isn't even a good % for all"" your"" efforts.They just wanted to settle ,collect and go on to the next case. So they found away to bilk me out of another 1/3rd. I've applied for disability-denied!!! They said, I'm not of the right ethnic background. Also to make matters worse , you consumers out there may not even know this. If you ever get a legal settlement(at least this happened with my health insurance company-Health Net of Az) once they are alerted that you have received any kind of $ from an injury case they will not pay anymore of your Doctor visits until you've spent the last dime of your settlement $. Forget about pain & suffering. They don't seem to have a formula for that so you have to spend all your settlement before they cover your next bill. Health Net raised my premiums 6-7x's and my deductable 3 x's with out any Birthday or any other real reason.. I couldn't afford health care anymore. I can't work anymore. I can't drive more than 1 hour without severe suffering. I gave up all sports that I loved. Insurance only takes your $. When you need help they find a way to deny you. I wish I would have takin these unscrupulous jaded attorneys to the State Board. It's too late now. They deserved to be disbarred,they ruined my life. I don't even have enough $ to try alternative medicine.  The problem is there are so many cases that are bogus, If people would stop clogging the courtrooms with illegitimate cases maybe someone like me could actually get a fair trial. Maybe the Attorneys would have believed me. I had x-rays and x-rays don't lie. What about the lady at Mc Donalds that dumped coffee in her lap? I'm sure she doesn't have a care in the world after winning all those millions. we do need Tork reform so that legitimate cases get a fair chance. All I can do now is give you all out there some advice that cost me my quality of life. 1) Interview many Attorneys. 2) Get referals of people who had simular cases and won. 3) If you don't get an attorney who is very sure he will win your case, don't sue. Yes, don't sue. As soon as your insurance finds out you are in litigation they immediately start raising your premiums. if you can't work( like me) you won't even be able to pay the co-pays. 4) most important don't go to Wattel & York. They gave me so much hope. Instead I lost my health, my health insurance, my hopes and dreams and most of all my dignity. I also paid into S.S all my life and they treat me like a homeless woman begging for what actually is a benefit I paid for all my life. What's even worse as you know in AZ. we have so many illegal aliens here and they get better health care than I do. That last statement is not meant to be political or remotely racist, I just want the same benefits that are permanent guests recieve. I was royally screwed by Health Net Insurance (BTW most Doctors don't accept Health Net anymore, I was told Access is far better) .Most of all I was totally railroaded by the Attorneys at Wattel& York. They cheated,strong armed me, and blackmailed me(with losing my home) into accepting an insulting offer,that thus far is less than $2,000 per year for a $200k injury thus far and I'm not near regaining my back health.

For anyone considering him as their attorney should read this.In my opinion, I believe that he is a crooked attorney and a devious person with zero understanding what co-parenting is for a father with his children.My Ex-wife and I never wanted a G.A.L (Guardian Ad Litem) but all of sudden my ex and I couldn't agree on anything so the Judge said he had someone volunteered to take our case on as a Pro Bono. So happened it was Eric L. Panzer. I thought well he is a FRED attorney so he will be fair to the father. WOW was I wrong, my first communication with him, he was very truss and disrespectful to me and my new wife. His first recommendation to the court was to to take my 50% custody away from me. Which he was successful based on his lies. Also, got the court to order that my daughter has zero communication with her Uncles, Aunts, grandparents, nieces and nephews. After this I was in awe of this recommendation and how the court allowed this. I was determined to find out. Within 4 weeks of getting the GAL my wife dismissed her attorney. Which was strange, so I dug deeper and found that my Ex-wife attorney is related to Eric L. Panzer through marriage. They both go to the same synagogue. So, happens my Ex-wife attorney referred him to volunteer as a Pro Bono in our case. Not to long after this I received a motion filed by Eric L. Pazner to have the court order me to sign an application for a passport for my daughter. I still had 50% legal custody of our daughter. I told the judge I had 50% custody and didn't feel a 9 yr old needed a passport to leave the security of the United States. He replies well I have 110% custody of your daughter and I order you to sign or I will sign it for you. Needless to say, I didnt sign and our daughter got a passport.I have documentation that I will be sending to the attorney grievance board that not only shows this but also show he has written and given legal advise to my ex. Not only does he represents our daughter, he also represent my ex-wife.  I hope and pray they take his license to practice law.I believe he has a dangerous drug problem as he show characteristic of cocaine use while in court. E.g jaw moving side to side and eye sunken in.There is speculation that Eric Pazner has touched his children, that is why he losted custody of his girls.With all the other good lawyers available, why would anybody call the Pazner Law Firm. If the other side recommends Eric L. Pazner as a GAL stay away!! You will never see you child(ren) again. He is an evil man with zero morales. His new title should be FREDE (Fathers Rights Essentially Dont  Exist) don't play with your children lives or feeling ....

 Marie Haspil / James Ehler / Texas State Bar ,"  Marie Haspil / James Ehler / Texas State Bar  Congress Ave, Austin, TX Austin Texas, Texas United States of America ", , ,"Marie Haspil / James Ehler / Texas State Bar Lanette Joubert / William Dudley Intentional Dishonesty, Fraud and Corruption Austin Texas"," The child identified among other William Kelly and William Dudley asking him to lie that his mother had ""touched"" him and that he saw his mother and her lawyer in bed together.As summary, the corrupt Judge William Adams, Lanette Joubert, William Dudley, William Kelly, Marie Haspil, James Ehler, and the Texas Bar generally took the position that it was frivolous for this mother to believe her child (same for her lawyer). This was a corrupt lie. There is no legal principle stating that children are not worthy of belief. Further, there was nothing about this child that made him unbelievable. Further, these lawyers and this judge commonly believe children including children much younger and less competent than this child. They fraudulently created a legal principle and then said it was violated.Further, they claimed that it was harassing and frivolous to subpeona the people involved in asking the child to lie. They claimed it was wrong to subpeona a non-party. There is no such law. That was a fraud. They also claimed they were ""irrelevant"" even though they were present when the crime at issue was committed. Total corrupt nonsense.Now, two of these lawyers were asked to produce professional writings including a book. Professional writings are commonly requested of professional witnesses. Nearly all books and other writings on examination of professional witnesses state that these types of materials should be obtained. Obviously, the purpose is to limit the witness and also to understand him to permit full and proper examination. These types of materials are requested of professional witnesses all the time. Some writings even suggest that it is malpractice not to request materials of this type.  William Dudley particularly took the position that I should be sanctioned because there was no such book. I was attacked on what evidence I had of such a book. Of course, that is lunacy. There is no requirement anywhere that I know something exists before I ask for it. Actually, the purpose of asking for it normally is to see if it exists. These rules are not called discovery rules for nothing. The purpose is to ""discovery"" what exists. Now, for nit-pickers, technically this was a trial subpeona not a discovery subpeona but loosely speaking the term discovery is applicable (there are a few rules that make a distinction which are not applicable for purposes of this discussion).This was a totally dishonest position for William Dudley to take. There is no basis for it anywhere in the rules. It was totally dishonest for the Judge and the Bar to take the same position. The bar is shamelessly dishonest and inconsistent. As just one example, during the course of the various cases, it sent various document requests for things it did certainly had no idea whether existed. Its document requests were proper because again it is not necessary to know whether something exists to ask for it.   Again, you have the situation of a nonexistent rule being created, and then I am attacked for vioating the nonexistent rule. William Dudley is the Judge's personal lawyer it is now know (a huge conflict of interest). This conflict of interest was never disclosed.It gets worse. You have the surreal experience of Lanette Joubert telling the judge that I needed to produce the book before they should have to produce it (these lawyers always act as a team; she wasn't asked for the book, but again they act as a team). How stupid is that? There are a few exceptions of course, but generally there would be no reason to ask for something that you already have. It doesn't get much more insane than this.But, it gets worse, although I am not required to prove something exists to ask for it, I did. I coincidentally had two witnesses present who had held the book in their hands. They got up and testified that they had seen the book, held the book, and where (the Nueces County Law Library). Yet, Judge Adams signs an order drafted by William Dudley stating that there was no evidence that the book existed.Think about how many witnesses were ignored: 1) the child, 2) the mother, 3) the restaurant waiters, 4) the child psychologist, and 5) the book witnesses. How many witnesses did they have? Zero other than themselves and their testimony was conclusory at best. None of these witnesses were impeached other than with sarcasm. William Dudley particularly has written numerous articles for the Bar relating to family law and procedure. Most are ""old"" before the year 2000 and difficult to find. I found a few and they were not particularly interesting and not well written. But, some I didn't find could easily have been useful. Of course, his writings would not say that it is frivolous to believe children -- that was a lie just for this fraud and would not be in a professional writing to be read generally by peers. His writings may have been useful to counter act his numerous misrepresentations of law is the point.  Even Judge Adams got to talking about how the ""book"" the witnesses saw may have been a compilation of articles. He admitted there may have been a book but it was sanctionable for me to ask for it?  There is no reason I should not of had it to assist with examination (an examination I was never able to really make by the way). It would have taken him about 2 seconds to grab it from whatever shelf he has it on if he still has it. This kind of wraps up the sanctioned imposed by Judge William Adams although it doesn't wrap up the dishonesty or fraud by him. This is a good time to summarize the sanctions. I was sanctioned for believing a perfectly credible child. I was sanctioned for issuing subpeona for obviously relevant witnesses (the people who asked the child to lie according to the child), and I was sanctioned for asking for professional writings of professional witnesses. The fact is every thing I did was completely proper.Actually, it would be malpractice arguably not to do these things. Actually, I have responded to grievances along the lines of 1) why didn't you subpeona witness X, 2) why didn't you subpeona document Y, and 3) why didn't you rely on witness Z. Of course, you can always do more, so these complaints in my view were unmeritorious. However, the point is that I was doing what I supposed to do as a lawyer. I was doing it without significant compensation to help an abused woman and child.My conduct was exemplary. Why was I attacked? For one thing, William Dudley was Judge William Adams' personal lawyer with respect to his plan to get custody of his daughter. This was a huge conflict of interest. Judge William Adams by ordering me to pay Dudley thousands of dollars was ""paying"" his personal lawyer. Also, he was supporting the ""credibility"" and methods of his personal lawyer.But, there is more. I have seen over the course of over a decade James Ehler support this abusive and dishonest lawyers. I have seen him look the other way at extreme unethical conduct by them including for example fabrication of evidence. I personally saw him smirk and laught as William Dudley got caught telling a black and white lie during a proceeding. I don't know all the corrupt dynamics at play. It might be best characterized as politics or it could be some personal relationship, but whatever the Bar acting through James Ehler looks the other way at extreme misconduct by these lawyers, and any time someone tries to stand up to the frauds of these lawyers he attacks their victims.In any event, I went into that hearing to protect my client from a false sexual allegation in progress (actually more than one). First, according to the child, he was being asked to lie that his mother ""touched"" him. Second, they had been lying for months that there was a sexual relationship between the mother and her lawyer (me). I was just asking they be ordered to stop (a pretty darn reasonable request). I was trying to protect my client and myself from several bad things in progress including potentially including prison. I left with over $10,000 in sanctions and I was obviously being set up for trouble with the bar (this was evident in roughly the first 5 minutes of the hearing). It is now known the bar and Judge Adams were probably doing ex parte before the hearing (which is unethical). The bar has never denied that and asserted bogus privileges to avoid discovery on that.Hopefully, it should be more than evident why I am upset about this. However, this is not just about me. This is about the public. There can be no way any member of the public can have confidence of justice when lawyers and the bar act so corruptly. I was offered the opportunity to continue practicing law if I admitted I was wrong. I refused. Someone needs to oppose evil and corruption like this and that someone is me.I have already had some success. I cannot take complete credit but I contributed to some extent together with both Jennifer Flores-Lamb and Stanley Rains. We testified before the  Sunset Commission about the Judicial Conduct Commission. It never made the news because the recommendations at issue were made low key orally rather than in writing, but the Sunset Commission made three recommendations for new laws to make the Judicial Conduct Commission more responsive and accountable to the public. The commission will need to give written explanations for its decisions. It will need to hold annual meetings for public comment. I cannot remember the third one right now.

Michigan","										I want to tell you about a guy that actually thinks that he is Macomb County judge material.  The other day I attend court with my husband.  This, John Temrowski, character is suing my husband for defamation of character.  Thus far, he hasn't gotten anywhere.  Anyways, he is also my husband's ex-wife's divorce attorney.  There was also a show cause hearing for a later time that day as well against my husband.  My husband is behind in Child Support as almost all of his money has had to go towards hiring attorneys to have the FOC enforce the written visitation order that his ex-wife has completely disregarded.  And that is a fact, no doubt about it.  Anyways............My husband was ordered on June 13th by the Friend of the Court judge to produce any and all documents of people that he owes money to within 14 days.  Mr. Temrowski is very concerned to see if my husband has any more money for him to get before he pursues his case.  Per the judges order, my husband sent the loan notes to Mr. Temrowski on the morning of the 25th.  He had other papers to send Mr. Temrowski as well so he waited until he got them all together and had them sent out certified mail.This IDIOT comes up to me and says in his little mousy, cowardly voice, ""Mrs. Blank, you've been served.  And you better show up or you will have a warrant out for your arrest""  It was a subpoena for me to give a deposition.  Then he cowers off into the outside hallways.  As soon as he leaves, we get one attorney who passes us a yellow POST IT note first, and tells us that what he did was completely improper and not a valid form of service.  As soon as we read this, ANOTHER attorney taps my husband on the shoulder and tells him the same thing.  My husband tells that man that 'yes' he knows and makes a comment about how Mr. Temrowski is running for Probate judge in Macomb county.  They both chuckled.   One made a comment about how he has a lot to learn before he ever becomes a judge.I might also remind you that not only was the subpoena served improperly but it was requesting me to provide a loan letter that was ordered of my HUSBAND not me AND it was already on it's way to his office within the 14 days ordered by the judge.  No way in hell, am I missing a day of work for a new job for something that was 1.) not my responsibility and 2.) already provided to him and 3) not properly served.Meanwhile, and this tells you further what a slime ball this man is.  He is sneaking up to the 6th floor and telling the Macomb FOC that my husband has failed to appear and that he must pay $1802 but the end of July and that he owes Mr. Temrowski another $500.  After our hearing was concluded, we went up to the 6th floor and get the whole run down by the nice lady at the desk about how Mr. Temrowski told my husband that he has to appear upstairs or else he would be in contempt.  I sat right there, side by side, with my husband.  He did say that 'why don't we go upstairs and take care of the show cause motion first since they are not quite as backed up?'  But, as Mr. Temrowski is, he twisted his words to his own advantage.  I have been with my husband for over five years and have gone through all of this with him.  I've seen every dirty trick that this man has pulled.  My husband hasn't seen his son in almost two years because of all the red tape that both his ex-wife and Mr. Temrowski have put him through.  You would think that this young boy has been molested or abused in some way.  But the way he got it all started in the beginning of 2011 was to send the order of the judge to speak with all parties, my husband and his ex-wife, to his parents' home.  He knew that my husbands' parents were on vacation for over three weeks and that my husband would never get the notice in time to appear.  The Friend of the Court had our home in Walled Lake listed as our residence.  So why would you send a court order to his mommy and daddy's house in Troy?  From that point on, it took my husband about three months to save the money to hire an attorney.  Finally, in October/November of 2011 my husband was required to see his son in a facility for parents that basically have either abused their children or didn't even now they were the daddy for the first two years of their life.  At least that's how my husband described it.  After that experiment didn't work out and his ex-wife refused to bring his son for further visits, even after she was ordered by the court a SECOND time to comply, then they went to a deal where my step-son needed to see a psychiatrist to deal with the trauma.  My husband had to sign the consent papers and agree to split the cost of any co-pays.  I was with him when he signed all of the papers in his attorneys office in January of 2012.  Well, Mr. Temrowski received the papers and just said he didn't get them.  The visits were terminated as a result and we didn't find out until JUNE 2012 that my husband's son only attended TWO visits and then cancelled.  I remind you, my husband never got a phone call, nor his attorney, nor anything mail correspondence to state that there was any problems.  Granted this was at least 3-4 months since this order had been placed but, as we have learned to expect with the Macomb County Friend of the Court, everything takes a long time.I am basically filing this report as more of a PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT.  If you ever deal with JOHN F TEMROWSKI, then you are deal with a real crook that should have been disbarred from the State of Michigan quite some time ago.  I have heard through the grapevine, that Mr. Temrowski has already been either disbarred, disappeared or simply failed to renew his license from several other states.  And if the later is true, why would an attorney not renew his license?  But hey, GO VOTE JOHN TEMROWSKI FOR MACOMB COUNTY PROBATE JUDGE!!!Woohoooo!!!!",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Then when I asked for an update, his response is asking for more money and he did not take care of the matters I came to him and paid him for. Then 1 of the matters he finally addresses, which he told me the first part of the year he was submitting, the vacate motion, he just tells me he is just submitting, clueless as if he did it or not. Then I ask about all of the erroneous charges and not doing what he was hired for, he tries to justify and refuses to return my money. I hired him for critical matters and if he wasn't capable or going to do exactly what I retained him for he should not have taken my case. Everything that I came to him was critical and time sensitive. I requested an invoice from him as he had not sent me anything, he forwards me several emails about replenishing my account with more funding and then gives me invoices with all of these erroneous charges with a lot of charges for phone calls/emails and requesting repetitive documents and charging me every time he spoke with me by phone. He never informed me of any of this. He has refused to do what I hired him for and has the nerve to have taken my money and saying I owe more. I informed him of my situation financially and he knew that what I retained him for was critical. If he was not able to do he should have not taken my money and just said that he could not assist. I am elderly, loss my son and spouse, responsible for a lot financially. I explained this to him. He took my check for $2000.00 and told me he would start as soon as he cashed, he didn't. He took my next check for $1,500.00 and still nothing.  It's so much I want to explain. When I asked him to return my documents, which I initially told him, I did not want him to keep, he told me, he wasn't returning them, that I owe him more money, when he never did what he was suppose to. Then when I stated, you have conjured up more fraudulent charges and you know when we spoke you agreed to scan my documents and return them. So he finally said he would return and send an invoice, when he is the one should be returning my money. I have e-mails showing what I went to him from as well as the invoices he conjured up last week when I requested. I am so upset and hurt that he can take advantage as he did. When he took my money he told me that he would take care everything we discussed and he does this. Brad became very nasty when I requested my documents, he assumed at that time he definitely wasn't getting any more money so he sends me an emailed saying he no longer represents me. He is a thief and he preys on the elderly.									",  Attorneys & Legal Services 
 Marie Haspil / James Ehler / Texas Bar / Texas Judicial Conduct Commission ,"  Marie Haspil / James Ehler / Texas Bar / Texas Judicial Conduct Commission  Congress Ave, Austin, TX Austin Texas, Texas United States of America ", , ,"Marie Haspil / James Ehler / Texas Bar / Texas Judicial Conduct Commission Lanette Joubert / William Dudley / William Kelly Introduction to Commentaries and Case Studies Austin Texas, Texas","										 They Why?This is not revenge. This has nothing to do with the damage done to me. This is done out of a sense of public responsibility. I have seen people hurt very badly, and I have seen a corrupt legal system.It is unacceptable to me to have lawyers and others asking a child to lie about his parent especially in ways designed to destroy the parent.  I have ""seen"" this several times all involving the same group of lawyers. It is unacceptable to me to have lawyers abusing people financially and in other ways. I have ""seen"" this more than once and the worst offenders are the same group of lawyers.  It is unacceptable to me to see fraud, and I have seen this multiple times again the same group of lawyers. The worst case of fraud involved Larry Adams who stole a child with a fraudulent order.These things have occurred over the course of over a decade. These things for most of this time have dominated my life not allowing me to live a normal life as a lawyer. The abuse has been horrendous both abuse of clients particularly Stanley Rains and Jennifer Flores-Lamb and myself.I have seen a couple of judges cooperate in these things, but the Bar Association has consistently participated in these things. The bar is corrupt and dishonest to the Core. The main offender has been James Ehler and a recent addition has been Marie Haspil, but the corruption and dishonesty goes to the top levels of the bar. The bar in Austin knows of the corruption and dishonesty involved, and it has done nothing. I spoke to one investigator in Austin extensively, and he didn't dispute anything I said. His main reaction seemed to be mild amusement.As just one example, you have an honorable woman repeatedly falsely sexually maligned. It was a malicious and not grounded in evidence. Her child then tells her that his father's lawyers and others asked him to lie that his mother ""touched"" him improperly and he saw his mother and her lawyer in bed together. The first requested lie corresponded to a regular practice by these lawyers, and the second corresponded to the false sexual accusations against this woman and her lawyer for months. This was a very serious situation. The child reported a crime (witness tampering). The crime was designed to possibly put the woman in prison and certainly further malign her falsely in the civil litigation. They were involving her lawyer in the allegations, and he could be further involved. These lawyers regularly involve the police in their cases. The bar without any doubt conspired with corrupt Judge William Adams and the corrupt lawyers at issue to cover up what this child said. There can be debate whether the bar joined the conspiracy, either before or after the judge signed the corrupt orders at issue, but the bar certainly joined the conspiracy, and the bar committed a crime.It is certainly not true that it is frivolous to believe a child. That is just a lie. There was clearly a total disdain for the law and the truth by the corrupt bar. There was a lot of communication. The bar was briefed on both the law and the facts. The bar was asked questions like ""why is it frivolous to believe children generally"" and ""why is it frivolous to believe this particular child."" Of course, it is not frivolous to believe children generally, and there was nothing about this child that made him unbelievable.  Actually, both parents testified that he was honest and intelligent. Again, the bar didn't care about the truth or the law. The bar could not and did not respond. It was intentionally corrupt.What would be the alternative? The lawyer just ignores what the child said?  The lawyer either ignores the child (and the mother also) without explanation? Or, the lawyer tell the truth, specifically, I cannot represent you on this issue because the bar is corrupt. Yes, you might go to prison. You will almost certainly lose your child, but there is nothing I can do for you. The bar is corrupt, and if I help you, I will be destroyed.That simply is not acceptable. That is pure corruption. The mother had a right to believe her child, and the child had a right to be believed. There was nothing even close to genuine legal process or truth seeking. What happened was a lynching not grounded in evidence or law. It was along the lines of I dare you believe that child rather than us because he are Board Certified Family Super Lawyers. That is pure corruption. It was later learned that one of the lawyers who asked the child to lie was the judge's personal lawyer and friend.  This conflict of interest was never disclosed.The judge could have been biased without complaint. If he had patiently listened to the evidence and then said he didn't believe the child, there would have been nothing said. Instead you had this circus, where he attacks the mother for subpoenaing witnesses, he attacks her for believing her own child, he ignores blatant falsehoods presented by the father's lawyer, he ignores the welfare of the child, and he devastates this mother and her lawyer both financially and their reputations because they defended themselves from a conspiracy revealed by the child designed to put the mother into prison (possibly, her lawyer also) and certainly to falsely accuse her of a very serious crime.When you have a judge and the Bar Association saying that this mother was not entitled to representation under these circumstances and attacking her and her lawyer for defending themselves, they are not playing by the rules. They are being corrupt. Further, it is not just minor corruption, it is very major corruption. James Ehler is a repeat offender. He has been corrupt several times over the course of a decade.That is just one situation and it is only part of even that one situation. The point is just to show the seriousness of the situation. No honorable lawyer would do nothing in light of corruption and dishonesty, corruption, and criminality of this magnitude.The bar as represented by James Ehler and Marie Haspil have zero professional integrity. You cannot reason with them about the law or the facts. They don't care. I spent a lot of time trying and they never meaningfully responded. Trying to reason with them is like trying to reason with a brick wall.  Nobody should say that the method I am using is wrong because I should have reasoned with them. I tried for well over a year. The same applies to their supervisors in Austin. There is no professional integrity whatsoever.Further, they are simply abusive. As just a few examples, they claim I didn't follow rules, but they wouldn't identify any rule I violated. They claimed I didn't tell the truth about something but they would say what. They claimed I caused unnecessary expense but they wouldn't explain how. Each of these positions was 100% opposite the truth. The opposition attorneys butchered the rules, caused immense unnecessary expense, and lied repeatedly (in very offensive and hurtful ways). The bar sent stacks of documents with no pertinence whatsoever. In one instance, they sent a stack of ancient child support modification orders, citations, etc. having not significance whatsoever while refusing to produce anything pertinent or give good faith answers to interrogatories. The bar as represented by James Ehler and Marie Haspil are the worst of the legal profession. There is nothing that was going to be accomplished through the bar. The bar acting through James Ehler and Marie Haspil is thoroughly corrupt and abusive. Marie Haspil effectively became co counsel with opposing counsel Lanette Joubert making the same utterly frivolous arguments during the entire pretrial time period. Just two days before trial, Marie Haspil demands to know why I believed my client instead of Lanette Joubert. This was obviously designed to disrupt trial preparation but further it was corrupt. A lawyer is supposed to believe his client, and this client particularly deserved to be  believed. It was total and absolute corruption for the bar to attempt to intimidate a lawyer into disbelieving his own client. This was particularly absurd given the fact that Lanette Joubert was demonstrably dishonest (she had been caught telling a whopper of a lie) and the client's position was the same as the fathers even Joubert's (her position flip flopped but her position was the same as my client most of the time). Of course, the client ended up being right. The bar is corrupt when it takes sides in litigation threatening a lawyer for believing his own client. This type of behavior is simply not acceptable.The Judicial Conduct Commission of course had no problem with Judge Adams abusing this woman and her lawyer with obviously corrupt rulings even after it came out that he had a massive conflict of interest and even after it came out that he sent a text message to his ex wife the same day he signed his corrupt orders tellng massive lies about me. He  not only accepted the unsubstantiated lie not supported by any evidence that I was sexually involved with my client but inferred therefrom that I was physically dangerous, etc. It just goes on and on. The bar was right in the middle of all this corruption, and there is substantial reason to believe it was part of the conspiracy from the start. Specifically, Judge Adams' text message tends to indicate that.The point is that there is no remedy with the bar and there is no remedy with the Judicial Conduct Commission. If they did there jobs, which they clearly don't, these issues could be resolved ""through channels"" but since they don't do their jobs, the only source of remedy is appeal to the public.  These postings are just preliminaries. I am trying to get the story told immediately to protect the public from further abuses by these corrupt lawyers and the corrupt bar. The corrupt lawyers are probably ""giddy"" with their success at using the corrupt bar to destroy their opposition and there will be more victims. I suspect few lawyers will even fill safe in representing their clients against the abuses of these corrupt lawyers because they know what the corrupt bar does.Now, it is true that there was real signs of hope in the litigation process. The judge in the slander case filed against Judge William Adams was acting fairly.  The judges in the grievances proceedings were acting fairly. The judge in the Bill of Review proceeding was acting fairly.  I am saying that the bar as represented by Marie Haspil and James Ehler is totally corrupt, and I am saying the Judicial Conduct Commission is useless.  I am saying Judge William Adams is totally corrupt. I am not saying all judges are corrupt. I do have a complaint against the Thirteenth Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court but I will leave that alone for the moment. The fact is though that was so worn down financially and otherwise by nearly 2 years of abuse by these lawyers  and the bar (12 years if the Stanley Rains case is included) that I lost my ability to function. I also lost all my financial ability to litigate. I think I could have prevailed in the litigation if I had the resources. I didn't have the resources. I could barely get out of bed for a long time, and I am only slowly recovering. I have to fight back in the only way I can. Again, this is not for me, though, this is for the public. I cannot tolerate this kind of corruption particularly when it comes to children. The evil is just too great. I will not stand silent. I don't give a flip about whatever the bar can do to me in the future. I am going to tell the truth.  The only thing necessary for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing.Part of the truth will be told in these internet postings and ultimately a more complete statement of the truth will be told in a book. What do I expect? At the very least, I can start a ripple, and this is enough. It is better than standing silent in the face of evil.									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

In 1989 I left the state with the children to California and then to Oregon, which Oregon should of had Jursidication at this point. I sent children to Mothers in Michigan in summer of 1992. She went in to Michigan court and filed for custody and Michigan ordered it with support against me. I had no support during 1989-1992 against her. they wouldnt do it because they didnt like me. they dropped the ball again as usual. so at this point she owes me for 2 and a half years with a extra child of hers.During her custody years of the children from 1992-1994, she abused and neglected the children and i regained custody again. I had to rescue them in Michigan from  her abuse/neglect of the children. Again, no support order was ever put against the mother. I have had the kids since Dec. 1994 to their legal ages of 18.

While she has skated her whole life with no support order! i rescued them from her documented abuse, neglect, and welfare fraud,they did nothing. now after 18 years they are, giving her monies for neglect. she had them 2 years i had the 15 years and im owed nothing. if i owe 25,000 she owes me 120,000. if she paid me i could of paid them. so they want me to pay three times for raising my kids,,and charge me surcharges while i have the kid for all those years. and she skates again, and is proud of it because the courts allowed her to be proud of almost killing my kids. i arrived in michigan in the middle of december to rescue them because i got a call they hadnt eaten in 3 days and they havent seen there mother in a month,,mind you my childrens ages were 3,5,. i thought some one killed the bitch so i dropped everything and went to there home to check it out from oregon. when i got there they had the door wide open cuz it wouldnt shut to much stuff piled in the way. 3 oclock in the morning i got there.then i proceed to look for them and they were cuddled up in a pile of dog and cat feces ,and garbage pile. the whole house was 3 to 4 feet high of garbage. i started balling when i got them to come out of the pile of garbage. no heat, power ,,food,, or water,,and shes on welfare. so i went to a hotel and got them cleaned up and they were malnourished and a wreck, my two beautiful kids punished by her and the state. so i called the state and told them how i found them and they came and arrested ME for non support and caused my kids more trauma at the hotel room. i gave them there bullshit 500 to get out after spending 4 days in jail and they put my kids in foster care in the mean time. then they said i could not leave with the kids until i signed off charges for abuse and neglect on her. why was i suppose to do that? i dont know, so i did so i could leave the state of michigan under duress to sign., back to our residence in oregon. i never got any credit for saving them or my trip and she skates again. so at that time i owed them like 8,000 for the two years and now it went up to like 30,000 .i tried on numerous occasions to get a order on her and they never got it done. so how can 1 person have to pay and not the other. and now they say like 11,000 is owed to her. like im going to pay her for leaving my kids for dead and using all the welfare money and food stamps for her drug habit. now shes selling presciption drugs on the street here in oregon and still skates. i would love to sue the state for what they put my family through. they caused permanent damage to my kids and myself. how much more can a person take? they suck and i need help from someone,,i have enough to hire someone if they read this. i have proof for everything i have said i have saved all of my documents from the begining. so government agency the friend of the court,,i motion to change there name to enemy of the children!!!!",  Attorneys & Legal Services

 Texas State Bar / Marie Haspil / James Ehler ,"  Texas State Bar / Marie Haspil / James Ehler  Congress Ave, Austin, TX Austin Texas, Texas United States of America ", , ,"Texas State Bar / Marie Haspil / James Ehler Lanette Joubert / William Dudley / William Kelly Case Study No. 3 / Attorney and Judicial and Bar Lying Austin Texas, Texas"," BackgroundLanette Joubert, William Dudley, William Kelly, and Lanette Joubert told a judge that they needed to depose the lawyer for the mother of the child David Sibley for 10 hours.  It turns out their primary purpose for the deposition was asking whether the lawyer had sex with his client.David Sibley testified that he had not. He also testified that he had not kissed her. He testified he had held her hand. He testified that this happened at the child's demand. Essentially, the child ran down the sidewalk in front of his mother and her lawyer. He turned around and shouted ""hold hands"" so they did. Later, it was added that they had held hands in church during prayer. He also testified that he and the mother had eaten dinner together and gone to sea world (with a group of about 7 people all together) and had gone to Oyster Fest (again with a group of people).There is of course nothing wrong with a lawyer and client socializing.  These facts somehow became evidence of lawyer and client involved sexually. Two motions were filed to disqualify. After one judge denied a motion to disqualify, the motion was refiled with a second judge. The second motion was particularly dishonest because it claimed the lawyer admitted to a romantic and sexual relationship. The wording was ""tricky."" The first sentence is an accusation of such a relationship. The second sentence said the lawyer admitted to the ""personal relationship.""  In context, it was obvious that the ""personal relationship"" referenced was a romantic / sexual relationship not just innocent socializing which was actually what was admitted.   The allegation of a romantic / social relationship was a lie not supported by evidence. Eating dinner together is not evidence of sexual relationship, and neither is innocent socializing or going to church and what not. The allegation was a lie.The dishonesty was deeper though than merely the lie of a romantic / sexual relationship. Two motions were filed seeking disqualification based on this lie. The fact is that even if the lie were true, it would not be grounds for disqualification. There no reason a lawyer cannot represent a girlfriend, wife, or other person significant to him (without more). There was never additional facts alleged which would create grounds for disqualification (e.g. the lawyer was a witness of facts favorable to the opposition who would be deprived of that evidence by the lawyer's status as attorney in the case; there was no allegation of any such evidence the lawyer had).This lie was told for at least two reasons. First, the hope was to have the mother's lawyer disqualified leaving her helpless. Fortunately, Judge Adams was not the judge with either motion to disqualify. These lawyers repeatedly make frivolous motions, but the judges who the motions were straight. Second, this was done to harass the mother and the lawyer. The mother was portrayed as a whore, and the lawyer as a sleazy family lawyer. These lawyers work as a slander team (Lanette Joubert, William Dudley, William Kelly, and Larry Adams), and they spread their slander throughout the legal community. This lie was particularly offensive to this woman who is very religious and they were accusing her of what she believes is a very serious sin. It was very offensive to the lawyer for a different reason. He was representing this woman who was obviously being abused by these lawyers largely pro bono (without compensation). Lawyers are supposed to do this. He was acting positively and ethically and these lawyers through their lies characterized him as sleazy.The corrupt Judge Adams escalates the lying. He sends his ex wife a text message stating that the lawyer was involved with his client. He makes the incredible inference that the lawyer is physically dangerous because he is involved with his client. Well, if a man has a girlfriend, he is physically dangerous? That is stupid or insane. It just doesn't follow. You have several levels of dishonesty and insanity. If two adults go to dinner, it means they are sexually involved? Further, it means one of them is physically dangerous? That is just nuts. These people are unethical or crazy or both. Judge Adams literally told his ex wife to not let his daughter walk home from school alone the lawyer could be a danger to her. You know saying that is slanderous beyond belief. It is also ironic. Judge Adams later it is learned is a child beater. The lawyer had never hurt any child. Along these same lines, Judge Adams refused to believe the child because children are ""fantasizers"" absent a video of what the child described. Well, the judge's daughter had a video. Good for her. The notion that there must be a video is known nowhere in the law. Of course, a video is good, but it is not required. Most criminal prosecutions for example do not involve videos. The prosecutions are mostly based on witnesses and sometimes physical evidence. Imagine if a witness identifies the criminal defendant as having done some crime let's say burglary and the defendant then says the witness is not entitled to belief because there is no video. That just doesn't fly, but that is exactly what Judge Adams did. Again, it is ironic justice that his daughter did have a videotape.These lawyers repeatedly lie about sex. The biggest example would be the Stanley Rains case where they lied for years (they didn't have any evidence). These lawyers were caught fabricating evidence in the Stanley Rains case (which will be discussed later). The corrupt Texas State Bar represented by James Ehler said that fabrication of evidence does not state an ethical complaint.AnalysisThe child said these lawyers were asking him to lie that he saw his mother and her lawyer in bed together. The judge and these lawyers took the position that this was ridiculous, and the child was a fantasizer.  However, it is not ridiculous, these lawyers had been claiming groundlessly that the mother and lawyer were sexually involved for months. The child did not know about the lies being told and probably did not fully understand sexual concepts (at age 5 nearly 6). However, he says he was told to lie in ways designed to support the sexual lies being told. This of course strong cooborates what the child said. As noted previously, children are competent witnesses absent showing of incompetency. This particular child was extremely competent.The same Judge Adams who would not believe the child absent videotape of what the child described had no trouble believing the lie about a sexual or romantic relationship not only with no videotape of that but with no witness or anything just very strained inferences (obviously, it is absurd to infer that people are having sex because they eat dinner together; it is not unusual at all for lawyer and client to eat meals together and they aren't all having sex). The judge in addition to believing this absurd inference adds additional absurdity (e.g. the lawyer must be violent because he is supposedly having a relationship with his client).  It is not really possible for the judge to this stupid. You don't get through law school and the pass the bar being this stupid. He is just being maliciously dishonest. By the way, he told his ex wife to call the police if she even saw the lawyer (who lives essentially in the same small town as her). That is trouble stirring and malicious beyond belief. There is a history of strange police behavior when these lawyers are involved. This is probably a good example of how this happens. Malicious lies are told behind the scene which stirs up trouble with the police. This is particularly dangerous when a judge is doing it. As for the bar, they died nothing. In fact, the protected this harassment. These lawyers were obviously harassing and causing unnecessary expense.  If they weren't lying to the tribunal, they were making retarded inferences to the tribunal (the tribunal was being retarded also). They ignored this abuse which is just a small part of the total abuse. They attacked the victims which is a pattern lasting a decade which will be very evidence when the Stanley Rains case is directly addressed.  Essentially, as will be seen over and over again as these discussions continue, these lawyers are allowed to be as abusive as they wish and their victims are attacked.This woman should not have been attacked repeatedly for supposedly having sex with her lawyer the implication being she did it essentially as a whore to pay attorneys' fees with no evidence of that whatsoever just strained abusive inferences. The lawyer should not have been attacked either. They should not have had to deal with multiple frivolous motions to disqualify.  The bar actually joined the unethical attacks of this woman and her lawyer attacking both during the course of litigation including 2 days before trial and probably during the trial itself.

The standard of competency is low. If the child knows his name, colors, etc.,, he is competent. This doesn't mean that the fact finder will believe him, but it means his statements are proper evidence for consideration.Courts, prosecuting attorneys, police, CPS, etc. commonly believe children. Further, children are commonly believed in civil litigation particularly litigation relating to child abuse.A mother not only has the right to believe her child but she should according to CPS.  If a mother ignores reports by the child of child abuse, CPS considers this an issue sometimes requiring intervention. Of course, the most obvious case would be if the child reports sexual molestation by the mother's boyfriend and the mother ignores this.  In some cases, this should even be grounds for termination of parental rights.The child at issue in this case was not even arguably incompetent. The child reported what a child psychologist characterized as ""horrific"" child abuse. Specifically, the child reported that lawyers and others were asking the child to lie that his mother had ""touched"" him and he saw his mother and her lawyer in bed together. The child's statements were recorded multiple times including by the psychologist. The child's statements were extensively investigated. The child said he was at a specific restaurant at a general time on a specific date and sat a specific table (he even described which side of the table). He said his father was with him and various other people. These things were confirmed by the restaurant waiters (not the exact identities of the people but the number and general description). The child was taken to a child psychologist, and he told her the same thing. She believed he appeared credible.A client has the right to presentation of lawful evidence. The lawyer can make recommendations but the ultimate decision is the client's decision. A judge can disbelieve evidence and make legitimate evidentiary rulings but he cannot deny a party the right to be heard including lawful witnesses. Judge William Adams attacked this mother and her lawyer for presenting the statements of this child. There was no lawful basis for him doing this. The attacks were serious. He impugned the lawyers honesty without grounds and sanctioned many thousands of dollars without grounds. This lawyer had a duty to present evidence on behalf of his client whether he believed the evidence personally or not (subject to various rules not even arguably at issue here). In this case, this lawyer believed the child. There was no colorable argument made that this child was incompetent. There was no argument made at all that the child didn't make these statements. The argument made was incredibly dishonest. The argument was that it is frivolous to believe children because they are fantasizers. That has no legal basis whatsoever. The Courts do not consider all children to be fantasizers. Judge William Adams said he would not believe the child absent video of what the child described (in other words, the child's words would be given no credence whatsoever in and of themselves). Further, he imposed a corroboration requirement. Generally, corroboration means independent evidence generally supporting the statements of the witness but not every detail of what the witness said. Here, there was clearly corroboration (e.g. the restaurant waiters) but Judge Adams demanded corroboration of every detail (again, this would mean the child's statements would be given no credence in and of themselves).  There are very few types of cases requiring corroboration of the testimony of a witness. There is no applicable such requirement here.Later, it was learned that one of the lawyers who asked the child to lie was the judge's personal lawyer in his personal family law case. The judge had a serious undisclosed conflict of interest,AnalysisThe lawyers particularly Lanette Joubert clearly lied. She knows that child testimony is competent testimony. She knows the law does not consider all children to be fantasizers. She presented no argument that this child was incompetent. Her own client testified that the child is honest and intelligent. She regularly believes children in her own practice. She has a history of asking children to lie (which will be discussed subsequently). If this child had said his mother touched him or he saw his mother and her lawyer in bed together, she would have used the child's statements and never would have called the child a fantasizer. One trend we will see through these commentaries and case studies is that with Lanette Joubert claims the law is anything she wants at the time and the law is one thing for her and another for others.  She just lied. She maliciously lied (just like the lie that will be discussed in Commentary No. 3). Judge William Adams lied. He lied for attacking a lawyer for presenting obviously pertinent and competent evidence. The lawyer would not be representing his client if he just ignored the fact that the client was being set up for a false sexual allegation according to a competent child. He did these things operating under an undisclosed conflict of interest. He also lied when he said the child's statements were not investigated. He heard evidence of extensive investigation and never suggested any investigation that wasn't done.Marie Haspil and James Ehler lied.  It it is just a lie for them to say that a lawyer acted frivolously for presenting evidence of a perfectly competent child. They were presented with extensive factual and legal materials which should not have even been necessary because this is all black letter law. James Ehler has a long history of supporting fraud and corruption in our legal system (involving these same lawyers -- which will be discussed in later Case Studies). The best that can be said is that they were doing the bidding of the corrupt Judge William Adams. However, that is no defense. They are supposed to enforce ethics not judicial corruption. However, they probably were not just doing the bidding of the corrupt Judge William Adams. There is significant reason to believe they were involved in ex parte with the judge. They knew about he restaurant meeting within hours (they were faxed a letter). They conspired with these corrupt attorneys and the text messages where Judge William Adams admits he was conferring with them even before he signed his corrupt orders. Further, when discovery was sought from them of their communications with the Corrupt Judge William Adams, they made bogus privilege arguments to conceal those communications. They claimed to be his lawyer (e.g. attorney client privilege), and they claimed he was part of the commission (internal deliberation like privilege). The truth is they were committing unethical ex parte by communicating with him. ",  Attorneys & Legal Services

FactsYears later, the same man as discussed in Case Study No. 1 is falsely accused yet again.  This accusation relates to a totally different teenage child (the child of his new girlfriend).  The accusation is made by the child's paternal grandparents. The parental grandparents want the child. Their son is on death row. They make very specific and graphic allegations. For example, they claim the teengae child was anally raped. They specifically state that blood was dripping from the child's anus. The allegations are not supported by any known evidence.The child denies that this ever happened. At the hearing, the grandparents and their lawyer are asked the basis for their allegation. The only basis the could identify was that the man had been accused previously by Lanette Joubert of ""tickling poop."" That allegation had been dismissed by the police and was never litigated because the man essentially decided to abandon his chidlren out of terror. The Judge did the right thing and made an affirmative finding that the man did not abuse the child.AnalysisThis Case Study once again illustrates how under the ethical scheme of lawyers like Lanette Joubert, William Dudley, William Kelly, James Ehler, and Marie Haspil children should simply be ignored if they don't agree with the false sexual allegation being made. This child said it never happened. She was ignored. Of course, if she said it happened, she should not be ignored.Cross ReferenceThis case study is filed under the Commentary on Child Statements. It could also be filed under the subsequent commentary on ethical logic.  Briefly, these lawyers pervert logic. They make the most bizarre and unreasonable inferences.  In this case, for example, they inferred that blood was dripping from a teenage girl's anus from the fact that this man had been accused of ""tickling poop"" many years earlier (by the notorious liar Lanette Joubert). It just doesn't follow. At most, it could be concluded that some greater than normal attention should be paid but not that blood was dripping from anus. Also, this could be cross reference do under the Commentary on shifting burden of proof. Again, briefly, it should be the burden of the party making an allegation to prove it. However, these lawyers throw out an allegation based on no evidence or if any evidence hearsay often anonymous. They then take the position that they have proven their case. Their victim must try to prove a negative.  Of course, if he relies on the child's statements, he is attacked. Actually, almost any defense results in attack. The corrupt bar as represented by Marie Haspil for example has taken the position that the lawyer defending against a false allegation in progress had to believe the lawyer making the false allegation (Lanette Joubert particularly). Marie Haspil writes a letter just two days before trial demanding to know why the lawyer does not believe Lanette Jobuert. Essentially, according to the highly unethical James Ehler and Marie Haspil if these lawyers make a false allegation or have one in progress there is no right to defense. The target is not entitled to believe witneses or even have genuine representation. Accordiing to the highly corrupt Judge William Adams, the targeted parent is not entitled to subpeona wigtnesses (even witnesses who according to the child were asking him to lie). Practice PointerEverything depends on whether the particular judge is honorable. This judge was. Of course, Judge Adams would have sanctioned this man and his lawyer for believing the child.

 James Ehler / Marie Haspil Texas Bar Corruption ,"  James Ehler / Marie Haspil Texas Bar Corruption  Congress Avenue, Austin, Texas Austin, Texas United States of America ", , ,"James Ehler / Marie Haspil Texas Bar Corruption Lanette Joubert / William Dudley / William Kelly Case Study No. 1 relating to  Child Testimony Austin, Texas"," Case Study No. 1 Relating to Child TestimonyAs discussed in Commentary No. 1,  James Elher, Marie Haspil, Lanette Joubert, William Dudley, and William Kelly in conjunction with Judge William Adams take the position that child testimony should not be believed.  Actually, it is frivolous to believe children.Facts of Case StudyLanette Joubert asserted a claim of sexual child abuse on behalf of Larry Adams' secretary.  Larry Adams is a family lawyer who will be discussed in these commentaries and case reports.Lanette Joubert based her claim of sexual abuse of a child solely on the alleged statements of a child still in diapers. The father returned the child supposdly with ""poop"" in her diaper. Weeks later, Lanette Joubert field a police report and a civil pleading asserting that the child said ""daddy tickled my poop."" There was no known corroboration of this supposed statement. The occurence of the statement was based solely on the word of the mother (who works for Larry Adams an affillilate of Lanette Joubert).The child was examined by a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner apparently looking for weeks old ""tickled poop.""  The SANE found nothingof interest. SANE Nursees are used in abusive cases like this for at least two purposes.  First, the accusing parent gives a ""history"" to the nurse. This ""history"" is treated sometimes as evidence even though it is really just a hearsay accusation. It is claimed that the history was given for purposes of medical treatment (an exception to the hearsay rule). Second, these people are often child molestors themselves. The SANE intrudes in many instances within the child's body and definitely examines the child's private areas. Thus. a child who was never sexually abused is abused. Children have been known to be subjected to multiple SANE examinations repeartedly molested (e.g. instruments are inserted within the child's body). Third, SANE examiners are sometimes used fraudulently. The child is taken to one SANE examiner and a short time later a different one. The second examiner finds evidence of penetration which was actually done by the first one.The police exercised some sense and did not pursue the criminal case. However, Lanette Joubert nevertheless continued to pursue her civil allegations. This destroyed the father's relationship with his children. He was terrified about being the subject of such a frivolous allegation that could land him in prison, so he voluntarily relinquished his parental rights.Question PresentedLanette Joubert asserted as discussed in Commentary No. 1 that it was frivolous for a mother and her lawyer to believe a nearly 6 year old child who was highly intelligent and honest according to allwitnesses familiar with the child. The child's statements were corroborated to the extent possible by independent third party sources. However, Lanette Joubert herself literally tried to put a man in prison based on the statements of a child still in diapers with no known corroboration at all. Is it possible to reconcile these two positions?  James Ehler and Marie Haspil were asked to reconcile these two positiosn. They didn't try. Thus, we are left to our own reasoning to reconcile these two apparently inconsistent positions.AnalsysisAs noted in Commentary No. 1, ethics according to these esteemed ethical attorneys is situational and asymmetric. It matters who you are and whether you are politically correct. There reallyl are no rules of ethics that are reliable. The published rules of ethics should be disregarded.James Ehler and the Texas Bar have a long history of promoting and supporting theft of children and false sexual allegations (involving many devices particularly perjury and fabrication of evidence) Thus, it was OK to believe the child in diapers because child statements can be used to support allegations of sexual abuse of chidlren (no matter how absurd or uncorroborated or who incompetent the child). However, it was no OK to believe the nearly six year old intelligent and honest child because defense against false sexual allegations is politically incorrect. In other words, child testimony can be used to assert sexual allegations of abuse but not to defend against them.  Further, it is OK for preferred lawyers like Lanette Joubert and Larry Adams to make false allegations of sexual abuse of children. However, defense of innocent victims of false allegations is highly frowned upon.  Generally, speaking Larry Adams is allowed to commit fraud on innocent parent as will be discussed subsequently. Practice PointersIf you are a lawyer, do not defend against false allegations of sexual abuse of children. You will be attacked. You are not allowed to believe your cilent's child or your client. This is the position of the corrupt James Ehler, Marie Haspil, and the Texas Bar as these commentaries and case studies show.If you are a parent, leave the State of Texas and seek a State with an honest legal system.  If you don't have children yet, don't have any at least not in the corrupt State of Texas.  Lawyers like Lanette Joubert, William Dudley, and William Kelly have the right to make false allegations against you.  You have no right to defend yourself.  If your child tells the truth, you cannot believe your own child. Your own lawyer cannot believe either you or your child. He will be attacked if he does. In other words, in the Corrupt State of Texas you have no right to genuine legal representation.

" Judge William Adams, James Ehler, Marie Haspil ","  Judge William Adams, James Ehler, Marie Haspil  Congress Ave. Austin, Texas United States of America ", , ,"Judge William Adams, James Ehler, Marie Haspil William Dudley, Lanette Joubert Commentary on Legal Ethics based on Esteemed Ethical Experts Austin, Texas","										Commentary on Legal Ethics #1 based on the esteemed Judge William Adams, James Ehler, Marie Haspil.The law is not necessarily what it seems. The law is not so much what the statutes, constitutions, cases, and rules say. Rather, it is what actually happens in the Courts and other tribunals. This commentary will address legal ethics from this perspective. This commentary will focus on a few ethical super stars specifically James Ehler and Judge William Adams. Child TestimonyClearly, child testimony is ethical in some contexts but not others. This is called situational ethics. Alternatively, this is called asymmetric ethics. The trick is knowing when child testimony is ethical and when it is not.  The written rules, statutes, and cases are not very helpful. Rules, Statutes, and CasesThe rules clearly allow child testimony unless the child is incompetent. The applicable case law establishes a very low standard of competency. For example, in one case, a man was sentenced to life imprisonment based on the testimony of a child still in diapers (2 years old at the time of the alleged incident and 3 years old at the time of trial). This child had a mental handicap. The child was held competent to testify because he knew colors, his name, etc. Thus, according to this case, the standard for child competency is low. Essentially, absent extreme incompetency, the fact finder decides what weight to give the child's testimony. Of course, the Courts, CPS, Police, and others regularly believe children. Real World Application of the RulesIt is evident though that the rules and the case law cannot be properly applied to all situations. For example, in the Jennifer Flores-Lamb case, her child was nearly 6 years old. He was highly intelligent and honest according to all witnesses who knew him. He told his mother that certain lawyers asked him to lie about her and say she touched him. Also, they told him to lie and say he saw her and her lawyer in bed together. He gave specifics like where this happened and when it happened. The child's statements to the extent possible were corroborated by independent third party witnesses. For example, this happened at a restaurant, and the waiters at the restaurant confirmed the child was their with his father and the appropriate number of additional adults as described by the child, even at the table the child said. The child knew things he could not have know absent his statements being true. There was no contrary evidence other than conclusory denials by the people involved. The imminent expert on ethics Judge William Adams held it was frivolous for this mother and her lawyer to believe the child. The ethical gurus James Ehler and Marie Haspil concurred.Clearly, this case cannot be distinguished from the more typical cases based on the language of the rules. This is an example of asymmetric ethics or situational ethics. Although the distinguishing factors have never been identified by Judge William Adams, James Ehler, or Marie Haspil, an analysis of these and other situations reveals the factors. It is impossible to set for the applicable factors and weights precisely, but the most important factors are:The identity of the person accused of misconduct by the child.If the child identifies a generic member of the public as guilty of misconduct, then the child's statements are near gospel, and this person is likely to be arrested and jailed on a high bond (as Judge William Adams acknowledges).He may or may not have a chance to respond to what the child said, but even if he does have a chance to respond his statements will likely receive little weight. He is just given opportunity to respond hoping that his words will be useful in later prosecution of him by the State.On the other the other hand, if the person accused of misconduct is the Judge's personal lawyer, then it is frivolous to believe the child and the person relying on the child's statements will be hurt. Be careful, it is not always known who is the judge's personal lawyer, and don't expect the judge or his lawyer to disclose this.The identity of the person asserting the child's statements.If you are lawyer seeking to take a child from a parent, you may assert a child's statements. You may rely on hearsay, and you can be vague. You are not required to have any substance to your assertion other than to claim that the child said the accusation. You can usually take full control of the child without a full hearing (an ex parte hearing will usuallybe sufficient at least for a while and if the accused has little money forever).If you are a lawyer who's client is being set up for a false accusation of sexual misconduct, you can never believe the child's statements. It is frivolous.It doesn't matter than you have thoroughly investigated and that the child has repeatedly stated what happened or that all the circumstances and evidence support the child.This rule overlaps with rule 1. If the lawyer who asked the child to lie is the judge's lawyer, then you really cannot rely on the child's statements (it is really frivolous). A simple rule of thumb here is that child statements can be used to hurt people but not to help them.  A child's  statements will put you in prison but will never keep you out of prison. If a child seeks to tell the truth that his parent is not bad, the child can never be believed.Don't ever get deluded into thinking that truth or justice has anything to do with anything. It might with some judges but you cannot count on this. It is important to know not only what factors are relevant but what factors are not:1) The child's competence, intelligence, honesty, and coherence.Actually, the Judge is likely to make a decision without ever meeting the child or watching videotapes of his statements. At this point, the Judge says something like All children are fantasize (there is no need for any evidence that this child did). 2) The importance of the matters at issue.It doesn't matter whether the child's statements relate what he had for lunch at school or the fact that he is being asked to lie in a way that could put you in prison.The factors important are who you are and who is accused.If you are the target (the child says he is being asked to accuse you of sexual misconduct), you are in trouble. There is no hope just enjoy the ride. Prison food isn't that bad. Practice PointersIf you are a lawyer, you can use child statements if you work for the government whether the prosecuting attorney, CPS, or the police. Otherwise, unless you are friends of the judge, don't risk it. It is just too dangerous. This is not a good time to care about your client. Let your client go to prison if your client is the target, save your own you know what. Don't feel guilty if your innocent client goes to prison (or loses their child) based on a lie. You didn't make the law. You are just a cog in a large immoral system and don't ever think you are more.Remember, people are not entitled to representation anymore. They are just entitled to the appearance of representation. They wants you to ""roll over"" and you will be rewarded for doing that. If you are the client and your child is being asked to lie in ways that could  send you to prison, you should understand if your lawyer refuses to represent you in a meaningful way. Your lawyer is probably familiar with Judge William Adams, James Ehler, and Marie Haspil. He knows that he will be attacked if he actually represents you. He cannot be expected to throw himself under the train on your behalf. It is clear to him that he is not allowed to really represent you. He is not supposed to believe you or your child. He is supposed to just pretend to represent you. He is not supposed to have a conscious. If you opposing counsel works for the government or is the Judge's friend, you are supposed to go to prison. Just accept it. Remember, how the contestants in ""Hunger Games"" accepted their fates without much objection. You do the same.You should pack your toothbrush, report for prison when instructed, and just be happy that Judge William Adams doesn't beat you. Consider yourself lucky if you just lose your child.",  Attorneys & Legal Services

James Ehler is the head of this criminal enterprise in the South Texas region, and Marie Haspil is directly involved in the criminality.The criminality goes to the top of the bar and permeates large portions of the judiciary. The Texas Supreme Court itself has been given the opportunity to address the issue and lied. Specifically, the law is very clear that the Texas Supreme Court has ultimate authority over the attorney discipline process. It refused to even file the document at issue falsely claiming that it had no jurisdiction. It does have jurisdiction. It buried its head in the sand. The attorney discipline process is the process by which the Texas State Bar commits its crimes at issue.  The Texas Supreme Court is derelict in its duties.The criminality at issue extends over the course of well over a decade.  It is continuous, and it is shameless. Only a summary can be set forth here.  The full story will await a book. Most recently, there is the Judge William Adams case and the Larry adams case. In the Judge William Adams case, a child reported that he was told to lie by several lawyers and a judge. Specifically, he was told to lie that his mother had ""touched"" him and that he had seen his mother and lawyer in bed together. The bar commits its crimes in connection with lawyers most particularly William Dudley, Lanette Joubert, and William Kelly.All these lawyers were present at the restaurant meeting where the child said these things happened. The child said where this happened (a particular restaurant), the day it happened, the general time it happened, and even the table where it happened. The waiters at the restaurant confirmed that the child and the father where at this restaurant when the child said and even at the table the child said even though the father denied being there. The waiters said there were the appropriate number of additional adults present in suits and ties. A restaurant ticket exists.A child psychologist interviewed the child. The child told her the same thing. The child psychologist believed the child. The child's statements were recorded at least 3 to 4 times once with a child psychologist and once with a district judge present. The child's behavior was consistent with his statements in several ways, and he knew things he could not have otherwise known. Most particularly,  these lawyers had been lying for months about a supposed sexual relationship between mother and lawyer (a total lie not supported by any evidence just insinuation for innocent facts) which is something the child did not know (at least not from the mother) and yet the child recited that these lawyers asked him to lie in a way to support this lie. The child's statements clearly corresponded to the lies in progress.This is a good time to note that the Bar particularly James Ehler is a promoter and protector of lies. Years earlier, one of these same lawyers got caught red handed lying to a tribunal.  James Ehler laughed and smirked clearly communicating to this lawyer that the State Bar supports his lying and even considers it funny.  A grievance was field against James Ehler because lawyers are supposed to report unethical conduct that they observe. James Ehler is in charge of ethics for the whole region. He would have a greater duty. The corrupt bar of course did nothing. This whole episode was recorded on videotape and there could be no evidentiary dispute at all. Of course, the corrupt Judge William Adams acted corruptly.  It was later learned that one of the lawyers at the restaurant meeting was his personal lawyer at the time. He was operating under a huge conflict of interest. He held that it is frivolous to believe children because children are fantasizers.  That of course is a total lie.  Texas Courts and probably all Courts believe children. There was nothing about this child that was unbelievable. Both parents testified that he was honest. The father testified that he would be worried if the child said the mother and her lawyer were doing these things (no kidding). People go to prison based on what children say (regularly). In fact, this mother could of gone to prison if the child had said what he was told to say. If the child had lied as requested, of course, the Courts would have believed him. Judge Adams was being dishonest and corrupt in favor of his personal lawyer, obviously.  There were open corrupt statements along the lines of it being improper to say such a thing relative to lawyers and a judge. Of course, the truth is that these lawyers and the judge should not have done such a thing. This child was entitled to be heard, and the hearing was totally corrupt. Actually, Judge  William Adams and the lawyers at issue committed a crime (conspiracy to conceal a crime). The lawyers and the judge at the restaurant meeting committed the crime of witness tampering. This is only a very small part of the corruption and criminality that occurred that day. The bar not only supported this fraud and criminality there is good reason to believe that it participated in the conspiracy to commit these crimes. There are text messages strongly suggesting that the bar was involved even before these crimes were committed conspiring with corrupt Judge Adams.According to the corrupt criminal bar, not only was this child not entitled to belief in court but hsi mother was not either. The bar demanded to know 2 days before trial why the mother's lawyer believed her.  The mother was clearly telling the truth and later events proved that. The bar was actively involving itself in litigation corruptly taking the position that the child should not be believed and neither should the mother. Total corruption. It was totally in support of the corrupt Judge William Adams and the corrupt lawyers at issue.  Neither this mother nor her child was ever significantly impeached.  In contrast, the corrupt lawyers were repeatedly caught lying.  As just one example, Lanette Joubert took the position that the father's child care provider was perfectly OK. The truth as established by documents form MHMR she was homicidal, psychotic, suicidal, heavily druggeed, etc.  Incredibly, the corrupt Judge William Adams held that was irrelevant to the best interests of the child. The corrupt bar was not concerned of course with this verifiable instance (one of many) of Lanette Joubert's lack of honesty. The worked to protect her and her dishonesty and attacked the lawyer who presented the true evidence on the condition of the care provider.The seriousness of this situation cannot be understated.  The bar is obviously corrupt and dishonest. No honest lawyer would say that children are entitled to belief in our courts. That clearly is not the law. These lawyers know it is not the law. Actually, Judge William Adams admitted that he puts children in jail based on what children say with high bonds (children he probably doesn't know and has never met). These lawyers regularly believe children.  Lanette Joubert destroyed parent child relationships in one instance based on supposed statements of a child still in diapers. This child was nearly 6 years old and very bright far different from a child still in diapers.The fact is that Judge William Adams flat out lied when he said that it is frivolous to believe children. He knows that it is not true. He is a liar, and he is a criminal. His lie is a crime because he was working to cover up a crime by lawyers including his personal lawyer. He was comfortable in his corrupt and criminal behavior because the legal system particularly the bar and the Judicial Conduct Commission in Texas are thoroughly and systematically corrupt.The bottom line is that in Texas preferred lawyers can tell the most heinous lies designed to destroy your relationship with your child and even put you in prison. You are not entitled to be heard in Court and neither are your witnesses (including your child).  You might get an honest judge there certainly are some but if you get a Judge like Judge William Adams there is no corrective mechanism. Actually, the bar will join in the abuse.  The bar supported the lawlessness that occurred. There was never any meaningful response to what the child said just conclusory denials.  What happened was corruption and criminality pure and simple and the bar was involved.In the Larry Adams case, Larry Adams stole a child by drafting a corrupt order. The order was corrupt in the sense that it was different than what the judge ordered orally. None of the lawyers sent the order to the father despite his requests. By the time he got the order which took some time since he lived 2,000 miles from the courthouse, it was too late for him to comply with the corrupt order which Larry Adams had corruptly altered adding obligations and conditions not ever stated in the Courtroom by the judge.  You guessed it. The Bar supported this corruption.  The clear attitude of the bar as evidenced most directly by the unethical James Ehler who thinks that lying by lawyers is funny (particularly William Dudley lies) is to protect and promote lying, child theft, and false accusations of sexual abuse of children.  One case resulted in a suicide. Nearly all cases result in disruption of parent child relationships (e.g. child theft). In the Stanley Rains case, he was accused of sexual impropriety with his child for over a decade. There was never any real evidence. There hearsay often anonymous. There was insinuation. These lawyers are liars.  They take the smallest fact like a lawyer and client eating dinner together and all of a sudden they are filing motions repeatedly that lawyer and client are sexually involved. If a father takes his daughter to the park, well, he is molesting her because he has a smile on his face and he ""just doesn't look right."" They are sick abusive people and the Bar supports them. Stanley Rains never had consistent visitation with his child for her entire childhood. He was harassed continuously and he was even jailed on totally bogus charges (he was arrested for trying to see his child at school when the applicable order made clear he had that right; he was acquitted). In one instance, just one of many, these lawyers (William Dudley, Lanette Joubert, and William Kelly) together with the ad lidem (William Kelly's sister in law which was not disclosed at the time) got caught outright fabricating evidence. The ad litem wrote a report stating that witnesses in the park saw the child sitting on her father's lap steering the car in the parking lot. The ad litem added the remarkably offensive statement that Stan Rains' penis was erect. Of course, it would be impossible to know that through a car door, clothing, etc. More importantly, though, these witnesses when asked denied ever saying such a thing in fact they denied ever even talking to the ad litem (until much later). It was a lie. The bar did nothing.  It didn't even investigate. The bar sent the corrupt message that fabrication of evidence is perfectly OK in its book. The allegation of fabrication of evidence did not even state a claim of misconduct.  You cannot make this kind of thing up.  It is unbelievably corrupt. The determination by the bar that it is perfectly OK to fabricate evidence was made by the utterly corrupt James Ehler. Of course, if he had been honorable in the Stan Rains case the restaurant meeting discussed above may never have occurred (they both involved the same lawyers). He sent the message as a person in charge of ethics that fabrication of evidence was OK by him.  He also sent the message that false accusations of crime were OK with him. In one instance, William Dudley and Judge Henry Schuble were making false criminal accusations in open Court (verifiable on the record).  Ehler thought that was OK also. Actually, he took up arms on behalf of the corrupt William Dudley and Henry Schuble.Particularly, the Court would not set Stanley Rains' motions for hearing. He was not seeing his child continuously for months. The Court was ignoring him and his motions. Total corruption. Stan Rains got the Judge next door to sign an Order setting Hearing. This made the corrupt William  Dudley and the Corrupt Judge Henry Schuble mad.  The order setting hearing date disappeared from the file (documents were constantly disappearing and appearing out of nowhere in his file).  A certified copied of the order was produced. The corrupt William Dudley and the corrupt Judge Schuble started in unison claiming the order was ""forged"" which was a total lie. They were obviously as so often the case rehearsed (much like the rehearsed lie that it is frivolous to believe a child). They didn't stop until the District Clerk representative who was a retired Marine took charge demanding to know what the heck had happened to the missing order which clearly did exist. This is just one of many instances of corruption and false accusations of criminal conduct by this group of lawyers (always the same group). You guessed it. The totally unethical James Ehler saw no problem with the disappearing order,  the false accusation of forgery, or any of the other nearly infinite number of crimes and frauds committed by William Dudley and Judge Henry Schuble during just that sequence of events (not even counting the entire decade long duration of the abuse of Stanley Rains). These things must be said. There is clearly systematic corruption and criminality. It feeds on itself. Again, if James Ehler had handled the Stanley Rains case even remotely ethically then the later cases probably never would have even occurred. He sends the message on the behalf of the bar that the bar supports and even promotes corruption and criminality (certainly protects it).  Marie Haspil in the most recent cases was acting under direction of the corrupt James Ehler.  									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Case # 2:10-20998.    The motion was supported by a completely Baseless and Fraudulent declaration under the penalty of perjury by John Aschieris of Foothill Financial lp and Partner Ron Aschieris. This is a side business for Ron Aschieris as he is also a teacher at Morango Elementary School in Pasadena.      The Motive for the Fraudulent claim and filed motion was that if they did not get a ""Relief of Stay"" by July 15, 2010 the default notice of the foreclosure process would expire under the California CivilCode 2924 would have to be refiled and the foreclosure process would have to go through the legal process after the 365 day expiration period.

Walker (SBN 175108) had failed to include the declaration from the appraiser in the lien strip motion     Instead of going the legal route.. They decided to take a chance and thinking they would not get caught ""Committing Fraud"" under 9011 and illegally and Knowingly Violated the ""Automatic Stay"" by overwhelming debtor Rusin and proceeded to foreclose and take my home to trust deed sale and sell their Junior loan for the amount of $ 60,000.      The 1st lender Ocwen Loan Servicing had previously modified the 1st loan and took no part in the Foreclosure and they had no problem with me as the borrower.      This act of Fraud upon the US Bankruptcy Court of the Central District of California has nearly all the same RECKLESS AND MALICIOUS acts of what took place in the case of EILEEN FAGAN US BANKRUPTCY CASE  #04 B 23460 9 (ASH).The Fagan case shadows almost every aspect of what transpired in my Chapter 13 case with the exception of .. .1 IMPORTANT THING !!*** EILEEN FAGAN NEVER ENDED UP LOSING HER HOME AND NEARLY ALL OF HER BELONGINGS AS I DID AND HAVING MY LIFE NEARLY DESTROYED !** EILLEN FAGEN  ENDED UP RECEIVING OVER $10,000 IN SANCTIONS FROM THE FILING ATTORNEY*  FALSE CERTIFICATION OF POST PETITION DEFAULTS******************************************************************************THIS CASE WAS ENTERED FOR PUBLICATION  : IN Re: Gorshstein, 285 B.R. (Bankr S.D.N.Y.)      Motions to lift the stay may be routine and inconsequential to secured creditors and their councel.  But to a debtor and his or her family, such a motion and the consuquent loss of the family home may be devestating.  Most creditors and councel and conscientious.  But some are callus by design or inadvertence, as exemplified by this motion and two thers presented to this Court the same week.  The danger here is that a debtor who does not have an attorney or the resources of intellect or spirit to defend against a baseless motion may lose his/her home despite being current on post- petitiion mortgage and plan payments.      I know of no way to protect against such an eventuality if no material consequence attaches to the filing of motions bases upon false certification of fact.  Secured creditors and their counsel who know that filing motion to lift the stay will result in material sanctions if caught will undoubtedly be motivated to a higher standard of care.Dated: White Plains, NYSeptember 24, 2007                                                                                                                                                                            /s/Adlai S.

I told him of my growing dissatisfaction and the need for the documents so that I could begin to do business. He apologized and promised to have everything expedited to me in an overnight delivery. That delivery was to have included all three documents upon which I had been waiting. The delivery only included the LLC papers. There was a blank tax ID form included because, as they claimed, I had not asked them to prepare one. The DBA form was absent.I called customer service.

As for life threatening stress for which three cardiologists have documented, Herzfeld & Rubin is not concerned.How does Herzfeld & Rubin address these issues?Rather than provide counsel to my brother who acts as Trustee to find healthy solutions and compromises, they march off to Court where they know they can find blank checks from my Trust to support their lavish meals and vacations.Rather than negotiate settlements out of court with my attorneys - their method of operation is to intimidate my legal counsel by threatening them with sanctions!If my father knew that over $80,000 of his hard earned money went to Herzfeld & Rubin to hurt me, separate me from my children, his grandchildren, to have me evicted from my home, ignore requests for heart medicine and rather than protect me and care for my well being as the Trust calls for, he would be writing this consumer complaint.Herzfeld & Rubin can always try to blame my brother for the decisions that they make. But that holds no water as they could have resigned from representing my brother and my Trust. But then again, if they had resigned, they would not be in a position today to take over $80,000 in legal fees as I and my children suffer.Ripoff Report is truly not the answer.

Indeed, Lerner and Rowe devotes the utmost in care and meticulous attention to each and every case, whether large or small.  They carefully listen to client concerns and see them as an opportunity to learn from past mistakes and become more efficient as a company in the legal services and support offered.  This means that clients can expect that the company will work towards finding a mutually satisfactory resolution to any complaint or concern.Lerner and Rowe's principal attorney, Mr. Rowe, has informed us that his personal philosophy is that it is a privilege for their law firm to be chosen to help a client in their time of need.  As such, the client can expect to be provided with outstanding professional service after they or a loved one has been injured in an accident, applied and been denied the social security benefits they deserve, injured because of the financial crisis, or accused of city, state and federal crimes.  As a successful lawyer and businessman, Mr. Rowe feels it is critical to listen to his clients comments and concerns, and respond promptly.  By always putting his customers first, Mr. Rowe hopes to maintain that Lerner and Rowe is a successful law firm that always has their clients best welfare at heart.Another top member of the company told us that Mr. Rowe's personal business philosophy is founded upon the principle of being fully committed to providing quality representation to clients in their time of need and to help them obtain maximum compensation whenever possible.  Some of the other things Ripoff Report learned in the course of its investigation: typical customer feedback reads:  “Lerner and Rowe personal injury lawyers in Phoenix are very helpful and friendly.  I was very impressed by my attorney’s professionalism and the job he did for me.  I never thought I would get the settlement that I did.""The information provided in this report is based on comments made by Brian Prezgay and Kevin Rowe during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Lerner and Rowe.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..Lerner and Rowe Professionals are injury attorneys. They focus mainly on personal injury claims which include automobile accidents, tractor trailer accidents, motorcycle accidents, and personal property accidents (i.e. slips, falls, etc.). They also handle social security and disability claims. Lerner and Rowe Law Group also extend their services to include criminal defense, DUI defense, bankruptcy, and real estate sales.Lerner and Rowe set themselves apart from other competitors by the level of commitment and compassion from the entire team.  Kevin Rowe is not only a boss, but an active team member; he prides himself on his passion and desire to help every person that he is able to.  Mr. Rowe has a motto that the way things are now are “never enough,” meaning that he pushes his team to strive for better.  He wants a “volume based company with a boutique feel for the customer” so each and every client feels as though they are the only client and receive full and satisfying attention from the entire team.  The desire to help people and provide special attention to each case as it comes into the business is the basis for the level of customer service provided for each and every person who comes through the door.  There is a wealth of knowledge and experience among the team members, with some holding 40 years of experience.  Mr. Rowe stated that he wants everyone to be able to learn something new every day just from interacting with each other.  The team members will also go to clients if they are unable to come into the office, ensuring that they can help in any way possible.  Exit reviews/surveys are completed for every client once their case is settled or resolved, to find out any problems the client had with the process and/or what positive experiences the client had.  Mr. Rowe stated that he wants to know the good and the bad so the company can continue to improve their practices.  Lerner and Rowe also contributes and volunteers with a large charity base throughout Arizona, making donations, volunteering time, attending events and participating as much as possible.  Mr. Rowe discussed his own personal experiences with several local charities and explained that the entire office gets involved as well.  He has been involved with Phoenix Children’s Hospital, Phoenix Rescue Mission, Susan G. Komen, and Arizona Chapter for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, as well as several others.  Lerner and Rowe have setup a webpage giving information on events and charities they are involved with for anyone who is interested: lernerandrowegivesback.com.Lerner and Rowe acquire clients through their multi-media advertising campaigns, and from referrals from past and present clients.  The company advertises on television, radio, internet, billboards, bus stops and cabs.  Mr. Rowe stated that many clients come to them due to hearing the jingle on the radio or seeing the commercials, but a large amount of clients are through referrals.  The clients speak with one of the In-take Specialists when they first come into the office or when the call is received, discussing the issue and proceeding from there.The typical experience a client should expect to receive is individual attention and a feeling that they are the only client.  Each client is provided with a knowledgeable team, who are available at any time to answer questions or concerns, to provide updates and just to check to see how the client is doing.  Lerner and Rowe strives to provide a satisfying experience for each client and to give a sense of relief and assurance of help, so the client can focus on getting better and on their recovery, not having to worry about the case details.When the client comes in to the office, calls or makes contact with Lerner and Rowe initially, they speak with an In-take Specialist, who takes some details and then assigns the case to a specific team.  This is the team that the client will work with through the entire process, consisting of a Case Manager (paralegal), Attorney, Associate Attorney, Co-Case Manager, and Accounting Team.  The client receives communication and information from the Case Manager and Attorney primarily; the other team members are supportive and administrative roles, helping the Case Manager and Attorney.  The Case Manager and Attorney are expected to provide consistent communication throughout the entire process, no matter how long the case takes.  If there is any kind of delay in the case or time while waiting for information from Medical Providers or Insurance, the Case Manager and Attorney are responsible for reviewing the case and contacting the client at least once a month. ""During the onsite interview Kevin Rowe was asked to describe their standard process for taking care of a complaint: “The standard process for taking care of a complaint is a little different depending on if it is a current client or a past client.  If a current client has a complaint about the Case Manager, Co-Case Manager or Associate Attorney, the supervising Attorney will speak with the client for resolution.  If unable to provide resolution or if the complaint is about the Attorney, it is reviewed by me and my team of Executive Assistants.  I will speak with the client directly, in person or by phone, to find out more information about the complaint and to find the best resolution for the situation.  If a past client has a complaint, I will call the client to speak about the situation and try to provide a resolution.  Each case is notated each time it is accessed, for conversations with the client to updates in the case.  Each notation gives a detailed explanation of what was discussed, any offer made or information that was given regarding the case.  When I speak with a client regarding a complaint I review all of the information to find out if something went wrong or if a client is upset because the outcome was not what they were expecting or wanting.  I try to understand what caused the complaint and to provide the best resolution to the situation at hand.  Through utilization of exit surveys for current clients many complaints or concerns are resolved before the client leaves allowing for resolution and communication at the time it occurred.  I take every concern or complaint to heart and try to provide resolution for situations as quickly as possible; sometimes I am unable to provide complete resolution depending on the situation.  I take all concerns or complaints personally and work tirelessly to provide satisfaction and closure for my clients, past and present.”In addition to how their office handles complaints, Mr. Rowe was asked to describe a specific situation where a client was not satisfied with the level of service they received: “The client was upset with a situation regarding the settlement; there was a discrepancy from what was offered originally and what was received.  I called the client to discuss the situation, while speaking with the client and with the review of the notes and information regarding the case, the discrepancy was found.  I was able to correct the issue and made an offer of resolution for the situation.  The resolution was accepted by the client and they expressed deep satisfaction for the quick resolution.  The client has since referred friends and family to Lerner and Rowe, stating that he is very thankful for our help and sincerity for the entire process.”The process for dealing with insurance company requests starts with obtaining all necessary information from the client, requesting medical records/bills for any doctor/hospital visits.  Lerner and Rowe is at the mercy of the medical providers to send the information as quickly as possible, it can take several weeks, months sometimes for the records to be received.  Once everything is received, the information is provided to the insurance company for review and determination.  The insurance company can take between 30-45 days for review.  The delays and time it takes that has spurred complaints about how insurance claims are handled are due to the length of time medical providers and insurance company review takes, it is not something that can be controlled by Lerner and Rowe.  Mr. Rowe stated that the company is not able to go pick up medical records or force the insurance review process to move faster or keep to the time frame given when the reports are sent.  He stated, “Lerner and Rowe do not gain anything from delaying the process, it is better for the company for the process to run smoothly and quickly.”Some internal processes needing improvement include the size of caseloads each team handles; the company is in process and has already seen improvement of hiring additional staff to lessen the case loads.  The teams are already benefitting from the increase in people and are able to better help clients efficiently and effectively.  Also needing some additional improvement was general training and expectations of the company for newer employees.  Improved training and learning expectations for the company have contributed to better communication with clients and between team members.  Mr. Rowe strives to have pro-active client contact and communication, instead of re-active, he wants to have the teams reach out to the clients and make sure everything is going okay, not to have the clients calling concerned with the process.The changes seen have been better communication with clients and lessened case load for the teams, allowing more efficiency and effective client interaction.  Additional supportive and administrative staff allows more functionality of the office and allows the teams to focus on the clients more.  Concerns are easier to address and resolve and no client is being overlooked or falling through the cracks.  Mr. Rowe stated that he has a quote that he found a few years ago that he sends to his teams to remind everyone that the client is the most important part of this business, without them we have no business.  The quote he gives; “A client is the most important visitor on our premises, he is not dependent on us, we are dependent on him.  He is not an interruption of our work; he is the purpose of it.  He is not an outsider of our business; he is a part of it.  We are not doing him a favor by serving him; he is doing us a favor by allowing us to serve him.”In order to do whatever it takes to make the client happy, Mr. Rowe advises his employees to maintain pro-active communication and satisfaction for each and every client. Providing answers and resolution in an effective and efficient manner allows each team to best address clients’ concerns/issues.  Providing the best and most qualified staff, and the level of knowledge provided throughout each team allows Lerner and Rowe to “do whatever it takes” to provide satisfaction.The creation of the exit surveys and addition of the administrative and supporting staff have been some results from the complaints made on Ripoff Report.  Additional training and expanded expectations have also been directly related to the complaints.It means a great deal to Lerner and Rowe to be part of the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program; it is a huge benefit to the company.  Mr. Rowe stated that it is the essence of the business and its practices.  Lerner and Rowe / Statements from the staff.  ""Mr. Rowe and the senior attorneys and staff members provide a very positive environment to work.  We are encouraged to share ideas, seek additional training and give back to our local communities by participating in community based events.  Mr. Rowe is truly concerned about our professional growth within the company and takes the time to listen and communicate with employees and clients.""Lerner and Rowe takes employee satisfaction seriously as well.  If an employee is satisfied with their job, they are more likely to provide exceptional service to clients and their fellow co-workers.  Lerner and Rowe employees have expressed that they are very pleased working at the law firm.  A case manager at Lerner and Rowe stated ""I have seen Mr. Rowe take personal interest in client cases and in giving back to the community.  He is not a silent partner by any means. He actively seeks justice and fair treatment for clients and local community groups and organizations that are in need. Mr. Rowe truly has earned the title of being the ""Attorney with a Heart.""Lerner and Rowe recognizes that complaints posted on Ripoff Report (whether true or not) are issues that need to be addressed, not ignored.  If handled correctly, complaints can be valuable learning opportunities. With the feedback generated by Ripoff Report’s review, it became apparent that Lerner and Rowe has made organizational changes allowing its users and employees a more streamlined approach to problem resolution and a commitment to a great user experience.In summary, after our review, which included discussions with Lerner and Rowe's executive team, Ripoff Report is convinced that Lerner and Rowe is committed to quality delivery of services resulting in total user satisfaction.Read more about why consumers should feel confident when doing business with a member of Ripoff Report's Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.

Here a year and 4 months later. they want to settle my claim for 10500.00 they get 1/3 for doing absoultely nothing, and i end up getting 5000.00. this really pisses me off, because i beleive that with the uninsured motorist coverage on our truck, we could of gotten more. they never return phone calls, you never really speak to an attorney, just their arms...They need to stop making those stupid commercials, and start working on the cases they are maken money on for doing nothing, i would not reccomend Lerner and Rowe, I think this case was handled terribly, and we should of gotten a lot more money. they did absoultely nothing...								 SPECIAL UPDATE: May 27 2014: Glen Lerner remains committed to increased customer satisfaction and has improved their business practices over the years to better serve their customers.

Exit reviews/surveys are completed for every client once their case is settled or resolved, to find out any problems the client had with the process and/or what positive experiences the client had.  Mr. Rowe stated that he wants to know the good and the bad so the company can continue to improve their practices.  Lerner and Rowe also contributes and volunteers with a large charity base throughout Arizona, making donations, volunteering time, attending events and participating as much as possible.  Mr. Rowe discussed his own personal experiences with several local charities and explained that the entire office gets involved as well.  He has been involved with Phoenix Children’s Hospital, Phoenix Rescue Mission, Susan G. Komen, and Arizona Chapter for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, as well as several others.  Lerner and Rowe have setup a webpage giving information on events and charities they are involved with for anyone who is interested: lernerandrowegivesback.com.Lerner and Rowe acquire clients through their multi-media advertising campaigns, and from referrals from past and present clients.  The company advertises on television, radio, internet, billboards, bus stops and cabs.  Mr. Rowe stated that many clients come to them due to hearing the jingle on the radio or seeing the commercials, but a large amount of clients are through referrals.  The clients speak with one of the In-take Specialists when they first come into the office or when the call is received, discussing the issue and proceeding from there.The typical experience a client should expect to receive is individual attention and a feeling that they are the only client.  Each client is provided with a knowledgeable team, who are available at any time to answer questions or concerns, to provide updates and just to check to see how the client is doing.  Lerner and Rowe strives to provide a satisfying experience for each client and to give a sense of relief and assurance of help, so the client can focus on getting better and on their recovery, not having to worry about the case details.When the client comes in to the office, calls or makes contact with Lerner and Rowe initially, they speak with an In-take Specialist, who takes some details and then assigns the case to a specific team.  This is the team that the client will work with through the entire process, consisting of a Case Manager (paralegal), Attorney, Associate Attorney, Co-Case Manager, and Accounting Team.  The client receives communication and information from the Case Manager and Attorney primarily; the other team members are supportive and administrative roles, helping the Case Manager and Attorney.  The Case Manager and Attorney are expected to provide consistent communication throughout the entire process, no matter how long the case takes.  If there is any kind of delay in the case or time while waiting for information from Medical Providers or Insurance, the Case Manager and Attorney are responsible for reviewing the case and contacting the client at least once a month. ""During the onsite interview Kevin Rowe was asked to describe their standard process for taking care of a complaint: “The standard process for taking care of a complaint is a little different depending on if it is a current client or a past client.  If a current client has a complaint about the Case Manager, Co-Case Manager or Associate Attorney, the supervising Attorney will speak with the client for resolution.  If unable to provide resolution or if the complaint is about the Attorney, it is reviewed by me and my team of Executive Assistants.  I will speak with the client directly, in person or by phone, to find out more information about the complaint and to find the best resolution for the situation.  If a past client has a complaint, I will call the client to speak about the situation and try to provide a resolution.  Each case is notated each time it is accessed, for conversations with the client to updates in the case.  Each notation gives a detailed explanation of what was discussed, any offer made or information that was given regarding the case.  When I speak with a client regarding a complaint I review all of the information to find out if something went wrong or if a client is upset because the outcome was not what they were expecting or wanting.  I try to understand what caused the complaint and to provide the best resolution to the situation at hand.  Through utilization of exit surveys for current clients many complaints or concerns are resolved before the client leaves allowing for resolution and communication at the time it occurred.  I take every concern or complaint to heart and try to provide resolution for situations as quickly as possible; sometimes I am unable to provide complete resolution depending on the situation.  I take all concerns or complaints personally and work tirelessly to provide satisfaction and closure for my clients, past and present.”In addition to how their office handles complaints, Mr. Rowe was asked to describe a specific situation where a client was not satisfied with the level of service they received: “The client was upset with a situation regarding the settlement; there was a discrepancy from what was offered originally and what was received.  I called the client to discuss the situation, while speaking with the client and with the review of the notes and information regarding the case, the discrepancy was found.  I was able to correct the issue and made an offer of resolution for the situation.  The resolution was accepted by the client and they expressed deep satisfaction for the quick resolution.  The client has since referred friends and family to Lerner and Rowe, stating that he is very thankful for our help and sincerity for the entire process.”The process for dealing with insurance company requests starts with obtaining all necessary information from the client, requesting medical records/bills for any doctor/hospital visits.  Lerner and Rowe is at the mercy of the medical providers to send the information as quickly as possible, it can take several weeks, months sometimes for the records to be received.  Once everything is received, the information is provided to the insurance company for review and determination.  The insurance company can take between 30-45 days for review.  The delays and time it takes that has spurred complaints about how insurance claims are handled are due to the length of time medical providers and insurance company review takes, it is not something that can be controlled by Lerner and Rowe.  Mr. Rowe stated that the company is not able to go pick up medical records or force the insurance review process to move faster or keep to the time frame given when the reports are sent.  He stated, “Lerner and Rowe do not gain anything from delaying the process, it is better for the company for the process to run smoothly and quickly.”Some internal processes needing improvement include the size of caseloads each team handles; the company is in process and has already seen improvement of hiring additional staff to lessen the case loads.  The teams are already benefitting from the increase in people and are able to better help clients efficiently and effectively.  Also needing some additional improvement was general training and expectations of the company for newer employees.  Improved training and learning expectations for the company have contributed to better communication with clients and between team members.  Mr. Rowe strives to have pro-active client contact and communication, instead of re-active, he wants to have the teams reach out to the clients and make sure everything is going okay, not to have the clients calling concerned with the process.The changes seen have been better communication with clients and lessened case load for the teams, allowing more efficiency and effective client interaction.  Additional supportive and administrative staff allows more functionality of the office and allows the teams to focus on the clients more.  Concerns are easier to address and resolve and no client is being overlooked or falling through the cracks.  Mr. Rowe stated that he has a quote that he found a few years ago that he sends to his teams to remind everyone that the client is the most important part of this business, without them we have no business.  The quote he gives; “A client is the most important visitor on our premises, he is not dependent on us, we are dependent on him.  He is not an interruption of our work; he is the purpose of it.  He is not an outsider of our business; he is a part of it.  We are not doing him a favor by serving him; he is doing us a favor by allowing us to serve him.”In order to do whatever it takes to make the client happy, Mr. Rowe advises his employees to maintain pro-active communication and satisfaction for each and every client. Providing answers and resolution in an effective and efficient manner allows each team to best address clients’ concerns/issues.  Providing the best and most qualified staff, and the level of knowledge provided throughout each team allows Lerner and Rowe to “do whatever it takes” to provide satisfaction.The creation of the exit surveys and addition of the administrative and supporting staff have been some results from the complaints made on Ripoff Report.  Additional training and expanded expectations have also been directly related to the complaints.It means a great deal to Lerner and Rowe to be part of the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program; it is a huge benefit to the company.  Mr. Rowe stated that it is the essence of the business and its practices.  Lerner and Rowe / Statements from the staff.  ""Mr. Rowe and the senior attorneys and staff members provide a very positive environment to work.  We are encouraged to share ideas, seek additional training and give back to our local communities by participating in community based events.  Mr. Rowe is truly concerned about our professional growth within the company and takes the time to listen and communicate with employees and clients.""Lerner and Rowe takes employee satisfaction seriously as well.  If an employee is satisfied with their job, they are more likely to provide exceptional service to clients and their fellow co-workers.  Lerner and Rowe employees have expressed that they are very pleased working at the law firm.  A case manager at Lerner and Rowe stated ""I have seen Mr. Rowe take personal interest in client cases and in giving back to the community.  He is not a silent partner by any means. He actively seeks justice and fair treatment for clients and local community groups and organizations that are in need. Mr. Rowe truly has earned the title of being the ""Attorney with a Heart.""Lerner and Rowe recognizes that complaints posted on Ripoff Report (whether true or not) are issues that need to be addressed, not ignored.  If handled correctly, complaints can be valuable learning opportunities. With the feedback generated by Ripoff Report’s review, it became apparent that Lerner and Rowe has made organizational changes allowing its users and employees a more streamlined approach to problem resolution and a commitment to a great user experience.In summary, after our review, which included discussions with Lerner and Rowe's executive team, Ripoff Report is convinced that Lerner and Rowe is committed to quality delivery of services resulting in total user satisfaction.Read more about why consumers should feel confident when doing business with a member of Ripoff Report's Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.

Then he calls a few days later and tells me to take the plea. Back and forth he would swing. I did not know what to do. On the day of court Kris was not prepared and was so angry at me for asking questions about the case he began to raise his voice at me  saying completely in appropriate things. He was obviously aggravated because my questions were relevant and he did not do any work on my case at all. He got me such a great plea that I got to pay restitution for items that do not exist and that are not related to the case.He would not listen to my side of the story yet he was supposed to be representing me. I believe he entrapped my witness into saying things he would not normally say just to discredit him so that I would have not witnesses at trial. Therefore, he backed me into a corner to take the plea so he could stop dealing with this case. Had he listened to me and gave an ounce of care he would have discovered mitigating factors that would have had lent cause to have the case dismissed.If you get Kris as your defender ask for another attorney.

After making agreements with payment options and with some paperwork being received that the process wouldn't start til they had received the initial payment which was $1,192.00. When the date came for the withdrawal from my checking I saw it didn't go threw couldn't understand why the money was there. I had called to see what was going on and they said they are running it but its getting denied. Called my bank and they told lpful on me they are trying to run it threw the savings which had already been done twice mind you I'm getting overdrafts each time the run it. I called again told them they are running it wrong that its going threw savings not checking. They do it again same way savings getting another overdraft fee that there gave me a red flag when we decided to cancel the service the payment got withdrawn again but correctly this time from checking. When I told the Amanda my go to person I want to cancel she had to direct me to her supervisor Vanessa I had explained to her I wasn't liking the service of them not getting payment right so I feel that the rest of my experience was going to be the same I want to cancel my account and get my money refunded back,she had agreed told me I would get the full refund that it would take up to 2 weeks and if I hadn't received it by then call the accounting dept.This took place on Feb 28th 2012.

Week went by no refund call again no answer leave voice mail..no call back,call again no answer leave a message .

I call spoke to Neph he put me on hold and when he came back he told me he was going to put me threw to someone who is going to get this resolved and the money refund.

Josh said that I was getting refund $253.00 due to the man hours that were put into my file mind you that I had cancelled,he had people he had to pay. I told him that I didn't agree with what he is saying I want my full amount refunding he said that is impossible.,then he ask what is a reasonable amount to be refunded to me I said a $1,000.00. josh response is not happening,i said okay I'll have my husband call and discuss this with you further. Josh proceeded the same with my husband and ask my husband what would be a reasonable amount back, my husband tells him 80% of it back. Josh said I'll see what I can do and I will call you back. Josh never called back we had to call him again asking what did we come up with on the refund this was a week later I went from him saying I was going to get back $253.00 to according to him in the negatives to were they aren't going to charge me those fees. We asked for him to provide a progress doc.for services he claims they had done after I clearly told them I didn't want ,Josh is saying he can't provide any we still demanded that he does and we will see if anything will come .

No surprises there as I had only sent about 7 lines worth and the most basic of details about my case.  Anyway he encouraged to me to call him back (I never did).About 20 seconds after I listen to the voicemail which i did immediately after he hung up, I receive an email from him saying that his retainer is $5,000 and there's a retainer agreement attached.  I'm sitting there saying to myself 'what the ****' not only have I never even spoken directly to the guy, i've not even told him much of my situtation and he fully admitted that he didn't know what I wanted to achieve, so how on earth can he expect to say he can help me and want me to sign a retainer agreement before even having a consultation???????  On top of that $5,000 is way to much!!!!!This  man has been on tv on various shows - just search You Tube for his name.To me and many others he is running a scam, I have not, and will not have any further contact with this so called gold digger (aka attorney).",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Like so many I also had to start over and this is where I'm at in life....about 10 or 11 yrs ago I had the brilliant idea to not file taxes, that the IRS wouldn't care about little ol me. Uh uh stupid I know now. The IRS recently started garnishing my wages and seem to think that all I and my family need to live on is $305 a week. So I had seen so many tax masters commercials on tv and finally gave them a call. They contacted me the next day, went over everything, and told me it would be $5050.00 to fix the situation, being to file my 03,04,05,06,07,08,09,10,11 taxes. And to have the garnishment removed,and to act as negotiator with the IRS. They would then give me the option of paying the IRS or I could pay them which would be cheaper because they apply the payment to the principle rather than the interest. I was kind of surprised I wasn't expecting it to be so much, and asked if they would be working while I paid or did it have to be paid fist. The rep assured me that they would start the case while I paid and the garnishment would be off within 3 to 4 weeks. $500 to start the process, an additional $776 within 10 days and then $1000 a month for 4 months starting 3/15/12 which there was no way I could do. So that next week I paid an additional $2500 making my deposit to get everything goading $3000 . A whole lot of money for me. Ian the Mean time I told my company that my tax issues were being taken care of that the garnishment would be lifted soon, so they started giving some of the work to meagain, since I had been put on the back burner while the other guys that would actually benefit from the extra work were getting it. After about 4 weeks of not hearing from anyone I a called and the man I reached was I could tell trying to get rid of me, every time I sked a question I was put on hold at the end of it I was repeatedly told that they had everything they needed and would be in touch soon. I demanded to speak to someone and was given to another lady who tried to shoo me away, finally admitting that my case hadn't even been processed. She also said they would need to have a power of attorney and a copy of my garnishment order since it wasn't in my file, but that she would put my casetheoughwith a rush order. She said she would be in touch with me in the next day or few. 3 or 4 weeks later I called them again after having called and leaving messages and no response. The same guy answered and told me they had supposedly had a consultation with the IRS but couldn't do anything but repeat what was on the paperwork that I had sent them with the power of attorney.

As your report stated, they requested all the documentation, Income Tax Information, Internet","										In October 2009 wife had lost her job and after several months of living off of one income we saw a tv advertisement to do a home loan modification with Home Mitigation Services in February 2010. I called the 800 number and spoke with a representative who told me they could get our loan modified in 60-90 and it would cost us $2,500. In February 2010 my wife and I took this money out of our retirement savings which sent a cashier's check to them and provided all of our financial information and income tax information to Danny Rodriquez, who was action on behalf of Sheldon Fleishman.After sending all the requested info we were told to just wait and be patient. This went on for months. Every time we called to inquire to the status of our case we were told that the bank was looking at the info and it would just take time. Then we got transferred to another representative, a Dave Costello. Finally by May 2010, Home Mitigation Services told us that the bank will not consider doing a home loan modification for us unless we were at least 30 days or more behind in mortgage payment. My wife and I did our best to keep up with the mortgage even with only one income by borrowing money trying to keep good status with the bank. Even after we were 30 days behind in payment, nothing changed and Home Mitigation Services kept telling us to wait two weeks and we'll see what happens. Two weeks turned into two months and longer. Then we were switched somewhere in the process to another agent, Rayna Riggi. She too told us that we had to wait two more weeks. When I contacted the bank in August of 2010 and asked them how the home loan modification process was going with Home Mitigation Services, they told me they have no record of anyone from that company working on our behalf. When I contact Home Mitigation Services they just said it was due to the fact that they were working with another dept. and not to worry. November 2010 Bank of America sent us a payment offer that almost doubled our payments to make up a new contract. When I contacted HMS, they had no information about any modification to that nature and told me to ignore thepaperwork.By December 2010 there still was no offer from HMS for a modified loan contract and no indication whatsoever that HMS had ever even been in contact with our mortgage lender, Bank of America. The last contact I heard from HMS and Danny Rodriguez was that their office was closed in January 2011 for winter storms. Since then, all phone numbers and contacts with Home Mitigation Services have been disconnected.  My wife and I finally negotiated our own terms with Bank of America for a modified loan and Home Mitigation Services had nothing to do with the process. I have recently contacted Sheldon Fleishman to request a refund of our money. As consistent with Home Mitigation Services and its employees, he said ""I'm looking into it and I'll get back to you.""									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

 Attorney Rhonda K. Walker SBN 175108 Paid and leaves Clients stranded. Fraud upon the Court Arcadia, California","										I have had my life left in ruins ever since ATTORNEY RHONDA K. WALKER (SBN 175108) did not show up and challenge a FRAUDULENTLY FILED DEFAULT CLAIM  ( RELIEF OF STAY HEARING ) against my Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Case # 2-10 -bk-20998 by my 2nd lender FOOTHILL FINANCIAL LP and its partners RON ASCHIERIS and JOHN ASCHIERIS   and their REPRESENTING ATTORNEY AMY MARTINEZ  on July 2, 2010.THE MOTION FOR RELIEF OF STAY FILED BY CREDITOR FOOTHILL FINANCIAL LP AND ITS PARTNERS RON ASCHIERIS, JOHN ASCHIERIS AND THEIR ATTORNEY AMY MARTINEZ WAS... ENTIRELY FRAUDULENT AND IT WAS FILED WITH FULL DOCUMENTED KNOWLEDGE BY ALL PARTIES AS FRAUD UPON THE COURT TO OBTAIN RELIEF OF STAY. THE MOTIVATION WAS THAT IFTHEY COULD NOT GET RELIEF OF STAY BY JULY 15 AND TAKE MY HOME TO SALE BY THAT DATE JULY 15, 2010 ...THEY WOULD HAVE TO START THE ENTIRE FORECLOSURE PROCESS ALL OVER AGAIN UNDER CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE 2924 BECAUSE UNDER THE LAW THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS OF 1 YEAR (365 DAYS) WOULD OF EXPIRED IN JULY 15, 2010.I had been making all the timely required payments as required to the chapter 13 Trustee  Kathy Dockery which also included Attorney Rhonda Walker legal fees each month as part of the Chapter 13 Plan. As difficult as it can be I was in compliance to all of the requirements demanded by the Chapter 13 Trustee so that I could have my Chapter 13 Plan confirmed if not by July 8, 2010 I shouldbe able to comply within 30 days and the court allows some time to revise an Amended Chapter 13Plan.I wanted to make sure I stayed on top of taking care of every requirement because my beloved family home of over 37 years was a stake along with my business because I was able to work from my home.I had a CONTRACT with Attorney Rhonda K. Walker that was included with my required filed paperwork that CLEARLY states that she will represent me and defend me in... ANY RELIEF OF STAY PROCEEDINGS WHILE MY CASE WAS ACTIVE AND NOT DISMISSED.  Attorney Rhonda Walker fees as contracted were $ 4500 to represent me in my Chapter 13 Case and were being paid through the chapter 13 plan each month as required. On July 4th,2012 over the extended 4th of July Holiday weekend the Shortened Time motion was dropped on my doorstep received hearing was for July 8th, 2010 so I knew Foothill Financial LP and their Representing Attorney  Amy Martinez were trying to pull a fast one by me hoping I would not receive the package until the day of the Hearing July 8th because of the extended holiday weekend knowing  Monday the Courts and Post office would be closed. I was still ready and prepared.  Because of numerous problems with Attorney Rhonda K. Walker repeatedly not keeping on top of my case and  having to repeatedly rushing to file required paperwork for my case at the US Bankruptcy Court myself I had opened up a PERSONAL ACCOUNT WITH .. PACER ELECTRONIC FILING TO FOLLOW AND STAY ON TOP OF MY CASE. On the Friday afternoon around 3pm before the 4 day extended 4th of July weekend I logged on my PACER account and discovered THE OPPOSITION AND THEIR ATTORNEY AMY MARTINEZ FILED a SHORTENED TIME RELIEF OF STAY MOTION.I immediately called and left several message and emailed my Attorney Rhonda K. Walker to warn her and let her know I read the Motion on PACER and that it was ENTIRELY FALSE WITH NO MERIT AND OPPOSING PARTY AND COUNSEL HAD KNOWINGLY FILED A FRAUDULENT MOTION UNDER THE RULES AND GUIDELINES SET BY THE COURT UNDER THE (ADEQUATE PROTECTION ORDER FROM 4/28/2010).My Attorney Rhonda K. Walker finally responded after 3 days  to my many calls of concern on July 6, 2010. The Shortened Time hearing was only 2 days away and she said she needed me to fax over docs and proof of payments to show I had made all my timely payments by certified check. I did so immediately. I had faxed the required docs in the weeks before and she said to fax over the proof docs again and don't worry about itOn July 8, 2010 I went to meet my Attorney at the Bankruptcy Court.  She was doing everything to avoid taking to me and I became very suspicious while she was watching the calender being calledfor my case and seemed to be very nervous.  I had all the requested documents needed the Chapter 13 Trustee had demanded to comply as required to resolve the objections for the Confirmation hearing.  The Shortened Time Motion for relief was to be also heard the same day but my Attorney was talking to another Attorney while I patiently waited.OUT OF NOWHERE and right before my Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Case is about to be called by the Judge Alan Ahart from the Court Calender.... My Attorney Rhonda K, Walker blurts out ""I need you to go downstairs and file these papers in the clerks office downstairs asap"" I was upset and said my case is about to come up any minute. Attorney Rhonda K, Walker said just do it real quick you will be right back. (I knew something was going on and I am not an Attorney or a paralegal that is suppose to be filing my documents and other people documents).  It is not my Job to be doing what My Attorney is suppose to be doing). My Attorney Rhonda K. Walker is contracted and suppose to ""file my papers""     I literally ran as fast as I could to the filing office a few floors down dropped off the papers and ran back as fast as I could to get back to the Courtroom to be present as my case is called.  It only took me a couple minutes to only come back.  I got back and Attorney Rhonda K. Walker was already taking to the judge and letting the trustee call out objections and not responding or objecting  or defending me in any way whatsoever... all the time knowing I had  everything at handavailable to handle any objections to continue on with my case.  Attorney Rhonda K. Walker only requested the judge to not impose the180 bar order to refile another Chapter 13 case.  I had previous bankruptcy filings filed with my Attorney Rhonda K. Walker which under the Bankruptcy code would leave me with no protection in a multi filing situation ..No Automatic Stay.  After a prior case is dismissed you dont have the Automatic Stay to block the Foreclosure Sale.  I have to petition the court for a hearing to request the court grant the Automatic Stay again which takes approx. 2 weeks.  Without a Automatic Stay order in place... Nothing could stop my home of over 30 years of going to Foreclosure Sale in only 7 days and she knew it the entire time.Judge Ahart even stated to Attorney Rhonda K. Walker  on the record when she requested to not have the 180 bar to refile another case imposed. "" Judge Ahart stated "" I will not impose the 180 bar for multifilings, but Council  I don't understand what you are trying to accomplish to help your client when  refiling another case will not give any Automatic Stay protection or help him in any way.I ended up discovering that Attorney Rhonda K.Walker on July 1st, 2010... Yes the days before and leading up to most critical and most important time of my life KNEW SHE WAS GETTING SANCTIONED AND BARRED FROM PRACTICING LAW  by the very same court for $900 AND COULD NOT EVEN FILE PAPERWORK BECAUSE OF NON COMPLIANCE OF FILING DOCUMENTS THROUGH PACER.  And she was suspened and barred from practicing law at the US Bankruptcy Court Central District of California on July 13, 2010..... Yes at the very same time in between she threw my case intentionally to get DISMISSED. and 2 days before I lose my home forever she knows she is GOING TO GET BARRED FROM PRACTICING LAW AND.... NEVER TOLD ME ANYTHING AND THEN AVIODS   OVER A 100 DESPARATE PHONE CALLS AND SIMPLY LETS MY HOME of over 30years go to foreclosure sale jULY 15, 2010  as she knew I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.I have since discovered that Rhonda K. Walker SBN #175108 has had several other cases where she has taken the clients money and left them stranded and end up losing their longtime homes as I I have and lost nearly everything.  Yet this Attorney seems to only get minor disciplinary actions and probation while the UNSUSPECTING CLIENTS she has intentionally robbed and left stranded become homeless and literally end up losing everthing. She has done  the same thing repeatedly. Simply put. Taking a clients money and leavingthem absolutely stranded continually is the same violation and pattern... over and over again.This is about the worse thing an Attorney can do to you, because even if want to get anotherAttorney she took your money and it will cost 2 times as much to clean up the legal mess shecontinually leaves behind.This Attorney Rhonda K. Walker needs to be disbarred for life.  She has ruined many families lives with absolutely no remorse. She tries to divert the pure thievery away by saying her ex husband left her stranded with 1 child. She claims her ex husband left her stranded... In reality he has morals he can't stand having a Unethical Immoral Thief for a wife !  My life is devastated and will probably never be the same.  Attorney Rhonda Walker gets to go to a nice warm home and still even kept the money she took from numerous clients  for doing nothing but contributing to a lifetime a misery and further major life changing set backs for hard working families. All of this  from someone  whom we thought we could entrust and legally represent us in our time of need. Rhonda K. Walker is a  embarrassment to the Cal State Bar and to all of the other ethical Attorneys and ethics it represents. 									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Then told me he would contact Wells Fargo directly to get it resolved. 4 weeks later, he now refuses to return e-mails, still no response from Wells Fargo, and the system is once again clogged by illegal foreclosure filings.

I reported them both to the police and the FBI, and this bastard is now deported back to the hellhole country he came from, but not before he served a lengthy and fruitful prison sentence.Women usually do it in the way you tried to do (and failed to accomplish) using unwanted sexual offers, unsolicited sending of photographs, and other salacious comments (I always react the same way, ie, by first showing the evidence to everyone that matters, warning the offender about their conduct, and if they refuse to stop, diplomatically (and sometimes undiplomatically) refusing representation if they have not already been retained, or terminating immediately if they already have been retained - exactly what I did in your case).Either way it is the same Modus Operandi by the same criminal mindset - extortion and blackmail is an art form, and you quite frankly are not really very good at it.

Its because I didn't want to deal with your sick and twisted self.And I too, had many witnesses to your gross and digusting sexual prevarications and come-ons, all designed to try and blackmail and extort me into continuing representing you in what the FBI called a ""poison pen"" case.You are transparent, psychopathic, psychotic, dangerous, and manipulative, and you belong in jail or in a mental institution.

I had got a call from her in september and at which time she said that I should contact the mortgage company myself because they was not responding to her and that I should try for a modification through them, and see if they respond to me ~ which they did. The last contact that I had with this person was an email on 10-5-09 asking for yet more info ~ They had everything I had. Then the contact stopped ~ I called the number that I had and left many of messages with no response, and no reponse to the many e-mails that I had sent. Me and my wife felt like fools to have gave away our money as well as all of our personal information, and didnt know what to do other that not say anything to anyone else about it, and pray nothing else bad becomes of it. We were turned down for a loan modification through 2 different mortgage companys because the original one sold the note to BOA and they kept giving us the run around, and wanted all of the back payments up to date before they would even talk to us and the only reason we stopped making the payments is because we were told by the paralegal not to send any more payments until we were approved for a loan modification. In may of 2012 we just walked away from our house because of the stress it was causing to myself as well as my family. This law firm did nothing for us and took our money and ran so use your judgement before you hand over your money to anyone ~ You can go through your own mortgage company for a loan modification and it wont cost you a dime and you will probably get the same results.  									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Satisfied with that answer, I paid her. Up to that point she went out of her way to advise me and counsel me, to the point irritation; telling me she was more on my side than his, to see a therapist, to divorce him before I got AIDS like another woman she knew. I just wanted a legally sound agreement, with no bias as my husband and I were agreeable to the terms. However, Debra was actually highly recommended by 2 of my friends (one of whom later changed her opinion of Debra due to the way her own experience with her ended), hence my decision to ignore the sudden claims of affection and strange unrequested loyalty  (""you are very dear to me Amy"" -this from a woman who had met with me 3 times) and engage her legal services.When I later informed her that I had decided on divorce (about August 2010), she said it would cost 350 or so more. I reiterated what she told me before about it not costing more, and she became defensive and said that I could get in trouble for receiving a waiver for the original filing fee. [When I first came in, my husband and I had a fair amount of money and could easily have afforded the extra fee for filing, on top of the 1,500.00 to Debra. I told her we could afford it, and she said ""If you do not have a job, you don't have to pay it"" and I said ok. Later she tried to turn it around and threaten me with it] She hung up on me (the first of about 3 times - the last 3 calls I have had with her -me being very calm and nice and her being quite antagonizing, talking without letup and needless to say not helping me, her client, at all). When she finally returned my calls about a week later, she said the price was now higher, about 400 or 500. I said, ok, I don't have that, (as at that point I was quite broke, with no financial support or job) but I will look into it. Now being a bit wiser, I asked her to give me something in writing stating for X amount of dollars she would do X (finish my divorce). She stated quite rudely ""I'm not going to waste my time with that"" and talked non stop for about a minute before hanging up on me again. I called back and left several very pleasant messages (not wanting to set off this obviously crazy person to whom I had paid a fortune and had my legal future in her hands) asking for a simple email. This was never done. She does not return my calls, and I have no idea if my husband was served (he says he never got any papers), or if my case was filed at all. It has been about a year since I have heard from her, despite my having left voice mails, and of course paying her 1,500.00 which I have since learned is about what an attorney would charge for a non contested divorce like mine. I am now faced with doing this divorce myself, with little to no money, and do not even have a case number, as she is completely AWOL.									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Brian Steele, left that firm and took my file with him.  Subsequently he went to court even though his former employer had been informed of my bankruptcy.  They were awarded judgement against me and a lien placed on my home.I didn't find out about the lien until I tried to sell my home some 5-6 years later.  At which time I tried to get the lien removed.  I provided copies of my bankruptcy paperwork but was informed that Mr. Higgenson did not file the proper paperwork in my bankruptcy to keep this from happening.  I even went to the trouble of taking my bankruptcy paperwork to the Porter County courthouse to present to the judge.  At which time he withdrew the judgement with prejudice.  This however did nothing to lift the lien against my property.I contacted the law office in Merrillville of Mr. Geraci to talk to Attorney Higgenson.  I was told that he no longer worked there.  So I tried first to find where he went.  I was unable to find him, so I talked to the office manager and explained my problem to him.  After several calls he informed me that the proper paperwork had not been filed on my behalf and the only way to resolve the issue was to re-open my bankruptcy at additional costs.  I feel that this was not my fault and that I provided the correct information for this not to happen.  After explaining this to the office manager, he stopped returning my calls.  I have been ripped off and my credit rating is suffering for it.  Not to mention that I am rapidly approaching retirement age and am unable to sell my home.  Or refinance it at this time because of the adverse effects of Mr. Geraci's inept attorney.

pedophile uncle bought my lawyer.  a circus ensued.  .....and from that day on, my very tight criminal and civil case went to pieces.  i have paid about 12,000 thus far, and am still being billed for another almost 6,000.  the lawyer for the other side felt i had a good case.  but my lawyer justin white was hoping to make twice the money, by my own civil case and through the under the table purchasing by my uncle, james wilson cook jr.  of grand  haven michigan, also has a house in kalamazoo michigan, also keeps an address in nyc, also keeps property under his son's name, michael cook.  and probably a lot of others.   i have documentation, film, everything that supported the criminal events and the civil lawsuit i filed.  but my uncle bought and paid for a new house for my lawyer, and bought the illegal manipulating of my case -- all of the above was through the for-hire services of a local ""political thug"" who is well known in this area and makes his entire living off of the actions of ferreting out secrets of the opponents and of manipulating no matter how illegally the end result of anything in this locale that you can imagine.  just pay david guidarini of 1060 new pear street enough money and you can have anything done ot your opponent, or your ex, or your neighbor, anything.  he is well known, well protected, and expensive.  my uncle has several million he inherited and retired from his government job in 2000.  buying the ""services"" of david guidarini or justin white or the woman leah togno who was part of the effort and was also well paid (she was overheard telling someone that she was paid 800 a month plus expenses and was given a house on 6 d'shibe street here in vineland as payment for her ""work"" and for keeping quiet.).  in addition, i hav esince acquired proof as word and proof in recordings and proof in email of my lawyer justin white breaching all manner of attorney client privilege and sharing many many things with the very persons i was suing.  as well as later allowing the other side to manage my evidence, depose me, and then he himself helped them to craft a pending potential or threatened ( i dont know what it is called) charge of pimping my then young teen daughters by allowing them to wear those workout/jogging.gym clothes style tops that are called ""sports bras"" inside the house in the kitchen on a 98 degree day with the curtains open to the back yard thereby enticing a strange man who was found videotaping my daughters..  the proof?  because i had video of HIM while i waited for the police.  justin white later fired me as a client claiming i was not cooperating with him.  no, i was not, and only a fool would have.  he also claimed i was not paying my bill.  but i have paid over 12.000 and still owe another 6000 and tha tis hardly NOT paying a bill.  he - justin white - was heard by another lawyer, vincent pancari, at a party telling every lawyer within earshot that i was a bad client, a liar, that i was trying to tap the system for free money, that any lawyer who would take me on after what ""he had been through"" would be just crazy, that i was crazy, that he gave me all the best legal advice in the world, that he had reached the settlement agreement o ftens of thousands of dollars and tha ti wa so greedy i refused to take it and demanded he ""get me more""......that i never paid him a penny (testa's accounting department will tell you otherwise)....oh god, it was awful.  i could not get a lwyer now in this town even if my life depended on it and i paid them triple.  yes, because of justin whites unfounded mouth.  he had ot cover up and protect what he was doing.  he was a new lawyer and he fell so fast and deep into corruption that i suppose he hoped that i was ""nobody"" - i am - and that it was ok, as long as he used his authority to refute any future attempts i might make to complain.   it is very convoluted, and much wrong was done in every way as well as emotionally, physically and reputation-wise in this little town to me and my daughters.  we never deserved it.  through all of this, i have quietly continued to raise my now late-teen daughters and the severely autistic 6 year old daughter of my last marriage.  this is not a situation that developed suddenly, my uncle married my aunt and proceeded to, according to my mother, sexually assault me as a tot.  i do not remember.  but he was always hateful then to her.  i grew up with a safe distance from him, but my aunt was always blaming my mother for being ""mean"" to my aunt's ""hunny"".  and the same things that hav ebeen done to me, my husband, then my next one, my dad, my brothers, my daughters, and my son is the same as what was done at my mother and all involved when i was a child.  it is my wealthy socio and pedophile uncle.  he later accessed my daughters one day.  many many years later, after my mother, my grandfather, my grandmother, and my uncles father and then shortly later his father all met untimely unnatural ""accident"" deaths, where my uncle was always the last one to have any contact with the dead person, i wa sleft with virtually no family, and the same problems started happening to ME that had once been the bane of my mothers life.  the neighbors suddenly acting wierd, snooping in my windows, the flat tires, the shorted out new car batteries, husbands who suddenly claim a person close to the family who has known me since childhood assured them i was sleeping around and doing drugs and drinking (i do not) and causing those men to leave, leaving me alone with little girls....and out of hte blue comes my aunts husband waving the flag of money to help me.  all i had to do to stop all my troubles he said, over and over, was let him spend time with my little girls, so he could and i quote ""teach them how to be loved by a good man and so that they wont grow up afraid of big men who are kind to them.""  then my grandmother begged me to come back up to michigan to be with her after she had been in the rest home for a good many years already (she was healthy and still drove and did her own shopping and cooking), as my uncle and aunt had secured some kind of legal claim and hold over my grandmother and they then used that legal thing to put her into a rest home  and allowed only 25 dollars a month and was in a rest home (NOT a nursing home)  for the next thirteen years.  while the aunt and uncle happily  spent her own millions left to her by my grandfather.  meanwhile, i did not then know all of this.  what i did know was that my own friends and husband in nc were taking a strange turn.  no matter what i did, they said i was doing all manner of impossible things otherwise.  i was left with no job, a landlord who accused me of ""being immoral"" and said she had a person ""close to the situation who knew""  that told her so she wanted me and my children out of there.  and my car was badly tampered with one night soon after that.  i had no where to go.  my aunt offered me ""help' if i came back up to michigan since my grandmother wanted me there anyway.  had i known then what i later realized, was that the pattern was not ""me a bad person"" but that of my uncle manipulating things to acquire opportunity to molest my little girls as he once did nto me, and i later heard from my aunt that he has been accused and in and out of many dismissed court cases of other poor, and single moms who claimed he molested their little girls.  my aunt called them golddiggers and was pleased thatteach time, her ""hunny"" was able to beat the charges and the (((REDACTED FOUL LANGUAGE))) didnt get a single dime for their lies.    but too late for me, i was back up there, with nothing in my favor, and every time i even made a friend, within a couple of weeks, that person would suddenly act strange or accuse me of being eveyrthing from a mobster to a slut to a druggie to a child abuser.  it was crazy, and i thought i was going crazy.  then one day, in the dead of winter, i had no hot water at my rental home again.  so my uncle wa ssuppsed to be out of town, and my aunt said i could bring the girls over to the house there and they could shower, and then i was going to take my grandmother  out to pizza hut for lunch.  my uncle came in from somewhere, whether outside or hiding in the house i dont know, and he locked himself in the bathroom where my daughters were - one was in the tub, one was on the toilet.  i was getting fresh towels from the dryer.  i heard them screaming and ran back, and the door was locked.  i heard nothing from him, but their screams and the locked door, i kicked the door in, and there he was in his goddam boxers and a tshirt, and laughing as he grabbed the one who was on the toilet and was reaching at the one in the tub who was dodging him.  i punched him and pushed him out, and he laughed and said that was the stupidest thing i had ever don eyet, and said at least i was ""more fun"" than my mothe r who always used to just cry and act like a victim.  dear god. i knew then, i knew so much tha ti had not relaized right then and htere.  and from that day on, james cook never even tried to hide the things he was doing to destroy me, not even a little bit.  no matter how insane his actions, he had and has the money and the sociopaths way of making it somehow believable to people around him and it is a living hell for me.  meanwhile, this lawyer justin white probably did more damage all by himself with his abuse o fhis license than even david guidarini and james cook together.  what can i do?  nothing.  i am no one.  i ma the poor, old, poverty stricken dumb woman who all these years refused to die by accident as every other member of my family has when they questions james wilson cook jr's behaviors or motives.  i am no one.  jus tthe dumb single mothe rwho refused to belive that i was ""crazy"", who refused to care anymore i fmy husbands were scared off, who refused to believe that i had to succumb to this sick man and hand over access to my daughters (and now of course, it iwll never end since i have a noverbal autistic 6 year old girl, god almighty, the irony of it), but not for any relief do i ever give in.  no matter WHAT he puts us through.  my dad knows. my son has witnessed enough.  we know it sounds paranoid, and james cook and yes, justin white, all get away with this, because they can hide behind the ""she is a paranoid woman alone who is frustrated by poverty and getting old and not having a man"" and on and on.  meet me, you will see that is not the case.  talk to my father in nc - he is terrified of james cook jr.  -  talk to my son - he is 30 years old in michigan with four kids o fhis own.  i wish you could ask the other women in my family, but they all died of unnatural causes.  accidents.  you do not suss out this uncle without some sort of reprisal.   find out how the actual home purchase occurred and how it was recommended to my lawyer justin white.  he will lie, and of course he iwll get away with it.  another lawyer whom i hired to assist me with another extremely illegitimate eviction (for about two years, the landlord here was assisting htis uncle, along with anthony cinotti of milmay nj....and i was subject to regular illegal and frivolous evictons that served no purpose except to harass and to cause me ot spend money), that other lawyer was bennett bardfeld.  a respected lawyer here.  and out of hte blue, he started doing things that were not right.  and out of the blue, as soon as he somehow mangled my court date for some other charge concerning rats and public health threats from the landlords property, i dont know, but i was not aware of a change of court date, and the lawyer bennet bardfeld i guess was aware, and he went in to court and told them he did not know where his client was so he was asking to be removed.  and a warrant for arrest for me wa sissued, for failure to appear for a date that had not even be set, near as anyone at the clerk knew, for a charge of ""feeding, harboring and entertaining wild rodents"" on the landlords proerty because she had a rat and squirrel problem here and somehow the city inspector, decided that the sewage leak in the basement pipe on the other tenants side was caused by me and that caused rats to want to come into the basement because the inspector ordered me to leave my side of the basement ope to the the outside for a period of weeks to ""dry out"" and then he ordered me to clean, disinfect, repair any mold damage and to ensure the health and safety of the other tenants and to repair and replace all faulty sewage piping in the building and to stop feeding, harboring and entertaining wild rodents in city limits and he ticketed me for this.  a ticket for a civil violation of the city code enforcement in this town is a thing tha tis to include a fee, and if you pay the fee, there is no court.  and no tenant can be charged by the city, only the landlord.  the landlord can then choose to sue the tenant.  whci is the oNLY thing the landlord never tried to evict me for.   i had already paid him three hundred .  again.  david guidarini literally bragged to my face when i confronted him tha ti could not do anything about any of this, ""sister - you better learn to play the game - even bennett is in my back pocket, haha, and my guy said do this dave, so i did this, and you better get used to it, this is the real world, sistahhh....hahahaha - see baby in this town and in this state, i am your biggest nightmare, so dont (((REDACTED FOUL LANGUAGE))) with me.""  i have had cops come to the door,  and accuse me of writing email messages in hebrew and ordering me to

did nto need ot know.  i yelled at him, he said it was driveways express and he was from kalamazoo michigan.  i later called that company and HE answered and he hung up on me every time.  as did the jt exterminator guy when i called that number when they were out here cussing me and my daughter.   there is the officer, sgt chris davis.  david guidarini is very verbal aroudn town about how chris davis is ""in his pocket"" and sgt davis came out one night and ordered me to make a statement, that i had to make a statement, oh -- anything at all that i thought i needed to tell him before they found something or another and came back to arrest me and leave my kids with the state to care for them.  he asked me for the name of my nearest ""responsible"" relative who could afford to take care of my pretty little girls.  there are more.  i have had each one of htese persons in court, and somewhere somehow it got dismissed.  by justin white,  justin said i had no right to bring those charges in , but the attornies justin white was the one, along with mike testa sr, who told me to do it in the first place.  they changed their minds later.  maybe after they were paid better, i dont know.  the situation goes on.  does it sound crazy?  yes.  i know it is.  we have been livign it.  it has not stopped.  the uncle still has money is retired from his supervisor position at the muskegon social security office,  - he retired just after the estate was cleared after his mothers accidental death that year.  and all he has done since is harass me , because NO woman NONE shall keep their little girls from him, if he wants them, or they WILL pay a price.  he has not i dont think encountered one who simply will not give in or give up.  you can take everything from me and leave me in shreds, but my girls will never be handled again.  he more and more desperately wants the youngest as she is nonverbal and autistic, and he will no doubt be able to do anything with her and NO ONE would ever know.  how would they?  so if i cannot stop him, and apparently i cannot, then i will continue to advertise every scrap of information and events and names to every where that i can until there are nno more persons willing to do these ungodly things for james wilson cook jr's money.  if that is the only thing i can do, i will do it.  and justin white and bennett bardfeld and david guidarini and anthony cinotti and marie fisher and leah togno and tomas togno and mike testa sr and joan charlotte cook (who enabled and permitted her hunny all these years) -- these people all have the money, the ""community standing"", and the respect and the gift of glib lying, none of which i have, and i doubt i ever will.  this did not mean that htey were ""right"" by virtue of getting away with it.  this is a nightmare of a big huge james cook fantasy-sized 1-2-3 punch that was suppose dto be the ultimate.  or as david guidarini likes to say -- ""the kabash, and ripping a new asshole"", and such.   justin white loved to reiterate those vivid expressions with abandon too.  as if this were my preferred form of communication.  these are words i had heard too often from my uncle long before these men ever met him.  all i know is as a retired federal employee and a man with tons of money and community ""respect"" there is nothing i can do to him.  the lies and the damage to reputation and even my will to do more than get up each day and breathe has been too great.  but the other persons, and justin white, they can be made ot deal with their corruptions, their lies, their greed, their thievery, their utmost disregard for the lives and health and safety of these children of mine.  dear god.  that is why they needed me to move on out of here.  james cook KNEW if i stayed too long in one place, i would put it all together.  but this time, the very expensive ""kabash"" he tried to create around me here only made me hurt and confused and poor and alone.  i loved my husband.  but i will protect my children first.  i loved my friends.  but my children are first.  i had a sterling reputation.  but i will not sacrifice my children to preserve it.  i have no future, no real life.  but they DO.  and the littlest one iwll never get touched by that uncle, as her sisters were, whether or not anyone is ever able to do anything or whether or not anyone ever exposes the filth of justin whites behaviors or those others who helped james cook int his venture.  what a huge huge mess, all jsut to show ME that he WILL (((REDACTED FOUL LANGUAGE))) if he wants and NO ONE will get away with anything otherwise.  if it is true to form, it would not surprise me if i ma next on the list of women in the family to die of an accident.  not one in his family OR mine has died of natural causes or direct illness.  always an accident that occurs, sometimes in the course of an ""illness"" sort of....but as i have come ot expect, i will nto be hear din these matters either.  my word against his word, and my word against anyone he pays and PROTECTS will always be nothing.  but exercise great care with lawyers such as justin white.  they are easily bought, by YOUR enemy.  and hti sin spite of me having literally piles of real hard documentation, audio and visual, reports, transcripts.  dear god, justin white LET THE PERSON I WAS SUING DO THE TRANSCRIBING OF MY OWN VIDEO!!!  that was when i realized it was true, i was being played with in a manner so disgraceful i went home and cried for days.  dear god.  all these years, why me?  why mine?  because a pedophile who is rich and has ""connections"" and who lies with ease got away with everything he ever did????  so what ar ethese people going to do to me or mine that they have not done already?  really?  they could tell the truth.  do the right thing instead.  that would be amazing.  that would be the only thing not done yet.  my uncle could see abou tmy own death.  i am next.  my mother.  my grandfather.  his mother.  his father.  my grandmother.  not one was natural.  every one was accidents.  every time he was the last seen in the area.  and you think the justin white story of legal corruption i just wrote is too crazy to believe?  live the nightmare, that we have lived.  this will be the easiest part to understand.  the rest of our lives because of the man who paid justin white and all those others -- that is what is hard to believe.  									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Suwannee, Georgia","										My husband and I worked with Ravi Mannam for my husbands immigration filing. We were filing for a green card for my husband. We trusted Mr. Mannam with all of our records and felt like he would be a great legal representative for us. We paid him over a thousand dollars at first. One day, we received a letter from INS stating that because my husband did not turn in the appropriate papers, that my husband may have to leave the country. We immediately called Mr. Mannam to find out what happened. He assured us that they sent the letter mistakenly and would call us back. When he did, we got a bombshell. The office had not sent our papers and on top of that Mr.Mannam could only request that INS make an exception, but he couldn't guarantee that my husband would not be deported. I felt as though Mr. Mannam was not caring or apologetic towards the mistake his office made. He returned the money to us and basically left us on our own. Better yet, he did not even tell us hisself. He had an associate female lawyer call me and tell me he would not represent us anymore. So, he did not fix the mistakes his office made and put our lives in jeopardy. I was so disappointed. How mean and selfish can someone be when they know that your survival and losing your family is on the line? One question I do have for Ravi Mannam is, what if your family was threatened to be torn apart because of someone being careless? I bet you would have fought for them. For anyone considering using him, do your research first and remember when your dealing with immigration, use someone that you know cares 100 percent about you and your families well being because if they make one mistake like this, it could tear your family apart. Thankfully, we found good people to help and finally got things straightened out. It took us 2 years of explaining and begging because of this.									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

The water not only flooded the apartment but because she was gone so long the carpets became mildewed, the wood floors destroyed and other fabrics including drapes were ruined. I was very sympathetic to her when we met but told her to use her insurance company for repairs. A few days later she informed me the insurance had lapsed and she had no recourse but to ask me to make repairs as it was a burst pipe in the wall that caused the flood. Of course I refused, it was not my fault she failed to maintain the insurance policy. The next week I received a call from her attorney demanding I pay for the damage. This was when I made the biggest mistake of my life, I refused. Weeks went by and I noticed contractors were fixing the tenants damage. It was peaceful and my wife and I started planning a trip to Jamaica. The day after we bought tickets the shit hit the fan big time. A lawsuit was filed against me by my tenant for damages and grief, but worst of all a letter came from the City attorneys office requesting a meeting over charging excess rent to not only that tenant but two others I had made arrangements with. Life for me would never be the same. I called my local attorney to help me but he told me he could not as I needed a real estate attorney. I went online and discovered just a few specializing in defending this kind of action. One in particular listed press articles about how good he was defending landlords from frivolous claims, Adam Leitman Bailey, the man who would destroy my life forever. I am a conservative Jew and when I met Mr. Bailey I saw right away from his head covering, he too was of my faith. He immediately explained to me how successful he was defending landlords who got themselves in trouble winning all his cases. He showed me press articles about himself and his firm. His request for retainer was reasonable and I signed with him immediately as both the City and tenants litigation was over my head.  I was initially impressed as Mr. Bailey postponed deadlines on meetings with the city and plaintiff. Our trip to Jamaica was back on, the last trip I would ever take with my wife and likely the last vacation of my life. My deposition took place three months later. I was not prepared for the hell that resulted. Mr. Bailey appointed one of his staff to be present and did not rehearse me properly. I was torn apart by opposing council. After decades of accepting cash payments for most of the rents including overcharges I forgot I had given all three tenants receipts for same! Dead in the water and not prepared by Bailey. This was just the beginning, though Bailey postponed the city hearing repeatedly that was the extent/ postponements. Later when I called the court directly I was told Bailey postponed hearings all the time and sometimes never appeared or cancelled! Then the bills starting coming for the postponements, over a two year period hundreds of thousands of dollars. He explained he had extensive phone conversations with both the city and tenant councils, meeting with lawyers in his firm to discuss my case, research in law books, lunch meetings and hundreds of hours dedicated to my case. I asked him why I had not been rehearsed thoroughly and prepared for my deposition. He told me it was best to just be honest and tell the truth. I told him the truth crucified me. He had no response on that. When my money ran out I met with him and so did my wife. He appeared quite interested in my much younger wife but I paid no attention. In an hour long meeting I agreed to sign a contract giving him my lifelong hard worked  for apartment building for any shortfall of money I might owe him, better I had committed suicide. I could continue on hear but my readers must know the end of this story. I lost everything, the case, my beautiful building to the tenants and Bailey and the investigation of the city for overcharging and my wife. I sit in a miserable tiny apartment in the Bronx living on my social security and welfare checks and contemplate suicide every day. Noone should go through this with an incompentent attorney.

John Mahoney, Atty Steven Herrick Don't Listen (or) Review Full Case - Pass you off on (inexperienced) Atty's NOT having experience to handle case Washington, District of Columbia"," I have no idea ""HOW"" this Law Firm charges Consult Fees BEFORE you speak with them.  If YOU are the Client looking to HIRE the Atty., YOU are the Boss and the Atty's are the prospective employees.  These Atty's need to EARN your business to hire them and ACT like they WANT your business.  I spoke with Atty. John Mahoney and his very shitty attitude he argued with me during my entire consult, refused to listen to my case, and stated to me: ""Management could do whatever the hell they wanted and nothing I could do about it...so what.""  (Thanks John for your ""uplifting"" motivation trying to ""SELL"" (market) yourself to a prospective Client (""Boss"") that was going to hire you.  All he cared about was his Consult Fee to entertain him for the hour.  He made comments, ""Congressman are worthless and Office of Special Council is a waste of time...you should've filed an EEO complaint.""  Given the fact I filed an OSC Complaint and OSC was supposed to investigate my matter....OSC referred my case to MSPB under Individual Right of Action on Whistleblower's Complaint and he's well aware Employees can only file (1) claim with (1) Agency (not both).  Atty. John Mahoney was just plain nasty, rude, condescending and made wise-crack comment, ""Oh, that's right...I'm only an Atty...I've been there before.""  You MAY HAVE ""Johnny"" but guess what...NOT every case is the SAME as what you commented to me and since his attitude was just totally shitty...he made very sure he not only was disqualified for my case but he was a REFLECTION on his entire Law Firm (DUH!).  There's a big difference between ""cocky"" and ""confident"" and how Atty ""I know it all"" Mahoney came across was ""Don't question me, I know more than you"" attitude.I filed my complaint to Mallory Faulkner (who originally scheduled my Consult) and she then forwarded my complaint to Atty. Derrick Hogan (who had NO experience with my case and upon reviewing his profile appeared he was a ""greenhorn"" and not much experience to even evaluate my case.  I disqualified his comments because his letter implied ""his word"" was the ""entire Firm's decision"" when he came across as a ""rookie"" stating in his letter ""After careful consideration, the firm has determined not to accept my case and we will not be representing you in that manner"".  Where does a (considerably younger Atty. (half my age) come across that HE speaks for the ""entire firm"" because his word is ""gospel""?  Then I sent another email and it was forwarded to Graig Cortelyou (Chief Marketing Officer) and he stated he was going to refund my Consult Fee.  *Which is an honorable/professional gesture and after my (horrible) Consult with Atty. (""I know it All"") Mahoney I felt my Consult Fee should be refunded + pain and suffering added to my Consult Fee for the barrage of ignorance and shear rudeness he gave me.  *** Graig Cortelyou was highly professional and understood my concerns and he addressed he wanted his Firm in the best posi+ive light because they don't want negative publicity (of course not...who does?).   I stated my Concerns to Greig why my case was ""bounced"" to Inexperienced Atty's who ""thought"" they knew my case to...""not having a clue about my case"" and I needed a specialized Atty. to fix the problem like finding a ""specialized"" Dentist you could TRUST.  Greg understood my concerns to a ""T"" as we both laughed from my comment.  The problem with this Firm is finding someone highly experienced who CAN help you and as BIG as this Firm is (and advertise)...there's NO excuse why ANY of the Fed. Atty's couldn't represent my case (and WIN).  Upon Reviewing this Firm's Website ... they're ""founded"" on VETERANS experience.  I'm a NAVY VETERAN and the HRO Director did some very crooked-shady-unethical shit against me and because I've had Navy Administrative (and Police) Experience I found the HRO Director in violation of many Laws/Rules/Regulations she violated...she became intimidated of me addressing my Privacy Act rights and accused me of not completing my Security (Confidential) Documents and terminated me.  (40) days after the HRO Director terminated me...she sent me an email stating she had all my documents and nothing was lost.  REALLY?????  The HRO Director intentionally caused habitual delays to my Privacy Act questions....terminates me for not completing the Security documents...and THEN tells me she had my documents the entire time?  How can you say...Gross Mismanagement, Harassment and INCOMPETENT in the same breath?  The HRO Director did this to a NAVY VETERAN????  This Firm is founded on Veterans and if they allow a VETERAN to be SHIT on by ABUSE of AUTHORITY in the Fed. Gov't System....the HRO Director (Jane Ackiss, Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth, VA) needs to be answering to someone for what she did.  Had I did to her (or anyone else) what she did to me....I'd have my Security Clearance REVOKED and terminated on the spot!  So....why was this allowed to happen?So...my complaint gets forwarded to Atty. Steve Herrick (D.C. Managing Partner).  Same letter stated, ""Even IF you were to succeed in obtaining a hearing...the probability that the Court would disagree with the Findings made by the Federal Circuit's (3) Judge panel is remote""  Here's the biggest problem...the ATTY. needs to put himself in the Client's position and understand the full story and stop ""guessing"" on a case.  These Atty's are paid to FIGHT....and as political as this may sound....this is what they're paid to do is FIGHT for their (VETERAN) Clients.  Their website advertises ""brags"" they're the best...they stand up for their clients (blah, blah, blah) but the experience of my (1st) Consult with Atty. (""I know all"") Mahoney to now (2) Letters received by Atty's in this firm (1) inexperienced Atty. who I would NEVER hire because he lacks the experience I needed so WHY did he even send me a letter ""on behalf of the Firm"" ???  Then the (2nd) Atty. (Steve Herrick) tells me ""Even IF you were to succeed...."" aren't these Atty's paid to have their Client's Succeed?  What does this Firm post on their website? Their subliminal messages on every video you watch (see Atty. Mahoney's Video) and you'll get the subliminal message, ""I fight for you to win...I'm the best...I won't take any shit...I'm on your side""  Then I spoke with this Atty. and discovered....he has NO IDEA what he's talking about and spent more time ""blowing smoke"" for his Firm.   Secondly....Atty. (I know all) Mahoney is NOT even a Veteran so he even claimed, ""Congressman are worthless"".  I think Atty. Mahoney seems to forget that our Senate/Cabinet are made up of former Atty's themselves....so, what's that say about you John (I know it all) Mahoney????From my personal experience...I can't understand why when you call this Firm....you're forwarded to Atty's that don't match your case as in...you get the feeling....""OK John...it's your turn to get a ""new fish"" for a Consult I'm scheduling you for.  John said, ""Oh...it would cost about $15,000 and if you want to contact the Agency to see if they would get you resignation...I can do that for $3,500.""  REALLY JOHN???  Are you serious?  I could get Homer Simpson to do that and get the SAME result so why would I waste my money on you to ""cheap shot"" me when I DID NOTHING WRONG .... Do you reallllllly get it ""Johnny"" (Mahoney)?  You fight for WHO?  I think you need to take down your video....better yet...I think you need to LEAVE T&R because I believe Atty's Tully and Rinckey would just be ""thrilled"" from my experiences with Johnny.I sent a letter to Graig Cortelyou with my case and identified where the errors were from MSPB to Fed. Circuit Court and gave Atty. Steve Herrick the entire script of my case identifying all the errors.  If Law is never supposed to ""prejudge"" someone....then the facts are to be presented at ALL costs in every case.  I cited relevant case law and presented documents supporting my case and heard nothing (yet).  Being former Navy Administrator and Navy Police...""documentation beats conversation"" but WHY IN HELL does this FIRM state they were FOUNDED by VETERANS if their ""INTERNAL"" Atty's I've spoke with were NOT Veterans and didn't give a shit about my case but expect ME (""Boss"") to hire THEM (""Employee"") to work for me on my case?  Finding a good Atty. is worse than a migraine headache but if you're going to hire an Atty for what you need....make sure the person you speak with at Tully Rinckey understands your case...has a good grasp on your case....and IF you're NOT satisfied with the results....FIND a qualified Atty. IN this Firm....and keep talking with someone that KNOWS your case....and will take it personal to FIGHT for you.  REMEMBER......a Client is always the ""Boss"" who HIRES a ""qualified Professional"" Atty as their ""Employee"".  The Client pays the Atty. Fees just like a Boss pays their employees is NO different.  Only difference is ... Atty's are held to higher standards on professional ethics.I cannot speak for the ""ENTIRE"" Firm on my negative experience.  I DO KNOW there is maybe (3) Atty's IN their Firm that would be HIGHLY IRATE what happened to me ""IF"" it happened to them but I cannot (and will not) Prejudge this entire firm on just (3) Atty's I've encountered.  IF this Firm prides themselves on ""experience"" and ""bull's eye"" quality....then PROVE it and get rid of the Atty's who've provided me poor customer service by not listening.  The other problem is...when (1) Atty doesn't have a clue on your case....it would be bad publicity for the Atty. if another Atty. in their Firm proved him wrong.  It's awfully hard to get a reasonable Atty. who will listen because you know MORE about your case and what happened to you than the Atty's do but if ANY Atty treats you like John Mahoney treated me....quickly slam the door/hang up on him and FIND an Atty. that will not be ""cocky-arrogant"" with a shitty attitude.  You're right...you're looking to hire an Atty (Employee) but you wan't an Atty (employee) that will take direction from you (but...allow the Atty. to give you advice and give you direction in your case).  As of today (o4 Jan '12) Greig Cortelyou hasn't returned my calls regarding our detailed phone conversation but I will be happy to provide any ""updates"" on this matter and I expect posi+ive results from this FIRM....otherwise....I would hate to think they've grossly misled a (potential) Client (VETERAN) by false advertising not abiding what they said.   Stay Tuned for any updates with my experience with this Firm......VETERANS will not be disrespected by anyone.  Period!

Something may be fishy at the Idaho State Bar, he may have someone working on the inside for him, in 2010 he had 4 formal complaints pending against him and the bar wanted to disbar him and in 2011 an additional charge was added bringing the total complaints to 5 formal complaints (who know how many informal complaints he has against him) and the bar is looking to suspend him instead of disbar him. This doesn't sound right, something is going on with this complaint. How can an additional complaint be added to the formal charges brought on by the Idaho State Bar and instead of disbarring him they have changed their minds and only want to suspend him.This needs to go to the Attorney General of Idaho or to the Supreme court. This needs to be investigated by the local news media and this old man needs to be EXPOSED.If you've been hurt or wronged by this attorney, please let's all get together and try and stop others from being hurt. 									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

These ttorney are apparently biased according to what happened to me and other writing online. I also had personal experience with this mentioned law office....These attorneys and judges appear to be connected and no one may have a fair trial with these people and their antics.5 attorneys in fort Lauderdale were disbarred in November.  I wish to remain anonymous, I do not wish to give up my hard copy of whatI call threats or letters of the attorneys in question, however if you  want hard copyevidence, you can request Robert Hannans as well as Joyce Julians  cases, you can even verify their Facebook information too along with the Judges in the links below. [continued below]....																			..... I included links to back up my observations however I am in a legal battle and do not want these attorneys or ex judges or their apparent connections to ruin things for me. FACT:  Joyce Julian operates out of Robert Hannans office, according to google maps.She was a judge that was kicked off the bench for being drunk and naked in public, she also claims she was sexually assaulted. She also had another call against her for drinking and domestic at her residence. So the police were contacted twice on her. This woman operates out of Robert Hannans office, and because Joyce Julian claims she was sexually assaulted, wouldn't this show her biased toward men and domestic violence cases, according to at least one online review, claiming a woman filed domestic violence when Joyce Julian represented her.(courtesy of google reviews)Is this firm or has this firm told ANY of their clients to possibly file a report for leverage?Did You know that according to Robert Hannan's PUBLIC Facebook page shows him connected to the Kaplans and did you know that Judge Kaplanoversees domestic violence? Interesting isn't it? I wonder how Roebrt Hannans domestic cases turned out for him especially related to the male gender?Joyce Julian may still have connections to judges and remember Robert Hannan is friends on Facebook too. Why is Joyce Julian an ex judge able to practice law in the same courts, let alone an office with Robert Hannan involving domestic and divorce???  See Below for their PUBLIC Facebook Evidence and connections to these  observations.Robert Hannan http://www.facebook.com/people/Robert-Hannan/702443710         &Joyce Julian http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000369189844 Here Are Robert Hannans Facebook connections to Judges and their family thereof:Facebook Has Robert Hannan connected to the Kaplan family, Michael Kaplan is a judge here in Broward County. Robert Hannan is also friends With Carlos Rebollo, a Broward Court Judge as well. Robert Hannans friend and partner Joyce Julian, are friends with  judges according to Facebook and as she was an ex judge, Facebook shows Joyce friends with Janine Rice who works for the district attorneys office as well, this goes all the way to the top.Now if they are friends on Facebook, does that mean that they are friends in the court room, or better yet favored, since they are FRIENDS?According to complaints online I am not the only one but I am reporting it. With Robert and Joyce's connections, its safe to say they may only have their best interest in these cases, as it may seem wouldn't you agree? motive? could it be money? Why else would a divorce be continued for 1-2 years? read on for evidence..... Robert Hannan is apparently friends with Judge Hurley on Facebook or at least writes to him publicly, as evidenced,evenwriting on his election page. Remember Judge Hurley was accused of injecting his personal and religious views into a case as reported in the Sun Sentinel See Evidence Here: http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/broward/blog/2009/03/cristappointed_judge_faces_scr.html Hurley also took criticism in 2009 when he got upset over a comment on the JAABlog that revealed the location of the judge's wedding. The judge called the blog to try to learn the identity of the commenter. When that didn't work, Hurley phoned the Broward Sheriff's Office to see if there was a way for him to learn the commenter's identity. Is there some connection with the Sheriff?Apparently Robert Hannans Facebook Friend Abuses Powerlooks as if Judge Hurley is using his power as a Judge to try and findout online identity of an anonymous blogger seen here: http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/pulp/2009/12/judge_jay_hurley_tries_to_bust.phpRobert Hannan currently owes and in a civil suit against him for 250,000.00 in Marina Garcia Woods court, THE same Judge that presided over several of his divorce cases, now presides over his debt, isn't that  interesting? I wonder If Robert Hannan's divorce cases were favored? Does he know this judge? Is he friends with this judge? Robert Hannan has obtained multiple tickets and fighting  them with Judges, He also appears for a Tyler Hannan? for evaded toll. Is Tyler a relative? This further proves he has more connections doesn't it? Recently Robert Hannan and Joyce Julian have been making negative headway's with clients posting about them online since 2007. Further people are researching these attorneys with clients claiming, he basically told me to shut up to filing paperwork late, to not returning phone calls etc. People claim He has dragged divorce over a year,possibly  to recoup his 250,000. It appears people are afraid to report them to the Florida Bar in fear of retaliation withthe apparent friendship and connections.This is frightening Joyce Julian and Robert Hannan operate out of, 404 Southeast 14th Court, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33316. Joyce Julian if you remember in the early 2000s was a sitting Judge in Fort Lauderdale Florida, the same city where 5 attorneys were disbarred from in November 2011. The Sun Sentinel reports Joyce Julian in December 08, 2001, Broward Circuit Judge Joyce Julian's run-in with police at a North Florida resort a week ago was the second time in 15 months she had been involved in an alcohol-related police call. Security personnel found the judge, disoriented and naked from the waist down, in a third-floor hallway of the resort, where she was attending a meeting of the Florida Conference of Circuit Judges.See Here http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2001-12-08/news/0112070864_1_judge-s-home-joyce-julian-circuit-judgesAnd See Here : http://www.noethics.net/News/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=878:is-attorney.. On Sept. 23, 2000, Plantation Police responded to a late-night domestic disturbance call at the judge's home in the south part of the city, according to the officer's report on the incident. ""At the scene, I met with Joyce Julian [mother] and ElyseJulian [daughter],"" Officer John Velez wrote in his report. ""Both subjects advised that they were involved in a verbal argument that escalated into a minor altercation. While interviewing both parties, it was apparent to me that Joyce Julian had been drinking and was somewhat intoxicated."" Now Lets look at Robert Scott Hannan, Broward County Public Search has Robert Scott Hannan ticketed with no license, as well as hunting/fishing/trapping without a license, and appears Robert Hannan took these to court to fight them, Isnt that costing the tax payers  money?I wonder why people claim Robert Hannan writes to Judge Hurley on Facebook? The same judge that was reported by the Sun Sentinel as being accused of injecting his ""personal, political and religious views"" into a case. One must wonder what kind of connection this Robert Hannan may have? When you research Robert Hannan on Broward county, you will see he has a pending issue with apparently a mortgage company in the amount of 250,000.00 in Marina Garcia Woods courtThe Same Judge that presided over many of Robert Hannans divorce cases , what is going on?Robert Hannan is affiliated with Women In distress,according to avvo.com, One person on Yelp alleges Robert Hannan preys on women, and another alleges Robert Hannan told them to""basically Shut up"" People allege that Robert Hannan and Joyce Julian write their own positive reviews to try and remove negative behavoir, but I managed to recover some negative posts below.Here are recovered negative reviews online about Robert Hannan (taken from yelp.com) Terrible attitude and quality. He didnt file a financial doc until after it was due and almost got me in hot water. He also basicly told me to shut up everytime I needed to discuss my case. He didnt even know his assistant had already collected key information. Almost seemed to be sabotaging my custody case. His who scene is very shady and he wants to be paid up front because he knows you wouldnt pay him after he screws upyour case and tells you how hes gonna win. This Robert Hannan  really sounds like a crap hole and should be reported for SCAMMING people and taking advantage of their emotions. I know this guy and have seen the way he operates, he sucks big time and is in it all for the cash. I certainly wouldn't recommend him to anyone because he's a opportunist from what I've heard who prays on woman. This person accuses him of preying on women, keep in mind avvo.com has Robert Hannan affiliated with Women In Distress....connecting the dots?moving along.....read his website and you will see what kind of guy he is........ Interesting, now lets take a look at online reviews practices with Robert Hannan (courtesy google reviews) Seen Here: Joyce Julian Negative Reviews Beware:Read this and do your homework first Panel Drops Complaint Facing JudgeJanuary 13, 2003| By Ardy Friedberg, Florida Correspondent The commission that disciplines Florida judges has dropped a complaint against Joyce Julian, who lost her bid for re-election to the Broward Circuit Court inNovember.Allegations of drunken behavior and lying to law enforcement officers stemmed from an incident in December 2001. Julian, 45, was arrested after being found drunk and partially undressed at a judicial conference at the Amelia Island Plantation Resort near Jacksonville, according to police.The incident was compounded when she said she had been drugged and sexually assaulted.The Nassau County Sheriff's Office declared the drug and assault accusations ""unfounded"" later that same month. Disorderly intoxication charges against the judge were dropped because she enrolled in a 30-day alcohol-rehabilitation program.The Judicial Qualifications Commission on Tuesday issued a one-sentence notice of dismissal, which said, ""The Investigative Panel . . . hereby dismisses the Notice of Formal Charges without prejudice."" Without prejudice means they could be filed again, though the commission loses its jurisdiction over judges once they leave the bench.Julianis still a licensed attorney and The Florida Bar could proceed against her, but Julian's attorney, Michael Dutko, said on Friday that he knows of no further action pending against her. ""We have had no notification from the state Bar or any reason to think that will occur,"" he said. Julian is currently ""exploring various career options in the private sector,"" Dutko said. Julian could not be reached for comment. As a Judge... she put my 5 year old child and myself out on the street after ""landing"" her as my judge in 2003. I filed a domestic abuse case, with law enforcement backing me and photos of the investigation. My ex was law enforcement... she took care of him. She put my home up for sale since I was a stay home mother and couldn't make the payment. She was voted off the bench. Local law enforcement negotiated that issue for her. Her last case was mine... Dec 2003. She showed up 20 minutes late, drunk and under the influence of some other kind ofdrugs as well.... it was overwhelmingly obvious to everyone in the room. She had been out all night partying. Be very careful... I would NEVER want what my child and I have been through to happen to ANY other family no matter what the case is. Signed, Someone who cares Avoid this law firm!! was referred to this lawyer for my divorce. turns out she was a judge kicked off the bench for unprofessional behavior. she handed the case to her junior associate who proceeded to bungle the whole case all the while running up bills of $20000. when she got in over her head, she withdrew from the case leaving me high and dry, without a lawyer, a mess of problems and now she wants to get paid for the rest of the work she supposedly did. watch these people like a hawk,they will rip you off. they are supposedly good mediators but if you need a lawyer that will be your advocate and defend and protect you against some other sleezebag attorney lookelsewhere. broward county is disgusting. all the lawyers are buddies regardless of how they may appear in court, they are looking out for themselves only. to hell with their clients. i have been told of cases involving these guys on opposite sides of divorce cases teaming up to drag things out for months and months just to continue milking the client for more and more I noticed that people are accusing Robert Hannan and Joyce Julian for writing their own positive reviews online, it may appear so now wouldnt it? I found that Yelp filtered reviews, they were flagged, I wonder WHO would flag negative reviews and keep a positive that looks as if it were written by an attorney? Keep in mind in Novemebr 2011 5 attorneys were disbarred in fort Lauderdale, the same town that these attorneys practice in. Natalie Kay also operates out of this address with Robert S Hannan and Joyce Julian, lets take a look at whatRobert Hannan and Natalie Kay have in common, well According to BrowardCounty Clerk, they both handle divorces and domestic issues with them, this is odd dont you think? It appears that some of this firms clients file domestic violence, surely the attorneys are not telling their clients to do that right? That would be a false report, wouldn't it? How can these attorneys operate together in the same office or divorce cases, or even domestic cases, when Joyce Julian claims she was sexually attacked? Wouldn't that be a conflict of interest to opposing counsel, and SHOW a Biased toward men ???Especially since Robert Hannan is affiliated with Women in Distress according to avvo.com and he is affiliated with womensdivorcelawyer.com??? Does Robert Hannans male clients see justice? Does Robert Hannans opposing husbands see justice, or are they in fact biased as it would appear? But hey thats my opinion with information I gathered to present to you.With the reviews it seems that Robert Hannan and Joyce Julians male clients get the short end of the stick and opposing males get the short end of the stick. Could this be because the ex Judge Joyce Julian claimed assault on a man? Robert Scott Hannan, Fort Lauderdale,Natalie Kay, Joyce Julian operate out of the same office/firm. Robert Scott Hananan was ticketed for hunting/fishing/trappingwithout a license viewed here: http://www.clerk-17th-flcourts.org/BCCOC2/OdysseyPA/CaseSummary.aspx?CaseID=3746327&hidSearchType=party_case&DisplayCitation=yes&CaseNumber=04089630TI40A&SearchType= He also had ticket for no drivers license, apparently has no respect for the law in which he practices . These tickets can be verified on BrowardCounty Clerk here: http://www.clerk-17th-flcourts.org/BCCOC2/OdysseyPA/CaseSummary.aspx?CaseID=4379570&hidSearchType=party_case&DisplayCitation=yes&CaseNumber=09080687TC30A&SearchType= Now Joyce Julian, she was a Broward Circuit Judge,KICKED OFF THE BENCH  Joyce Julian's run-in with police at a North Florida here in the Sun Sentinel: Joyce Julian PA Then Natalie Kay and Robert Hannan are divorce attorneys, but why is it several of their divorce cases have a domestic violence attached and why did a lady write on google reviews that Joyce Julian was her attorney and she filed a domestic issue? It kinda seems like a pattern,  Again it appears there may be some bias toward men at this firm. Why are people claiming online reviews that Robert Hannan TOLD them to file a report?I think we need to watch Robert Hannans cases and Joyce Julians cases VERY CAREFULLYin 2012, and how the Judges of Broward County TREAT them, because 5 ATTORENYS have been disbarred all in Fort Lauderdale, where Robert Hannan and Joyce Julian practice, along with Natalie Kay. View Here: 5 attorneys Disbarred in Fort Lauderdale For corruptionI still would like to think that our Judges aforementioned or any in Broward for that matter, got mixed up on Facebook without any knowledge of Robert Hannan or Joyce Julians reputations which apparently precede them.After all people can write what they want online according to the 1st amendment and have their privacy protected.If you look here Robert Hannan is in court for a mortgage debt of 250,000.00 and people claim he drags out divorces over a year, could it be to recoup money? Here is proofhttp://www.clerk-17th-flcourts.org/BCCOC2/OdysseyPA/CaseSummary.aspx?CaseID=2643986&hidSearchType=party_case&DisplayCitation=no&CaseNumber=CACE10030392&SearchType=   Seems like he tries to hold people responsible for things he avoids, see the hypocrisy? Furthermore there is a connection with Joyce Julian, Robert Hannan petitioned to divorce his wife Laura M Hannan 6-26-1995 and retained..........yup Joyce Julian, who later became a judge, interesting isnt it? See evidence here: http://www.clerk-17th-flcourts.org/BCCOC2/OdysseyPA/CaseSummary.aspx?CaseID=1441945&hidSearchType=party_case&DisplayCitation=no&CaseNumber=FMCE95008791&SearchType= Seems like an office full of attorneys who resorts to scare tactics, and remember the old saying, Birds of a feather flock together? You do the math, dont take my word for it, make your own decision, do your research, I gave my opinion, with researchonline and you can give yours.I have suffered immensely from This Robert Hannan and his unethical antics, threats and harassment toward me.  Now going back to Robert Hannans Facebook he is friends with Carlos Rebollo, a Circuit Court Judge, group 22 wonder what that means? http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000083176507&ref=pb Robert Hannan is also friends with Kenneth and Micahel Kaplan, Surely he is not friends with Judge Michael Kaplan?? WOW this seems to go deep. See Here: http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=702443710&sk=friends&v=friendsThen divorce court is transferred to Marina Garcia Wood,the same judge that presides over many of Robert Hannan, And his firm's divorce cases, Remember Marina Garcia Wood transferred and now is currently presiding over Robert Hannans civil debt $250,000.00 the same civil debt, which clients claim he drags out divorce over a year....possibly 2 years to help recoup his debt. that is weird isn't it??? Lets hope that Judge Marina Garcia Woods is firm and fair with Robert Hannan, and treats him like any other citizen of Broward CountySo do the math, Robert Hannan and his firm have clients that file or possibly had clients domestic violence with a divorce which Judge Kaplan handles.Why would this firm do this?? Is it because a domestic issue is one case and a divorce is another that equals 2 case$. ? Hmm It seems it is money related now doesn't it?Keep in mind Robert Hannan is currently pending in Marina Garcias Woods court for $250,000.This information showing connection pertaining to the people attacking clients through what I consider to be unethical means, opposing attorneys need to move to dismiss any and all legal actions against  from this particular court on the grounds of possible bias and corruption coming from this legal firm and its connections to the current court over any case and others alike client and opposing.I would also move to have others entire case transferred to another county and under the authority of a different judge if at all possible as we don't know how deep this runs in Broward County, or at least another unrelated judge there in the county until an investigation is finished upon Joyce Julian, Robert Hannan, Natalie Kay and anyone else that is or has operatedwith these attorneys.Not only does Hannan have a history of legal abuse from people reporting him online, but he continues to show his negative antics allegedly on his professional business sites by outlining how he deals with the husband of a particular case concerning moving his Clients out of the courts reach, filing for domestic violence orders against the husband etc. Robert Hannan is affiliated with Women in distress and apparently takes on several women as clients, interesting? Wouldn't this be biased toward men once again? And If Robert Hannan does take on a man, would they benefit from hiring him or his staff, especially Joyce Julian?He also seems to demonstrate a close and unprofessional relationships with others working there in thesame office, whom some of which have been terminated from the bench for whatever reason and moreover, seem to have a highly stereotypical outlook on the male gender whom further, effects the way they handle each case as it comes in, as Joyce Julian claimed sexual assault.That again, seems to be geared to cause great emotional and financial damage to not only the other side, but to their client as well Robert Hannans office, and because Joyce Julian claims she was assaulted, this makes her biased toward domestic violence cases, in which Robert Hannan and the like practice and shows biased toward the male gender.Here is more Evidence that Robert Hannan may be biased toward the male gender he is affiliated with womensdivorcelawyer.com People complain tha tRobert Hannan an dJoyce Julian coerce exuberant amounts of child support, here are reviews to back up these statements:Joyce Julian  (seems i am not the only one with issues)Attorney ReviewsReview:     totally disregards clients needs or wants/ requests. does not appropriately communicate with clients. inappropriate billing/ over billing. attorney says she is going to do something and does not follow through. does not communicate what is going on with the case whatsoever, you have to chase her for answers. does not return phone calls in a timely manner. delegates EVERYTHING to someone who is incompetent and then says its to save her clients money but in the long run all the back and forth with the incompetent individual costs more than the attorney fee per hour of service. tells client to be calm in court and she gets nasty with judge so judge throws case out leaving client with a bill and ABSOLUTELY NO RESULTS! in 8 months all that has been done was child support more than tripled. no increased visitation until 8 months after retaining her services. child support order reduction put in place after 5 months of asking to do so. 3 days before hearing she cancels hearing and withdrawlsAdded on 0000-00-00Review:     Has a troubled history as a general master and a judge.Bad attitude and unprofessional towards clients and judges.Is a known manhater that never found a divorce case in favor of the male when she was a judge.She even has sabotaged the cases of her own male clients so their wives would get everything.A truley manhating psycho that needs to be disbarred!Added on 2009-03-30Review:     one word...HORRIBLE word to the wise don't listen to word she says at initial consultation most of her few clients that she has had leave as a result of her lies also her staff leaves as well Added on 2011-05-25Review:     Horrible attorney OVERBILLS! She promises all kinds of things at initial consultation and tells you she wil fight for you and how she is an experienced judge and then once she gets your retainer, you can never get her to talk to you. She must not have a lot of clients because she is always doing mediation. She is a mediator and is always ""out in mediation"" yet your bills reflect she works like night and day on your case. She bils you for research and preparation then when it is time to go to court on a motion she tells you it is in your best interest not to go and that she predicts you'll loose the motion and it will look bad for your case. Due to her past arrest and legal problems with the law, it seems like she is afraid to go before a Judge. She overbills for ""research and preparation"" then does nothing. All you get are bills no outcomes. She is the worst attorney. Dana Swickle an attorney that had worked for her is amazing but she left the firm to go out on her own. She is in Fort Lauderdale check her out if you plan to hire a divorce attorney, she will fight for your case. Don't waste a dime on Joyce Julian, in my opinion the Judges dislike her.Added on 2011-04-26Review:     Aggressive with her clients very very rudeNow people claim she is aggressive toward clients, remember in the beginning I gave links to where she was in a domestic dispute, not once but twice? It seems her behavior is the same in the office as it is in her private life doesn't it?These above are my opinions with facts I found online and Broward County Clerks, my personal experience and of course other online reviews on these above aforementioned. I hope someone out there is strong enough to stand up and report them to the bar, I cant be the only one suffering.These attorneys need to be PERMANENTLY DISBARRED",  Attorneys & Legal Services

This site claims you hold a commercial pilots license Robert. I have a question, I wonder if Robert Hannan charges people to fly from point A to point B. I further wonder if he does charge people, if he claims it on IRS, or writes it off, since the Broward courthouse has him owing two hundred fifty thousand dollars to a mortgage in Marina Garcias court. Interesting it is with her court, considering Robert Hannan Tries many divorce cases through her. [continued below]....																			.....

Avvo also appears to show an affiliation with Woman In Distress and Mr. Hannan. With these claims, I hope Mr. Hannan isnt preying on womens emotions, it would appear so, but that is just my opinion. One review which was flagged on Yelp claims he does prey on women, but again anyone can write whatever online.  Here is the facts Avvo claims he in affiliated with Woman in Distress, and someone wrote he preys on women, and apparently a woman wrote he basically told me to shut up every time I asked about my case.

Surely it couldn't be to drag things out because of his $250,000 dollar debt would it?

Charlie Crist, is being accused of injecting his ""personal, political and religious views"" into a case.Staff writers Macollvie Jean-Franois and Juan Ortega report: Defense lawyers on Monday accused a Broward County judge of injecting his ""personal, political and religious views"" into an illegal abortion case and asked an appeals court to reduce the bail of a woman charged with aborting her teenage daughter's pregnancy.Public Defender Howard Finkelstein said Judge John Hurley overreached when he set Tonuya Rainey's bail at $185,000. Is there a personal involvement with Robert S Hannan and this judge or any other judge In Broward county?

Bad Practice, Breach, Bad experience, Beware Robert Hannan Fort Lauderdale, Florida","										Robert S Hannan, make sure you research before you retain. Often times these days, many people find themselves in legal dispute and discord with either another person whom they barely know or even a business or a spouse and so, we find ourselves totally depending on not only the legal system but our attorneys to guide us on through whatever legal troubles that might be plaguing us at the time. But what happens when we unknowingly hire a bad attorney to represent us in a court of law?,Or better yet, find an unethical attorney opposing us that moreover, resorts to scare tactics in order to lead and badger us into doing something that isn't advantages to our wants, wishes or legal goals? Not good in my opinion.Again, what occurs, When the opposition attorney violates our civil rights and our counsel doesn't seem to be coherent to the fact and allows the other side to have their way with us. [continued below]....																			..... Further, what is the result when our counsel isn't as legally savy to the issue as they portray when selling their legal services to us? There is nothing worse then going to court and being thrown on the mercy of strangers just because your attorney didn't know what he was doing in the first place,wouldn't you agree?  Sure you would; and that brings me to the point of why I'm even writing this article today.In my travels I've come across the perfect candidate to not only offer as a case study but to prove my point concerning what I consider to be a unethical attorney and illegal practices.  Again, I was very lucky in finding a particular South Florida Attorney by the name of""Robert Scott Hannan""  who states There is nothing quite as stressful as family and relationship issues. I found it interesting that Mr. Hannan makes this statement on his site, while promoting his services yet, when researching further into Mr. Hannan's track record of legal professionalism, I discovered that he generated many bad client reviews coming from people who have allegedly contracted his services in the past. Let's keep in mind that many of the reviews in question were posted both by Hannan's past clients and by those who have been on the downside of his stated legal harassment. Furthermore, a few of Mr. Hannan's past clients went on to say such things as he was horrible at litigation, he screwed up several custody cases, apparently kept charging them more and more until he cleaned out their bank accounts and or, life savings and lastly, that their spouses had the upper hand on them in the courts due to his legal incompetence.On the other side, or concerning those people that were on the other side of the issue, they went on to say that Robert Scott Hannan was badgering, hostile, leading and threatening towards them with no real interest in fairness or mutual justice, and that he was all about making the buck of his clients and their spouses. We have to consider that these are just Internet reviews and that should Mr. Hannan read these reviews for himself, he would just maintain that these persons are disgruntled on both sides and that they should come and speak to him personally to resolve their issues however and again, this is subsequently a man that will sue at the drop of a hat and they might be hesitant in resolving anything with him from what I've read.Again, this is a man who has apparently, written is own positive reviews on Yelp. When on Yelp scroll down to the last review and  at the bottom left there is a link called 4 filtered to the right of where it says write a review(red button) see the filtered links, apparently someone had negative reviews removed, I wonder who did this? And who seemingly will stop at nothing to remove any bad press that has been posted about him, with positive reviews apparently written by him or his staff.When In my further research it's further alleged that Mr. Hannan and his family law practice there in Fort Lauderdale, FL 33316 has in fact, badgered Clients and defendants alike, lied to the court, withheld pertinent information from both the courts and Clients in order to manipulate for leverage or personal finance not to mention, placing folks under emotional distress by threatening to throw them into jail continuously even when there's no cause for incarceration in thefirst place according to the courts themselves.So in summery, We've heard others yield their personal accounts of Mr. Hannan on both sides of the issue concerning his ethical behavior and that of yet others submitting their speculation, summation and opinion of this particular Attorney there in Fort Lauderdale, FL 33316 Whom moreover, proclaims to be an ethical, experiences and aggressiveAttorney of twenty years who specializes in family law, or more specifically divorce and battered spouse law.However, the postings on this gentleman and his legal service seem to state otherwise or contrary within exception to his aggressiveness to which both sides unanimously agree.  Still all in all, and not believing everything you read on the Internet, I would urge you to go by the facts and not anonymous postings stating this or that about a personor service. Ok, moving away for the allegations, statements and opinions made above by others on the Internet regarding this specific attorney and his practice, let's look at the provable history and factual circumstance of the attorney in question to either substantiate the claims made against him on line, or to write it all off as pure rederick and speculation.Possible Fact: Apparently, Mr. Hannan specializes in domestic and divorce cases according to his site, to which often times blend together and further, that the majority, if not most of his clients may appear to be women.  Search Here Broward County Clerk Fact: Robert Hannan according to Broward County Clerk of Records public search located here: Broward County Clerk you can search for yourself, and find how many domestic issues are intertwined with his divorce proceedings. Does he tell women to file bogus charges to gain legal leverage in court? Makes you wonder doesn't it?Fact: That in many of his cases end up charging the husband with spousal battery while using this and other scare tactics to entrap the husband into paying huge amounts of money in the form of support payments.  Again Search Broward County Clerk. If you perform a background search on Mr. Hannan through public records you can obtain this information for yourself along with simply reading over his site to gather other pertinent information. You can also look up any reprimands he's been given or possible disbarments he may have acquired over the years along with his licensed to practice law, if any. Mr Hannan appears to be an aggressive and ethical attorney who fights for the rights of clients, or possibly women everywhere however, we dug up a few other things that seem to dispute these statements as well. Mr. Hannan saysthat he's an ethical guy, and his conscience is clear when he legally moves towards others for being late in their child support payments and or, legal payments to his firm.By stating that he holds a current license to practice law, he's essentially stating that he will uphold and obey the laws of the land and the court system that he further expects and demands that others live by but I sense a trace of hypocrisy in his actions as can be cited below in the public records obtained.It would seem that ""Robert"", or ""Bob Scott Hannan""  has several criminal traffic tickets along with a civil suit and or matter with a mortgage firm to the tune of $250,000.00.  Real Prop Non-Homestead Res Fore =/>$250,000and not leaving out being ticketed for hunting without a license, fishing without a license and or trapping without alicense. See Here Search Robert S Hannan Robert Hannan had a case against him Bellsouth Adv & Pub CorpPlaintiff vs. Robert S Hannan Defendant <- Contract and Indebtedness This doesn't really sound like someone that serious about upholding the law more so, then someone looking to get over on society, the city,  state and federal government, what do you think?  It sounds like a man that wants everyone else to live by the law and courts decrees yet, he himself feels exempt to these very same laws. Mr. Hannan, do you think that the laws apply to the rest of us and not yourself?  It would appear so, in my opinion.Again, in conclusion and in my opinion, Mr. Hannan sounds to be a person that typically uses the court system to his own benefit, an opportunist whose only goal is in obtaining the buck no matter the ethical lines he must cross to do it.  A person that has little to no regard for the law and whom feels he's above it.A person with little to no respect for his own clients, the opposing counsel or the courts and lastly, someone who has little respect for himself or the profession he represents; someone that feels entitled and that the world owes him a living. Of course, people can say whatever they wish to say on the Internet these days and we really can't be sure what is true from that which is malicious however, we can speak to a companies or firms directly and or, previous clients to see what the outcome of their particular service was, how the client was actually treated throughout the process.When we see things posted on line against a person or firm this should give us all reason to stop and check someone out before hiring them especially, when it comes down to your finance and freedom being up for grabs in a court of law. The most frightening thing I have seen posted on this attorney can be viewed here: Robert S Hannan , apparently a client or opposing counsel is accusing him of being on opiates. Again this was obtained online in a review, but lets stick to the known facts with Broward County Clerk Of Courts.We can also do our homework by researching a person such a Robert Scott Hannan to ensure our safety as his site appears to be professional however his subsequent actions and or other activities being alleged over the Web seems to contradict everything he states on his web sites. Here is a quote from an alleged client on Yelp  ""Terrible attitude and quality.  He didnt file a financial doc until after it was due and almost got me in hot water. He also basicly told me to  shut up everytime I needed to discuss my case.  He didnt even know his  assistant had already collected key information. Almost seemed to be  sabotaging my custody case. His who scene is very shadyand he wants to  be paid up front because he knows you wouldnt pay him after he screws up your case and tells you how hes gonna win.""Allegations like this have been made on the Internet against Robert S. Hannan that he apparently withholds pertinent information from the courts and his own clients, to which leads me to believe that he hasn't disclosed his own dirty laundry to the clients in question, and not leaving out the public at large.Again, and to reiterate some facts here, this is a man that doesn't pay his own bills, breaks the laws while thinking nothing of it and lastly, continually threatens to put people in jail for not paying their bills or child support on time, who doesn't even respect the laws in which he represents and or, whom manipulates his clients for the sake of self gain financially over seeking justice through fair and ethical due process and legal practice. I would encourage the consumer whom happens to be having serious legal issues concerning divorce, divorce attorneys, child custody issues, family law issues, criminal laws issues or anything else to do with Tort law or criminal or civil law to do their research pertaining to a particular attorney that you may choose to represent you as after all, everything you've worked for, family, finance and your very freedom might be on the line.I would also encourage Robert Scott Hannan, to clear up some of these issues online concerning his past civil records convening criminal traffic tickets, lawsuits against him for not paying his debts, tickets for hunting, fishing and trapping without a license, and how he feels about attempting to have others prosecuted for the same and or, similar infractions. How he feels about himself in inflaming and manipulating martial conflicts for the sake of his own self profit and moreover, to explain to us all in how he perceives himself to be ethical in any sense of the term. We await your reply Mr. Hannan and again, consumer you be the judge in regards to having this particular attorney representing you or not based on the information above. In Closing, If you believe Robert Hannan was unethical toward you, you may file a complaint with the Florida Bar Here: Florida Bar Complain In closing I found 2 pictures for his office, both appear to have garbage sitting out side his office, what does that mean?",  Attorneys & Legal Services

My wife and I met with her for approximately 1hour. I was just recovering from Kidney Cancer and I was very distraught. We paid the $5000 and she told me she would review the case. Two weeks past and I started calling her office to see the progress. Jeanne Damirgian informed me that she was not interested in the case due too a high profile lawyer one of my co-defendants was using. She said he liked publicity. I asked her about the retainer being returned after she took what she felt was fare for her time and she informed me she would look at her time spent. I was expecting a fee of anywhere from $300-$500 for the time she spent reading the charges and the consulting with my wife and I. I tried calling her back after a few weeks and she would not take my calls. I never received a penny back. Here I was in a very scary predicament and a lawyer rips me off for at least $4000 if not more.  I never pursued the transaction legally and I paid another attorney $20,000. I highly recommend you avoid using and attorney who could do this to a person who is in need of help during a very emotionally and disturbing time! She should have had the courtesy to return part of my retainer. Stay Away! She is a poor representation of the judicial system and members of the bar in criminal cases. Jeanne Damirgian was a former prosecutor and that should have been my first sign to stay away with a criminal case.									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

They called 3 times, the first time they left a voice mail then the second and third time they called twice in a row. I answered the phone and this Pakistan accented man told me that I had accusations and charges against my name and my social security number. There were 3 total. I asked what for, he said because of an unpaid payday loan through Money Mutual (money mutual was not my lender but found me a lender). He said that I owed over $3000...which is bull crap because I borrowed a total of $300. He said the lender is taking the money as a loss and that I was being charged in the next few hours with 3 charges and one of them would be check fraud. He then preceded to say that he would ask his ""Head Attorney"" not to charge me with these crimes if I would just go ahead and pay over $700 right then. I said I dont have that kind of money so he said since I was not willing to pay $700 then they would be sending a Sheriff and an Investigating Officer to my workplace to inform my boss of my crime and I would be arrested on Friday. I asked if there was another way around this and he said that I would be put in prison for 6 months. I then asked to speak to the ""Head Attorney"" he kept talking about and ofcourse he said that he was the Head Attorney. I did research on the number and the name of the business and this website is what I found. Also, I called my lender and they were gracious enough to tell me not to ever speak to this man or give him any info. Somehow these people have my SSN, my current employer, and I just recently started this job in October and never have put my employer on the internet. I have no idea how they are getting this info but I did report it to my local Sheriff and I hope something is done about this. 									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Shawn king was their accountant.  When Nyta became ill Shawn let my boss know a tasty senior prize was available for the taking. When Jared Shafer assumed his responsibilities he said to both mother and son you will not be together.  Two handicapped people living in the same house is a big Burdon and as your guardian I will not have this. Mother and son objected, but my boss, Jared Shafer told them to man up and keep their stupid mouths shut. A relative of the family hired an attorney to fight Mr. Shafer.  During the proceedings Shawn King of Gamett and King reported to the court the money Nyta had in her trust was lost.  It appeared someone had placed Nytas securities on margin through a mysterious set of guardianship orders and withdrew large amounts of money from the family trust.   Jared Shafer removed mother and son from their home and sold the house.  Both of them were placed in substandard care facilities, which had numerous health department violations.  The son killed himself on November 10, 2007 and within two months Nyta died of starvation.  Claire Shafer received a large amount of money from Shawn King, which they said came from her uncle, but when I saw the records, which showed this money to be from the sale of the same securities Nyta had owned my suspicions were aroused.  I have reported Jared Shafer and Shawn King to the Las Vegas police, the Nevada attorney General, the Las Vegas FBI, Social Security, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  All agencies turn a blind eye to cases involving Guardian abuse.  Shawn King constantly meets with Jared Shafer.  Shawn and Jared settled a securities fraud case in the federal court of Utah in 2008 involving the sale of securities without a license.  These securities went bankrupt. Both Shawn king and Jared Shafer knew the securities were in danger of failure when they sold them to seniors who were looking for extra income. Shawn told the senior investors the securities were as safe as United States savings bonds.    Shawn has told me that his accounting practice wouldnt exist without the help of Jared Shafer.  Guardian abuse is now at epidemic levels throughout the country with Nevada leading all states. Failure to regulate and enforce guardian regulations are the cause of this abuse.  The attorney general Ms. Masdoe owes her position to Jared Shafer through a friendship Shafer had with her father. As such she will not defend any senior who falls victim to Jared Shafer. This is a direct policy of her office. Ms. Masdoes behavior is understandable, according to a Los Angeles times reporter, Ashley Powers Masdoes house is under mortgage water.  She needs Jared Shafer to bail her out of debt.  It is widely known throughout federal law enforcement Nevada operates on the good old boy network.  Close to 100% of elected and non elected officials in Nevada owe their positions to friendships or political connections. The Los Angeles times article in 2006 entitled Juice for Justice called Nevadas legal system a pay to play fiasco.  The times article wrote about the criminal courts, it would be very interesting to read what they write about the Las Vegas family court.  The group of individuals in charge of protecting seniors in Nevada managed by Jared Shafer makes their living by harming senior citizens.  The groups relationship with each other is incestuous, especially in the way they protect each other from unlawful actions the group members commit against seniors.  Lying, stealing, submitting false documents, bribing judges, threatening family members, and embezzlement of funds are normal daily activities for this horrible group of degenerates.I will continue to report their activities and post to all forums.  Someone will eventually listen and take action to stop the deaths and abuse of countless innocent seniors.      									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Jared Shafer through his attorney Elyse Tyrell blocked the proceedings.  Legal fees began to build up to the tune of $40,000.   I met with Alan D Freer who was my attorney.  What he told me changed everything I believed about the American legal system.  Alan Freer said I can get Lynn released to you, my fee is $350 per hour.  Understand some of this money must be paid to Commissioner Jon Norheim and Judge Chuck Hoskin.  Norheim and Hoskin will get their cut one way or another.  If you pay me for an additional 100 hours of work, Norheim and Hoskin will be taken care of. I guarantee they will rule in your favor.  We have a doctor who will report the Las Vegas climate is not healthy for your sister.  This money will also take care of the doctor.  A hearing will be scheduled and your case will be heard as the last one on Norheims court calendar.  If there is other parties in the room, Norheim will clear the court.  Jon will make the ruling and Jared Shafer will sign the papers to facilitate the transfer of guardian ship from him to you.  If you want to fight, Jared and Elyse will continue to block the transfer until they have created fees of $80,000.   Alan Freer leaned across the table and said the choice is up to you.   I was speechless.  The shock of his words reminded me of doing business in Senegal where we had to pay $5,000 to a local leader to get medicine distributed to a rural tribe.     Alan Freer smiled and said we have this thing really tied up.  I do not give clients the easy way out, but since your sister is very sick I believe she should pass away with her family.  Yes, it is going to cost you, but lets be business like about this.  I looked directly at Mr. Freer and said youre fired as my attorney; god will punish you for what you are doing to seniors who live in this state.  Alan Frres words are now online in this rip-off report.   Ive reported this conversation to the police and the Nevada state bar.  I will be filing with additional governmental agencies.  The results of possible future governmental actions will be submitted to this report.  									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

Everyone beware of this company (Full Count Eviction Services). I also engaged with this company to prepare a Unlawful Detainer action against one of my tenants in a commercial building I own. I first spoke with Devon. He took all the information and charged my credit card $464.00 for the start up cost. I was advised by him that Linda Dunn would be in charge of my case. This all happened on Aug. 01, 2011.I received an e-mail from Linda Dunn whom told me that they are preparing the UD and would be getting to the process server within a couple of days. Well, that was the last I heard from her. I sent her e-mails asking how the case was going. It took several e-mails before she replied. She told me that the process server had gone to the address that I had given her and that the tenant didnt live there. She said that it would cost me an additional $65.00 for the process server to go to another address. She said that the process server spoke to the tenant at the address I gave them and also spoke with the manager and both stated that no one with that name lived there. I knew this was bull as I own another building just down the street a few buildings and knew that they indeed lived there. I also confirmed that they lived there.They told me that they would deliver the notice to the office he was renting from me and if they didnt get ahold of the tenant that they would then have to file for a Order to Post. Again I kept writing her e-mails and not getting any replies. They never tried serving this tenant at the building. We have video cameras in our building and I kept checking to see if the tenant came in the building and while I was checking that I looked to see if anyone tried serving any papers to his Suite and there was no one.To make a long story short,I heard from Linda Dunn via e-mail that the got the Order to Post from the court and that it would be posted on the tenants door in a day or so. Needless to say, another 30 days went by and no Order to Post was posted on the tenants door. Nor did I get any answers to my e-mails from Linda Duun. I then took it into my own hands and got a hold of the tenant and got him out. I sent a e-mail to Linda Dunn telling her that I had waited long enough for them to get this tenant out of my building and took it in my own hands and got them out and that I wouldnt need their services any longer and requested any money owed to be to be returned. Much to my surprise I got an e-mail back from her within 5 minutes of sending her the e-mail telling me that they would notify the court and that I didnt have any money coming back to me. The bottom line here is it cost me over $700.00 for nothing. This company is a rip off and I want to warn everyone to be aware of this company.									",  Attorneys & Legal Services

During this time I had health issues.Shortly after that we were able to get the foreclosure canceled so NO work was done or needed by this company.I emailed asking for a refund because they had went ahead and withdrew a payment and I explained that it was my understanding  that no funds would be taken until we were able to review a package they were sending (withdrawal taken before we received this package last week) and I got the okay from my husband.To make a long short and after several emails I was stalled long enough for them to take out a second withdrawal which according to my bank was drawn before the scheduled day we had set up of Nov.14, 2011.My gut said something was wrong when they would not accept my cancellation request by email staying i would need to call and speak with them before they could cancel anything with the assurance no other funds would be withdrawn and they would take care of the refund as soon as I called them..Made the call ended up speaking with a Mr. Wilson who stalled once again stating he felt I needed to speak with one of their attorneys so I could be sure how Texas laws handled things.I told him that that the rep had explained all that and things were good and that I had got the foreclosure cancelled so we didn't need them after all.He refused to take no for an answer setting me an appointment with an attorney scheduled a few days later.  The call from the attorney was brief stating we seemed to have everything under control and didn't need their services.Called back informing Mr Wilson of the brief conversation, seemed surprised it was so brief (my opinion)..Mr Wilson at that time informed me that he would immediately take care of the refund process...this was on the morning of November 11, 2011.The following Monday, Nov. 14 I was surprised that another draw had been taken from our account.  I immediately contacted Mr. Wilson him then stating there was a form o needed to sign to get my money refunded..When I received the form it had $750 on it so I marked through it and put $1500 since that is what they owed me now.Within minutes I was contacted by Mr. Wilson informing me I was only entitled to $750 of course I strongly disagreed directing him to his account rep who I had been emailing back and forth and had been attempting to get this cancelled for weeks now.....and NO work had been done or authorized.He Very Rudely stated I am the rep's supervisor I don't  need to contact him you either sign the form or you don't get any money back.I was shocked that I had just been taken by this COMPANY that had done NO WORK for us because there wes no work to be done and now being threaten you sign or you don't get anything back.I signed the form writing ALL over it that I was not in agreement with this being a Full refund and that I would be filing a complaint.I also sent an email stating this and asked that they provide me with documents that they had done work for us.I also stated that they had stalled me to make sure they would get that second draw.....I should have been informed of a release form when I spoke to Mr. Wilson over a week ago...they had not taken that second drawn so when they agreed to the refund a couple of weeks ago what were they going to refund since they said they earned that $750 and that was all they had at the time they agreed to give me a refund......I definitely was stalled allowing them time to make that second drawn....My lesson learned is to follow my gut..Something just did not feel right....not accepting an email as a cancellation tool....then stating they had to speak with me before they could cancel anything...many Red Flags ..many whispers....as Oprah says I had to get a Brick up side the head....Speaking of a Brick upside the head ...Oprah was used as a pawn to get us to sign up saying ""you know Oprah would Not endorse something she did not believe"" .....Oprah would probably tell me that this was just ""crazy a**""  ""crazy a**""!!Oprah would definitely be Pissed that her name is being used to take money from hard working folks at a low point in their lives trying to save a home they worked hard to get!.....I pray this at least saves one person from being used and their hard earned money taken from them ...next step is to figure out where I file my complaint with The BBB.",  Attorneys & Legal Services

The only thing they do is file court documents on your behalf. There is nothing special about their ""process""at all. They are like snake oil salesmen who are taking unfair advantage of people who are in trouble. They charge approximately $270.00 to file a single document which does not include any explanation or exculpatory facts on your behalf. Of course the court will find you guilty! After the court does find you guilty, ticketbusters wants you to go to the court in person ( like you probably should have done to begin with ), and be found guilty again. This is the only way they will consider refunding you roughly half of your money. When they are talking you into paying for their service they are friendly and sound so caring but after you've paid they are short and very uncaring, basically they don't give a damn about you or your ticket.

I was told there nothing that could be done except pay the new fine ( I was fined initially $255, instead of the $125-$150 I was told). I asked her to check my record and mysteriously the files wereremoved at the end of 2010. She said someone would call me at the end of the day, which never happened. I received a phone called from a woman who proceeded to tell me that she was a supervisor and she looked at my file and said they called and left a message for me.

Cooke he will be detrimental to your case. He will not do the necessary research on your behalf thereby placing you at a disadvantage from the on-start. He will not prepare for any of your hearings placing a prepared opposing party at an advantage because he will not be prepared to fight for you. There will be no pre-trial preparations also putting you at a disadvantage. He will not prepare monthly statements so you can stay on top of where you are financially with billing and ultimately you will receive an extremely ridiculously high bill with little ""real""work done by him or his staff. His timekeepers billing is so horrible resulting in many overcharges but you will never get your money back. His staff is ill prepared and lack basic knowledge and very rude and they do not even pretend to advocate for you. Basically, you're like a number not a real client just being moved right along and collecting your money. I regret not doing my research before retaining him so I am warning everyone reading this note to do your research and you will find several complaints about his level of representation which in my case was low, low, low the worse representation money can buy for my hard earned thousands of dollars. I do not have money to throw away but that is exactly what I did by retaining his services. If the opposing party has a good lawyer you are dead in the water he will make arrangements without informing you, settle or negotiate an agreement that will favor the opposing party all because he comes unprepared and not ready for the gun fight. Before hiring him do your research honestly, you are better off being a Pro Se. This is my opinion and reflects my experience. I am not telling anyone not to retain this attorney just a word of caution to do your research. I would never recommend him to anyone who's looking for honest representation.

Before the consultation, I had to sign a contract along with credit card approval documents stating that she would bill me for $350 for one hour of phone consultation and an additional $350 for one hour of ""document preparation time"". During the 47 minute phone consultation, which I recorded, she gave me only generic information regarding California probate law. When I questioned Ms. Gordon about the particulars of my case, she was obviously unprepared. On the recording, I can be heard asking her four separate times, ""Did you read the documents?""  When I mentioned the name of the primary actor, a person whose name appears 122 times in the documents, (I did a word count) she had to ask me who that person was.  Looking back, I should have terminated her right then over the phone.  I have listened to the recording multiple times and have become convinced that Frieda Gordon is truly the embodiment of all  that can go wrong with a private practice attorney; she is corrupt and incompetent.  Before I could send her a  letter of termination, I received a new and unexpected contract from her in which she had raised her hourly billing rate to $400 per hour!In my research, the lowest advertised fees I found for probate attorneys in California were  $180 an hour. The fees charged by Cooper-Gordon are at the very top end of the scale. I recommend contacting one of the attorneys  listed on Bill Handel's web site located here:  http://www.handelonthelaw.com/home/  The method of screening these attorneys is not described anywhere on Bill Handel's site, but every single attorney I contacted answered my questions intelligently via e-mail, free of charge.Regarding Frieda Gordon's client-attorney contract; it is massive and curiously detailed. In it, she attempts to indemnify herself from every possible accusation a client could possibly make regarding ""creative billing"".  After looking it over again, I couldn't help but wonder if it was a catalog of past client billing accusations against her. Truly an odd document, which in my opinion, falls suspiciously short of what a good faith client-attorney  contract should be.One last comment. Negative reviews about professionals such as this one are typically short lived on the net. This is because attorneys, doctors, accountants etc, who garner these type of reviews employ ""reputation repair"" services. As of this writing in 2011,   I was able to find only one brief and poorly written positive review on Frieda Gordon, and not a single negative review, despite her being a practicing attorney for more than 25 years.
