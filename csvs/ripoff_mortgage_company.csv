Lewisvill, Texas USA ",: www.nationstarmtg.com, 1-877-304-3100,," This company has continued to baffle me if you look them up they have over 5,000 complaints I have found alone I am trying to get a class action lawsuit I don't see how to get this done when everyone and every website will not let you post your name or email or phone number. I have a court date the 16th of this month against nationstar. I am countersuing and wanting to file a class action lawsuit as this company is nothing but a scam. The company is made up of a bunch of head of employees from Bank of America who left formed Nationstar Mortgage and guess what all of the sudden Bank of America sells a bunch of mortgages to guess who...Nationstar now that kinda falls under insider trading just a little bit but we will get back to that. What the company actually does is forces you to take their escrow, their insurance raises your rates without your permission, then when they have drained you for all the money they can get out of you they tell you you can qualify for a HARP loan and they will get you approved. You are instructed to not make any payments and then they start the I didn't recieve the paperwork, this paper was missing you didn't sign this paper, then while they are working on your loan you will find your house is up for auction while they are working on your ""loan modification."" Suddenly you recieve a letter that you didn't qualify for loan modification because you missed payments even though they told you not to pay and they mark your credit so you can't get a loan modification from anyone else and about a day after you get the you were denied a loan modification you recieve notice that your home was sold at some mysterious auction that nobody ever attended because they didn't tell anyone and then they take your home and all of the sudden Nationstar owns your home, then they offer you cash for keys if you will move out in 30 days, they won't pay that money because they have their lawyers sue you for denial of access to the property for the 30 days your there. Just check with any website that deals with complaints and look at how many people have lost their homes to this scam. I want to file a class action immediately. Bank of America is involved in this as well. (of course they are). I have a court date the 16th of this month in Springfield, Mo any attorney interested I actually have 5,000 people who are wanting to file a class action lawsuit. ",  Mortgage Companies ,0
 Champion Mortgage ,"  Champion Mortgage  PO Box 91322 
Seattle, Washington USA ",www.championmortgage.com, 1-877-591-7684,," When my Mother passed away, I contacted Champion Mortgage within two weeks to discuss paying off her reverse mortgage. They would not discuss the loan until I provided proof of my Mother's death, which they already had because they sent me a letter stating so, along with documentation that I was the person responsible for the estate. Over the next two months I received bi-weekly letters from them stating that the loan is now due. I sent them a letter of intent to payoff the loan along with all the requested information. The harassing letters continued along with letters taped to the front door of an empty house with the word Confidential in bold letters signaling to any burglar that nobody is home. They continue to send registered letters stating that I have not attempted to contact them when I have both a paper trail of faxes and letters sent along with a complete log of every time I have called them. In the course of trying to refinance this reverse mortgage when the title company called, Champion Mortgage would not provide required information without my intervention. When the company refinancing my mortgage, a very reputable well-known one, tried to contact them they were told they no longer had that reverse mortgage. When I provided my refinancer with the the reverse mortgage information and a payoff letter was requested they were told it would take 7-10 business days to provide a payoff letter. Meanwhile the expiration date for my refinance is approaching because we cannot obtain a simple payoff letter from Champion Mortgage, somethingg that any reputable company should be able to provide in minutes. I don't know what to make of a company that demands immediate payoff but makes it impossible to do so because they will not provide a payoff letter to a nationally known and advertised lender. One thing to note. They refuse to do any communication via fax or email. Only by phone. But, of course, when one does so by phone there is no legal record. This company seems focused on doing everything they can to make sure that a reverse mortgage always goes into foreclosure. ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

It was made out to myself and Green Tree Servicing (my mortuage company). I had to sign the check and send it to Green Tree along with the estimates on the damage. There was approximatly $2000 in material and $16000 in cleaning and labor. Green Tree has a 7-10 day waiting period to process the check. If there is anything missing from the documentation then they start the process over again. Supposedly the first check went out yesterday after over a month and it was only for $1000. Every aspect of the work has a different set of documentation, one for the demo, one the clean up, one for the sheetrockers, one the painters, one for the carpet install, one the the AC/Ventilation cleaning. Then each one will have a 7-10 day waiting period to receive their money unless the documentation is wrong, then the 7-10 day process starts over.

OCWEN is the absolute worst.   When I was initially turned over to OCWEN, I had just paid my GMAC mortgage. THEN I received an OCWEN letter letting me know of the change, and proceeded to slap a late charge on my payment -- though it was supposed to be honored, given the transition from GMAC to OCWEN.  Later, I signed up for a Bi-Saver program and things went well for a month. The second month, they tried to slap a late fee on the second automatic withdrawal. It's automatic! How do I incurr a late fee? Apparently, it's a Bi-Saver program that still requires you to pay the total mortgage payment within 10 days! Who would know? I picked two dates from a calendar on their website - first payment on the first Monday and second payment on the third Monday. If those weren't acceptable, then why allow me to sign up for the program that way? Furthermore, they participate in deceptive advertising by sending you small checks to get you to join needless insurance programs -- and good luck cancelling. It took me numerous calls, and getting bounced from one department to the next to get cancelled.   The customer service is horrible.

The second escrow analysis shows a shortage of -$347.14 which results in my mortgage payment being increased my monthly house payments of over $33 more, which I told them I did not cash the check because I knew it was wrong. I have called twice to request a third analysis be done and informed them this is not acceptable and I am very upset with what they are doing with my money.  Green Tree informed me that they were sorry the other person didn't request the report. Last Friday I requested again for this escrow analysis and I was told I would still need to pay the monthly increase until they get the new analysis.  I have asked to speak with a supervisor  was told there is none.  I never talk to the same person.  Can someone out there help me with this?  These people do not have competent people working for them!

Payments go through on the 1st-3rd of every month, and the 14th. Nationstar has been holding my first payment, and not applying it to my monthly payment until they receive the 2nd half, which defeats the purpose of paying in this manner. They call this a ""Suspense Account"". This is where they hold your funds until all the funds are gathered. In the same type of transaction, anything that is paid over the amount is put towards the same ""Suspense Account"". An example of this is when one of those payments went through on the 28th, instead of the 1st-3rd. They held that payment in the ""Suspense Account"" instead of applying it to the following month's payment, or towards the principal...they just hold it, and the interest accrues. This is a very shady practice, and may be illegal? When you go to try to fix this, you must wait extrodinarily long wait times (read 15minutes+ for customer service, but you never start there, you start in collections due to ""non payment"" because your money is in a suspense account instead of being applied to your balance).   I hope to get this cleared up.

Then the Attorney General shut them down and they were barred from doing any type of real estate or mortgage business INCLUDING MARKETING! They are still doing it. Ryan Marier is running Driving Force Media doing mortgage marketing. If you use his company to do your marketing and it gets traced back to you, you could get audited and have a big problem.

 WELL FARGO HOME MORTGAGE ,"  WELL FARGO HOME MORTGAGE  200 Colonial Center Parkway Suite 140 
Lake Mary, Florida USA ",www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage, 18002837918,," Open Letter to WELLS FARGO for sending my loan for DENIAL 5 months into the process, and 3 days before closing. This is no way to treat a Veteran. Thank you Wells Fargo, for ruining my life.  On Monday February 17, 2014 you told me I would be closing on Friday on my Wells Fargo Home Renovation Loan.  It was a blessing in disguise; I made it all the way through the lengthy process.  I called my mother, ""mom, I am going to be closing on my birthday February 21, 2014.""  I have been looking forward to this day, long before you qualified me and gave me my Well Fargo Loan Commitment paper in September 2013 in my hand.  I found a Fannie Mae foreclosure listed on the Homepath Website, a portal designed for first time home buyers like myself.  Since I already had 3 bank accounts with Wells Fargo, I figured why not place my loan with a bank that I have been with since 1993.  I gave you everything you asked me for and cleared every condition one by one.  On Tuesday February 18, 2014 you repeatedly asked me why did I have a judgment on my credit from 2003, even though I gave you and your underwriter proof 3 times that the judgment has been paid with a copy of the satisfaction letter from the creditor with the stamp on it from the high court in Trenton, New Jersey proving it was cleared since 2012.  After the persistent badgering, I figured why not just be honest and tell you the truth of what really happened so we can get on with the process.  I know it may have been odd to have a 745 FICO score, and have this on my credit.  I told you, ""the judgment may have only been removed from one or two of the credit bureaus and not all 3.  After graduating from college and after losing my job on Wall Street in January of 2002 during the crisis, I went to federal jail for a period of time.  So, my bill went unpaid and that's the reason why I received a judgment on my credit from the debt collector company that assumed the debt"".  You apologized for making me have to tell you this, but I figured you are just doing your job. On Wednesday February 19, 2014 you called me to tell me that the File is being submitted for DENIAL. Really...???  5 months into the process making it 3 days from achieving the American Dream and you are canceling my loan just like that.  You add in that my American Express account went up 5% so unfortunately I do not qualify any longer because my debt ratio is now too high.  Most people's credit cards go up a little bit after the holidays; I have a child, family and a girlfriend.  You wait this long into the process to tell me this? I did everything you asked for.  I paid $1,500 to the title company; I gave you $600 for an appraisal. I got inspections totaling over $500.  I got an insurance policy totaling $1,500.  I did every single thing you asked for and to just cancel my loan in the blink of an eye is unfair to me and my family.  I have never been late on my rental history.  I have never been late on any credit cards.  I make $45,000/year, I know that I do not make a lot of money now, but are you telling me I do not qualify for a $100,000 house?  I have over $10,000 in your Wells Fargo bank accounts alone.  I know I am only 1 person in the millions of customers you have, but why didn't you offer me options or give me an alternative solution? I haven't heard back from you, because I guess you're just onto the next. My only assumption is that I have a conviction on my record and I told you about it.  Being pragmatic, I thought I paid my debt to society and I could move on with my life.  I am just living my life as an ordinary Joe, all I was trying to do was get to the next level in life.  Instead of being a proud homeowner today on my birthday, I am waking up again at 5:30am to this pounding migraine headache that I have ever since you crushed my world.  I want you to know that I am truly saddened and I feel devastated and I have held off crying until now.  I am grown man, but I am truly crying as I end this letter to you. Thank you ",  Mortgage Companies ,0
 OCWEN Loan Servicing LLC ,"  OCWEN Loan Servicing LLC  P.O. Box 785063  
Orlando, Florida USA ",, 18003337023,," We fell to the misfortune of losing our home to a forclosure that started back in 2007 in CA. We had 2 loans (1st and 2nd) when we initially purchased the home. The loans were interest only with a 2 year fixed. Once the first 2 years were over, we tried numerous times to refinance but came up empty due to the home losing value. The first mortgage company refused to work with us and instead of keeping the interest rate the same or lowering it for us, they instead increased it which raised our monthy payment over $700.00 per month. We could not afford thier increase so we became delinquent and did everything to re-finance. They refused to work with us to include accepting any offers that our realtor worked so hard to provide to them so we ended up losing the home. The 2nd mortgage company, OCWEN was also included in the foreclosure and realizing that they had no stand being a Jr. 2nd they closed down the account. The account had been closed on my credit report for 4 years and then in Nov of 2013 we started recieving letters from them that we not only owed them the inital amount, but we owed them over 70k in late charges. We did some research on this and found out that they have no recourse in CA for a purchase money loan/lien, plus in CA there is a 4 year statute of limitations in which they had surpassed. They continued to send us threatening letters and we finally sent them one asking them to stop sending us letters as we are no longer responsible for this debt and if they didn't stop we would file harassment charges against them. In Dec of 2013, I had put in for a small loan at my local credit union and when they advised me of my credit score I hit the roof. It had dropped drastically and I couldn't understand why so I pulled my credit report and found out that OCWEN had re-opened the loan stating that had acquired the servicing rights of the loan from LCS Financial Services Corporation on Nov 15, 2013. In other words, they transferred the account to another department within their company and are trying to state that since they moved and re-opened it, they are trying to collect the debt. They put this debt back on top of all 3 of my credit reports which shows an open balance of the initial amound borrowed plus all the late charges and shot my credit down the tubes that I had been working on rebuilding for over 6 1/2 years. This account is going to fall off my credit report this year, so re-opening this account did nothing for them. I currently have a dispute running with all 3 credit reporting agencies but knowing the reputation of this company, I would assume I will be waiting for this to drop off before they budge to report this as closed like it was and now should be. This company is corrupt, and I was so glad to read that when I filed a report against them with the BBB, that there is a federal investigation against them for millions of dollars. I am also hoping (after reading so many horror stories from others in reference to this company) that all the other individuals that they have ripped off, scammed, and lied to will be paid back in some way for their suffering as well assisted with their losses.   ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Carol Stream, Illinois USA ",, 18008666540020,,"  I refinanced my home in November 2013 - had a loan with Wells Fargo. Upon closing, my loan was immediately sold, and much to my dismay, Ocwen was the buyer. I received a letter in Dec 2013 which instructed me to send my first payment to a PO Box in Louisville KY. I send my first electronic payment in January 2014 - which was rejected. I called, and they said the payment address was incorrect, and has been changed to a different address. I make the payment to the new address (first payment made). Then I get a letter in the mail that says my loan has been sold to Homeward Residential Inc, but to keep making payments to Ocwen. So Feb payment comes due and I send it to Waterloo - so my second payment was rejected. I pull my February statement out, and surprise, they changed the payment address again! Meantime I receive another letter that my homowners insurance has lapsed and that I must provide them proof of insurance. Well, guess what - they have my insurance payments in escrow and failed to make the payment per the terms of the loan agreement! Now I'm at the mercy of Ocwen which will charge 3 times my current rate - WTF?! What recourse do I have when they collect my insurance payments in escrow account, and then never make the payment? Moving forward, I sent my Feb mortgage payment to the new address - and its rejected a second time! WTF! I called Ocwen and explained my frustration, and they said the account has been ""modified"", and now there is a NEW payment address.  Guess what - now I'm right up against the grace period due date and will likely incurr a late fee. Be careful - this company is extremely deceptive. Even when you try to make payments, I get the feeling they want to reject my payments to force me into default - they have rejected 3 of my last 4 payment attempts. I have equity in my home - and I think they know it. I think they want me to fail making payments so they can initiate a foreclosure. Why on earth would a company keep playing leapfrog with the payment address? They have changed the address several times in the very short time I've had my new loan.

Unfortunately due to property prices where I live, it's going to be a while before we can refinance the loan as one. So I am stuck with this company for a little while. To start out with they send no monthly statements and there is no way of getting loan information through their website. If you ask about this, they simply tell you that they do not do statements. Customer service is awful. You ask for anything and you mosts likely won't get it. They don't respond to emails. Then I still haven't received my 1098 for interest paid on the loan. The fact they they refuse to provide statements of any kind and have such horrible customer service scares the crap out of me. I don't know if they are taking me, ammortizing my loan correctly or what. I realize they are used to dealing with low income families and problem customers. However I am not one of them.

 Dovenmuehle Mortgage ,"  Dovenmuehle Mortgage  1 Corporate Drive, Suite 360 
Lake Zurich, Illinois USA ",, 18666540020,," ERROR #1 Dovenmuehle Mortgage has handled almost every interaction with myself and my finances sloppily and haphazardly.  6 months ago Dovenmuehle needed to take money out of my ESCROW ACCOUNT to pay my home insurance and my yearly taxes.  I had plenty of money in my ESCROW so the deduction should have been painless.  Dovenmuehle pulled the payment twice in error, driving my escrow balance almost into the negative.  I, in the meantime have no idea of the error until I received a letter from Dovenmuehle stating that my escrow account is way too low ""for some reason?"" and my new mortgage payment is now roughly 15% more than the previous months'.  The gigantic increase in my mortgage payment was due to an immediate ecsrow re-analysis by DOVENMUEHLE the very moment they accidentally withdrew double the payments they were supposed to.  Needless to say I had to be the one who found the error and I had to call Dovenmuehke and coach them through their responsibilities until they learned the error of their ways.   They would not re-evaluate my escrow account to make my payments decrease for an additional six months after I re-sent in the error money and asked for a re-analysis of my escrow.  They eventually recalculated it.  After their new analysis my mortgage payment still ended up permanently higher than it was before the Dovenmuehle folly.  I also had to pay the additional 15% plus increase for months resulting in myself, (who is a 100 percent disabled veteran) and my wife having to pay hundreds extra until Dovenmuehle realized/fixed their gigantic unexcusable selfs.   ERROR #2 In December 2013 I closed the bank account linked to my Dovenmuehle Mortgage because I was switching banks.  Today is rouglhy 50 days since I told Dovenmuehle the bank account is closed and 50 days since I sent a letter requsting the change through the USPS which tends to deliver most my mail within a week.. Dovenmuehle automatically withdrew from my old cancelled account on the first of the month until December 2013, when I notified Dovenmuehle that the bank account was closed and asked if I could please set up a new automatic withdrawal through a new bank.  Dovenmuehle basically said they can't do anything productive over the phone because that would be hard so if I could please send a letter with my bank info and my insructions about what I wanted to happen.  This letter was sent out before Christmas 2013. The staff member I spoke with in December said that they could not cancel the cancelled bank info to the closed account for some reason and she would simply ""put a skip"" on January's payment while they recieved my December letter.  I sent in a check from the new bank account which cleared covering my January payment.  As Febuary approeched I got nervous because Dovenmuehle had not sent me a conformation that they recieved my request to draw from a new bank.  Finally on February 3rd I received a letter that was dated January 31, 2014 stating they got my letter and they will withdraw my next scheduled payment...which would be February 1st.  As of February 8th there had been no withdrawal.  On February 10th, Dovenmuehle sent me a letter Dated 2/5/2014 stating they couldn't withdraw my February 1st payment because the account was closed. So my payment is late and I owe them a fee.  I called Dovenmuehle and the lady was very apologetic at first. She addmitted that Dovenmuehle tried to pull from the account that I notified them was closed 2 months prior.  My ""Good"" account, which they claimed on Jan 31st they would pull from had enough in it to cover the mortgage. So what the heck happened?  First, I would put my hand on the bible and say I believe the assoiciate I was talking to started out-right lying to me at one point.  She claimed that Dovenmuehle tried to put a hold on the payment on January 30th on my old accountt that I told them was cancelled...because they did not recieve the letter I sent for almost 50 days...until January 31st!!!.   I said please do not pull February's mortgage because my wife and I mailed a check on the February 7th, because we saw that Dovenmuehle had still not withdrawn.  I told the lady I didn't want to pay the penalty fee from the January 30th attept to draw from a cancelled account.  According to her I still am responsible for the fee, and if I want to i can mail in a rebuttle, so If my math serves me if I mail the letter in today February 10th, Dovenmuehle will look at it in roughly the end of April? I hate you Dovenmuehle. ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

 BB&T ,"  BB&T  PO Box 2467 
Greenville, South Carolina USA ",www.bbt.com, 1888-480-24-32,," I have been making extra payments toward my principle. As a responsible consumer, I have been checking to confirm these payments are being posted properly. I discovered once last year these funds had been misappropriated and applied towards a future payment. The result is BB&T collecting interest on funds which they took as interest. In the past month, this has occurred numerous times. They have had more than a week and have done NOTHING to correct the payments. I contacted Freddie Mac (the investor on the loan) only to discover none of the corrections had been made. As of today, BB&T cannot even give me an accurate pay-off amount. I asked what I should do if I wanted to pay off the loan. Their response was ""Well, just pay what we say and we'll try to reimburse the difference.""  If these people cannot apply funds properly, how can I trust them to properly reimburse properly? When I pointed out all of these issues to the ""Customer Service Group"" and how applying these payments to future payments versus applying the payments to the principle as I stated on the payment, none of them have understood how this negatively impacts me as a consumer. This means none of these ""Customer Service"" people understand loans, and they are trained not to admit when they have made an error. If mortgage companies charge a $50 late payment fee, why are they not charged a fee when they misappropriate funds? How many more mortgages are they doing this scam to collect higher interest payments from customers unknowingly? In short, BB&T is a mortgage scam company. If your mortgage is held by this company, ask every month for an accurate loan history and question how EVERY payment is applied.   ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Including family members like that ugly nigggger she is married to Richardo F. Suarez. I feel sorry for him but if he married her thats what he deserveds. I was reluctant to write this because I know she has two small children but she made the decisions and choices to do what she did. She wasnt thinking of those kids when she went after my husband nor did she think of the impact it would have on them in the future.     ,  Mortgage Companies ,0
 Ocwen Mortgage ,"  Ocwen Mortgage   
Orlando , Florida USA ",www.OcOcwenom, 19723168772,," I had trouble the minute Ocwen started servicing the loan. My mother was the borrower but in her 80's so I was always the contact before (GMAC) Ocwen became lien holder. Once w/ocwen, I could never get info or make arrangements. Sent numerous authorizations for 3rd party access but no results. They didn't accurately post payments. Had to send bank statements to resolve that issue. Long story short, payment was late, couldn't pay online OR get an answer at any of the published phone numbers except for CR's who couldn't understand English. They only had one response for every question no matter what the question. Website kept routing back to payment options and a phone #. I asked for US rep and never got one. Held for hours only to be disconnected. I called for Weeks until finally just this morning was told the property Just got in (4 days ago) foreclosure. I have called EVERY # and have yet to speak with a US rep. I condensed this story obviously but it has been a nightmare. As much as I want to keep the home, I'll be glad to be rid of Ocwen. They are ripping off home owners daily. What they're doing should be illegal. Id be happy to join a class action against them. I see too many posts regarding their obvious shady business practices. Did I mention they refused the loan modification and they have reported the mortgage on my credit, not my moms? ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

 Ocwen ,"  Ocwen  1661 WORTHINGTON RD, STE 100 WEST PALM BEACH,  FL  
Miami, Florida USA ",http://www.ocwen.com/, 214-615-6505 ext 8783,," Our nerves were so rattled by what Ocwen put us through. We were called and offered a modification on our loan. We did not call them to ask for it. They proceeded to tell us that we needed to stop paying the mortgage for at least three months in order to qualify for the modification. That seemed very strange to us. They had just told us that we qualify for it, yet we had to do something else to 'qualify' for it.  We just did not believe this could be correct information.       We continued getting these calls, so eventually took their advise in order to get the modification. After the 3 months of not paying the mortgage, we called to ask when the modification would be done, and what do you think we were told???  We were told that we do not qualify for the modification because our account was in arrears!!!!! If we wanted the modification, we now had to pay them the 3 months payments all at the same time as paying our current mortgage payment. We did not have $20,000.00 just lying around.  We went through a year or two of hell trying to fix this mess. We could never get hold of anybody. We could never speak to anybody who knew anything about how to handle our case, and quite frankly they did not care! We tried getting to the top, but that was a waste of time too. They finally started threatening us with foreclosure, but we still had not spoken to anybody who could offer us any advise or explain why this happened in the first place. We paid an attorney recommended by them (ha ha!), but that was just another waste of our hard earned money. In December 2012 we received a call telling us that we had maximum 2 weeks to vacate our home!! We moved into a rental and now will not be able to purchase a house for many years due to what Ocwen have done to our family! We had a great home that we loved. Ocwen have taken away not only our home, but they took away our pride, our confidence in any businesses out there, and the ability to own our own home! My daughter's mortgage on her house was just bought over by Ocwen 2 months ago, and guess what she is going through??? She has been in her home almost 10 years. They have never been in default. They have never had any issues. They always paid the taxes together with their mortgage, and now they are having a huge battle as Ocwen deny that they paid their taxes. My daughter has the confirmation from the tax offices. Ocwen are raising their mortgage by $500 per month, which they definitely can not afford. She has tried incessantly to get hold of somebody that will listen to her. Nobody listens. All calls are to India and there is an obvious miscommunication there.  They do not speak English properly and they certainly do not understand the American mortgage systems!  She has spent weeks on the phone trying to solve this issue. Her nerves are frayed! What is she supposed to do? Will they evict her too? Please tell me if there is anything either of us can do and if there is some sort of class action suit that we can participate in, or where we can turn to get some sort of compensation for what they have done to us.

Tempe, Arizona USA ",www.gtservicing.com, 405-426-1299,," In April - Green Tree Servicing purchased my mortgage from Bank of America. I did a quick web search to determine who I was now going to have to deal with as BOA's mortgage arm is just this side of a joke. After noting that GT had a history of ""insurance scams"" I proceeded to make sure that my insurance agent sent the proper information so as to not cause any issues. In August - I got a letter stating that they didn't have the proper insurance paperwork. My agent sent the paperwork over to them again. In early December - I got a letter stating that I had insufficient insurance for the property. Threatening that they would purchase insurance for me (at my expense) if I did not provide proof. My agent contacted GT and found everything to be in order. In late December - I get a repeat of the same letter stating that the added insurance would be triple what my current homeowners policy would be. My agent resent all paperwork. This time, I sent a very detailed letter pointing out that not only would I not pay for their insurance, but I would charge them double the amount as an inconvenience fee. That the current level of insurance was enough for BOA and for Countrywide before them, so it was good enough for GT. A few days later - I get a phone call from a GT employee stating that they wanted to clear this up. That all they needed was proof of insurance from my HOA. Which I then had sent over. In mid-January - I get another letter stating that GT has purchased the overpriced insurance from their subsidiary company (Yes, the scam is perpetrated to build business for one of their own companies.) When I call, they finally tell me that the insurance carried by the HOA did not meet their needs. At this point, the issue has not been resolved.

Sioux Falls, South Dakota USA ",citimortgage.com, 405-426-1299,," Hi, It's really scary to see all of the previous comments (AKA horror stories!) regarding removal of PMI from home mortgage with Citimortgage.  Just talking with a couple of customer service rep, made me feel like I am about to be hoodwinked; so, I did what any other sane person would do: check if there is any similar occurrences.  And there are many! I am at a point, I can start the PMI process (LTV < 80%).  So, when I asked Citi about automatic PMI removal at LTV of < 78%; the CSR says that even then an appraisal need to be done.  For what?  When I got this loan from another company, they mentioned that at below 80% LTV, PMI would be removed.  Nobody mentioned anything about an appraisal or anything.  Now, reading the comments in Ripoff report, makes me wonder, if that appraiser is going to be fair or not.   Well, I have asked Citi to provide me with their policy regarding PMI removal.  Hopefully I will get it, and based on that I can decide what to do.  I will keep you posted. -PN_Pa ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

He said that unless we lied about information, that we should see no issues getting the actual loan. We found the home of our dreams, put in an offer, and our offer was accepted! We had never been happier. The next day, Mr. Sharp called to say that we needed two full years of trade line credit and that there was an item on our Credit Report that needed to be taken care of.

Within a month Proficio had sold our mortgage to another company.  During that month we had a water heater leak which caused some serious damage to a built-in entertainment center.  Proficio required as a condition of the loan that they be a co-payee on our home owner's insurance.  Our insurance company (State Farm) was extremely helpful and agreed to reimburse us for all our damage and sent checks very quickly, which we then had to send to Proficio for an endorsement.  Proficio no longer has any financial stake in our home but they are requiring more documentation (invoices, contracts, etc. for the work being done) than the insurance company did before they will return our insurance checks.  I was told they were jerking us around (my words) in order to protect Proficio and ""business practices"".  From what, insurance fraud?  State Farm doesn't think there is any fraud because they had an adjuster come and inspect the damage.  I am extremely unhappy with our treatment by Proficio and I would never recommend this company to anyone.  ",  Mortgage Companies ,0
 LoanCare ,"  LoanCare  3637 Sentana Way 
Virginia Beach, Virginia USA ",, 419-259-7703,," LoanCare has been ""servicing"" our homeloan from Freedom Mortgage since the first few months of our loan. Our loan was purchased by them and it's been a nightmare ever since. Right now we are fighting a $14,000 charge on our account preventing us from paying our mortgage because they won't accept any mortgage payments until this is paid. The $14,000 is for wind insurance. Our USAA policy has always had wind insurance. They decided to take out a policy without our consent when we were trying to figure out what was the problem. They don't return calls. We always ask when are you going to call back and they never do call. Only collections calls and they are rude. Back to the $14k added to our escrow a few months ago. We added hurricane insurance to our home owner's policy when it became apparent that's what they wanted after we already had the wind insurance and that scam didn't work. We added it in September and they bought it for us in November of 2013. Oh and it's 5 times the normal cost AND they backdated it to April 2012. We qualified for a loan modification program to reduce our payments after a layoff of the primary breadwinner fir almost a year and falling behind. We cleaned out our savings, our retirement, and went into debt to pay the mortgage. The new mortgage was for the same amount of our first mortgage, four years prior!!!! So we lost all the money, at least $40,000 in principal payments paid and that's a conservative figure. The new mod loan was effective Jan 1 2013 and we were doing just fine until the government shutdown. My husband is retired Navy and working for DoD as a Civilian. So we got a little behind, two months. We want to pay our mortgage after catching up and renting out a part of our house. They refuse to take the payments for two months mortgage because they want us to pay $14k insurance first. My husband called that insurance company and no money has changed hands, it can be reversed and they are only going by LoanCare on this. They already reversed a portion to LoanCare since we could prove our hurricane insurance from Sept but they won't credit us at all. We are looking for an attorney and welcome solicitations from attorneys to take care of this matter. We have a VA loan BTW. We need help asap. They are again putting us in foreclosure all because of their charges that they have made up. ",  Mortgage Companies ,0
 Everhome Mortgage  ,"  Everhome Mortgage   P.O. Box 2167 
Jacksonville, Florida USA ",https://www.everhomemortgage.com/, 440.225.4714,," Here how my issue began. My wife's business went out of business in March and we had to close it up. So we were gonna have a hard time making our payment until she got back to work. We could make it, but it was gonna be tight. So we did what responsible people do and contacted them (Everhome Mortgage) to see if there was anything we could do and find out if it were possible to tack a few payments to the end of the loan in case we got in any trouble.  We called Everhome and they seemed nice and helpful. The guy we talked to said it would be easier if we filed for a loan modification so we said ok. So we filled out the papers sent them in and was told to pay $50.00 a month until they ran the information through to see if we quailified. I asked are we gonna be considered late? They said ""oh no"", I then asked are we gonna lose our home?.. and again he said ""oh no, don't worry it looks good"",  this is in March, in April they called and said we need to send the papers in again they lost them, so we did we gathered them together and sent them, we did this send the papers thing four diffirent times until August. In August they called, this time with a pissie attatude and said we did not get the modification. They then proceded to tell me to pay up with late fee's or face foreclosure. Me and wife was horrified, I said wait you told me It looked good and not to worry about anything, now im told to bad pay up with late fees or lose my home?  The lady went on to say I had to wait 30 days and I could try to remodeifiy then. My wife had found a job in June and was making good money, but in september was laid off. So in September we get a letter from Everhome Attorney's saying we were being foreclosed on. My wife was devastated. I said I was told this would not happen, and yet here I am. They scheduled my house for Auction on Nov. during this time I was dealing with useless greedy attorneys and a rude Everhome who said they couldn't help us now because my wife had no work. My wife found a part time job and we quickly began the modification process over again. which slowed the auction process, but again we played lose the paper work, and had to keep sending them stuff we had already sent them. in December while going through the motions of modification again with these theives I get another notice from there attorney's stating they were going to auction my home off in Jan. So I called them and they (the Attorneys) stated that Everhome was doing it, and if Everhome would send them a letter they would stop the sale until the modification was done. We called Everhome who once again assured us to not worry, everything looked good, and not to worry about my house being sold. Then as we continued this silly dance of send me this, send me that, the guy we were dealing with from Everhome stopped returning our phone calls. We herad nothing from Everhome for 2weeks except two calls left on my machine to call them, when i would call the guys voice mail picked up, i would leave name and number, and told them we work i was calling back! Then after several calls and messages left on this dopes answering machine or voice mail, he calls and blames the Holidays for not calling me back to work on my mode, and says yea, you were denied on Dec 31 and he is telling me NOW one WEEK later after my modification was denied! I had no chance to make a correction to the reason he called no way to give him anything else he may have needed, no one called to let me know, he didn't return my calls nothing!!  So we ask what now? He said call our attorneys and see what they will work out with your home. So we call the attorneys not knowing that they sold my house 5 days prior to talking to this useless blob of flesh that didn't say hey by the way we sold your house 5 days ago.... Nope the attorneys tell me!!! The attorneys said they can't do anything for me only Everhome. When I called Everhome back they insisted that the attorney's are the only ones who can. The fact is the LIARS at Everhome bought the house back and so they and they alone hold the power not the attorney's. That's right this how the banking system works. They scam you for your property! Thats what they did. They didn't want me to have nor stay in my home, and those in Washington both sides are crooks who are lower then any form of human on the face of the earth for letting these banks pull such a scam is this. But hey there just getting some too, after all there the banks are the same people who pile in both sides election coffers!  Everhome just want the insurance money they take out on the house, and as a added bounus they get the house too. So why would the bank want to work with you. Lesson: The banks are scumbags running a sham, Don't stop paying even when the bank says...""Everything will be ok..you won't lose your property"". Just figure away to pay, loan modification is a long shot for the lender to give the ok when he is in a big win win situation. . Thats like having the other team bring the officals and the Ref's.

I gather he did this to meet quotas for writing applications, but it harmed me by preventing me rom applying elsewhere and giving false information to credit bureaus which affects your credit rating. I reported this to his supervisor who supposedly closed the false account that i never applied for but he claimed he could not write the credit bureaus on my behalf which costs me my time and aggravation to do so to remove this false application from my history. BEWARE OF LOAN OFFICERS At this bank. When I asked the supevisor bout HAMP he indicated I would have to call customer service and didn't think I qualified unless I didn't pay my mortgage one month.

 Green Tree Servicing LLC ,"  Green Tree Servicing LLC  1400 Turbine Dr Suite #200 
Rapid City, South Dakota USA ",, 480-383-2290,," My Mortgage was, in November 2013, sold to Green Tree by my former servicer, Specialized Loan Servicing. I made my November 2013 payment as soon as I received my first billing invoice, in mid November, from Green Tree. My bank shows that my November mortgage payment check was cashed on Nov 28, 2013. I then attempted to sign up on the Green Tree website, (AS RECOMMENDED BY GREENTREE ""FOR EASE OF PAYING YOUR MORTGAGE AUTOMATICALLY EACH MONTH""!) so that I could set up automated payments for all future payment transactions. I tried on at least 5 occasions to sign up for the auto pay but the system would never allow me to complete the process. In the meantime, my father, fell ill in late November and passed away on Dec 7. In my distressed state I forgot that I had NEVER been successful in signing up for auto pay. It was Dec 20 before I remembered that I was not yet signed up for auto pay. I went to the Green Tree website and tried again to set up auto pay, but the website would still not allow me to sign up. So on December 20 I called Green Tree to apologize and explain that I was late paying my Mortgage because my father passed away and, in my distressed state, I had forgotten that I was never able to sign up for auto pay. They then took my payment by phone for a $12 service fee. Much to my surprise, beginning on Dec 26, 2013, I started getting calls from Jenny at Green Tree Collections saying I was in default for NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER, 2013. I called back on Dec 29 and spoke to Malcom and explained that I HAD made my Nov and Dec payments, and the payments had cleared my bank. long ago. After some sleuthing, Malcome told me that my payments had ""erroneously"" been put into ""suspension"" and that the error would immediately be corrected. This was the reason, he explained, that I was not permitted to sign up for auto pay. I must be current on payments he said , in order to have the ""privilege"" to use autopay. ( even though I WAS current!) I have called every business day since Dec 30 and have been given every excuse in the book for my payments not being applied to my account. Today I spoke to Amber (employee 5592). She got mad at me for being upset and told me ""the problem will be fixed when it's fixed and that's that"". Then she hung up on me. I immediately called her back and she put me on hold immediately and indefinitely while playing the song ""Sweet Anticipation"" as the on-hold interlude. I'm not making that up! After 1/2 hr she never came back on the phone. I kept her on hold on my phone, and used my friend's phone to call back from a number unfamiliar to them. My call was immediately answered, imagine that! I asked to speak to my account manager Jenny S. (emp no. 576). I told her I was going to contact my Congressman if my $2800.66 was not immediately applied to my account for my Nov and Dec payments. Jenny then spoke with her supervisor Michelle H., who told Jenny to tell me she was sorry but HUNDREDS of their clients were in the same situation I was in. ""Everyone's payments"" Jenny said, ""are in 'suspension' due to a 'technical problem', and I cannot tell you when it will be corrected"". So apparently ALOT of money at Greentree is in limbo somewhere, NOT being used to pay people's mortgages. I believe this is called ""misappropriation of funds"", is it not? And it's illegal, isn't it? And now, to beat all, here is the icing on the cake: Today I received 4 certified letters from Greentree telling me, ""you are now in default on the above referenced credit transaction. Account # 822325213. Your default consists of : Failure to submit your monthly payments due 11/01/13 - 1/1//14."" ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Prior to them increasing my mortgage (for the millionth time), I had won a tax appeal and got my taxes reduced therefore my mortgage escrow payments decreased from $1300 to $1100. Wells Fargo was paying the state of illinois the correct tax amount but charging me a lower tax amount, for over 18months, so once again I have a escrow shortage of $3500 (this lead to my mortgage being going form $1105-$1269 (as of feb 2014). I think this was done intentionally, to once again force me into foreclosure?  What is the purpose of missmanaging an escrow account and causing payments to increase every analysis.  (Yes I am aware of tax increases that has nothing to do with mortgage companies) But there is something criminal about the way Wells Fargo manages mortgage accounts, and escrow accounts.   So now I have to make a choice stay inmy house and pay $1269 (use my money for food to pay the escrow shortage), go back into forclosure?  I feel stuck, The pain and suffering that Wells Fargo has caused me is enourmous, If I go back into foreclousre, I will use the mortgage payment to hire an attorney to sue for pain and suffering.  Who is advocating for the Wells Fargo Victims, how does this happen over again?  Wells Fargo Account Number 0205XXXXXXX PID 24-01-XX-XXXX         ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

In October Nation Star didn not take out the payment because I did not have the new full payment in the account.  I called Nation Star back and they stated that unless I make the full payment i will be reported to the credit bureau as being 30 days late on my mortgage payment. I did not make the payment at that time; but i did request that they annotate my account again stating my issues with the company. I called my husband and told him and he went and spoke to our lawyer.  Our lawyer called Nation Star and was on the phone with them for about 2 hours telling them legally they can not make us pay more then what our loan documents say.  In the end of the conversation my lawyer was told that they would suspend our payment until they rectify the issue. I called Nation Star 1 week later and I was told that my account was not suspended and it was incurring late fees because i was past the 15 day grace period.  I asked the representative for a copy of my loan documents stating that I will be subjected to a monthly payment increase IF my interest rate DOES NOT increase and as of 20 Dec i have yet to receive a copy of it.Due to me and my husband trying to close on another home I went ahead and paid the amount that was due to prevent a 30 day late notice on my credit; but I requested that they annotate my account saying that I was paying the payment under distress.  I received a letter from another member at Nation Star stating that they have completed their review of my account and they will continue to charge my account the new $1297 payment.  I tried to call the gentleman and he has yet to return my phone call.  Nation Star took out the complete payment in November and December. The mortgage company for the loan on my new house called us for approval to call our mortgage companies to verify on-time payment and the balance of each loan on 18 Dec. During the phone call with Nation Star the representative stated that we have a late payment amount on our loan due to our monthly payment is not paid within the 15 grace period.  My husband explained to the lady that Nation Start set up the automatic payment in the summer of 2013 and why didn't they state that when they set up the automatic payment. She stated that she didn't know and if he wants it to change then he needs to log into his account on-line and change it.  I have had my mortgage with BOA for 6 1/2 years when they sold my first mortgage and NEVER in my life have I had a mortgage company try to bamboozle someone; especially since we NEVER paid our loan late. ,  Mortgage Companies ,0

Waterloo, Iowa USA ",www.ocwen.com, 561-239-8800,," Filed against : Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLCComplaint Description:Just by requesting a loan modification, last year they scammed me for expenses, messed op the administration and harassed me. I got 6'' of paper.  Account number xxxxxx821  Just by requesting a loan modification, last year they scammed me for expenses, messed op the administration and harassed me. I got 10'' of paperwork. Seems to be that the whole deal with the request for loan modification, starting with the previous company GMAC, taken over by Ocwen loan ''services'', is in reality for their own profit, rather to help the client. Ocwen invoiced me for a lot of extra fees. Last year in discussion with their (very ruth) employees all trained to rib you off, One time The lady asked me....do you wanna continue or stop the loan modification request. I told them, just stop, because the only think i see is fore closure letters, harrasing me with stupid phone calls but no help. Scary!!!! Instead they kept going and added all kind of fees. Even though i pay my insurance and property taxes, they paid it aswell. More fees. On our behave, ofcourse the money was send back to them. Long story short; I send them 100 derds of letters, emails, calls nothing has changed. Certified letters to the president...I Only received the most ridiculous and stupid responses. They where showing me their SECOND and creative way off bookkeeping from a different department as they mentioned.Just to confuse the people and if you are dom to let you believe, you realy own Ocwen money. It's like a car dealer ship sending you invoices for repairs and the bodyshop invoices for paint jobs, which they never have done. Ocwen knows their wrong doing. They steal on paper hundreds or thousands of dollars from innocent people. If you steal the same money from a cash register or bank, you will end up in jail. Ocwen just takes the money. I have, as mentioned all the paper records, the fax trails, and Ocwen as they mentioned has all the phone conversations on 'tape'. So their can not be any mis communication at all. Ocwen, you don't have to respond on this again, the way you did. It will be an insult of my intelligence. Ocwen, you have to give me my money back, what you just took when i paid off the loan with your company. I will not rest to get my money back. Never. Ocwen will be held responsible for all expenses, all lawyer and court cost to collect my own money. With your behavior i had to get with off your company, by paying you off. I could *&(&)&)((* somebody. I never had this feeling before. Listing to all the complains and stories I am not the only one. You don't care. I also warning you to stop harrasing me with phone calls, collection calls. Those calls game from areas in the USA en outside like the Phillipens. I told you that i am on the do not call list. Every charge will be $ 10,000 You just ignored everything. You don't care. Your Desired Resolution:Ocwen Loan Services LLC has to refund me the money i paid to much....read they took from the settlement in order to pay off the mortgage. For harrasing me $ 10,000 They have to refund me, including my expenses, time, frustration and money they kept $ 3,000 For the harrasment part they owe me $ 10,000 After this i will take you to court, if Ocwen is not going to settle the debt with me.

Cincinnati, Ohio USA ",www.pncmortgage.com, 561-682-8000,," In April 2013 a Mortgage Rep DJ Gossett with PNC contacted my husband and I about refinancing our mortgage. I explained to the him that we really needed to refinance and save money because in the last 3 years, I had cancer and my husband had a heart attack, we were both off work for a long period of time without pay and we needed to get back on track with our finances. Our mortgage was with PNC Bank already. He stated they could get our Interest rate dropped from 6% to 3.5%, we would keep our contract for 25 years, we would only refinance what we still owed, and our monthly mortgage would go down several hundred dollars.  We went through with the refinance which closed in May 2013, trusting PNC. In November we received a letter from PNC stating we didnt have enough money in our escrow and it was short almost $1200 and as of January 1, 2014 our mortgage is going back up to almost what is was before. Our property taxes etc.. did not increase so I am confused how our interest rate could drop by 2.5 % but our monthly mortgage is going up several hundred dollars a month. I contacted the PNC Rep. DJ Gossett  through email, trying to get some answers but he just keeps forwarding my emails to his Regional Manager Chrissy Coffman who has yet to answer. I have to start paying the higher monthly payment in January 2014. ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Nationstar then said we needed to send the ""Endorsed"" check to them and they would dispurse the funds accordingly.  We were first told we had to have a Liscensed/Bonded Contractor{Not required in the state of GA) so we did what they requested.  After the contractor turned out to be a fraud (and several more after that) we called Nationstar and they said we didn't have to have a contractor and we could Sub-contract the work. We have spent thousands of dollars to meet there so called completion criteria-including meeting with their inspector and we still have not received a dime and we are still out of our home.  The worst part was not being able to have Thanksgiving with our son who is in the Air Force and has always had a home cooked meal with his Mom and Dad.

 HFC Beneficial ,"  HFC Beneficial   
Brandon, Florida USA ",www.hfc.com, 585-545-5604,," In June 2013, my 73 year old Mother started to get collection calls from Household Finance Corporation - HFC Beneficial but the representative could not tell her what the amount was for that they were trying to collect e.g. late fees, missed payment, etc. The calls stopped until September 2013 when they started again but the collection agent still could not give her any detailed information.  My Mom asked me to step in when the calls continued and she could not get any clear answers. I made my first call to the customer service center on Tuesday, December 3. I spoke with a woman who said her name was Terry Allan (she spelled it for me). As nice as Terry was, she was still unable to tell me why the calls were being made or what, if any, outstanding amounts were charged to my Mother's account. As close as she got was a missed payment in November 2012 but Mom's bank records clearly show the Nov. payment clearing her bank on Nov. 17. Terry asked me to fax some records to her including one that showed when each month's HFC payment cleared Mom's bank account. The fax was sent at 10:41 a.m. on December 4.  Terry was supposed to have called me back that same afternoon but, of course, I received no such call and since she has no direct dial number, I have no way of reaching her. This morning I called HFC and asked for Terry only to be told that they could not transfer a call to her but they would give my phone number to her and she would call me later in the day. Of course..............no call came in.  At 4:30 p.m. I called HFC again and talked to yet another HFC representative who not only ""could not"" transfer me to Terry but would not let me talk to his supervisor/manager. So, I went through everything once again and this time I was told that in February 2003 (YES FOLKS NEARLY 11 YEARS AGO) a payment was late and that those charges have been compounding. The November 2012 payment went to pay those compounded fees and since HFC never notified her, all payments in 2013 have been a full month behind. Now, some of you may think that my Mom just made a mistake and forgot a payment. However, I am in the process of trying to get a detailed transaction list for all payments from the beginning of the loan because through this sequence of events I have found that there are weeks between when checks cleared Mom's bank account and payments were posted to her HFC account. Case in point, in September when the collection calls resumed, Mom sent an additional amount with her regular payment (to keep them from harrassing her). This check cleared her bank on September 6 but it posted to her HFC account on November 17 - TWO FULL MONTHS LATER. I am already fed up with HFC, their so-called customer service team, their poor recordkeeping and lack of compassion. The HFC representative gets obnoxious and stops listening to me once he/she realizes that I am not going away and that I have complete documentation that brings their records into question. I truly never expect to get this resolved on my own so if I don't receive the transaction detail by next Friday I will turn to the State Attorney General's Office and any other agency that I can call on to assist. HFC won't get away with harrassing my elderly Mother for something that isn't even clear in their own records.   ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Tha being the case, I won't go into a lot of detail accept to say that in early April of this year, their shoddy marketing practices roped me into an arrangement to make bi-weekly mortgage payments to Wells Fargo through NBA's services. Shortly thereafter, in ""closing the barn door..."" fashion, I contacted Wells Fargo and found out that they provide the same service without charging an administration fee.  When I contacted NBA to cancel their services, they informed me that I would relinquish my administration fee of $130. Because I had only made two payments using their service, they agreed to refund half of my registration fee. I just received another solcitation letter from NBA.  I notice they changed the wording to make it less deceptive.  The letter now begins, ""Wells Fargo Bank NA may not have made you aware of the option to setup a smaller biweeky program payment option for your mrtgage loan.""  On the envelope it now states that, ""Loan Payment Administraion is not affiliated with the lender."" But there is still this, ""Contct us if you want to change to the biweekly option...""  ""...If you decline the biweekly option, you will be asked to confirm to confirm that you understand that you are voluntartily waiving the interest savings and loan reduction achieved with the biweekly option. At the bottom of the letter it states ""...is not affiloiated with, connected or associated with, sponsored or approved by the lender listed above."" I'm guessing these changes were not voluntary.

 Green Tree Services LLC ,"  Green Tree Services LLC  345 St Peter St 
St Paul, Minnesota USA ",gtservering.com, 609.883.3900,," After our third ( “3rd”) HAMP application, Green Tree Services LLC finally started our reduced payment schedule almost a year from our initial application into the HAMP Program.  Because of the distaste that had developed during our application process and prior to our acceptance into the Program, the intentional mistruths (“we misplaced your application & we need you to re-apply,”) Green Tree Services LLC, the Customer Service Department / all Customer Service Representatives and any company related Agent(s) began their strategy of arrogance and bullying and their obsession of a few of the Representatives, to design a daily telephone “annoyance” schedule.   My wife & I are convinced that Green Tree Customer Service “employees,” intentionally caused and blocked our qualifying for the “HAMP” program.  When we finally did qualify for the reduced monthly payment arrangement, Green Tree’s attitude “changed.”    We found Green Tree’s Accounting Department returned our payment statement’s without ever identifying interest, principle or any other monthly uses of our total payment.  The majority of these statements had any detailed or written data to record our payment history of the loan.  We never knew what the breakdown of interest, principle late fees, etc..  Many times, there would be an amount charged in the “other bracket” yet when we called, (Billing) we were given some ridiculous story to appease us.  When the call was transferred back to the CS Representative, he/she, would document the call and refer to the communication as “a Negative Response.”  These representatives actually kept a history of those comments/complaints.  When I walked in on a call, which the agent had my wife in tears from an agents effective brow-beating technics I wrote the St Paul Office (Four (4) times) and demanded that the telephone calls stopped… my attitude also changed.        We feel Green Tree’s lack of disclosure or the breakdown of our payment history was intentional, just another way Green Tree’s premeditated tactics combined with their “imposing” style of *behavior worked to finally make us Homeless.  *Customer Service began robo-calling our telephone number, requesting payments, adding “late fees” and intentionally finding any way in which to intimidate us.  There are several occasions I was witness to the CS Representative using the threat of “his ability” to place us on a list to begin Foreclosure!  “I warn you, Mr. **, I can simply place you in Foreclosure”… “you need to ask yourself, Mr. **, do you want this house or not?”  These agents working for Green Tree Services LLC, are without a doubt the rudest, most offensive & discourteous individuals in the businesses.  The practice of using harassing tactics had become deliberate by a few representatives who began calling each day to either cuss & intimidate me or if he/she was able to get my wife on the phone, they would pressure & provoke her into tears.  A record of telephone calls when left unanswered would amount to 3-6 calls per hour and in “one-day” there were thirty-six (36) calls on the message machine.  Each Green Tree Service Representative was disrespectful, telephone calls were laced with profanity, telephone calls prior to 7:00 a.m. & after 10: p.m., calling neighbors with fictitious stories of urgency to indicate ones need to call what would be a Green Tree Services LLC, unlisted number, and their attempt to trick each person with constant bullying by the use of fear convincing and intimidation through harassment.   It was when I requested by USPS “return receipt request,” that all communication via the telephone cease that the Customer Service agent(s) at Green Tree Service LLC began to initiate their strategy to arrogantly foreclose on my home. When I heard that I had been placed in Foreclosure as I was able provide the full amount of the Deed.  I called the Green Tree Services telephone as per their website www.gtservicing.com .  The first agent I spoke with actually began to arrogantly laugh.  “Do you really expect me to believe you have $120,000.00?  Even with his ego up his ass and his continued arrogant laugh, I explained that I did have the funds to purchase the Deed for the residence.  In the Civil matter in the Plumas County Superior Court we provided both the copy of the $137,850.00 Cashier Check and the refusal of the Green Tree Service Agent to accept the payment as a Payoff!  We were evicted but it was ordered that the Bank receive was to receive absolutely ZERO in compensation, back rent or any other fee’s concerning the Foreclosure or Eviction.  After reading the multitude of complaints written concerning this Company, it must be obvious to others as it is to me, that not only does Green Tree Services LLC, need to be investigated as to practices in their accounting, their arrogant CS behavior and their intentionally harassing individuals who are customers of an financial institution not a backyard bullying contest!     There is a similarity and pattern to each and every complaint I have read…Green Tree Services LLC, has a lengthy history of unethical behavior and should be barred from further business.  I hope each client of Green Tree will take the time to tell their story as you have indicated here to provide evidence of this companies horrible record.

" Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC  ","  Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC   Ocwen, PO Box 6440, Carol Stream, IL 60197-6440 
West Palm Beach, Florida USA ",http://www.ocwen.com/, 61 (3) 9663 1117,,"  Going on two years ago, Ocwen bought my loan from Chase.  It came as a complete surprise because I was always current on it, but I guess that's how it goes.  It's actually a rental property for me.  I lived there before remarrying and tried to sell right at the moment of the housing crisis.  So it's worth less than the mortgage.  Oh well - lots going through that right now, right?   My first trepidation was...who/what the heck is Ocwen?   Still making payments on time / regularly.  Have an escrow account set up so they can pay my taxes and it's about 500 dollars of my bill.  Well I started noticing some weird activity on the website, where it didn't appear my taxes were being paid at the normal intervals in Cook County and there appeared to be duplicate tax payments.   I caught wind of this around Nov / Dec of 2012 and checked the Cook County Tax Portal to see that I was delinquent on my taxes.   That they hadn't been paid yet.   I started calling and although the operators couldn't specifically answer my questions, they indicated I should write the tax department by email with copies of my tax bill and it would be taken care of.  I'm thankful I at least have this documentation.  Well I checked on it and nothing.  Called back and emailed the tax department again (which has no direct number) and again asking for some sort of reply which I never received.  Once again in the Spring of 2013 I saw that a tax payment was made on the ""website"", but it wasn't recorded in Cook County.   So I thought...give it a minute to register on the Cook County website right?  Well then a month or so later, the website showed that reverse payment again.    So I called again and emailed the information again. Well this summer I get a notice from Cook County saying my taxes are being sold.  I frantically called back Ocwen, spent a long time on the phone, got connected to an actual american.  Expressed the importance.   Gathered all of the information again and emailed it per instructions from the customer service representative.  I foolishly think thought that it was taken care of.  Again I saw the payment showing on the website, but not the Cook County portal.   At the end of August I got an escrow refund notification for over $5000.   Obviously the refund was this high because they never issued any payment on my taxes, right?   I talked to the operator on the phone and askeud sarcastically, ""Why do you think I'm getting a $5000 escrow refund?""  Gosh, how annoying to keep hearing the guy explain back to me...""It's because there is an overage in your escrow account so we are issuing an escrow refund"" yuk yuk right...""no...It's because your company refuses to pay my property taxes"".  So...I figured. Okay, get the escrow refund and start paying the taxes myself.   Before that could happen, In October, 2013 I received notification that my taxes had been sold.   So anyone that has gone through that knows that you have get a settlement bill from the County.    There are a lot of penalties and fees associated with it.     So my big problem is, I'm paying more on my loan to hold money in escrow, but it's not being used properly.  And...now I'm getting charged tax penalties for the last 2 and a half years.  Which I'd like to recover. So it could be worse - at this point, I'm probably out somewhere between 600 - 1000 in penalties at this point.    But I am concerned with this company and how they operate.  For the record, my Homeowners insurance payments are being made.  That's why it's so confusing that they don't just issue the payments for the taxes. Like many people are reporting here, calling Ocwen is a nightmare.  You have to deal with the foreign call centers and although english has been an issue, they just have no idea what is going on, cannot understand logic, and just read from the script.  It's really frustrating.  I have also experienced the hangups after long hold times.    The whole situation is depressing.  You don't really want to have to deal with it.   There is a feeling of complete powerlessness, because their whole company is PO boxes and 800 numbers and emails.   I might as well send money to that guy in Nigeria that claims to be a prince.   Part of the problem is my own problem for not dealing with this 24 hours a day until it's solved.   But you know what?  I pay the mortgage every month, I didn't ask for them to buy the mortgage, and the escrow account is set up so I shouldn't have to worry about these payments in the first place. What a hassle!!! Oh...and here is the kicker.  So after getting my Escrow refund.  My payment went up by 10 dollars a month because I now had an escrow shortage.  Couldn't they have just kept an extra $120??? There has got to be a way out of this, but it was comforting to see that there are so many complaints about this company.  I'm sure they are warranted.   Anyone else have an issue like this?

maryville, Tennessee USA ",www.vmf.com, 610-609-3301,," I have been a dealing with the most ignorant people I've ever encountered in my 37 years of life for the past 9 years, all of whom are employed at Vanderbuilt Mortgage & Finance in Maryville TN. Its more than obvious they do not care of your real life situations nor will they really help you with anything except having one of their customer service reps. explain to you how you need to be managing your money & paying your bills.  I'm a single mother of 5 kids, with one income and because an unexpected change in my income has caused my to fall 2 payments behind. I've been maintaining this past year with paying them as soon as I get the payment amount together. And since I'm a server I can't say what I'm going to make from day to day, but today I was so nicely told that I was taking advantage of their kindness and that I had plenty of money to pay them the past due amount of $709.00 before Dec. 1st which is in 3 days. I just made a payment this afternoon of $355.00 after Mrs. Ritchie so graciously called me at my job once again only after being asked by my manager more than 3 times already not to call me at work. This resulted in me being written up for receiving personal calls while at work, so when I mentioned that they were gonna get me fired for harrassing me at work they so nicely said that I needed to call them once a week in order for them to stop the phone calls. Maybe I can use my mortgage payment for my phone bill so therefore I can keep a job huh? Anyway, these people have a total lack of morals, respect, and intelligence. I suppose I will be losing my home for Christmas this year and the kids I will be out in the streets just because of VMFs impatient ways. I'm not even the primary lienholder and was told that if I wanted him to pay his part then I needed to track him down and send them his information. What a big lol that was since  I've been waiting for him to pay child support for over a year now. Maybe VMF could knock off one payment for my private investigation services!  Every day, day in and day out, Vanderbuilt Mortgage will harrass you and make you feel like an idiot in everyway they can. I know now I'm a BLOOMING IDIOT for ever financing with them. Never and I mean NEVER will I finance anything with them ever  again. If I make it to pay my last payment to them I'm going to be so relieved to never speak to anyone of them again. I've felt so insulted by these people. Remember all of you at VMF, life is life and it deals out some bad situations at times, rest assured you will all have your turn feeling how you make your customers feel. I hope you all get what you deserve.  Thanks for letting me vent  °~° ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

 US Bank Mortgage ,"  US Bank Mortgage  4801 Frederica St  
Owensboro,, Kentucky USA ",usbankhomemortgage.com., 615-851-3426,," First off, I was in the mortgage industry for 35 years. I am now on SSDi. In August of 2013, USB approved my loan for a refi. It was a portfolio loan, meaning USB is keeping the loan. The amount was $84,000 with an appraisal of $151,000 (ordered by USB). I had escrow impounds on the loan. After some issues with USB NOT paying homeowners insurance, I contacted their customer service and asked them to release the impounds and I would pay my taxes and insurance myself, something I had always done on my numerous prior homes. They said they would send the release request. What I got, was a letter saying ""the investor requires a credit report to release funds (my money)"". But they agree USB is the investor! It is a portfolio loan! So I am supposed to pay for a new credit report for $12, and then they would `review' the account and decide if they would release the funds. Again, an impound account is basically a savings account, and it is my money, NOT theirs. There is no shortage in the escrow account. My loan is paid directly from my bank account, so it is paid early. No lates. I have fewcredit cards with the same zero balances as when I got the loan, with no lates. My credit was good enough 3 months ago to approve a bank loan (we know how hard that has become). Aside from that, there are only 3 reasons to run credit... applying for credit, for employment, or for collection. AND, an impound account is really a savings account that is FDIC inssured. It is MY money, not theirs! The form they sent me was for a mortgage application! I called Customer Service, and the answer was....yes, your taxes are paid, your HO insurance is paid, but too bad. Pay for the credit report and review, take the hit on your credit scores due to another inquiry, or we will not release the funds that they agreed, were mine, not theirs. And, it is `up to them' to decide if they will release my own money. This is bascically fiduciary blackmail. It's like a bank telling you they have to have a credit report to release funds from your own savings account. After 35 years in the industry, even I know this is illegal. I am considering filing a small claims action serving through a local branch, plus punitive damages. Do NOT do a mortgage loan with this bank. Do not do any business with this bank.

 BuyerHomeSite.com ,"  BuyerHomeSite.com   
Internet USA ",www.buyerhomesite.com, 619-872-6060,," This is my notification that I am cancelling all services with BuyerHomeSite.com effective immediately today, October 11,2013. A refund is required to due to BuyerHomeSite.com not fulfilling their contractual obligations and practicing deceitful marketing in order to acquire my business in the first place and examples of some of these issues are listed below:  1)      Your agent, Mr. Barr guaranteed a minimum of 15 leads within my primary territory and additional leads from two secondary territories which would contain verified information. To date I have received 11 leads with one duplicate so actually 10 leads all from St Charles my primary territory. Zero leads from two secondary markets. Of the 10 leads received, seven of the numbers were disconnected and not working, one had never heard of your website and two no answers. A minimum of three emails were sent to all email addresses and no replies were ever received. Therefore the Quantity and Quality of the leads were not as promised. 2)      When I asked Mr. Barr whether he had any other loan officers involved from my company before I bought, he gave me three names like they were established accounts. All three of these individuals had actually been approached and signed up by Mr. Barr on approximately the same day.  They have all informed me that they have all cancelled your service for the same reasons of not the promised quantity and poor quality with most information incorrect on the leads. Certainly not established accounts and in fact no longer exist. BuyerHomeSite email from Customer service (EX #1) to me dated 10/11/2013 which denies my request for a refund. The letter (as unprofessional as it was with spelling and grammatical errors throughout) tries to reject my refund request based on several points which I will address. 1)      Email (EX #1) says: “We do not verify the information”. I refer you the attached email dated September 12, 2013 (EX #2) from their salesperson, Justin Barr, to me. The subject headline in that email says: “Buyer Contacts with verified contact info” which is what he pitched strongly over the phone. This contradicts their own claim in the email response and was the HUGE inducement for me to buy because it was stated on phone and again in Justin’s email to me. I didn’t (as their denial email claims) “misunderstand”….I was falsely misled!! 2)      Email (EX #1) says: “We would never guarantee someone 15 verified leads for 299.00 that’s not even worth it and we would lose money”. Then what are they selling??? And what am I supposed to be buying? Mr. Barr on the phone said they get 15 verified leads per county per month otherwise they could not “sell the county”. St. Charles and Cass Counties as well as St Louis City were all for “sale” which would tell a potential buyer that each territory was getting a minimum of 15 leads per month. Mr. Barr said if I bought one county (St Charles) he would “throw in” a second county (Cass) for free. I asked if he would also throw–in St Louis City as well for free and after he put me on hold “to speak to his manager” he came back and agreed to that (EX #2). Based on his claims during the sales pitch, I figured that would get me close to 45 verified leads in a month which if true should be worth the 299.00. If you look in the latter stages of Mr. Barr’s September 12th email (EX #2) I already referenced above, it states, “We are the only real estate website offering an Iron-Clad Guarantee”. During the time I was involved, I received 11 leads all with bad contact information from St Charles County and zero leads from Cass and St Louis City. This once again contradicts the refund denial email (EX #1) which says they never guarantee. 3)      Email (EX #1)references the three names given to me by Mr. Barr (EX #2) as examples of my company's employees using their services. Mr. Barr did provide those three names and also stated, “This is just a few of the names that we are working with from your company”. His statement is obviously intended to infer some long term relationship of success working with our loan officers when that is not a fact regardless of how long these three had been involved. The refund denial email (EX #1) goes on to say, “I am not going to disclose whether the accounts still exist or don’t”. For your consideration, I have enclosed three emails from each person to me which all describe: a) a lack of leads, b) lack of working phone numbers, c) lack of quality of leads, d) leads from people who had never been to the website and are not in the market for a home or a loan. All of the other guys (EX #3-5) have cancelled their accounts as stated in their attached emails and at least one is disputing their charge with their credit card company (EX #3). 4)      To further emphasize what a scam these leads are, I have attached a response email (EX #6) I received while trying to contact one of my “verified leads”. It is from ""XXXX XXXX"" and says, “Please stop emailing me, I don’t know how you received this email but I did not ask for information”. I had already identified that I was emailing her in response to her visit to BuyerHomesite.com but she obviously knew nothing about it and did not request info as company claims about leads they send. This company is a complete scam as I have documented by myself and three others and additionally a consumer, too. They are obviously just buying names and addresses somewhere and sending them out as leads of visitors who visit their site. Hopefully this will help stop this scam from continuing to spread to others.   ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Detroit, Michigan USA ",http://www.quickenloans.com/, 630.632.0671 (Office),," I spoke with Quicken to refinance my home believing they were a reputable lender.  Before even taking my application, they pressured me into signing up for their $350 credit repair program promising me easier approver and a better interest rate.  They said it was refundable.  They did not refund my money. After signing up for this program and providing them with my financial information, I almost immediately realized my problem.  I was transferred between three credit specialists and they recommended that I pay down my two small credit cards (under $1000) to improve my score.  I was a little baffled.  That was it?  I paid $350 to be told to pay down to cards to 50% balance.  When I asked them why is costs $350 for that stellar advice, they simply explained how the credit game worked.  I asked for a refund stating that this information is common sense and nowhere worth $350 dollars.  I was shuffled around several times between the three specialists and the 30-day trial was almost over.  I was finally transferred to a so-called manager who never answered the phone.  I left voice mails and he never called back.  And, the 30 day free trial had ended and as far as I got with a refund was a non-existant manager.  I was able to track down another person to speak to who said my problems were handled by another department, again, back to one of the specialists I talked to earlier, and finally once again to the non-existant manager voice mail.  I sent a letter to the company, I never got a response back.  I am curious how they get away with this behavior. I complained to a few co-workers and one co-worker had an unrelated complaint about Quicken where Quicken tried to tack on $4000 worth of fees to a refi, half of the fees the broker didn't know what they were.  My co-wroker had the sense to walk away from Quicken at the table.  He also closed with a different bank with less fees. In the mean time, my current mortgage lender offered me a refinance at a much better rate and we took care of business.  I'm from the Detroit area, and apparently Quicken does not seem to be resputable lender they claim to be.   ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

 Mortgage Lenders Of America ,"  Mortgage Lenders Of America  8400 W. 110th Street, Suite 500 
Overland Park, Kansas USA ",www.mloausa.com, 6363576512,," I am a disability-retired elderly veteran existing on a meager fixed-income federal civil service disability retirement pension over the course of the past fourteen consecutive years running.  It has become my belief that MORTGAGE LENDERS OF AMERICA, Overland Park, KS 66210, operate under the deranged corporate philosophy, doctrine, and attendant actual practices of appearing to adhere to non-discriminatory lending practices, while behind-the-scenes and beneath the facade, in all actuality they may likely indeed embrace an elitist hidden agenda of exercising certain selective decisions in their own interests which do indeed become suspect and therefore tantamount to ""nod-and-wink"", ""hush-hush"" back-room practices which smack of fostering age discrimination and possibly discrimination against certain veterans and perhaps the disabled as well.  In light of the aforementioned belief, I hereby reserve the right to promote, advance, and/or promulgate said belief and attendant notions within the public domain at large, and more specifically within all manner of media from this day forward.   With reference to multiple affronts, I contend that MORTGAGE LENDERS OF AMERICA (MLOA) unfairly and unjustly put-me-through-the-ringer in terms of overall abuse, and made me expend all kinds of unnecessary time, effort, hope, prayer, energy, emotion, and money in applying for and matriculating through the refinancing process before suddenly just pulling-the-rug-out-from-under-me at the very last minute of the eleventh-hour by summarily denying my REFI loan and sending me an unexpected Loan Withdrawal Letter to that effect, following a long, protracted, and laborious loan approval process .   Personal devastation ensued as the tragic result of the aforementioned draconian action so cruelly perpetrated by the lending institution and when I lodged inquiry as to the rationale for their extreme and unexpected decision, their explanation was brief, cold, impersonal, and generally inadequate for the most part, with the exception of their advising me that the appraisal report came back stating that the entire roof of my dwelling was faulty and would require replacement. This is not true.  There was some moss on certain areas on the roof, but the roof itself had already been replaced seven (7) years prior to the appraisal inspection and said roof was still in good condition with formidable integrity at the time of appraisal inspection.  The roof has not leaked even once over the course of the past seven-years and I reside in the Pacific Northwest region where rain and snow is prevalent and all too commonplace -- and the new roof has withstood the mean-season forces of Mother Nature's inclement weather assaults for all this time running.   When I challenged the appraisal summary submitted by Paul Olson Appraisals, the lending instituion failed to follow-up on my assertions and contention regarding questionable aspects of ther report, but instead they informed me that their minds were made-up and their hands-were-tied, so they could not reverse the REFI denial action and thus elected to let-it-stand.   The MLOA loan officer I had been working with throughout the long involved REFI process -- Steve Johnson -- advised me that since only a partial appraisal report had been submitted by Paul Olson Appraisals, I should receive a refund of a portion of the $400 fee that I had already paid up-front with a credit card.  This refund never materialized and when I inquired about it, all lines of communication were shut-down on me and MLOA has remained entirely incommunicado regarding the issue to this very day.   It has since become my belief that the intolerable business practices of the MLOA organization have indeed become suspect, and their mission statement and guiding principles regarding fiduciary integrity and customer relations is nebulous and lacking at best -- thus reflecting poor credit upon the institition -- in my humble opinion.  I have needlessly suffered at the hands of the MLOA organization.  They got-my-hopes-up, encouraged me, and then suddenly slammed-the-proverbial door-in-my-face at the last possible minute.  Just when I thought the long process was finally over and I was expecting REFI loan approval, everything went all-to-hell-in-a-bucket and the emotional roller-coaster ride ended abruptly with a surprise unexpected denial sent by Shea Geist in the MLOA Customer Service Department .... and that was it …..... oh man, did I ever feel savagely raped and left-for-dead !!!! Due to all the aforementioned ugliness, I must confess that I cannot recommend MORTGAGE LENDERS OF AMERICA to anyone -- especially retired elderly veterans -- seeking a REFI loan.  Thanks to MLOA, I have now missed the last best golden opportunity to obtain a REFI under the present historic low interest rate levels -- levels which have not been seen for many past decades.  I've just gotta say that I could really benefit greatly -- in my fixed-income retirement condition -- if I were to have become able to have had my monthly mortgage payment substantially reduced as the result of effecting a successful REFI loan.  I feel so foolish and decieved, depressed, despondent, defeated, and disgusted by all that has transpired during my painful relationship with MORTGAGE LENDERS OF AMERICA.

The loan took more than 65 days to close 4. The sales person gave up on giving me excuses and actually agreed that they didnt know what they were doing 5. I found out the company is not a 40 year old lender. They bought the name a few years back. They are relatively new to the mortgage business. They used to do car loans and other types of consummer loans 6. The company regularly fires people and then hires them back then fires them again. 7. Both Larry Dear and his brother Gary made a sales person names David Zilberman into running most of the company. He was just a loan sales guy and now is basically running the company. You can check out the licensing on the consumer access site for the licensing. 8. They charges me almost 3000.00 in lock extension fees at closing 9. I saw an internal email where the processing people called me names. Bottom line- avoid this company. They are great sales people but after that, you are just a number to them.

West Palm Beach, Florida USA ",www.ocwen.com, 661  397-4850,," Where to begin? Ocwen acquired our loan from Indymc in August 2013, and the problems were soon to follow. We have paid IndyMac on time for over 9 years. We have always paid by using bill pay from our bank, direct to their account. The first month went fine, and we then received a notice that our payment would be increasing because there wouldn't be enough in the escrow account to pay thetaxes and insurance. Looking at the statement, they had made a mathmatical error by over-stating the taxes and by listing the insurance twice. We immediately called and were told to write a letter, which we did and sent it out to them, while also enclosing the tax statements coming due. We were then told they never received our documentation and to resend all the pages. Along with now we are into November and our payment was made on November 1st., we received a letter dated Nov. 7th., that they never received our payment. They received the first two (Sept-Oct) no problem, but all of a sudden we have issues. I can see where this is going. They will try and grab more escrow, try and hide-misplace the payments they recieve. All so that they can increase their cash deposits, by charging unwarranted late-fees. Placing families under stress and possibly taking their homes away. I'm not in a situation to refinance but I sure wish I was becauinsee the direction this relationship is headed. I really wish someone would pick up the ball and file a class-action against this company. I recently did research and found the Consumer Affairsbse where all the stories are the same about OCWEN being a lawless operation. their BBB rating is an ""F"", and no one can do anything, and there seems to be no protections for consumers who had their loans sold to this company. We need to take them down. All of their customer service is done in India so you aren't speaking with anyone who can help you. All thay do is say they are sorry and will make a note. Meanwhile, the next day someone is calling you again to say that your payment hasn't been received. You again explain the situtation and again, the same thing. I am sure we will see a late fee for the payment they claim to never have received. I am no longer paying electronically. I will be paying by check. DON'T do any business with this company. They are a SCAM, and will place you in harms way while they chase the all mighty dollar.   ",  Mortgage Companies ,0
 Mortgage Lenders Of America ,"  Mortgage Lenders Of America  8400 W. 110th Street, Suite 500 
Overland Park, Kansas USA ",www.mortgagelendersofamerica.com, 678-281-3464,," I am a disability-retired veteran existing on a fixed-income federal civil service disability retirement pension over the course of the past fourteen consecutive years running.  It has become my belief that MORTGAGE LENDERS OF AMERICA operate under the corporate philosophy, doctrine, and attendant actual practices of appearing to adhere to non-discriminatory lending practices, while behind-the-scenes and beneath the facade, in all actuality they may indeed embrace an elitist hidden agenda of exercising certain selective decisions in their own interests which do indeed become suspect and therefore tantamount to ""nod-and-wink"", ""hush-hush"" back-room practices which smack of fostering age discrimination and possibly discrimination against certain types of veterans and perhaps the disabled as well.  In light of the aforementioned belief, I hereby reserve the right to promote, advance, and/or promulgate said belief and attendant notions within the public domain at large, and more specifically within all manner of media from this day forward. With reference to multiple facts at hand, I contend that MORTGAGE LENDERS OF AMERICA (MLOA) unfairly and unjustly put-me-through-the-ringer in terms of overall abuse, and made me expend all kinds of unnecessary time, effort, hope, prayer, energy, emotion, and money in applying for and matriculating through the refinancing process before suddenly just pulling-the-rug-out-from-under-me at the very last minute of the eleventh-hour by summarily denying my REFI loan and sending me a Loan Withdrawal Letter to that effect. In said letter, the MLOA made it appear as though I had initiated the denial and witdrawal process, but that was not at all true .... not the case in any way, shape, manner, or form.  It was in-fact MLOA which initiated the loan denial and issuance of the attendant Withdrawal Letter. Personal devastation ensued as the tragic result of the aforementioned draconian action so cruelly perpetrated by the lender and when I lodged inquiry as to the rationale for their extreme and unexpected decision, their explanation was brief, cold, impersonal, and generally inadequate for the most part, with the exception of their advising me that the appraisal report came back stating that the entire roof of my dwelling was faulty and would require replacement. This is not true.  There was some moss on some areas on the roof, but the roof itself had already been replaced seven (7) years prior to the appraisal inspection and said roof was still in good condition with formidable integrity at the time of appraisal inspection.  The roof has not leaked even once over the course of the past seven-years and I reside in the Pacific Northwest region where rain and snow is prevalent and all too commonplace -- and the new roof has withstood the mean-season forces of Mother Nature's inclement weather assaults for all this time running. When I challenged the appraisal report submitted by Olson Appraisals, the lender failed to follow-up on my assertions and contention regarding the questionable report, but instead informed me that their minds were made-up and their hands-were-tied, so they could not reverse the REFI denial action and thus elected to let-it-stand. The MLOA loan officer I had been working with throughout the long involved REFI process advised me that since only a partial appraisal report had been submitted by Olson Appraisals, I should receive a refund of a portion of the $400 fee that I had already paid up-front.  This refund never materialized and when I inquired about it, all lines of communication were shut-down on me and MLOA has remained entirely incommunicado regarding the issue to this very day. It has since become my belief that the business practices of the MLOA organization have indeed become suspect and their mission statement and guiding principles regarding fiduciary integrity and customer relations is nebulous and lacking -- thus reflecting poor credit upon the institition -- in my humble opinion.  I have needlessly suffered at the hands of the MLOA organization.  They got-my-hopes-up, encouraged me, and then suddenly slammed-the-proverbial door-in-my-face at the last possible minute.  Just when I thought the long process was finally over and I was expecting REFI loan approval, everything went all-to-hell-in-a-bucket and the emotional roller-coaster ride ended abruptly with a surprise unexpected denial .... and that was it ...... oh man, did I feel savagely raped and left-for-dead !!!! Due to all the aforementioned ugliness, I must confess that I cannot recommend MORTGAGE LENDERS OF AMERICA to anyone seeking a REFI.  Thanks to MLOA, I have now missed the last best golden opportunity to obtain a REFI under the present historic low interest rate levels -- levels which have not been seen for many past decades.  I've just gotta say that I could really benefit greatly -- in my fixed-income retirement condition -- if I were to have become able to have had my monthly mortgage payment substantially reduced as the result of effecting a successful REFI loan.  I feel so foolish and decieved, depressed, despondent, defeated, and disgusted by all that has transpired during my painful relationship with MORTGAGE LENDERS OF AMERICA.   ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Harvey Kopelowits, President/Company Attorney, will just pass you back to the person you are complaining about. Nelson Haws, Owner, knows all the short comings but will just replace you with a new unsuspecting Branch to maintain a steady net profit. Mark Havlik in licensing will take forever to get anything done related to licensing.  Jeanne Delormier, Chief Compliance Officer, will deny all great marketing ideas with no feedback on what they will approve.   Lack of loan program options:  ResMac brokers out all loans outside of conventional and FHA. Anything non-vanilla will be  brokered out resulting in horrible pricing and turn times.       MARTI SYSTEM:  If you lock a loan through MARTI that is brokered out, they will not honor the pricing.  MARTI is not sophisticated enough to give accurate pricing on these type of transactions yet they allow you to lock, submit, and make you wait weeks and months going back and forth with their investor. After a month of waiting, I discovered they locked one of my loans with the wrong investor voiding my original approval and rate lock.     Commissions:  Keep detailed records of all your earned commissions.  ResMac will not pay you unless you fight for your check, especially when you decide to quit.  Their act of professionalism goes away real quick.

They extremly difficult to understand. I would ask a question and get different answer each time from the different reps. I never could speak to the same person. I would ask to talk to a supervisior and convenitly disconnected. They would make an appointment to call me and not call. When I would call them they reported I did not answer phone.

 Bank of America ,"  Bank of America   
Springfield, Oregon USA ",www.bankofamerica.com, 714-238-9098,,"  In March of 2007, I refinanced my primary residence, paid off Chase Bank, and obtained a mortgage from Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Mortgage Corp. I entered into an accelerated payment plan wherein TBW withdrew ½ of my monthly mortgage payment every two weeks from my checking account. The last automatic transfer was taken from my account in July of 2009.   In August of 2009, I went on an extended business trip and when I returned in mid-September I received a letter from Bank of America saying I was in default on my mortgage and they were going to initiate foreclosure proceedings if payment wasn’t received within 10 days of the letter. I received the letter two days after the ten day deadline. I immediately called the number listed in the letter for BOA and was told that this notice was sent in error. I was informed that BOA purchased the assets of TBW and CountryWide Financial but how that impacted upon my particular loan was unknown and BOA could not accept payment from me until they determined whether they actually owned my mortgage or not. They recommended I make deposits into a personal account and hold it until the investigation was complete. I received letters from BOA informing me that my account was delinquent and they were going to initiate foreclosure proceedings in both October and November of 2009. I called BOA both months and attempted to make payments but was informed on both occasions that they could not accept payment from me.   In November of 2009, I spoke with an attorney for BOA who informed me that this situation could potentially take years to resolve and recommended that I seek personal legal advice. I consulted with an attorney who advised me that this would likely require a lawsuit to quiet title to the property and could be very expensive. He also suggested that since I was upside down on the mortgage, I offer to give up any interest I had in the property in exchange for any future claim. I eventually negotiated an agreement ( I thought) with BOA where I agreed to provide them with a quitclaim deed to the property. I signed the deed and returned it to them in May of 2010. In September of 2010, I received a trustee’s notice of sale saying ReconTrust was going to sell the property in February of 2011. I lost my job in December of 2010 and became unemployed on January 1, 2011. The sale was subsequently postponed to April of 2011, then August of 2011, and then it just disappeared from ReconTrust’s website. I continued to live in the residence until October of 2011 when I relocated to Portland for my new job. I notified BOA that I was moving out and the house would be vacant.   I was unemployed from January of 2011 until November of 2011. As a result of my extended unemployment I filed for a chapter 13 bankruptcy in June of 2012. My credit report did not show any record of the BOA mortgage but the quitclaim deed had not been recorded and the County deed records still reflected that I owned the property. My attorney was adamant that I needed to list Bank of America as a secured creditor on schedule A of the bankruptcy and so I did.   Attorneys for BOA requested a written confirmation that I had moved out and was surrendering the property to them. We provided them with the confirmation and they then filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay. We did not oppose the motion and it was granted in September of 2012. The chapter 13 plan was confirmed in October of 2012.   In May of 2013, I received a call from a reporter asking me about a fire at the property. I discovered that squatters had moved in and set fire to the property. I notified BOA and was told I needed to file a claim with the insurance company BOA had taken a policy out with. They provided me with the contact information and I filed a report. I received an insurance settlement check in June of 2013 for the amount of $106,396.77 made payable to my ex-wife, myself, and BAC home loan. Both my ex-wife and I endorsed the check. I have called several different people at BOA during the last five months and everyone says they cannot accept the check, nor can they endorse the check so we can get the house repaired.   In August of 2013, my new wife and I talked with a mortgage broker about buying a home. We disclosed the BOA situation and the bankruptcy. He pulled credit and verified that BOA had never reported the loan to any reporting agency. He then issued a pre-approval letter for a VA loan with the understanding that we would need to get approval from the bankruptcy court to make the purchase. We made an offer on a house and it was accepted. The closing date was set for Sept 25, 2013. Notices were sent to my creditors and no one objected. The bankruptcy judge signed an order allowing the purchase of the property.   During the underwriting process, it was discovered that BOA had reported the loan as delinquent to FHA and therefore my SSAN was flagged in CAIVRS. The CAIVRS flag meant that I was ineligleble for any federal loan program. The underwriter sent a request for waiver due to extenuating circumstances to HUD and we received a written response back from Mr. Jim Sorrentino on Sept 24th had confirmed with the Albany processing center that the CAIVRS would be automatically cleared on October 1st.  The CAIVRS was not cleared on Oct 1st and since the government was closed down we could not reach anyone to clear this up. Once the government shutdown was ended we received another response from Mr. Sorrentino saying that since BOA was reporting the mortgage as actively delinquent there was nothing they could do to clear the alert.   We both, lost the house and incurred a financial loss as a result of this. During the last few weeks I’ve had multiple conversations with BOA people. The first person informed me he was my account manager and that he’d put in a request for review and someone would contact us within 7 – 10 days. I informed him I’d been told this before and he said that if someone didn’t call me back I could call him back and he’d submit another request for review. I eventually received a call from a Falisha Ward in the short sale department who informed me that I was not eligible for a short sale since my credit score was too high. She referred me to customer service who informed me that I could not do a deed in lieu of foreclosure until after I had attempted to do a short sale. I explained that the house burned down so there really wasn’t anything to sell other than a burned out shell and the land. I also explained that my credit score was over 620 which apparently means I can’t do a short sale. According to the customer service rep (Kevin) the reason BOA is not reporting the loan as delinquent to the credit reporting agencies is that the file is marked as paid in full and closed. However, there is a separate FHA file which reflects the loan as being delinquent.   Four years now and no closer to getting anything resolved.  BOA won't close the case and file a claim with FHA, We can't buy another house until they do, and our former neighbors are left with a burned out house bringing down property values.

Orlando, Florida USA ",www.ocwen.com, 714-447-4400,,"  17:56:29 2013-11-03   I purchased my home in January of 2006 in a suburb of Memphis, TN. I fell behind on my mortgage when I was laid off my job. I came home one day to find a foreclosure lock on my door. I had to pay a locksmith to cut me into my own home. Unknown to me at that time, Ocwen Loan Servicing had paid men to come into my home and tape down my toilets, place antifreeze down my pipes and completely trashed my home. I couldn't afford an attorney at the time so I simply cut my way into my home. Several months later while I was looking for work and kept getting denied employment, an HR official from one of the companies I had applied at told me I had a foreclosure showing on my credit report. [continued below]....
									
										..... I was shocked. I had been making my mortgage payments to Ocwen and they had been accepting them. I called the IRS and was also informed ""Ma'am, a foreclosure is showing reported on your home"".  I called up to Ocwen and reached one of their Indian associates in India and told him I was reporting as foreclosed to the credit bureaus. Do you think he cared? no. He didn't even apologize. He simply removed the foreclosure from the credit bureaus and from IRS. Fast forward to now, and this past June I feel behind on my mortgage again and called Ocwen to inquire about my options. I was told I only had one option which was the loan modification. I knew I would not be approved for the loan modification and requested the repayment plan which I knew they could do over the phone. I was told no. Your loan doesn't qualify. I asked why. No one could say. I called Ocwen multiple times since I first fell delinquent and they all told me ""No, your loan doesn't qualify for a repayment"". So finally I spoke to Michael Busch, a relationship manager, and he sent me an email that showed repayment was an option. I asked Mr. Busch why had I been told several months straight (by this time I am near foreclosure) that my loan did not qualify and he said I had been ""Misinformed"" and that repayment should have been offered from the start. I was very irate over this because now with me being so far delinquent Mr. Bush was quoting me several thousand dollars I had to come up with in less than one month or I would be foreclosed. I sent emails and letters to Ocwen telling them their agents had misinformed me about my options and do you think they cared? NO. They did not. Mr. Busch for some reason stopped communicating with me and the next agent was Sunil Kumar Jane out of India. He called me up and immediatley began to threaten me. I told him I wanted to apply for the repayment plan and he kept suggesting the loan mod. I use to work in Loss mitigation at a mortgage company and I knew I would not qualify for a loan mod. Finally after much back and forth Mr. Sunil Kumar Jane told me that Ocwen had ""recently changed their procedures"" and that he would need ""bank statements, check stubs, utility bills"" etc. to do the repayment plan. I told him all of this documentation was consistent with a loan mod and he assured me I would need to send this paperwork for a ""repayment plan only"". I thought it was weird but submitted the paperwork. About two days later I get an message on Ocwen's website informing me that I had been ""Denied"" for the loan mod. I was told I was not applying for a loan mod! and had no idea I was even being considered for one as Mr. Sunil Kumar Jane told me the paperwork was specifically for the repayment plan!! So I called up to Ocwen and spoke with Kristi, another India based agent, and she stated that she could see no information in the system regarding any repayment plan. I was shocked. To make matters worse she said that I would not be able to reach the relationship manager, Sunil Kumar Jane, assigned to me as he did not have a contact number. I emailed him but he had never responded back. Finally after several days of trying to reach him he called. He then told me he could not email out and that ""If I had done what he suggested"" which was pay ""several thousand dollars"" up front I would be able to keep my home. He was actually wanting all of the past due amount from several months to be paid in less than one month. I told him if I could do that I wouldn't be behind.  He told me the ""management"" had denied the loan mod and did not give a reason. I then asked him about the repayment plan that no one could see reflecting in the system and he stated I was ""denied"" for that too.  He then started badgering me to borrow money from loved ones and I told him they had no money. Then he said I would need to pay at least $1,500 down to save my home. As soon as I said ok, he suddenly in the next sentence said it was actually $2,000.00. I grew frustrated but said I would try to get it and then he said ""oh we need at least $4,000.00"" in the next breathe. I could not understand why he kept changing his amount. Three different amounts in less than 3 minutes.  I told him there was no way I could get that in less than a month and he hung up on me telling me there was nothing he could do. No one had even yet addressed the fact that for several months when I was calling Ocwen daily I had been misinformed repeatedly about being able to keep my home and what my options were. If Ocwen would have told me at the time I would have been able to pay the downpayment because it would have been much smaller. After I spoke with Sunil Kumar Jane I called back in and spoke to manager Ankur and manager Daniel Lawrence who both stated that I had been misinformed and that Ocwen was still doing verbal repayment plans and that I did not need to fax over any documentation to qualify for a repayment plan, which is what the relationship manager, Sunil Kumar Jane, had told me to do. He told a BALD FACE LIE and engaged in outright TRICKERY and LIES and DISTORTIONS. I sent a complaint to the Ocwen Ombudsman.  Three days later I call into Ocwen and was told no one could even see any notation from Mr. Sunil Kumar Jane regarding a $4,000 dollar down payment he said he needed. They could only see $2,500.00. Why didn't he update the system? During this time Ocwen's agents were still telling me my loan did not qualify for a repayment plan even though the relationship managers were now offering it. Why the confusion? Every agent disputed what the previous one had stated and argued with me. Finally on a phone call I was able to reach manager Cary Dukes out of the Addison, TX office and he was the nicest manager of all. He set me up on a repayment plan that I agreed to. Out of my experience I recorded the call. I recorded the call because Ocwen's people are very picky about what info they put in their computer system and they often place one sentence to sum up an hour's long conversation. Too much information is missing. Everyone disputes your account of what happened too. So a few days after I spoke to Cary Dukes I get a call from Relationship manager Sylvia Malone who threatens me again and demands all of the past due monies up front. She eventually hangs up on me.  Then I get a call from Juan Sagarra (or something similar) who said he too was a relationship manager and he was irate that Cary Dukes had set up the payment plan and he told me ""He is nobody. Just a customer service manager"" and that ""He doesn't have the authority to set up the arrangement"". Now more than a week has passed and I am near foreclosure. I don't know what is going on. The payment arrangement Mr. Dukes assured me would be set up is still not yet set up. No one knows why. I call in and I'm told ""we will investigate and call you back"" and no one ever does. The ombudsmen office is not responding to my many emails or contacts either. The number to the ombudsman office is never working either. I call and call and am told in the middle of the day ""We are not available at this time"". Ocwen has an ""F"" rating with the BBB. I filed numerous complaints with everyone from the Tennessee Attorney General's office to the BBB out of Central Florida to the CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) and no one has been of any assistance. How can Ocwen get away with this?  I am considering filing suit against them to have the judge make them honor that contract set up by Cary Dukes. This man assured me he had the authority to set up the aggreement and gave me the terms and everything. It represents an verbal contract. The call was recorded by me.  Ocwen has lied to me coming and going. Broke into my home. Trashed my place. And they are engaging in outright TRICKERY to try and take my home.     ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

We have also noticed that if we send a personal check it is a 100% guarantee that they will hold the check stating they did not receive it until they assess the late fees then they will ""magically receive"" it. If we send a Money order/cashiers check they will process it a bit faster helping to avoid some late fees. However after, September 1st, 2013 they are now saying they will not accept the Money Order/Cashiers check and stated that they could not return it. After going through the process to retrieve the funds sent for the September payment through the money order company we received a letter from Owen with the returned funds (a little over a month since they rejected it), after we paid additional fees for late charges in addition to fees charges to attempt to return our funds. Another payment was then sent however this time refused due to a personal check. When asked why they stated they would only accept Money orders or a bank wire transfer due to my account now being past due. I then sent a wire transfer, however, that was also rejected as it now was not for the ""whole payment due"" as the November payment is now due. They have started to add additional fees (Total is up to $900) and say that I can apply for a loan modification to take care of the fees. Or I would have to pay them. I ask how can I pay them when every attempt I make to pay the bill gets rejected. In the last two weeks I have received several documents stating that my payments would be accepted, in addition to speaking to several different representatives, account specialists, supervisors, and put concerns through their concern department. At this time, each time I call back I am given a different story and no resolution has been found. It appears at this point they are forcing my home into foreclosure and despite several attempts to pay my mortgage they are refusing to accept ANY FORM of payment from me!

Reduce principle to current market value, forgive penalties and fees created by their litigation, re-negotiate mortgage terms.They must be accountable for their part in creating the financial crisis, and give relief to all the mortgagees caught in these pooling and servicing agreements.  They must disclose the names and addresses of all the mortgagees that are part of the pooling and servicing agreement (Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, As Trustee Under Pooling And Servicing Agreement Dated As Of  July I , 2003 Morgan Stanley Abs Capital I Inc. Trust 2003-NC7).We want the investors and Ocwen to pay punitive damages for the pain and suffering they have caused in the lives of hundreds of families with their fraudulent financial practices. Why is this important? We have been trying to modify our loan since 2010, before we fell behind in our payments due to job lose.  The loan servicing company, (Ocwen) refused to tell us who owned the loan, stating that the investor (Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, As Trustee Under Pooling And Servicing Agreement Dated As Of  July I , 2003 Morgan Stanley Abs Capital I Inc. Trust 2003-NC7) would only deal with us through Ocwen.  We finally found the identity of the investor when we were served with foreclosure papers in 2011.  The investors knew that Ocwen has defrauded and exploited consumers (see http://www.worldlawdirect.com/forum/business-finance-law-issues/52457-problem-ocwen-can-i-sue-do-i-need-lawyer.html ) yet continues to hide behind Ocwen instead of negotiating with the Shadrick family.The 500+ page pooling and servicing agreement (between investor and Ocwen) was dated July 1, 2003 but was not signed until 2007.Neither the investors nor the Ocwen know the whereabouts of the original note.The investors and Ocwen have stalled, misdirected, and lied in order to steal our home.  Sending legal notices to the wrong address, directing us to seek assistance from the wrong government agencies, acting on requests as slowly as possible, and refusing to produce documents, transcripts, and information. We were following Ocwen’s instructions when we applied for their hardship program and made no payments until an appropriate figure could be reached.  We had a hardship agreement 3 years earlier so we were familiar with the action of delaying payment until a new figure could be reach.  When we contacted Ocwen with all the facts and figures they told us that we needed to pay all that was owed which was more than we had.  They refused a partial payment and have refused payments since that time, even though we could have made reasonable payments.  When we first contacted Ocwen to get back on track with our mortgage we were only 6 weeks behind.  They proposed the hardship program and then pulled the rug out from under us.  Once the foreclosure started the lawyers for the investors kept telling us that Ocwen would work with us to modify our loan.  I believe that this was a stalling tactic as Ocwen insisted that the investor was directing them not to modify the loan.  When I was finally able to speak with a representative from Ocwen and the investor’s lawyer at the same time we were dealt another body blow as we were informed that the investor’s lawyer was really Ocwen’s lawyer.  Ocwen is NOT named as a plaintiff on the suit.  When the person representing himself as the investor’s lawyer was confronted with this information, he confessed that since Ocwen was paying his firm, perhaps he was their lawyer too.  Is this not a conflict of interest?  Smoke and mirrors have plagued this entire situation.  We want answers.  We want relief.  We want accountability on the part of the investors and OcwenWhile our mortgage may be part of some crazy spaghetti mess of a pooling and servicing agreement with 499 other poor souls, our family is not just a number on a ledger of some big bank.

Fast forward two years, ten letters from collections about the ""missing"" payment and numerous conversations with Loss Mitigation service representatives, I got a job and paid it off two months early.  Eager to be done with that, I then get a letter that oops someone forgot to figure my escrow shortage while I was in Loss Mit. and I owed nearly 700.00.  So payment went up but was back to regular schedule.  Two days ago, another letter from Collections (?) was sent, exactly the same ones I got before except with dates changed.  Letter states my payments are two months past due, 0 late charges, and if I don't catch up before end of Oct. they may initiate foreclosure proceedings.  I actually paid both those months 15 days ahead of due date; a call to them confirmed this. I still questioned why this letter was sent and got stupid responses like ""it was on accident"" or ""you were not the only person who received it"". I pushed to talk to a higher person who was extremely rude and told me they knew I was not behind but this letter should be considered a ""soliticitation"".  Her example was when the bank sends me a soliticitation to buy insurance.  Certain customers receive these letters per her statement.  How they are certain who those customers are I don't know. I was speechless at that point, she could not give me any other reason, I was pretty sure I wasn't going to hear anything sensible so hung up. Sounds so much like other stories on here, someone should look into a class action suit against them.  It is outrageous for it to be legal, not to mention unethical, immoral, etc. to ""solicit"" anything in this way.  They put a blatant lie in writing and sent it to me, not just once but time after time.  The tone of the letter is scary for someone who doesn't understand to call about it and it is possible this could have resulted in people losing a home without it being necessary.  Anyone with insight into how to address this please let me know.           ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

I have several addresses for them & am trying to confirm the current physical for a Demand Letter. According to posts on national notary sites, this company is continuing to hiring notaries across the USA (who are independent contractors) w/no intent to pay--using telephone, fax, and the internet. This is a pattern of fraud that is currently being perpetuated against individuals who are themselves licensed, bonded, insured, background-screened, honest individuals who use their own resources to provide the services this company sells to its clients.  They are being paid by the client but not paying the little guy who did the actual service! Because we notaries are all across our great nation, we are being victimized.  We are trying to protect against this type of fraud by rating the companies we work for on national notary sites.  The Riverside County DA in California has had at least  1 complaint filed against another company practicing similar fraud against many notaries, in the amount of 5 figures known.  Across our nation, my guess is 6 figure fraud against individual Notaries Public, such as myself.

I asked for this confirmed to me in writing. [continued below]....
									
										..... I received a letter from Mr. Benjamin Yocca confirming their services and my savings. I paid Benjamin Yocca a retainer of $1750.00, quite literally all the money I had at the time. I Fed-Ex'd bank statements, taxes, pay stubs, financials etc., everything Benjamin Yocca asked for, to the AJM Mortgage office address: 1195 Washington Pike Suite 330 Bridgeville, PA 15017 Now I was notified by the FBI they are scamming seniors and those of us they need real help to save our homes for our children After one month of no communication, but constant contact from me, they finally were able to get me a Forbearance Agreement, for a ridiculous amount of money. Never mind that I had previously negotiated 2 other Forbearance Agreements, directly with my lender, and on my own. Benjamin Yocca needless to say, did nothing for me that I could not do myself. Over last year, I got an occasional one line e-mails saying they were working on it, yet my phone calls, e-mails, faxes and fed-ex's were never acknowledged. Ultimately, in desperation to hang onto my home, I filed a complaint with the FBI online services for white collar crime. I found out they have dozens of Complaints about Benjamin Yocca, and www.ajmmortgage.com Literally everyone that deals with Benjamin Yocca has the same story as myself.

 PNC Mortgage ,"  PNC Mortgage  3232 newmark drive, Miamisburg OH 45342 
Miamiasburg, Ohio USA ",, 800-283-7918,,"     I have lived in my house for almost 20 years. I refinanced in 2003 with national city mortgage. They were sold to PNC. In 2007 I was laid off my job and was out of work for 6 months, my new job paid almost half of what I was making. I got 3 months behind on my mortgage payments. Over the next several years I was put on repayment plans. I was paying anywhere from 100.00 to 300.00 a month over reg. monthly payments but never could get caught up. I was told to apply for a loan modification and they could put my late payments at end of loan.     I applied faxed my application. When I tried to make my monthly payment they said I couldn't because it was in modification and to put it away and pay when I get approved. They would tell me they had all paperwork then 2 weeks later they would need something else. I endded up refaxing paperwork like at least 5 different times then they sd they could not accept paperwork because was faxed at different times so I faxed everything again.  By then they sent it into foreclosure. They were a big help. Well we got turned down for modification but said we could go on a new repayment plan that would save it from foreclosure auction. I had to pay 2977.00 down and an additional 540.62 on top of my nomal mortgage payment for 11 months. If I made all these payments my loan would be current. My original cure amount was for approx 11,000 in march. I made down payment and the first 6 payments. I want to make my loan current so I asked for amount owed thinking it would be 540.62 X 5 more months and maybe 1000.00 in additional fees. I expected approx payoff of about 3000-4000.00. You know what they say I owe to make current 10,300.00. Their attorney sd tthis is what I owe. I've been making my payments for 7 months and I still owe as much now as I did in March. They are nothing but a RIP-OFF    I just filed  a complaint with attorney general. I ",  Mortgage Companies ,0
 Quicken Loans ,"  Quicken Loans  1050 Woodward Ave. 
Detroit, Michigan USA ",www.quickenloans.com, 800-283-7918,," I was in an online chat with a loan agent out of Quicken Loans' Arizona office.  We led the conversation with:   [Agent's Name]:  Please share with [my name].. what would you like to accomplish with your refinance? [My Name]:  I am looking to lower my monthly payment, get rid of PMI, not pay anything out of pocket and have a few bucks at the end. You know, all the good stuff. [Agent's Name]:  Absolutely! [Agent's Name]:  We will towards this today for you.     We then spent about an hour going over the details of my refi, credit, financials, etc.  I expressed my concerns about closing costs and she assured me there were none, that they were giving me a discount and that the remainder would be folded into the loan.  She also spent lots of time saying how qualified she was, how she was president's club, that Quicken ranked first in JD Power and Associates and that she's all about being up front and honest; basically why I should implicitly trust her and Quicken Loans.   Then at the end of this very long process and coming up with a loan solution that I felt good about, the canned message shows up.    [My Name]:  I want to move forward, BUT I'm about to sit down to tacos with my kids. [Agent's Name]:  aww. its easy to proceed. [My Name]:  So, how do we proceed later or tomorrow? [Agent's Name]:  I can secure this for you now, and we can go through your documentation tomorrow. [Agent's Name]:  There are no out of pocket expenses for you to refinance with us here at Quicken Loans- upon application we do accept a deposit in the amount of $500 to cover the costs of your out of pocket expenses, including your appraisal, up front. Then we apply that back to you at the closing table. It isn't a fee- it's just used for out of pocket expenses. Naturally, if we cannot get you initially approved based on the information you have provided me, then we do not charge you the deposit. I lock your rate and send you all the documents in black and white...We take Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Amex... [My Name]:  Can you explain that? [My Name]:  I need zero out of pocket, period. [My Name]:  No deposit, no credit back at closing. Nothing. [Agent's Name]:  Yes, to secure the loan and move forward we accept a commitment from you in the form of a good faith deposit. This helps cover the appraisal upfront. [Agent's Name]:  Once the loan closes, we reimburse backs towards the closing costs. [My Name]:  Welp, it'll need to wait then. [Agent's Name]:  Okay, [My Name]:  Caught me at a bad time. Not about to but another $500 on credit. Seems odd that a loan company would encourage that. [Agent's Name]:  It's actually quite standard. Last year we closed 70 billion in mortgages, so people are accepting of this. [My Name]:  That's okay. You found the one in 70 million that won't. [Agent's Name]:  I am sorry to hear that [My Name], but there needs to be a way to pay the appraiser. [My Name]:  Just doesn't work for me, right now. Doesn't matter what the guy next door does. [My Name]:  They do not cost $500 [Agent's Name]:  I am showing appraisal costs in your area are close to $460. [Agent's Name]:  [My Name], I am here to help you. When we secure a loan, this is part of our process. [Agent's Name]:  I am sorry if I caused any frustration. I was only trying to help. [My Name]:  Well, I started this very long conversation about me not wanting any out of pocket. [My Name]:  Maybe I wasn't clear [My Name]:  So anyway...thanks for the help. [Agent's Name]:  I am looking back at our conversation, and there was no mention. [My Name]:  Let me refresh you [My Name]:  ""[My Name]: I am looking to lower my monthly payment, get rid of PMI, not pay anything out of pocket and have a few bucks at the end. You know, all the good stuff."" [Agent's Name]:  Usually my clients still us the deposit and bring $0 to close. [Agent's Name]:  I am sorry if I misunderstood. T [My Name]:  Me too   I have some issues with my experience:    1. The canned message says that there are no out of pocket expenses, yet requires a deposit to cover out of pocket expenses.  This is deceptive.  Does the deposit come out of my pocket?  Yes it does.  Just calling something different does not change what it is: an out of pocket expense.  Even if it were returned or reimbursed to me 5 minutes later, it had to come out of my pocket first and therefore by definition is an out of pocket expense. 2. The agent spent an outsize amount of time generating rapport and trust with me.  Though she made NO mention of the deposit until the very end.  If not a ripoff, most definitely a waste of my time. 3. The agent also included scare tactics like this in the midst of the conversation: [Agent's Name]:  Before I spoke with my director I was about to let you know the rate was 5.125-5.25% with 4900 in costs. Your credit score causes some large adjustments. Most lenders right would not offer 4.75% fixed for only $3,900 in costs. Because the market has gone up over the past 2-3 months. We saw really slightly dip end of last week, but the market is very volatile right now. [My Name]:  Right. I believe it to be trending upwards. [Agent's Name]:  If your score drops anymore for any reason... [My Name]:  It won't. [Agent's Name]:  you might not even be able to qualify for refinance.   Bottom line: Beware of Quicken Loans.  The phrase ""No out of pocket expenses"" means something different to them than it does the entire rest of the universe. If they are willing to deceive about a $500 deposit, then I'm not interested in going any further.  Their loan terms are indeed attractive and their size/heft allows them to offer programs that a lot of other lenders simply can't.  However, Lenders don't get giant and huge by not closing deals.  They will seduce you.  They will make you trust them.  They will make you feel like an outcast for having a problem with something when a bajillion other customers are just fine with it. If you choose to do business with them, maintain a skeptical eye.    ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Boca Raton , Florida USA ",Richard@FoundationMortgage.Net, 800-295-5744,,"  On April 11, 2013 I went to Foundation Mortgage and spoke to Richard Malman to find out if I could get a mortgage for a housethat I found for sale. After Richard charged me for a credit report and reviewed my job history, my assets, and my bank statements and 2 years of tax returns, he told me I was qualified for a home loan. Over the next 45 days I delivered all the papers he requested and answered all his questions and re-answered most questions twice all the while he kept me assured that I was approved. A lot of additional questions needed to be answered because he failed to copy my information correctly and also said I should sell my other house through him to cover any costs and assured me it would be easier to do both sales through him. He started mixing up the paper work and causing incredible confusion and problems Somehow, he got my renters husband's cell phone number and had his appraiser calling asking him personnel questions and giving him personnel information. [continued below]....
									
										..... Initially, my dad wanted to be on the loan like on myhouse that I was selling. He assured me it would not be necessary and would be easier if dad wasn't on the loan. He wanted to close on both houses on the same day. He kept saying that we were on schedule and should close without delay after the 45 days. He charged me for an appraisal on 5-23-13 in the amount of $410.00 to my visa credit card. This amount was denied by my credit card due tothe fact that I never gave him authorization to charge it as I had just sent in my credit card payment. Then on 6-08-13 again without my authorization he charged it again for a higher amount in the amount of $520.00. I had plans to use my credit card as I was out of state traveling and was informed my credit card has reached its limit because he charged it without my authorization, again. He charged more this time as a kick-back scheme.  In the beginning of July I became suspicious of his ability to process the paperwork I provided. When I asked whether he would be available on a Friday to discuss why I keep getting Stihp sheets with recurring questions that I already answered he stated ""What's more important Mortgages or golf."" He then told me he would be there on Friday to discuss matters further. I received a phone call Thursday stating he will be unavailable due to an important golf game. At that point I felt he was maliciously causing me to go through a lot of leg work for nothing. On 7-1-13 my title company told me that they will help me to straighten out the problems he created. Up until the very last day before the closing all paperwork with the help of the lawyer's staff we provided and answered all the questions the loan processor asked. Mimi the lawyer’s assistant said there was no reason why we should not get the loan after answering all the questions. On 7-18-2013 one day before the closing I called the title company and they told me my loan was denied. Richard Malman then called a short time afterwards and he said that my previous employers said “not nice things about me”. Then he said ""it's your job history."" He saw my job history on the first day when I paid for the credit check and he said I was approved for a loan. After being told I was denied for the house loan Mimi the title lawyers wife informed me that I was previously denied by a different bank Malman had used. All banks/brokers go to the government for a loan why was I not told I had already been denied more  than once. He kept spreading around my money with no intention of ever getting me the loan.

 LOAN DEPOT ,"  LOAN DEPOT  26642 Town Centre Drive,  
Foothill ranch, , CA 92610 USA ",, 800-310-9229,," Sept 16th there was contact with Loan Depot agent Jon Morris. I applied for a Harp 2.0 loan. they sent gfe for a conventional loan but told me it was the same as a harp 2.0 which I found out was not true, they are not the same. I was asked for a $195 deposit and my credit card number. they said this was to prove I was serious in making application for refinance. Later I was told that I should not be surprised if I saw that there was a $495 charge pending on my card as that is the way the company does it and he did not know why.He assured me that they would never charge me this fee. The loan they said I was pre qualified for did not require an appraisal. (turns out many people have reported that this $495 fee was non refundable and was for an appraisal that they had done). Too many red flags over a couple days. I was high pressured to sign some documents and return immediately. I overlooked one page that said it was a fee for locking in a rate for 30 days. People do not usually pay anything up front to file a refinance application. I am dealing with a few other mortgage lenders to compare. As I was told not to worry about any charges to my card I signed unaware that it was a non refundable charge regardless of the outcome of the loan. I canceled my process when I realized there were too many mistakes and inconsistencies. I filed a dispute with my credit card amex and as I see that I did indeed sign a paper for the non refundable fee that was never told to me and just the opposite I am very upset that I may have to lose this amount of money to Loan Depot. They bait and switch and use deceptive practices all of which would be too much to write. I have consulted a lawyer, am planning to file a complaint with my state attorney general and any other legal remedy I can find. when I asked the person Karla Rivas who was doing the paper work whythere was an appraisal fee on the list of costs she said that was a mistake but did not rewrite it and take it off. Most people who have applied to Loan Depot usually put a $495 down for an appraisal fee. I do not require one. What is more important is i was told twice outright that I would never get the $495 charge on my credit card but with the fact that they slipped in that paper and told me it was to lock in loan and not change theri original promise of no 495 dollar fee I felt pressured and believed Jon Morris that he would keep his word. I am so sick to my stomach over all the shananagans that have gone on with this company. I am dealing with two other companies who would never charge me upfront for an application or to lock in an interest rate and may I say their rate was way to high for a harp or a coventional loan. They also charge over $500 more  than average for a title and they charge for origination fees that are not usually charged for a harp loan which is another reason it is not a harp loan but they keep insisting it is. Jon was very easy to talk to and very earnest and sincere except that is not how he operated and used that to deflect all the sneaky and deceptive and outright lying practices. Please just because someone seems nice and asks you to trust them do not. I do not know if I will be able to get this charge taken off my american express but I am so upset I got up to write this at 3pm in the morning. Please be very aware of the red flags out there. Asking for any money up front is a clear sign that something stinks. I plan to pursue this matter as far as I can take it. This is a warning that if a company does a few things that you question and then more, you should pay attention to this and do not believe things are going to get better because I have heard that things got much worse for people who were denied thier loans and not reimbursed for this fee that they say you won't be charged. Please don't anyone reply with I should have known better and not signed that paper. I know I should not have but when looking at the whole picture of a number of misinformation and mistatkes and errors Loan Depot made regarding the items I mentioned. and even more (they told me when I asked, that they do not know who the note belongs to that they are paying off to my loan servicer at Cenlar who got he loan from a mers freddie mac loan I originally obtained from Taylor bean and Whittaker in September 2008, That company was shut down and loan went to a servicer who represents I do not know who and when I asked Karla Rivas at Loan Depot if they would find out who actually owns the note she said they would never know. I asked how will I get a copy of note that says paid in full so that I do not put myself in jeopardy in case the real investor that seems to be a secret is not paid off. Please people wirte these experiences so that eveyone will know who to avoid. It was unfortunate I did not see many of these online complaints before I got in touch with Loan Depot. Do not be fooled by seemingly nice talk. without clear answers that make sense. thanks ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

First they never notified us (nor did Bank of America) that they were the new mortgagae holder, so we threw away their envelopes thinking it was junk. (We had paid B of A as always.) They began to call us harassing phone calls. We thought this was straightened out, but then it began again in August. We paid a month in advance (we pay by check) because we were going to be out of the country. They somehow couldn't find this payment so continued to harass us. Then they held the Sept. check and sent us letters saying we owed for two months and were in default. They notified the housing authority, who offered us advice on how to keep our house. Again, we have never missed a payment. One person said she ""found"" the payment but that it wasn't showing up in the right category?! The calls continue. We are afraid, now that we owe only for two more months and then we'll be free, that they somehow won't find ouf payments and will try to say we are in default.  After reading all these other complaints, we feel we must tell our attorney about this to ensure our rights and be free of this devilish company forever.

Additionally, Ocwen added fees arbitrarily and increased the interest rate they charged me on the loan by one full percentage point - without my knowledge or notification.  I realized it when looking over my statement, which I do very carefully each month now that I know what an awful company they are.  They did return loan to original interest rate after I disputed their right to do so.  But the point is...  this company practices criminal conduct as a regular part of their business plan.  Beware, leave asap.   I hope there is a class action lawsuit, I'd love to be party to it.  This company is despicable, I'd be embarressed to work for it.

Rapid City, South Dakota USA ",wwwgtservicing.com, 800-333-7023,,"  I initially had a mortgage under another company who sold my loan to Green Tree Servicing Company. Once I became acquainted with the new company (Green Tree), the representative would schedule a phone payment to be debited from my account for dates I had authorized. However, on the date that I had already authorized for the payment to be debited, they would try to obtain another payment the same day for the next month, and even say you were short for this month and we need your authorization to cover the shortage, this was the first time. The second time, I was told by the representative that I my outstanding payment was $1800, and told her she must be mistaken because I just sent you $1,000 and allii need to cover the payment was $400+, and I asked ""what happen to that amount""? She stated, there was a shortage and we will be sending $661 dollars back to you, because there was a shortage, and we need $300+ on the 30th of this month and if we can authorize 500+ on the 27th of the same month. These representatives main goal is to confuse defenseless home owners to default on their mortgages and take what they have worked so hard to maintain.

Grand Rapids, South Dakota USA ",www.gtservicing.com, 800-340-0473,,"  Since Green Tree has purcahsed the servicing of my loan from BAC, there has been nothing but illegal attempts to take money out of my pocket. This month, instead of my regular mortagage payment statement I received a statement that increased my monthly payment by $ 40. The payment is due in at the threat of late fees in 6 DAYS! No other finincial servicing company that I have ever dealt with presents you with an increase in payment without any explanation and functionally gives you no time to find out what is going on before you are slammed with late fees for non-payment. So, what is the $ 40 for?  Well, after 90 minuutes on the phone with GT, it turns out it is not for insurance ( my homeowners insurance actually went down this year) nor is it for taxes, which did not go up this year. It is for an ""Escrow Cushion"". That's right an Escrow Cushion. And what is that? Well, it turns out that is simply a rationalization to collect money that is not owed, as there is no reason for it to exist, except to make money for GT. What can you do? First, you can ask for an escrow waiver. An escrow waiver allows you to pay your own home owners insurance and taxes.Then, they have no reason to demand any money beyond principal and interest. You can also write your state AG with a written complaint, and ask them to contact Green Tree and ask them to legally justify each and every ""escrow cushion"" fee they are demanding of their clients, and force them to provide a 90-day advance notification whenever they plan to raise payments, which is how legitamate companies behave.

 Mark Pease @ First Commerce Credit Union ,"  Mark Pease @ First Commerce Credit Union   
Tallahassee, Florida USA ",www.firstcommercecu.org, 800-487-4916,," I am a realtor here in Tallahassee Florida with very strong relationships with local title agencies. The mortgage manager at First Commerce Credit Union has not once took the blame upon himself when closings go very wrong. The Real estate agents with experience and common sense along with title agents knows it not always the processors, closers or even the loan officer fault but take ownership for your team. For example, when a team has a bad game or season they move around some or bench some players or remove them from the roster. When the team have another bad season and the owner or in this case senior leadership need to look at replacing the coach or manager. Here is a list of True facts from realtors and title agents: 1. His name is Mark Pease and he doesn't like to return calls but will send a lengthly email 2. If he get around to calling he dominates the conversation with the same speech as before (yes, it happen before) 3. The closer or person who sends the HUD asks questions like its her first month on the job 4. The loan officer (female) has a hung up on a client and the Good Faith Estmate changes let's not go there.  But this make me wonder who is the leader. 5. The title agents says the underwriting is not done here locally 6. One agent said the mortgage manager Mark Pease never called her client back and ""that person"" works at the credit union. So ""that person"" went to a local bank as instructed by an employee at the credit union. 7.  Another agent said another client that works at the credit union was so upset that the mortgage manager doesn't return calls and when they did speak it was in a tone that ""she"" should have known how the mortgage process works. Yes, she was a first time home buyer ....... So if players tell other interested players not to play for this coach maybe the coach need to be replaced. 8. Ask Jerry Osteryoung who is the Chairman of the Board about his experience with Mark Pease  boardofdirectors@FirstCommerceCU.org 9. Ask employee Park Broome about his experience with Mark Pease 10. Ask Ric Holified (realtor) he said just complain or threaten not to send business and you will get what you want or someone fired. I revealed his name because he did and continually does unethical business arrangements and i am very surprised that someone at FCCU approved his loan. In which he braggs about and can't believe it himself. 11. Lastly, Mark Pease Mortgager Manager/Coach/Leader is it true that you approved a realtor loan based on the possibly that they will send you future business and a commission income from prior years but not recent 2 years?    First Commerce Credit Union need to change coaches if you want to survive in the purchase business.   Realtor, Tallahassee Unknown     ",  Mortgage Companies ,0
 WJ Bradley Mortgage Capital ,"  WJ Bradley Mortgage Capital  16885 W Bernardo Drive Suite 290 
San Diego, California USA ",www.wjbradley.com, 800-552-3000,," I would like to explain my experience with WJ Bradley as I was with the company from August 2011 until August of 2013. After being a very loyal employee and top producer I have seen the beginning and end of WJ Bradley and want all new prospective or current employees to understand what I went through so they don’t make the same mistake. During the first 8 months of my employment at WJ Bradley it was great, they were still a smaller organization and they really put the loan officers first. Over the course of my employment they acquired smaller broker shops to come aboard as WJ Bradley and then found some larger ones which really affected how the company operated. When HARP 2 came out and when they acquired Legacy and Emery Financial was really when the company changed gears. Below are a few things that they changed for ONLY the ones who worked at smaller shops: (Remember we started with the company and were the truly loyal ones).  Underwriting turn times went from 16 business hours to sometimes over 15 business days! We were unable to submit a loan without it being locked and the appraisal back in on refinances. Purchases we had to have the loan locked, appraisal was not required back to submit the loan at this time. Lock Extensions? Good luck getting one of those credited to you because it was the companies fault. They would find any reason in the book to say it was your fault rather than their insane turn times which caused the extension. I maybe was able to get a couple locks extended with the cost of the company and I was one of their top producers ranked in the top 50 loan officers month after month. Overlays, overlays, overlays – they would have these stupid rules unlike any other lender which prevented you from funding the loans. They were more concerned with the price they were able to sell the loans on the secondary market and wanted “perfect loans.” Many of my clients ended up getting funded from a different company that actually worked under the guidelines. INTEREST RATES! There is an extreme amount of competition between branches and corporate and most of the larger branches had better pricing than the smaller ones. Why? Because they did more volume and were able to secure a better bottom line than the other branches. This created competition even locally between branches and should never be the case. We shouldn’t be competing against the same company; it only causes problems down the line. These are just a few of the reasons I decided to leave WJ Bradley and it seems like I left at the right time!   Now to explain what happened to me both during and after my resignation/termination with WJ Bradley. I worked in the Rancho Bernardo office which Rick Sidley was the branch manager and Nick (Dominic) Carcioppolo was the “Operations Manager” who really didn’t do much. Rick Sidley was rarely in the office and still to this day I can’t understand what Nick was doing there besides creating these really colorful spreadsheets. How did this help our business, I have absolutely no idea and I know for a fact he was paid an ungodly salary for this. This caused an extreme amount of turmoil in our office bringing Nick on board. I have to say that this was the end of our group, not because he was a bad guy but more because of what transpired after he was hired. We had two teams at this branch, what you would call Inside Loan Officers who took leads and Outside Loan Officers which brought in their own business like me. The Inside loan officers did not like the way that Nick Carciopollo was managing them and that team diminished extremely quick, within a couple months of his start date over ¾ of that team left for other companies. In the meantime I was still hanging on because I believed in WJ Bradley Mortgage Capital. From January until the date that I left in August we lost over 28 employees and were only down to about 6-7 people left, 4 of them being loan officers. During my course of employment with WJ Bradley: I ruined almost every single one of my realtor relationships. Not once did I close a purchase on  time (and I dare you WJ Bradley to prove me wrong) Got absolutely no support with what I needed, built my business completely on my own Lost 2 amazing personal assistants, one because they called out the flaws to help which the branch manager didn’t like and the other because the branch “couldn’t afford her” but COULD afford someone making a 6 figure salary that did nothing but create spreadsheets. Worked for someone who was a compulsive liar, cheater and thief that would come up with a new idea to generate business every day rather than sticking with what worked. Processing was a nightmare, these people would go out on smoke breaks every 15 minutes, never get work done and lie about what they were supposed to get done. Turns out one of the processors was working for another company on the side and was never fired even though Rick Sidley was aware of this going on for months. I never knew how good a processor could really be until I joined the company I’m with now. Illusions that there was an overage account that I could use towards marketing, I never saw anything of this nature. Assistants were lied to and didn’t get the bonuses they were promised, my assistant started out below minimum wage and remained that way for almost a year. Most of the time they had to fight just to get their bonuses and reach out to corporate to make sure it was taken care of. What happened after I gave my notice of resignation? Was terminated the day after I gave my notice when Rick Sidley led me to believe it was in his best interest for me to remain employed until my start date with the new employer. The day I was driving into the office (not knowing I was being terminated) I received a phone call from one of the other WJ Bradley branches who said “Erik, SO I can FINALLY talk to you now” – This was from David Lippe & Mark Schellhaus with the Consumer Direct division who I researched months earlier and even sent them a few deals just to see how they operate (of course never getting paid). They tried to recruit me to their branch and said “Erik, so should I hold onto your termination” – I said “Sure, why not!” – In the back of my head I was thinking “Are you guys crazy? Do you really think I want to be a part of this organization of lies and deceit? This phone call I received was before I had any idea what I was walking into that day at work, and of course as soon as I walk in the door, half of the processors are fired, another branch manager quit, my assistant and I were both told to pack up our things and leave. Did I get paid on my deals funded after I left from WJ Bradley? No, I was led to believe that I would get paid on all my deals that funded after I left as long as they were within 30 days of my resignation which was mentioned specifically in my contract of employment. After calling multiple times the only answer I received until recently was “You will get paid under the terms of your contract” – 3 weeks went by and I didn’t see a dime and called HR back again, where’s my money? Laurel Timmons with HR at WJ Bradley Mortgage Capital informed me over the phone that I will NOT be getting paid on anything that funded after I left the company. Oh Really?!?!? This is not what my employment contract stated and I will be pursuing not only labor board but also federal labor lawsuits against them as it’s not a small amount of money, quite large in fact. Rick Sidley promoted working overtime but specifically stated that he would not pay overtime. Rick Sidley is actively pursuing my old clients by calling them and e-mailing them as he was recently demoted from branch manager to loan officer as they finally understood his management skills were lacking in quality and experience. He is now grabbing for straws, I know this for a fact because not only did my client reach out to me but I also sent a mock e-mail to see if he would call me back acting as a new client and of course he did! All in all Rick Sidley and WJ Bradley Mortgage Capital are a bunch of crooks and if you are a current or prospective employee, run for the hills! Make sure to close out your pipeline before you leave and make no mention that you’re leaving before you do that otherwise they will absolutely try and take advantage of you. They unfortunately picked on the wrong guy this time and I hope this information spreads as you need to be aware of who you’re working with. Feel free to contact me directly about this post as it’s the complete truth and I have documentation to support my claims, in no way is this false advice or inaccurate information.

His behavior over the last 8 weeks is typical ""bait and switch,"" in that false promises and representations were made, there was a rush to wire money, then came a massive runaround for weeks ending in no product (and almost losing our property), extreme difficulty in getting refunded (we still have not, as of September 10, 2013), and finally the victim is blamed by the perpretrator who asks not to be contacted anymore about a refund. This man is a pathological liar. I would advise even my worst enemy to stay away from him!

The appraisal was never conducted. Falsely portraying himself as the funder, Mr. Tomasi offerred loan terms and a bogus conditional loan approval.

Accordingly, we provided everything to his processsing department that was stipulated on his due diligence ""needs list,"" even though we were originally told it was essentially a no docs loan. He wanted 80 pages of documentataion. After we submitted everything, he kept asking for more and more. When we finally figured out that he was NOT a lender, just another broker, and that the real funder had not been contacted about us and had never received our due diligence docs, we began to ask hard questions. In eight weeks, he only picked up his phone four times. Getting to call him back was ALWAYS a challenge. Finally, he stopped answering his phone altogether, and cleverly used Email with false promises saying he would in fact call us later, and then never did. He began to call us unreasonable in our need to find out more information about the true lender, and then blamed us for being irrational and providing enough verification. Ultimately, the loan was denied by the true funder (who only received a smattering of our original support docs) as it wasn't a fit for them. We signed the preliminary loan approval agreement on June 27, 2013. It is now September 10, 2013, and we have NEITHER appraisal, $3750 refund for our appraisal, or a loan. His delay and run around tactics continued as we asked for a refund. We submitted multiple requests for that he provide us with trackable documentation about how and when our refund was supposedly sent. He said the check was mailed ""on Thursday,"" then he said ""on Friday."" However, he WOULD not provide a check #, bank information, who signed the check, how much it was written for, or a photo of the check stub showing the funds were deducted from his account. He continued to make us out as crazy and unreasonable, and threated to call the local police department if we kept contacting him.  We finally threatened to contact the Connecticut State Attorney General's office if he did not provide the requested information. We did. We said if, on the next day, we did not recieve trackable documentation about how and when our refund was sent, we would submit a complaint to the Certified Financial Planner Board. When we called the CFB board, we found out he is not even listed as a Certified Financial Planner, even though he puts himself out there as such. We said if, on the next day, we did not recieve trackable documentaiton about how and when our refund was sent, we would submit a complaint to the Better Business Bureau.  We said if, on the next day, we did not recieve trackable documentation about how and when our refund was sent, we would submit a complaint to ""RIP OFF Report"" and every other similar Internet site, warning people about doing business with him. We said if, on the next day, we did not receive documentation about how and when our refund was sent, we would sue him for fraud. He would not only be liable for the $3750, but for any property loss because of time delays, and pain and suffering.  Stiill, no refund or verification about a refund.  This man is BAD NEWS.   ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Oklahoma City, Oklahoma USA ",, 800-669-6650,," I see that I have joined a continuing chorus of protest against Midland Mortgage, their poor, uninformed customer service (if it my be categorized as such!), and other outrageous conduct! My mortgage was sold by Citibank to Midland a few years ago without any particular notice or other information about that company. All seemed to be ok until I applied to do a short-sale, and in the process, missed a payment. Now, while trying to play catch-up, I attempted to use the online pay option on their website, but was denied because I was delinquent by a month. On calling to inquire about this, I was told that that payment method was a privilege, and because I was a month behind it was withdrawn! The obsurdity of this abounds! For a company that seems to focus entirely on getting their money, I find it ridiculous that they would penalize someone who is trying to pay by removing this most expeditious means of paying!!

West Palm Beach, Florida USA ",www.ocwen.com, 800-669-6650,,"   My mortgage had been obtained thru GMAC & I have been paying the monthly payments without incident for 9yrs. Four years ago, I did a loan modification with GMAc for a lower rate & have continued payments without incident. Two months agoI received news that GMAC was going to give my mortgage to Ocwen. I have been making my usual monthly payments to Ocwen, the same payment amount we have been making to GMAC since remortgaging 4 years ago. Now I receive a notice from Ocwen that states my mortgage payments are now around $200 a month more. I called, trying to find out why the change in payments, as our insurance & taxes have not gone up at all. Their representative could not give me any satisfactory answers, first claiming that our insurance or taxes must have gone up, then stating that this was the payment we had been making prior to them taking over the mortgage. I called back again & asked why all this misinformation on their part. The representative insisted that their information was correct & that I must be mistaken as to when I first got & redid my mortgage, along with how much I have been paying. I demanded to speak with a supervisor, which the representative claimed that it would be a 45 minute wait. I told him that wasn't acceptable. When pressed repeatedly for the location of their offices, the representative hemmed & hawed for quite a while before finally stating that the head office was located in the Idaho & the call center in the Phillipines. Not receiving any satisfactory assistance from these people, I then went online to research them. After seeing how many complaints & lawsuits have been started against them, one a class action suit settled out of Court in Connecticut in 2002, I have decided to contact my realtor, sell my home & stop this scam from collecting any money from me unjustly.  I'm going to continue to make my original payment amount that I was making with GMAC until it sells.

 Ocwen Mortgage ,"  Ocwen Mortgage  1661 Worthington Road 
West Palm, Florida USA ",Ocwen.com, 800-696-8199,,"  I have been dealing with a complete nightmare with Ocwen for approximately 5 years ever since my Mortgage was sold to them by Equity Resources.  Everytime I turn around they are adding fees increasing escrow and putting payments in a suspense account but never have full explanation as to why.  I have opened payment disputes and payment research with them, but I always get the run around. Approximately 1.5 years ago, I entered into a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to protect myself from losing my house and Ocwens fraudulent charges.  This did not help with anything, they continued to raise payments which then in turn raised my bankruptcy plan payment and put my expenses to high according to the bankruptcy court to stay in a plan.  We modified the plan and then Ocwen guaranteed me if I would voluntarily dismiss the bankruptcy (yes I know I should have never trusted them) that they would get me in a modification and they would not file a foreclosure. Not long after this I was served with the complaint in foreclosure. Ocwen is claiming that they have not recieved any payments in the last 16 months. I have a printout from the bankruptcy trustee proving otherwise and of course Ocwen cannot explain where these payments are or why they were not credited to my account. For the last three weeks I have been in a Hamp Modification Application process with them.  Every single day (of course I have to call them to find this out) they need another document that they claim they didn't recieve. I have faxed the full application to them 3 times and have fax confirmations and I have emailed it once, and they continue to need a certain document yet again because they didn't recieve it.  I was instructed 4 days ago it was in underwriting. I called today to follow up to find out that it was kicked out of underwriting because on one document my signature and my husband's signature looks similar.  They said he had to call and confirm that he did in fact sign the document. We were given a number to call and after asking 3 different times if there was a certain extension or person we needed to talk to and being told 3 times no, my husband called and of course without an extension or name, he cannot talk to anyone and is being told the loan is no longer in the system. I have read numerous complaints on Ocwen and am beside myself that they are still in business and allowed to perform business in the manner they do. Not only is it a nightmare trying to figure anything at all you cannot understand anyone you talk to.  It is my understanding they are a global company and I have to talk to whomever I am connected with, I find this odd since they are headquartered in West Palm Beach, Florida in the United States but we cannot talk to somebody who speaks fluent english.

Lewisville, Texas USA ",www.mynationstarmtg.com, 800-716-2936,,"  Due to unforeseen circumstances in which I take full responsibility for my mortgage fell behind several months. I began receiving foreclosure notices from the mortgage company as well as a law firm. I contacted the mortgage company to review my alternatives, I was told that there were no options but to pay the past due mortgage along with a large dollar amount due to the law firm handling the foreclosure. I explained to the mortgage representative that I was able to pay the past due mortgage however the large dollar amount of attorney fees was preventing me from paying the total amount due. She stated she contacted the law office and was informed that the amount she sent and quoted me was the amount the law firm quoted her. I asked her to send me a breakdown of the amount due she sent me a very detailed email outlining the amount total amount due along with deadline to pay to prevent the foreclosure. After raising the money to have my mortgage reinstated I called the mortgage company and spoke with the same representative who informed me the amount she stated still was good and I was to send the certified funds to her. I decided to call the law firm the same day I was to send the reinstatement payment to the mortgage. I was informed by them they were not contacted by the mortgage company regarding the charge that should be added to my reinstated amount. The mortgage company advised me I had to pay $4777.59; the actual amount due per the law firm was $3333.12. The legal fees were only $50 and I was consistently quoted legal fees in the amount of $1502.48. You can imagine how upset I was to learn that I could have possibly lost my home due to the negligence of the mortgage company and their representative. Please help me, was this fraud, was I being scammed, how many families have lost their homes due to this incompetence. I am reaching out to you in hopes that you hear my story and somehow bring right to the wrong that was done to me.

I also asked why I was not informed of this fee prior to choosing the fax option.  Well....they had no answer for me on that one.  Basically said that each state is different and that in FL they can charge $50 to fax a payoff.

Our agent contacted green Tree with the routine paperwork. After a month,Green Tree sent us a letter informing of lack of proof of insurance. I called their customer service and was told they never recieved a fax from my insurance agent. The very same day, my agent and I faxed the required paperwork again. Few weeks later, we recieved another letter from greenTree that they still didn't have my insurance proof. Called them again, got the fax # and faxed papers again. Few days later called them again and was told that they did not have insurance proof.,was given fax # and faxed it again. When talking to customer service, I got all the way to the ""supposedly "" insurance department manager and was given another fax #. Faxed papers again. Month later, we recieved another latter from green Tree stating that because of the lack of proof of insurance, they bought a policy for us for ""only"" $2600, and the amount will be taken out of escgrow. Called my agent again and arranged a call with GreenTree, when the matter was apprently settled once and for all. Green Tree informed me later that they will return the money paid  to their insurance carrier to the escgrow account and pay my agent instead (my insurance is about 25% of what their insurance charged).I thought the matter was over with, but no.Month later, we got the letter informing us that we are short on our exgrow and we must pay $218 immediataly. Called them again with obvious question why when paying on time every time  with my taxes and insurabce not increasing I have $218 shortage. I was told that because the above mention $2600 payment to their insurance, the escgrow was short and all will be back to normal and eventually escgrow will show the surplus. I paid the amount over the phone (it was due the next day) and was charged $12 for doing so. Now, we recieved standard notification of paid taxes, but on the bottom of the letter it says that ""This communication is from debt collector"". What is also strange, my account # on the letter is incorrect, name and address is OK. I called Green Tree automated account info line and found out that i still owe them $218 of missing escgrow. Talked to customer service again and was told that scgrowe is still short and i have make that payment, otherwise account would deliquent. Started looking through all the monthly billing statements and found that one of them, under Account Information Since last payment portion is missing principal amount and interest amount, the spaces are simply blank (the date on that one coincides with all the escgrow problems). Without going into details, I can't account for any missing/unpaid amount. Called Green Tree and asked for explanation of incorrect account # on the letter and missing amounts paid on the bill. I was told that in both cases this was a misprint. Also, every statement we got has incorrect amount due. It is always at least double what the mortgage amount is. green Tree told me that the statement never reflects what was paid last month. The last statement  lists may actual mortgage amount, plus $200 and amount due equals double that plus some change. This company is not even able to produce proper bill for once, misprints(omits) the most important part of the bill (amount paid last time) and wants me to believe that my escgrow is constantly short without ever once sending me a full escgrow reimbursment statemant for which I asked repeatedly. I belive that bjuying insurance policy without informing the customer is illegal and besides, i never recieved either the policy # or any other information regarding the homeowners insurance they allegedly bought without my knowledge. All this seems like a premedited scam, trying to extract more than customer owes every month, created late fees ,confuse and obfuscate..

 Nationstar Mortgage ,"  Nationstar Mortgage   
Irving, Texas USA ",www.nationstar.com, 800-746-2936,,"  To whom it may concern: I am requesting a full investigation be conducted on NationStar mortgage in regards to their insurance, tax and escrow department as a pursuant to an unacceptable situation that occurred to the aforementioned Mortgagee, Shanikqua Y. Sharp.  I received a letter on Saturday 8/17/2013 indicating that my insurance company canceled my insurance and that I need to provide Nationstar with updated insurance information. This request was puzzling, because due to our contract, we have to have an escrow account for our insurance and taxes. I called NationStar and inquired about the letter and was told that I need to contact my insurance company and find out why they would not accept payment. However upon deeper investigation and speaking with my insurance company, I have not had homeowners insurance since 8/10/2012. Last year Nationstar sent the insurance payment to the wrong insurance company and the funds were returned on 8/28/2012. On 9/7/2012 I was contacted by my insurance and was informed that my insurance payment had not been paid by the mortgage company.  I was told by the insurance company that if they received payment by 9/10/2012 then it could be reinstated. I called Nationstar and informed them of the situation and was told that they are so sorry, and it was in the system that the payment sent on 8/10/2012 but was returned. However I was never contacted in this regard.  I then proceed to give Nationstar the information to send the payment over night to the insurance company. I called Nationstar back the next day to verify that payment was sent, I  was told to check the website to verify that the payment had been posted.  I checked every day for a week and it finally indicated that posted that it was paid on 9/10/2012. At this point I thought our insurance had been paid.  Last week, after speaking with 15 different associates, supervisors and customer service specialist, escalation team, and wasting 15 hours in three days, nothing was done.  I had to secure my own insurance and paid out of pocket  $2021.00 despite the fact that per contractual agreement it would be paid via escrow which has a balance of $7491.93 (I doubt that it is correct). I requested that my entire escrow be cancel and refunded check sent for the entire amout. back. I was told that it would be overnighted which was 3 business days. Today 8/26/2013 I received a letter indicating that due to the contractual agreement I could not be refunded my escrow and I could not cancel the escrow and be responsible for paying my insurance and taxes myself, seeing that for the last two years nationstar was not capable of adhering to their part of the contract. I feel that it was a breach in contract and due to nationstars negligence my request should be granted.  Their pitch line is “As a valued borrower, your satisfaction is our Top priority”, this is a lie and they have given me the run around for the last week. This has caused me to become ill and missed time from work. I feel as though I have been inconvienced enough and nationstar is not a company that lives us to their word. More than that they should be investigated for fraud, I have read the many complaints and it seems to be the same thing with most of the complaints. Moreover, the entire team has conducted themselves with poor customer service, and failure to provide timely resolution in handling the above case. After several attempts trying to speak directly to a Supervisor for refund of my escrow to obtain an updated status on my claim and a timely resolution, I was told today by an employee that they lied and that I will not be refunded my escrow.  As a Mortgagee, I am entitled to contact NATIONSTAR Mortgage LLC with any questions/concerns I may have regarding my mortgage or any pertinent case regarding my property. I have had several problems with Nationstar’s horrible customer service in the past but this latest one takes the prize and I am ready to take action: I have contacted CNN news, ABC news, NBC news and writing a letter to my senator, congress and the president.   I am a Disabled veteran and this is also affecting my health condition; As a citizen of the United States I know all my constitutional rights; Nationstar crossed the line and what your employee’s did to me is against the law, I am not going to allow Nations tar’s employees to put me on hold for two hours due to the fact that they did not want to handle my customer service issue. I feel as though I have been inconvenienced enough at this point. This situation has been poorly handled and unreasonably delayed. The Loss Draft Department failed to conduct due diligence in resolving my claim. The assigned representative handling the claim and her manager have worked in Bad Faith, and the customer service rendered is unacceptable for a mortgage company of your caliber.  I am sending copies of this letter to my State General Attorney and Congressmen. I will also open a group on Facebook and Twitter to tell my story and will post a video on YouTube soon. I will also make a complaint on www.complaintsBoard.com (which by the way has already almost 500 complaints against your company), www.ripoffreport.com (mine is going to be # 100 something) and I am willing to sue Nationstar over my rights and how this is affecting me my financial situation and my health condition as a disabled veteran.

I refinance for interest rate reductions from 8.75% to2.95% mortgage went from $ 612.00 A MONTH to $ 876.00 and GFE Went to $3,000 TO $6,300 I find this ludicrous. When lawyer got here he blindly said sign here you know the drill. I will bet my life we never signed a $6,300 GFE . I read papers and called what I thought was Citimortage to cancel the contract. The guy was to do that and he also stated he would be sending the check back that I gave him. It never came.So now my escrow is short again .When we refinance our escrow disappeared. They also doubled flood and homeowners insurance coverage it was $60.000 we were paying on now we pay on $130.000 on each . There answer to me was Obama made these changes when everyone was underwater with there mortgage I was never late and we paid faithfully. I am paying for there bad loan practice and the fines that Citimortage had to pay.. I Pray for the news or Press To Contact Me I would love the world to know what a scam they are playing and abusing the consumer. I am very angry . I owe $58,000 . This is and is a continuing bad raw deal .trust me every underwriters at fema . Citimortage. And homeowners insurance coverage. I think my next step will be lawsuit and real estate lawyer . They are sending me letters saying there going to charge me high interest for the $382.00 doesn't that make them robbers one would think they have bigger fish to fry than a little honest faithful consumers who owes stinking $58,000 that should be chump change to them after there fines and bad financial ruins to many consumers . So now I get threatened letter for higher interest rate if they have to pay it for me. Where did the $6,300 go??? ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Dallas, Texas USA ",www.NationstarMtg.com, 800-766-4622,," My mortgage was sold by Bank of America to Nationstar Mortgage in June 2013.  My husband and I had been in our home since January 2007 with the same interest rate and same monthly payment since purchase. Our original mortgage company was NationPoint Mortgage who sold the loan to Bank of America.  Anyway one month after our first payment, which was the same as it had always been, to Nationstar, we recieved notice that our payment was increasing by $206.15 effective September 1, 2013 while our interest rate remained the exact same as the original.  I was baffled by this and called.  When I spoke to customer service, I was put on extremely long holding periods while they supposedly looked into my loan.  I was transferred to four different people and none of which could explain why my mortage payment increased. Finally I was told that my account had to be reviewed by an account specialist and I would be contacted in 7 days. Well two weeks passed and that call never came, but a statement came in the mail reflecting the new payment.  This prompted me to call back.  When I called, I was given the same run around that I was given the first time, but the last representative, Beverly employee #771709, told me that my payment increase because there was an increase in the principal and not the interest rate on my loan. I have never known of the principal of a loan being increased without an increase in interest rate.  I am no expert, but this sounds illegal to me.  I demanded a copy of my note be mailed to me, and I will be visiting an attorney.  All of the persons that I spoke with seemed very inexperienced.  Terrible business!

Loan Depot requested detailed information about deposits made to our checking accounts and when they changed the amounnt of the loan and we sent them a cashier's check to pay down our present loan, they cashed the check then asked for detailed documents of where the deposits came from.  Loan Depot changed the mortgage company on our home insurance policy with their name before any payoff was made or the loan closed.  They changed the amount of the loan on June 7, 2013 locking in 2.75% interest for 45 days.  Although we met all their superfluous requests on July 14, 2013, they changed the interest rate to 3.375%.  That is 3 days before the lock in expired.  We then rejected the new rate.  Loan Depot requested we ""prove"" that our pensions were for ""life"".  On bank statement they required even the ""work page"" of the statement.  The required flood insurance even though we are not in a flood zone and Loan Depot would not provide us documents to show we were in a flood zone.  We signed closing papers on June 24, 2013 and the underwriters still requested many documents to delay the process.  The underwriters were impossible to satisfy and work with.  We realized that Loan Depot was just delaying so the lock in rate could be changed and we challenged them on that fact.  On July 16, 2013 a couple of their representatives apologized for the outcome and ""acted"" embarrassed.  All we can say is people BEWARE    BEWARE   BEWARE of LOAN DEPOT.  In fact, run away from them.   ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Irving, Texas USA ",https://www.gohomeward.com/servicing/home.asp, 800-909-9525,," In 2004, I’d reached out to Columbia National’s Loss Mitigation department because I fell behind on mortgage payments due to a divorce. As a result we’d agreed on a Loan Modification which included a Special Forbearance. Years later, 2007, now known as American Home Mortgage (AHM), begin returning payments after I’d inquired about the status of my loan because by now, I should have received a letter stating my loan is back on track and Loss Mitigation was no longer required. Seems someone dropped the ball – sort of speak – and either did not complete the paperwork, did not properly file it, or lost them. This, due to regular communication between self and case manager, seems odd. To this day, I was never given a clear reason, what happened to the agreement. Since 2007 I’ve been told (and have proof) everything from a document was not sign to they did not receive the loan modification initial down payment…from they did not receive payments for approximately 2-years but unsure why foreclosure proceedings were not filed during this time…and so on. To add insult to injury, each proof of payment I’ve submitted AHM would say, “That was applied toward the year before.” Eventually, they’d settled with you would have to prove every payment since purchasing the home in 1998. By early 2010, I was placed on a short term disability from long time employer due to stress, anxiety, and depression, then long-term disability, and now Social Security disability. Even though, outlandish financial claims were made equity remained in my home, and at time of foreclosure, I had the home up for sale. Although I was giving up on the fight (to save my sanity and out of finances) AHM/Homeward Residential foreclosed.   I’ve made many attempts to rectify this situation to no avail and was forced out of my home. Now known as Homeward Residential, at the time of foreclosure they claimed I owed approximately $35,000. Several months after foreclosure, I’d received documents from Ocwen Loan Servicer with updated financial information indicating I owe approximately $20,000 less. The documents clearly show the adjustments but after numerous attempts to get clarity AHM said that somehow Ocwen was sent my information and the loan has not been corrected or reinstated. This company forced me out of my home, caused me my job and sanity, ignored my many attempts, and simply stole my home. ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Davenport, Iowa USA ",https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/, 800-930-7334,," We were a few months behind on our mortgage and we entered into a forebearance aggreement with Wells Fargo home mortgage. We made each of those payments on time with a balloon payment made at the end as agreed upon. We were up to date on our mortgage after this and then received a notice that our home was in foreclosure due to ""not having made a payment in 12 months"". When we contact Wells Fargo home mortgage to try to straighten out this issue we were given a false fax number to fax in our receipts to. Upon further phone calls I was told that Wells Fargo did not want to see our receipts and they argued that we had not paid our payments and they also stated there never was a forebearance agreement. We were able to get a lawyer through help legal aid and Wells Fargo dropped the foreclosure proceedings when the lawyer called for an audit of the account. Our lawyer stopped working for help legal aid and there was no longer a mortgage attorney with the practice and we could not afford to hire a lawyer to help us. Foreclosure was filed again, being filed by U.S. Bank under the claims that they had purchased our mortgage. Upon phone calls to Wells Fargo I was repeatedly informed that US Bank did not purchase our mortgage, Wells Fargo still had our mortgage, and I was assured that we were not in foreclosure. To make a long story short, we had a court date where US Bank was attempting to finalize the foreclosure. This was done in Judge's chambers with a attorney for US Bank on the telephone. The judge asked if we had any proof in our defense, but when we got out our folder to show him all our receipts the judge told us he did not have time to look at that and the foreclosure was granted to US Bank. We were given six months to vacate the home. We moved out by the date specified by the court, however we received a bill for the next years home insurance from Wells Fargo. When I called to ask why we are receiving a bill for insurance on a home that has been foreclosed on I was again informed that our home was not foreclosed on and US Bank did not hold the mortgage to our home and did not have any legal rights to foreclose on our home. Through this time that we had been moved out of the home there was no electricity to the home therefore no sump pump running and we had several heavy rain storms which left the basement full of water which caused black mold. The house was no longer livable and we have not been able to afford the retainer fee to hire a lawyer to help us with this situation. Due to all of this our family has all had to split up and stay with different people, our credit has been destroyed, the stress has led to my husband having a heart attack and me not being able to finish my college education due to no longer being able to obtain loans. I don't know how US Bank was able to get away with this if they had no legal right to the home and did not own our mortgage.  ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Month after month i was told to fax and re- fax information, i have to drive to my local library to send fax and i sent so many over these past months that the Librarian now calls me by my first name when i walk in the door. Just recently I was told by Citimortgage that unless i can have my ex-husband sign a hardship affidavit i do not quilify for modification, i don't understand why they told me in the beginning i could get modification without his signature and then change the rules mid-stream. they know that the relationship between me and my ex-husband was an abusive one and it would be dangerous for me to contact him for any reason, and also for my son who is disabled  yet  they continue to ask me to do so. I was told that maybe he would sign because it affects his credit, but as i explained to them many times, he cannot be contacted, but yet they continue to give me reasons why it would be ok to contact him I talked with someone in the exceleration department today. i'm not sure what that is exactly, but he said my ex-husband may be concerned about this on his credit so i should think about that and maybe he might want to sign. I ask him if i were to contact my abusive ex-husband and he agreed to sign, then he killed me, could my family then sue his company for recommending this, his only comment was ""I'm not answering that question"". I also ask why i was told before that i didn't need his signature and he said because the rules changed recently Not only did CitiMortgage let me down on the promise of a modification but now they are telling me i do not quilify for a repayment plan or deferrment, so i have to catch up all payments before the end of August or they will begin forclosure.

 Quicken Loans ,"  Quicken Loans   
Detroit, Michigan USA ",www.quickenloans.com, 800-955-6060,,"  This complaint is in regard to dishonest and misleading business practices by Quicken Loans client representatives. On July 1, 2013, I contacted Quicken Loans to inquire about getting a mortgage for a vacation home in Michigan. The property is a single family home that was used as a camp. The home has power and water, but doesn't have a septic system. Our plan for this home was to install a full bath inside the home after we closed on the loan. I was also aware that some lenders will not issue loans on properties without a bath. So on my initial call to a Quicken client representative (Eric Donaldson), I specifically asked if there would be any issues regarding the lack of a septic system, and he assured me that it would not be a problem. To be sure, he asked me to email a picture of the room set aside for the bath, which I did. After that, the loan application was accepted, I paid the $500 application fee and submitted all required documents over the next three weeks. At this point I was under the assumption the loan process was going smoothly. Quicken client representatives (Eric Donaldson and Tom Putvin) kept me informed of what they needed and there was never an indication the loan may be in jeopardy because of the lack of septic system. The closing on the property was scheduled for July 31, 2013. On July 27, I was informed by a new client representative (Hermon Barbe) that the property appraisal could not be completed because the property did not include a bathroom/septic system, and because of that, the loan could not be issued! This was four days before closing! I feel like I have been duped and misled, which has resulted in a waste of my time and money, and the seller's time and money. I feel it is outrageous that Quicken representatives do not know their own basic lending rules when it comes to properties such as this. Now I am forced to find another lender to start the loan process over, and the seller has to wait, all because Quicken was dishonest from the start! ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

We are hiring an attorney just to help us make them clear up and clean up their false reporting to the Credit Bureaus. We will be taking our credit report, check copies, all letters from Nation Star, telephone records and a copy of our new mortgage to set up for a law suit against them. I recommend to anyone that has a loan at Nation Star to refinance if at all possible.  This company is untrustworthy and liars and if not careful will foreclose on your home and report falsely to the Credit Bureaus.  This is a very nasty company.

 Axsys Financial Group ,"  Axsys Financial Group  Address: 27129 Calle Arroyo, #1820, San Juan Capis 
, Select State/Province USA ",www.axsysfinancial.com, 8003300423,," On 2-7-13, I contacted Axsys Financial to inquire about a house mod on my home, I'm upside down over 100k and can't afford to continue making payments on a house thats worth half of what I owe. After our initial meeting with Ela Kitchen at their San Clemente office we were wowed by stories of corporate corruption and banking irregularities to the tune of ""we have a shot of a Quiet Title or in a worse case scenario a lower interest rate with a possible principle reduction"" The thought of lowering our mortgage to a sum we could afford had us dreaming of being able to live beyond a day to day existence. We were told that after a back round on our title to make sure we were dealing with a high chance of doing this for a fee of $2000 down and $1500 a month they could almost guarantee results. These fees are higher than a lot of companies doing the exact same thing but I was sent to Axsys by a lawyer and incorrectly assumed I was dealing with another lawyer whose company that was dealing in real estate law. Brokered as a ""deal"" in which I would also receive Ela's ""expertise"" in credit repair we were sucked in. Surprise to me that when we were inquiring about having them help us, when ever I placed a call to her private phone or office phone we were able to be patched right through and speak directly but after receiving down payment all the sudden we were told that we should only contact thru email via their website/portal in which all communication should be conducted.  And thus this is where the scam kicks in, we were told the first step in this procedure is to get a ""QWR"" a qualified written letter off to our bank which with a electronic audit of the banks and chain of command in which the banks bought and sold our loans thru Mortgage Electronic Registration System (MERS), this is where they began to team up on us with the double talk. Ela's partner in this is named George Bosy, you can see with this link how someone else may have been scammed as well.  The first thing that seemed a little fishy to me was in this ""QWR"" I found several grammatical errors, the kind you may see in the Nigerian Prince scam, just bad english and spelling mistakes. I brought this to their attention and was told, ""it doesn't really matter"" as long as letter is sent.  A month goes by and its getting to be time for our first payment of monthly installment of $1500. We decide before we are going to send of a check that we should ask where they are with the process. When I called I was told ""do not call"" ""leave message in the portal"", well ok here we go again. I leave message in portal and after no response, I call with a different phone # and they pick up and say ""ohh, your computer is messed up and you are not really putting info in right. Turns out they just don't know how to use their own program, after straightening this mess out I was told,  ""letters were sent and we are working on your credit"". When they did not ask me for $1500 I figured they were just not really up to speed and that seemed kosher as in if they are not charging me monthly until they get going. After six weeks goes by I drop into their office and ask for proof of letters sent. They can't show proof of a letter sent and so I ask what is my credit score? You would think this is first step in credit repair........ They had not run TRW, they can't tell me until they run it in front of me. I have all of the screen shots of their ""portal"" in which you can see they are not prompt in any responses.  After 3 months of dealing with Axsys Financial, George Bosy/Ela Kitchen my bank did not receive any letters from them not even a 3rd Party Auth. Form which would let them do a mod. on my behalf. After 3 months they had still not contacted us for monthly payments so we figured we were scammed for initial $2K, but when we tried to contact to see if they had even sent 1 letter to bank we were told ""have you received our invoice""? They are so busy with other scams that they didn't even send out their own billing let alone any paper work to help us with modifications. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE, they WILL rip you off and still try to rip you off again.   ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Saginaw, Michigan USA ",https://www.pncmortgage.com/Locations/Branch.aspx?BranchID=243, 8003657772,," I received an offer on my house that we were selling by owner. The buyers decided to go through Tim Rousse at PNC bank in Saginaw, MI. They were approved and had a down payment with no issues, going conventional. Tim had them fill out a purchase agreement (which he chose the closing date- June 30th- 7 weeks away at that point) and all started off well.  About 2 weeks in (after the appraisal) Tim became VERY hard to reach. Both myself and the buyers tried several times to reach him every day and he was always out of the office or out of town. Weeks 3 and 4 went by with no news or communication.  Week 5 came along and Tim told us flat out, ""You have a clear to close"". Those were the best words you can hear when buying/selling a house. So I went and got a storage unit, got my next house all lined up, and thought we would be hearing from the title company.  Well more than a week went by and we heard nothing. I called the title company- nothing. I called Tim (several times again) and finally reached him and he swore he never said those words (clear to close) and that the appraisal hadn't even been approved yet. Yet he had the appraisal for over a month at that point! So that was devastating because we thought we were in the clear. He tried to blame it on the appraiser, but it wasn't the appraisers fault, I called him and he had everything sent in.   Then things got more interesting when it was all sent to the underwriters in Chicago. They were even harder to reach than Tim. Anytime I could actually talk to Tim he would only say ""I haven't heard anything"" or ""the appraisers are in chicago and you are just a piece of paper to them"". We flew past our original closing date and I became in danger of losing the next house we had set up.  The rest of the story is that Tim completely stopped communication with us and it finally closed on the 22nd of July, over 3 weeks past the original close date. It was a complete mess!  DO NOT ORIGINATE A MORTGAGE THROUGH TIM ROUSSE OR PNC! You will regret it, I promise. Oh yeah- that $500 guarantee they have that you'll close on time- scam all the way.   ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Then in Feb. 2013 I got a notice stating that I was late sending my payment in. So the next month, I made sure that I was several days early. I got another statement stating I was late again. So this time I sent my payment in express mail overnight. They didn't cash my check until after the 17th of April. I was so mad. I called them. All I got was an East Indian who could hardly speak English. I got the run around. In May I called them again. All I got was the automated system. I made the payment again by express mail. Ounce again they didn't cash the check until the 17th. I called agian and couldn't get anything but the automated system. This is BS. Unfortunately my wife passed away on May 27th 2013. So I moved into an apartment which is cheaper by a long shot. OCWEN can have the house. Good luck to them getting their money. They can have one of their East Indians or their Germans move in. For all of you who are dealing with OCWEN and are in the same situation, do yourself a favor, if you can, wait until they foreclose and then file chapter 7. OCWEN seems to have a habit of letting people file bankruptcy and then foreclosing and slaping the homeowner with a bunch of legal BS. I feel sorry for the hardworking American these days.

 Fifth Third Mortgage - Aimee Green ,"  Fifth Third Mortgage - Aimee Green   
Louisville, Kentucky USA ",https://secure.53.com/mortgage/, 8003934887,,"  I was contacted by Fifth Third Mortgage to refinance my home loan early March 2013.  They had been calling me for month to do this.  I had a baby on the way and decided it would be beneficial for my family to refi.  They called took my information down and no one called back.  I waited a few buisness days and then started to get worried it really wasn't Fifth Third I gave my information to.  I got on-line and and called someone from their website.  This person was rude and said there wasn't any way they could help me save money.  I worked in the mortgage business for years and knew that was false.  My wife then went to a local branch and spoke with a loan officer there.  They said they could help and get back to us.  They never did.  I let it go for a couple of weeks and then attempted to get in contact with Fifth Third again in the middle of April.  I tracked down the person that took my information and she said she would give my contact information to the loan officer again.  Days later Aimee Green got back to me.  By this time my wife was 39 weeks pregnant and getting ready to deliver.  I wanted to move fast due to the time constraint a newborn can bring.  I had everything they needed as soon as they asked for it.  We had the appraisal completed the first week of May and then my wife delivered.  We were waiting to hear when the closing date was when Fifth Third started calling for additional information.  My wife's maternity leave was causing an issue because she is technically an Independent Contractor. Fine.  They said we would have to wait until my wife went back to work to complete the loan.  I wasn't happy, but I went with it. I didn't hear anything concerning changes to the loan at all from Aimee Green the entire time my wife was out for Maternity leave.  July 18th I get an e-mail from Fifth Third saying that I have documents to review.  I open the document and things have changed.  Apparently, they had been extending my rate lock and charging me for it.  They also increased my loan amount (without notification) to cover the fees they were charging me.  If any of this had been disclosed to me I would have cancelled everything and gone with another bank.  Now, the rates have gone way up and I am stuck. I confronted Aimee Green and Fifth Thid concerning their lack of communication about the change in the loan and what they expected me to pay.  They said that they had left me a voicemail with the charges I was incurring on my phone.  I keep my voicemails (a bad habit), so I knew they were lying.  I also have all of my e-mail communications.  I went back and fourth with Aimee Green and the V.P. in Louisville for days trying to get answers and when they answered my question finally she lied and said she had left a message with the information on it.  Then they tried to give me a higher rate as a consulation.  They lied about informing me of the charges they were going to make me pay and then they tried to send the forms to me without discussing any changes to the loan (In hopes I wouldn't pay attention).  They also said I didn't disclose my wife being pregnant at the beginning of the process.  I have the e-mail to prove that I did.  Fifth Third lies, and they try to slide charges in under your nose.  I thought dealing with a bank would be different, but they are the same as every slime ball out there.  This isn't over.

 OCWEN Homeloan Services ,"  OCWEN Homeloan Services  Worthington Road, Suite 100 
West Palm Beach, Florida USA ",, 8004414428,," OCWEN took over my loans back in 2007 for both my home and a rental property - that was my business.  They would not allow me to make payments for the first 4-6 months, stating that my accounts were not in their systems yet.  They assured me that I would not be made to pay late fees.  I set the money aside waiting until they would let me pay.  On both properties, when they finally got my account information into their systems, they told me I owed $10,000 on the rental and $15,000 on my home in late fees and threatened to fhen threatened to foreclose if I did not pay both amounts in full.  I asked for a statement of fees, etc. (to bring to a lawyer) and when I recieved it, they had also added $30,000 more to the ORIGINAL amount of my home mortgage - on top of the $15,000 late fee, and they tacked $20,000 on the rental to the ORIGINAL mortgaging amount of the rental as well, though I had paid each down by over $20,000 from the original amount.  In other words, they tacked an extra $40,000 on principal of rental and $50,000 on principle of my home mortgage and this did not include the exhorbitant $10 & $15,000 late fees.  After much fueding - I refused to pay the mortgage payments knowing that I would likely lose the houses because I refused to pay the fees and to go on pretending that the amount they added didn't matter.   I lost my home and my business.  Now they are on my credit report under several different names for the same two accounts, looking like I defaulted on multiple properties.   Does anyone moderate these crooked A#%holes?  They not only ruined my business because I could no longer get mortgages or credit of any type, they ruined my abilitys to buy another house and it is six years later - though I have always paid my bills and have NO debt!  I will join any lawsuits that are out there.    ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

 Proficio Mortgage ,"  Proficio Mortgage  6100 Rockside Woods Rd.  #180 
Independence, Ohio USA ",http://www.proficiomortgage.com/, 8004431032,," I started my refinance with these people back in February 2013 and I still don't have a closing date. The only thing I've been getting is the runaround and constant requests for documents I had already sent. My initial case worker (or whatever you want to call her) had gotten all of my information and gave me a rate of 3.75% for my HARP loan. Once I got all of the initial paperwork and sent it in, I thought we were good to go. Not the case. I get a call asking for more work that I had already sent in. A week later, another call asking for more paperwork that I had already sent in. I had to call them back and tell them I wasn't sending a thing because I had sent them all of that information already and nothing changed. Then, I get a bunch of paperwork in the mail that I needed to sign. I did and faxed it all in. Guess what? I get another call telling me I didn't fax a few things, which I did. Then another call comes that they needed paperwork from the first round of paperwork that I had already sent in.  Seriously?? Anyone who losses paperwork like that shouldn't be working in mortgage finance. This is my personal information. Had this been healthcare, these people would've opened themselves up to a lawsuit.  Anyway, again, I told them I wasn't sending them anything because they had already received it. If they didn't, then I'd take my business elsewhere where they actually keep up with their customers' information. A day later, I got a call that said I was pre-approved for a loan and they were waiting for underwriting. Keep in mind that it's been 8 weeks at this point and I have the emails to prove it.  12 weeks come and I haven't heard a thing. During the last couple of weeks of silence, I had been emailing my case worker wondering what the heck was going on and had their been any news. I finally email the main office in Florida and someone calls me back within an hour. He tells me that my case worker left the company a month ago. Too bad nobody bothered to tell me that I was emailing into a void. If that wasn't bad enough, I keep getting letters that Proficio has tapped my credit report four times, bringing down my credit score from 780 to 730. When I ask the guy on the phone about it, he says I should be more worried about the number of accounts I have open because that's what's bringing my credit score down. Oh, really?? They sure didn't have a problem with pre-approving me for a loan though, did they? Not only that, but if it was that bad, then why do business with me at all? After all of that crap, I finally got a reason why it was taking so long for my refi to go through. Quicken Loans was doing the underwriting and they had to do a PMI check. Nobody bothered to tell me any of this!!! Even worse, now that Proficio suddenly got the approval to do loans with PMI, they wanted to drag me through the whole process again!  Again! The guy on the phone said it would take approx. 30 to 45 days with them, but probably 60 to 90 days if I wanted to stay with Quicken. Of course, I chose these idiots because they already had all of my information and could move pretty fast from that point on. But that's not the end of it. Guess what? They need me to fill out more paperwork. More!!  I'm coming up on the six month point and the only message I've received from these people is the loan has been approved, but they needed more paperwork. Guess what? They'll have to get it the best way they can because I'm done. I've written the FHFA, but they can't really do anything, so they forwarded my information elsewhere. At this point, I just want the word out about these scam artists. The more people I keep away from them, that more gratified I'll be. ",  Mortgage Companies ,0
 Selene Finance  ,"  Selene Finance   9990 Richmond Avenue, Suite 400 South 
Houston, Texas USA ",CustomerService@SeleneFinance.com, 8005645693,," Selene Finance must be thoroughly investigated for ""sneaky"" practices designed to create several methods for greatly increasing the odds of making late payments on their mortgage payment. An article I read on this site pertaining to Selene Finance is right on! I couldn't agree more with what was said, so I'm not going to re-write again, but strongly suggest you do a search and read the article ""Selene Finance must be thoroghly investigated"". What I would like to add to this Ripoff Report on this article is the ""slick"" way they go about forcing your hand to move away from your already in place on-line bankinig payment method, to use their on-line payment. I call this ""slick"" because it is leagal, but intended to once again add just another way of making sure you eventually make a late mortgage payment. Just to be clear, I have been making on-line banking payment without any issues for over 10 years until Selene Finance entered the picture during a refinance earlier this year. In short, they do not accept EDI payment, this is a method of making a payment on a specified payment date to ensure your bank (or whomever), makes the payment on a specified date and ensure delivery of payment. I do this for ALL major companies (i.e. Captial One, Chase, Discover, Ally, Sears, JCPenny), you get the idea, and have never had an issue. Because Selene Finance does not subscribe to this service (by design), your banking instituation must send a manual check to ensure that the date you setup with your bank, is paid in time. This method does not gaurantee delivery because its like sending a payment by mail and no electronic history is recorded. This is how Selence Finance takes its time to record the payment when it is received by the bank. Hence, they say they didn't receive the payment on time. If you call customer service, they will give you the canned answer that you should be sending in the payment to allow for 10 day delivery. The last time I checked, it doesn't take nearly 10 days to receive mail anywhere in the continental U.S.  Now that they have forced your hand to move to their on-line payment method if you want a solid record of when the payment was received and recorded, this is where the ""slick"" comes into play. Once you sign-up for Selene Finance on-line paymenet, (what for it...) you only have 15 days to schedule a payment in advace. In other words, you must litterly log into your Selene Finance account and setup a scheduled payment no earlier than 15 days in advace. WHAT? Wouldn't it make sence to allow you to schedule ALL off your montly paymenet ahead of time so you don't miss a payment? This is by design, so you will most definitely make a late paymenet sometime in the next 15-30 years...right? Vacatiions, sick, death in the family...etc. and you will forget to setup your monthly mortgage payment sooner or later. When I asked Selene about this underhanded way of doing business, they simply said that this is an IT (Information Technology) provision and that is the way it is designed to work. Anyway, I'm still with Selene Finance and have had no late charges yet. In Selence Finance defense to the above, they did refund my late payment since I was not aware of this practice. How nice of them. Its only a matter of time before they get it back....right? NOT! ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

 Peter Rzepka Best Houses LLC ,"  Peter Rzepka Best Houses LLC  9485 W Lone Mountain Rd  
Las Vegas, Nevada USA ",http://www.bizapedia.com/people/PETER-RZEPKA.html, 8006347928,,"  LAS VEGAS — Several Las Vegas homeowners have filed a lawsuit against Best Houses LLC, a local real estate company that advertises, ""We Buy and Sell Houses."" The plaintiffs allege that they signed a purchase agreement for their homes with the company's principals, Peter and Janice Rzepka, only to find out that the sale was never recorded at the Clark County Assessor's Office. With property titles still in their names, the homeowners unwittingly fell behind on mortgage payments and some of the homes went into foreclosure, ruining the homeowners' credit and preventing the homeowners from buying new homes.  ""I call them `rogue' Realtors,"" said Evan Needham, the plaintiffs' attorney. ""They can't compete with the top peers in their field so they come up with creative ways to transact business and it usually comes back to impact people."" In the first complaint filed Jan. 15 in District Court, Needham said the Rzepkas agreed to pay off the mortgage loans on two separate homes purchased from Daniel and Anita Lopez and Robert Gaudreau, with escrow to be closed within 30 days. The Rzepkas never paid off the mortgages and instead rented the homes to third parties, defaulting on mortgage payments, county taxes and homeowner association dues, the complaint states. In an amended complaint filed Feb. 9, Needham added plaintiffs Hillary Haddock, Jason Cowie and Tara and Mark Conklin. He also claimed that Best Houses has no physical commercial business location where its resident agent, Janice Rzepka, could be served with legal papers. Furthermore, the Rzepkas never obtained a state or city business license, never filed a fictitious business name certificate and do not possess real estate or property management licenses. ""Based on the above, defendants were unauthorized to do business in Nevada,"" the lawsuit states. ""As such, all deeds, assignments, trusts, contracts, leases and other legal documents created by defendants that relate to plaintiffs' properties are void and unenforceable."" Benjamin Childs, an attorney representing the Rzepkas, said his clients are not required to have those licenses. Childs answered the lawsuit with a counterclaim on Feb. 5, denying the allegations and filing a motion to disqualify Evan Needham and his law firm brothers, Al and Howard, from the case. A ""warranty deed"" was recorded on the Lopez' property at 3312 Barnstaple Court that is in dispute, purportedly deeding Lopez' interest to Resolve LLC, a company controlled by Al Needham, Childs asserted in his motion. Needham then initiated eviction proceedings against the tenant with a declaration from Lopez that he deeded the property to his counsel. Childs claims the Needhams are thereby unable to ethically represent Lopez in litigation concerning the title and ownership of the Barnstaple property. Lopez was paid $10,000 for his house by Best Houses, the attorney said. ""Guess what happens?"" Childs said. ""The price of real estate goes way up, so Evan Needham, who's a Realtor, calls the owner of the property and says, `You deed it to us and we'll kick out the tenants.' ""Now you own the property and the house goes up $20,000 over the year. Needham files a revocation of trust. Now it has to be duked out [in court]."" The case is scheduled for a March 18 hearing in District Court, Department 7.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-03-07/business/0403070426_1_mortgage-payments-homeowners-las-vegas   ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Dallas, Texas USA ",www.mynationstar.com, 8007462936,,"  My home loan was recently transferred to Nationstar Mortgage for servicing. It transferred in ""good standing"" and Nationstar actually wrote the account was as such in the welcome letter sent to me. I made my June payment the end of the month and included late fees with the payment and it was reversed without explanation July 1st. I have made several requests as to why the payment was reversed and as to date I have not received a reply. I did make the payment after seeing the balance in my checking account and of course it was late. I also tried calling them to ask why it was late and person I spoke literally hung up on my stating I was being rude. Who wouldn't be upset to find out a payment was reversed and no contact had been made as to the reason why and to advise it wasn't accepted. That is the worst customer service I have ever received from any business. From that point I have made communications in writing. They have simply not responded to any of my requests and in addition to that my payment history has been deleted from my account. The payment made and reversal are no longer showing in history as well as the payment made upon my discovery that the payment was reversed. In addition I have received in mail a letter stating a demand is going to be made and foreclosure proceedings to begin if my account is not brought current by a specific date and they are calling my home daily leaving messages. As stated I have made several requests for an explanation why the payment was reversed and no response at all. I have concluded that their objective is to push my account into default and foreclose. This is more commonly known as ""Mortrgage Servicing Fraud"" and manufactured defaults. They have NOT cooperated with any help to answer and resolve. My mortgage has NEVER been 30 days late until this occurrence. After discovering the payment was reversed and making the payment again I requested that they give a one time grace and not report as late, they have not responded to that either. All I want is answers and fair treatment of my account without manufacturing a default. I have copies of all transactions proving every item stated here. Also they sent a validation of debt with the welcome letter. I found interest charges in that validation unknown and have requested they validate the debt. It appears this mortgage servicer is deceitful and operates in a manipulative way to take advantage of consumers. Action needs to taken with them as was taken with Bank Of America and it seems no coincidence they work together. Bank of America lost a lawsuit with modifications/foreclosure.

 Absolute Home Mortgage ,"  Absolute Home Mortgage  105 Mountain court Hackettstown,NJ 
Hackettstown, New Jersey USA ",, 8007462936,,"  About 2 months ago today my boyfriend hooked up with this company to help with a streamline of his FHA mortage. In the begining they were very nice very pleasant very concerned. Then as time went on and on the claws came out. Stephanie at this particular location was eager to help after explaining that my boyfriend was about paying the mortgage a week before it is due she stated we could not close then the end of may because he was going to send out that mortgage payment. Once into June she wanted another paystub and for him to sign papers he has already signed. We let her know that he needed to close by the 21st or he would be maililing in July's mortage payment she stated she would try. Ok when that did not happen someone from the office phoned him on the 20th of June to tell him they would not be closing on the 21st but to hold off on paying the mortgage after stating to that person that the lawyer who was to do this closing would be on vacation the following week my boyfriend was reluctant to use another lawyer from the same firm but would just to get this done. As stated the last communication he had with someone from that office to hold off on paying the mortgage he as of today July 8, 2013 has yet to hear from anyone in that office. Good thing he did not listen to them and hold off on paying his mortgate. I paid that mortgage payment on the 27th of June this is way late for him but it is done and no late fees. My thoughts to anyone reading this is please check out the people and the business you are dealing with before getting involved. I would not reccommend this company to anyone looking to streamline or refi their home. this comapny is to me very uneducated in the field of business. If 3 months or more is the norm then they should say so at the first phone conversation and let the person doing the refi or streamline make that call. It will avoid these types of reports and detering potential clients from doing business with you. Unprofessional at one point as I was trying to explain to Stephanie how my boyfriend started this with another institution she cut me right off and let me know that she has nothing to do with that.

I'm currently going through a separation, and need to move like 2 months ago. I called the number that was listed, and told the woman my urgency. I let her know I needed to move as soon as possible. I ofcourse should've went with my first thought, and just said no; but she kept on stating how I could move in as soon as a few days with No money down, No credit check, and No security deposit. I told her I wasn't going to do it unless I could see a website or something stating this information. She then gave me the www.firsthousefinancial.com website, and told me I was gaurenteed my money back within 90 days if they couldn't get me in a home. She made it seem like they would work with the homeowners to get me in the foreclosed home of my choice, according to what I could pay. The $199 I paid via debit was the last I had, in hopes that I could find a home for myself and my children. I am also pregnant, and could've used that money towards my unborn child for that matter. I had been diligently looking up the lists, wasting time and gas money, only to find out none of the homes were in foreclosure. They were already purchased, owned by a bank, or not on the market. Not only that....after you pay your money, you quickly find out that you do NOT have any contact numbers for these homeowners. You put a request in for their number, and ofcourse they (first home financial) cannot get in contact with them either. So basically, you pay to do EVERYTHING yourself, and realize that you are wasting you time, just like your money. You will NEVER find the home that they promise you, and they DO NOT help at all. They are very rude after you've initially sign up, if you ever need to call back. Then the form they give for a refund has absolutely NOWHERE to send it to!!! I am extremely upset, and also hurt that someone would take advantage, knowing your situation and rob you of your money and your dream of getting into a home. I hope they are shut down! This should be illegal to do this to hard working people who honestly are trying to get ahead. BEWARE & NEVER fall for this full blown SCAM!!! This has put me in a financial bind, even though it is only $199. It was earned by my hard work, and taken from a bill that I could've paid with that very same $199. This company is full of crap!

My son selected ACH Lending based on a recommendation from colleagues at his new employer- big mistake. This is not a mortgage bank. I wish I had dealt with my own bank or credit union. This turned out to be the most frustrating and difficult mortgage process I have ever encountered, and I have participated in more than 20 personal or business real estate transactions. While the loan officer was very polite, dealing with him was extremely difficult.  At least he could speak English.  I had to resubmit the same documents several times. Every delay, on their part, resulted in a new round of updated forms. We had to explain where every penny for the downpayment came from.  Finally we had to quit making any deposits into our account as AHC would then request additional documents and statements to ""prove that we weren't borrowing money to make the down payment"".  We signed the documents electronically (We live in the Seattle area, and AHC is in the Dallas area) as is current industry standard, but AHC then made us sign an additional set with original signatures, 157 pages worth.  We notarized all the forms required, but because some of the forms were two-sided, we were then required to file a complete new set with another notary (at least 15 forms needed to be notarized).  Throughout the process, AHC kept asking for additional documents and things they needed and that list never stopped growing or changing. They increased rates and fees during the process. I don't know if they are imcompetent or what. Its amazing to me they can stay in business.  All of this continued up until the closing date and 3 days past closing, with them threating to pull the mortgage and the locked in rate if the additional documents weren't resubmitted as demanded.  I would never, ever, recommend this firm.

La Crescenta, Select State/Province USA ",, 8008528306,," To whom it may concern: I would like to bring to your attention something that occurred last month regarding a home in the La Crescenta area. July 1, 2013 To whom it may concern Back in February 2013 my client was looking for and found a house in La Crescenta that was a short sale.  He offered a cash deal of $450,000 with not contingency and no inspection with a seven day escrow.  The bank took the offer and we started the wait for the bank to get back to us to let us know if the accepted the offer. My client and I waited through the remainder of February, March, April and May and then in June of the 2013 the bank decided put the house up for auction.   To say we were disappointed with their decision is an understatement, especially since we had waited so long and had given the bank a generous offer. (Later we found out that the banks appraisal came in at $389K ten thousand below asking price) The auction began and the house was eventually sold for $452,500.  However the reserve the bank had set was not met.  Ultimately, my client was outbid on the home in the amount $2,500.    All this time, my client had his funds tied up in escrow waiting for the bank to get back to him, and since they were in escrow, he was unable to bid on other properties  and watched helplessly as house prices climbed. The only  person to gain in this fiasco was the auction house, their 5% commission ($22,500) has to be paid by the winning bidder.  The bank gained only $2500. What I would like is an explanation of why the bank put my client and myself through 4 months of waiting only to accept another cash offer for ½ percent more than the offered price.  This could have been sold by the end of February 2013 if they had gone with my clients offer.  What the bank did in this case seems to enforce the stereotype of banks as greedy and heartless, not thinking about the damage they cause as people try earn a living.  I think Aution.com and Nation Star should be investigated.   ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

I've posted the details of my exchange with them below. Aside from the issue of the flaw in their auto-payment system it's a designed part of the scam that they only communicate with you via their internal email system. This way you  have no way of knowing whether they are sending you some promotional crap (like all companies) or a delinquent notice. The emails they send you notifying that an email exists (in their internal email  system) all look the same - this way they must snag lots of people with this. Also, I was stunned at the tone the person took on the phone. It felt a collection agency and they started lecturing me on how I should have seen some screen flash by when I signed up for the auto-payment that informed me of this problem with their payment syste. I assure you that's the extent of the documentation on this. I have no email or letter stating anything about this auto-payment delay.   Thank you for being our customer.Unfortunately, the cut off for signing up for automatic payment for the June 1st payment was 5/14/13.

 Arkansas Federal Credit Union Jacksonville Arkansas ,"  Arkansas Federal Credit Union Jacksonville Arkansas  Post Office Box 9  
Jacksonville, Arkansas USA ",, 8177837491,," June 20, 2013 TO NCUA:   I would like to provide a perspective to the NCUA complaint that Mr. Rudolph Frazier made against Arkansas Federal Credit Union.  Being a then-current member of the AFCU Supervisory Committee, and the only African American volunteer, I have first-hand knowledge of his complaint.  I was asked to watch all the correspondence of this complaint.  Mr. Frazier’s initial complaint, dated 09 April 2013, dealt with his mistreatment by the mortgage department.  He started his complaint alleging that he received disparaging treatment based on his race and that felt that ACFU could benefit from racial sensitivity training.  I personally met with Mr. Frazier and questioned his contention of racial mistreatment.  At the conclusion, I extended my apologizes on behalf of AFCU and asked him to not close his membership. [continued below]....
									   Report Attachments:       
										.....    Firstly, this entire situation was entirely precipitated due to the mishandling of Mr. Frazier’s mortgage services as a member.  That fact is not in dispute.  He received unprofessional service that was further compounded by the CEO, Larry Bernake’s denial of Mr. Frazier basic access to the mortgage department.  Instead of correcting obvious issue in mortgage department, he limited the member’s right.  He denied Mr. Frazier access to mortgage services except through the CEO only.  Mr. Frazier is a 20-year member in good standing without any prior incident with AFCU.  The CEO’s remedy was to be Mr. Frazier’s “personal banker” to which Mr. Frazier did not agree.  If he was not racially mistreated at this point the CEO attempt at resolution solidified this it in this members mind.    In the CEO and Mr. Frazier’s initial meeting an apology letter was agreed upon.  Instead of correcting the issues in the mortgage department as promised and providing Mr. Frazier equal service, he was made to receive restricted service.  I was appalled to see this African American member could not even call the mortgage department to make account inquires.   Mr. Frazier felt that he received unprofessional treatment by the white staff in the mortgage department.  Afterwards, he received erroneous mortgage information from the CEO and continued limited loan information.   These are the facts that precipitated his further complaints to NCUA and EEOC.  26 April, I personally met with Jonathan in Internal Auditing regarding Mr. Frazier’s complaint and questioned the characterization of his complaint.   How do you tell a member complaining over racial mistreatment that he can only access services through a “backdoor” process.  Of course he would be upset.  This is a fundamental lack of leadership and an inherent insensitivity to the needs of the minority membership.501   ReFordMSgt, USAF Retired

Pnc said no problem and began processing the loan. I get the appraisal done and waited. They said everything is fine but needed a foundation inspection for $675 but will not charge me unless I did not use them for the mortgage. The foundation inspection came back with a good report.  I waited another few weeks with no indication there was a problem. At the last hour pnc told me the house that I was buying was ""unique"" and would not lend me the money. The problem is rates have gone up over 1% making my payment go up another $80 a month because of the rate increase. Pnc wants me to pay the $675 for the foundation inspection that they ordered. The worse part I had to be out of my house because the new owners had to take possession of their house. I now have to move my 5 kids, my wife and all of our stuff in with my in-laws. I wanted to use pnc because that is who I bank with. I can't believe this legal. It's one thing if I have bad credit, not enough money down or the house didn't pass inspection or appraisal, but everything did, the reason my loan wasn't approved is because they said the house was unique.This loan is out of the Toledo office and my loan officer was Sara E.

227 W. Monroe; 24th Floor, Illinois USA ",MortgagesByTony.net, 847-550-7300,," My 75 year old mother is in the market to purchase townhouse and had asked me to help her since I would living there with her.  Since this is the first time either of us has ever purchase a home (my dad had purchased their other home) we took the advise of our realtor and used one of the mortgage people she had used in the past.... Tony Costabile with CitiBank.  My mom has great credit, 700 plus. Tony even said himself that her credit was really good and rock solid. She has a fixed income of more than enough to pay for the townhouse  every month and that income will never change except to increase a little each year.  She has minimal bills, a home equity loan and 2 credit cards that she pays more on all each month than's required....not even a car payment. She has right at the moment only  Enough for the earnest money, inspection fees, Tony's fee of $357.05, a year's worth of ins., lawyer's fee and the closing costs.... downpayment etc.  But not really anything more than that.  But Tony knew all of that because he went over everything having to do with her finances with her on the phone the first time they spoke even....he went over her finances with a fine tooth comb so to speak. Then She made copies of everything for him including the last 2 months of bank statements, savings and checking just like he had asked.  He knew exactly what she had and did not have and she was very open and honest with him about her finances. I was sitting right there during the meeting at her house and know EVERYTHING was discussed about her finances. All during the couple week process he told her that she was good....no issues with her finances.  She had pre-qualified and then pre-approved without any problems and he didn't see anything regarding her finances holding her up from getting the townhouse. Even the realtor thought this would be a quick sale with no issues because of what Tony had led everyone to believe.  Well on the fifth day after the contract was signed, at the close of the business day, he calls me to say that he had bad news, the loan did't go through because of some new law that was just passed in the last couple of days and he had just found out about it that day, (06/07/13) .  He said  "" the feds in all their great wisdom, have changed the law because of what happened in the housing market in the past years. They now require you to have a reserve of 6 months worth of mortgage, ins. taxs, etc. not only for the new home but for the old one too.""   He then told me my mom would have to have a total of about $22,000.00 just sitting as a reserve in her account for the loan to go through. He said they were just notified that day (again 06/07/13) and the only way to beat it was to close by 06/15/13 and since that was only the 5th day after the contract was signed there was no way anyone could close that fast. So ""sorry"" and hope you have a good weekend or something to that effect.....  He then called my mom and told her the same thing. SERIOUSLY....WTH?!!!!  I then called my realtor who Tony had also told the same thing to and she was in shock too and very confused as to what had just happened because she was also under the impression that there were absolutely NO issues as far as the financing because of what Tony had been telling us all. She didn't know anything about this so called new law either. When I got home from work I looked on the internet for literally a couple of hours to see if I could find out something about this supposedly ""new law"" and I found nothing.   So today (06/08/13) I called two other mortgage loan officers and asked them about this.  The first kind of laughed (nicely) when I asked him about this ""new law""  and told me ""yes, that was true about most banks wanting a reserve BUT it wasn't new at all ...it had been around for a while"".  His only explanation he could think of of why  Tony would have not told my mom or myself right away was ""either he didn't know what he was doing or he screwed up, either way he dropped the ball."" The second mortgage man I spoke with has been in the business a long time and very knowledgable also . He owns his own company for investment mortgages in AZ.  A friend of mine had me call him after she heard my story.  He was more direct in what he thought Tony was up to.....He said that there was absolutely NO WAY Tony did not know about the ""reserve money"". That that's something he should have told her about immediately. And since he knew after talking to my mom about her finances right away that there was no reserve money he shouldn't have let it go any farther if he could not provide her with some alternatives. Since he knew there was no other way she could get financing with CitiBank he should have told her right away so she wouldn't have preceded with everything and would not have been charged the $357.05 fee from him plus the $275.00 inspector fee also.  This gentleman I spoke with seems to believe that Tony did this to get the $357.05 fee.. So I guess he figured at least it was a way to make a quick $357  if nothing else.  Or maybe Tony is really that stupid and just didn't know about the reserve money??  And then lied about it being a ""new law"" that he was just told about on Friday to cover his incompetence??  HA!!  NO, Tony's not that stupid....I found his two different websites today and the one...MortgagesByTony.net  mentions ""reserve money"" not just once but twice that I could see.  So way to go Tony...You knowingly ripped off a 75 year old woman $632.05...I hope you feel really good about yourself!!!  And I hope CitiBank feels really good about their employees and their practice of stealing from people, especially an older woman that he knew had absolutely no knowledge of any of this, niether did I,  and we counted on him being honest with us.....kind of sad to think  ...but stupid us for trusting him!  Tony Costabile is a liar!!!  He lied not only to us but to our realtor who has worked with him before and even reccomended him....Nice Tony, real nice guy!!  And really great choice of employees to represent you CitiBank!!!  Maybe you are the stupid ones for hiring someone like Tony or maybe your'e the ones telling him to cheat people!!  ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Lie - This company told me that I had a year after a year of my mother's death to pay off the loan. This was false come to find out it was a year after her death. 2nd. Lie - Because I had been stressing over all the letters and fed-ex letters regarding my home was to go into foreclosure and that I only had 30 days, thier response was that they were sorry and that I should just ignore these letters because they are just letters that needed to be in the file.  No need to worry you have plenty of time they would say. 3rd. Lie - They said they would accept the will of my mother which states that I was the executor and that everything was left to me.  No need for probate they said. 4th Lie - On the monthly statements it states these amounts for appraisers and services which are being added to the loan and for which has never happened.  In fact they said that when an appraiser is sent it was already paid for, their would be no charge. The final call I made to this company was right before my mother's 1 year of death just to make sure we were on the same page about how much time I still had.  I had sent in my extensions like I was told to do except for I sent them all too early because I would receive a letter from them and would get upset and so I would send them the request so to remind them that they had given me my extensions.  The girl I spoke to said she couldn't talk to me because there was nothing in the file with my name on it.  There was no will, there was a death certificate only.   I about died, I told her I had sent 3 copies of the will with death certificates each time at different times and they were faxed and I had receipts to prove it. I also stated that I have been calling all year and how could my name not be there. I then went on to tell her all the above statement s the company's other employees had stated and she was shocked because they had no record of it and they had just filed with the courts the default of no payments on the home.  My mother died and why or how would she make payments.  The loan should now be in my name.  She had me fax her again and call her back to make sure she had recieved it and then no response. My home is in foreclosure and I have no where to go, the home my father had worked so hard for my mom and myself to have til we died has been taken from me.  I was born and raised here, I left and came back and then finally stood to care for my mother til she passed on, she was 90 years old and she had everything in order so that I wouldn't worry  after she passed on, well she thought she had.  These greedy SOB's have lied and stolen my life and my childrens lives from us and not once did they try to work with me, no they just wanted and I quote,""WE JUST WANT A CHECK WITH OUR NAME ON IT FOR THE TOTAL AMOUNT DUE TO US"". and ""YOU DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO DO THAT AND THE HOUSE IS YOURS"". They knew no one would give us a loan on a home that was upside down.  The home is set to sell on July 1st of this year and I have been crying everyday since I found out. I hope someday they will pay for all the suffering they have caused not only me and my children but everyone else that they have stolen from.  ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Lewisville, Texas USA ",www.nationstarmtg.com, 855-683-3095,," Nationstar Mortgage purchased my mortgage in November 2011 from Bank of America. I have been in Chapter 13 bankruptcy since July 2010. Per the Bankruptcy Court ordered plan,  BofA  and subsequently Nationstar were to be paid back three missed payments and lender purchased hazard insurance (escrow account) by the Court's Trustee in monthly disbursements over the course of five years, and my monthly payments would return to principle and interest only. However, BofA  and then Nationstar kept charging me for the same insurance escrow shortage in my monthly mortgage payments, thus the Banks were receiving a payments directly from me plus payments through my bankruptcy plan; an illegal practice by the Banks known as ""double dipping"".  In October 2011 I purchased my own hazard insurance policy to avoid Nationstar from setting up an escrow account which would increase my monthly payments even more. After the transfer of my mortgage to Nationstar, I received an annual escrow statement from BofA proving the Bank's violation of the Bankruptcy Court's orders, so I informed my bankruptcy attorney.  My attorney sent BofA a qualified written request in February 2012. Four months later my attorney received a response back from BofA admitting to the illegal escrow charges and filed an Adversary Proceeding lawsuit against Nationstar and BofA in June 2012. In October 2012 BofA and Nationstar's attorney (both banks used the same attorney) requested a settlement offer. My attorney proposed that they forfeit all payment arrears, modify my loan by lowering the principal by $30,000 and interest rate to 3%. In January 2013 Nationstar refused to take payments over the phone. I knew they had a habit of ""losing"" checks, so I did electronic bill pay through my checking account (at least that way I had confirmation of payment received).  Then in April 2013 the two and a half years of over-payments finally drained me to where I couldn't make a payment.  In mid-May of 2013, Nationstar informed my attorney that I was five months late in making payments, and would only agree to a settlement where they pay the missed payments and my attorney's fees.  By then, I was only behind on two payments (if you consider the 1st of the month the absolute due date) and gave my attorney proof of this, through a phone payment log I kept and the three electronic bill payment confirmations. My attorney went ahead and accepted the ""settlement"",  advising me that the Bankruptcy Court would look unfavorably on me for not making mortgage payments as per the bankruptcy plan, implying that if I didn't take the settlement and the lawsuit went to Court, I would not win. Even though we had overwhelming proof that BofA and Nationstar broke several Federal and State laws, violated the Court's own orders and resulted in me paying over $3000 extra to the Banks, the court would find in the Banks' favor. How can that be? I was behind on the two mortgage payments because the extra charge per month for the illegal escrow over the course of two and a half years had slowly bled me dry.  Nationstar knew they could keep overcharging, deny a mortgage modification application and stall settlement negotiations for as long as necessary  in order to force me into a position where I'm the bad guy, and their crimes go unpunished. Please sign my petition to have them investigated by the Government. I do not want anyone else to be bullied by the Nationstar Foreclosure Industry.

Not sure what to do now, Today I received a packet from a real estate agent asking me to voluntary vacate on march 18,2013.      My second complaint, On February 28,2013 I filed a complaint, Complaint number is 130227-002371. I contacted by Tatya Whetstone she informed me that I qualified for a recession as to which I applied for and was denied, The texas state law states that I have to notified within 21 days of the sale date and must be posted in court house. It was filed in court house on January 14,2013 but was not posted and my notice of foreclosure was written on January 14,2013 and mailed to me there is no way i was notified within 21 days unless i was in the office and it was handed to me that day which I was not. I was informed by Mrs Whetstone to send in papers for a MOD which I did so. I was contacted again two weeks ago from Mrs Whetstone she informed me that my MOD was in reveiw and they were having trouble opening my file due to the foreclosure and she sent my file to someone who could fix it. Last week on May 22 2013 I was contacted by Mrs Fleetwood who stated she was my new case manager and that my house has been sold and that was all. I told her my conversation with Mrs Whetstone she told me that my case was never in review, I called Mrs Whetstone and she said that that was false and she emailed Mrs Fleetwood as I was on the hone to let her know the process of my file and where it was located. I received A letter to vacate immediately from the attorneys office. I called Mrs Fleetwood yesterday and asked what was going on, First she said I was never in review and then in the same conversation she said I was denied for a MOD i asked the date she said it was May 5,2013. I had not even applied before that date.She told me to vacate as well so I asked about the original off that was presented to me in the beginning that if I vacated within 30 days I would receive a settlement offer. I was guaranteed this offer if my MOD was denied, She says I was not ever giving such am offer. That is a lie I have the aer work from the real estate company that has my house in reo. Cameron real estate in cleveland texas which I got off the hone with today and who has sent my house to auction because they have never had any updates from BAC. During my first conversation with Mrs Whetstone I ASKED IF I SHOULD MOVE AND WAS TOLD TO STAY UT AS I WAS TOLD AGAIN LAST WEEK. mRS wHETSTONE IS VERY GOOD AT HER JOB IN FACT THROUGH ALL THIS SHE HAS BEEN THE MOST HELPFUL SHE IS A GREAT ASSET TO BAC. So now i have to vacate my family of 6 in 3 days. I know there is a mistake but no one will help me I begged mrs Fleetwood to lease contact Mrs Whetstone over and over again to correct this.We got behind due to unemployment and are loosing our home and never will be able to buy a home again for the rest of our lives at our age our children are being tossed out onto the street because we have been advised from BAC wrong. If I would have been allowed to ay the money for the forbearance last FEBRUARY WE WOULD STILL BE IN OUR HOME and up to date.This is wrong I have all my false documents they claim to have sent I got them from BAC. two of them show denied for a MOD after the sale date in June and August. I was contacted by them after I thought they sold my house that i qualified for A DOJ. I spoke to the DOJ department and was informed I had never applied for one. Everytime my file is sent to a new person this happens. The other letter of denial states my out going is over $9000.00 and my income is$5200.00 that was later found to be an error on their part because the entered my finances twice. The other one states I am denied because I can afford my house. Yes I can now my husband and myself were unemployed for a total of 15 month during this process. We have both return to the same companies we have worked for greater then 15 yrs.. All we want to do is pay for what we are supposed to. And due to lack of communication within BAC we are being tossed out on the streets. I can at anytime provide proof of all this I have retained all Paper work and phone records.

We were able to get the money back from Moneygram and pay over $3000.00 to reinstate the loan.  At this point our payments went up $55.00 monthly.  We were told this was escrow.  I can find no evidence to this effect. We have have had this loan with Ocwen for 18 years and it has been nothing but a heartache.  We are unable to understand the customer service representatives because they do not speak English well enough.  We are never notified of changes and this morning, I went online to make my payment and am unable to get into the 'MAKE A PAYMENT' icon! Because of all of this, our credit score has plummeted and nobody will refinance the loan for us.  ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

West Palm Beach, Florida USA ",www.ocwen.com, 863-677-5119,," I was two months behind on my mortgage so at the beginning of the following month I sent a check for 3 months in order to catch up.  Two weeks went by and my check hadn't been cashed.  I received papers from an attorney that my house was being foreclosed on. I called Ocwen to find out if they received my check and why I got foreclosure papers.  They told me that they couldn't accept my personal check since I was more than 2 months behind on my payments. They said they needed a certified or cashier's check to cover the payments.  I asked them if they sent me a letter telling me this and they said they only make an internal note of it and don't send letters to the homeowner. I told them that i could send them a cashier's check the following day and asked if they would return my personal check.  They said they didn't do that either; they just shred the personal check.  I told them that I wasn't going to send a certified check unless they promised to send me back my personal check.  I spent over an hour on the phone with them.  They gave me a phone number that they said I would need to call if I wanted my personal check back. The very next day, I got another call from Ocwen informing me that I was behind on my payments.  Before the rep could finish, I told her she needed to check her computer and see if there were notes in there that I had spoken to someone for over an hour just a day earlier.  After yelling at her for 15 minutes, she finally acknowledged that there were notes and she apologized for calling me. The following week I got another call from them.  I had tracked my certified check and found that they did receive it.  I asked the person who called if they did receive it.  He said yes they did.  I asked him why he eas calling and he asked when I was going to send my next payment even though it isn't due for two more weeks. i told him they would receive it in plenty of time.  The very next day, they called again...I didn't answer the phone.

They sent me the settlement check but still no refund for the extra month's payment. I called again yesterday and was told to wait till the end of this month before I will hear back from them.

 WELLS FARGO HOME MORTGAGE ,"  WELLS FARGO HOME MORTGAGE  800 Walnut 
Internet USA ",wellsfargobank.com/mortgage, 866-570-5277,," In January I had to move to spontaneously for a new job. I listed my house with a realtor on December 26, 2012 in order to sell it. At the same time I contacted Wells Fargo about doing a shot sale because the housing market where I live is almost non-existent, therefore I tried to do the right thing. I could not and still can not afford payments on two places (I am currently having to rent), and informed them of this fact, in addition to not having a paycheck for the entire month of January.  They assigned me a mortgage preservation specialist named Latoya Freeman. Right after I spoke with her the first (and only) time, she has only sent me paperwork in the mail. I was informed that all I needed to send to them to start the process was 30 days of income, which I could only provide from the last pay stub of my former job and the one pay stub from my new job I received on January 31. I also provided them with a copy of my current lease agreement and was told this information would be enough.  A few weeks later, I called to find out the status of the short sale and was informed they had closed the process because I did not give them all the information, when I informed them they told me I only needed to provide them with the information they originally told me to send them, they said I was wrong and accused me of lying. I argued with them for several minutes when they agreed to reopen the short sale process, but I had to provide them with 2 years worth of tax returns (???) and 90 days of bank statements. I asked them why they needed the tax returns and bank statements when I didn't have to provide them in order to purchase the home.  Their response was because FHA said so. I could not believe the childish reply they gave me. I told them they were not going to get my tax returns because my children's social security info was in it and was told to black it out. Again I asked why they needed it and they asked me what I was hiding. I lamented and agreed to send them the portion of the return showing what I made for the year and what I received back, but the bank account is joint and because the other owner and I are not married, I could not give them the information since I did not have consent.  Again they accused me of hiding something and said they needed all of the pages of the tax return, which is close to 90 pages in some instances. They still could not give me a valid reason why and told me they would forward my inquiry on and that I was to contact them back in 48 hours to find out the answer. I told them I was working that day, but gave them consent to leave a message on my voicemail and that it does say my full name. However, they again informed me it was my responsibility.  I called Latoya more than a half dozen times, left voicemails, spoke to her manager, her manager's manager and to this point I have never received a call back. They keep sending me generic letters thanking me for my interest in the short sale process, thanking me for talking to them (but I have not talked to them) and now they are calling me 3-4 times a day. On April 1, 2013, my realtor called me and quit because she could not talk to anyone at Wells Fargo, could not access any of the paperwork on Equator they said was there. She called them to find out why she couldn't get to the paperwork and was told to call tech support, tech support told her to call the bank back. She also informed me that she had someone who wanted to purchase the home but was only prequalified for $90,000. I owed $94,000. If the short sale would have gone through I could have sold the house before it was to late. When I called the bank about it, they told me to get another realtor and start the process over. I understand I did not make the payments and the house is going into foreclosure because of it, but they refused to work with me, so I could try my hardest to do the right thing. They are still fighting me, harrassing me, and finally I had to demand they cease contacting me.  Is there anything I can do about how they stone walled me into foreclosure when I could have sold the house back in March? I am so furious with how they dealt with me and my realtor.  ",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Virginia beach , Virginia USA ",myloancare.com, 866-920-8932,,"   I got a phone call saying my homeowners insurance had lapsed. I wasn't surprised, because I've been through this each year since I bought my home. I was surprised when I called the insurance company and was told the last payment they received was May 11, 2011. Today is May 1,2013! I was shocked that I hadn't had any insurance for an entire year. I called and they couldn't explain why it was never paid. I had even received a refund a few months back from them and called to make sure everything was taken care of and paid for before I cashed it. They assured me all was hood and the money was mine. Even then they didn't find that they hadn't paid my premium. I brought that up in our conversation and again, they had no explanation. After all this back and forth, I was told I needed to call my insurance company and have it taken care of. They will gladly pay my premium for this year, but I also have to pay them back for my premium last year that was refunded. So I have to pay for insurance I didn't even have for a year so it doesn't show I had a lapse in coverage. Why should I pay for insurance I didn't have? Had my house burned down, I would have been out of luck. I'm sure they wouldn't refund any money or forgive my loan because THEY didn't pay my premium. That's their job. That's what I send them money for. To make sure these things get paid. They are completely incompetent. My insurance has lapsed every time it came up for renewal. And this time they just can't give me any reason but I have to pay double insurance because of their incompetence. They are useless and their customer service is a joke. I plan to fight this mess as well as beginning the process of refinancing just to get shed of them. I don't think I should have to pay for their mistake.

I called to check in with Met Life and was told that our mortgage had been sold so to call the new company.  I called them and they told me to call back in two weeks to wait for all the paperwork to transfer over.  Not all the paperwork did transfer for the modification process so I had to provide more paperwork.  We were assigned someone to our account but they were on vacation until June 1.  Our home was scheduled for Foreclosure on June 18, which we were told was just a procedure that had to take place on paper while our loan was in modification process.  They told us when we got to the foreclosure date, we could call and they would extend the date of foreclosure since we were in Modification Process.  I was nervous about that.  On or right about June 14 I called and was told we were denied the modification because we owed too much money and didn't make enough money.  I called a Bankruptcy attorney in May and was prepared for this.  We filed Bankruptcy immediately that day to keep the foreclosure from happening.  Our bankruptcy included a second mortgage with Chase Bank (as we had just built our home three years prior and had a construction loan and that didn't include some of the necessary work such as gravel, heavy equipment work, landscaping, etc.)  Our Bankruptcy was final in August of 2010.  We did not include the home mortgage in BK because we were told home mortgages go through foreclosure not BK.  In September 2010 we received a call from Seterus asking if we wanted to apply for Loan Modification.  I told them they denied us so we filed BK.  They told us now that we filed BK and didn't owe other lenders money, we could qualify.  (How honest is that on their part?)  We called our attorney and they said to go ahead and try.  We applied and went through the entire process again.  After calling them every two weeks to check on the status, finally in December 2010 I called to see if anyone at Seterus had been assigned to our account and I was told someone was. However, when I pressed her extension number a recording came up saying she was permanently unavailable, don't leave a message and the phone hung up.  I called back and talked to a person and he was on the phone with me for over an hour.  He called that extension and was appalled to find out that there was no employee listed by that name and felt it was a phantom extension to get people off the phones.  With that, I faxed a letter to Seterus with our FINAL offer to have them modify within two weeks or foreclose because we weren't going through their games.  About three weeks later, January 12, 2011, we received a certified letter saying we qualified for modification and if we agreed to the terms, to sign the forms and send them back in.  It was a nice deal, 2% interest for 5 years, after that the interest would go up 1% per year until the interest reached 4.75% where it will freeze for the life of the loan.  They also offered to remove $5,000 off our loan balanace at the end of 5 years if we paid all payments on time (which we have).  I called to make sure this was legitimate and asked if there was any ""cost"" to this modification process.  I was told ""no"" there are no costs at all to you to modify.  Then I asked, ""Will there be any additional costs to me at all for any of this?  If there are ANY costs to me, then I will not go through with this.""  I was again, told ""No ma'am, there are no further costs to you at all.  You sign the papers, you begin paying your new mortgage balance and there will be no further charges to you.""  We signed the forms, sent them back and began paying our new mortgage balance.  About two months later, I received a statement that showed I owed over $3,300 more than my payment.  I immediately called and asked what that was about.  I was told that it was for attorney fees to remove our home from foreclosure.  I said, ""Wait a minute, I specifically asked if there were going to be any charges and I was told no, so I want these fees removed immediately.""  I was told the fees were not going to be removed, and... that there would be NO interest charged on these added attorney fees that they said I owed.  They also said I didn't have to make any payments on that amount until the loan was paid in full at the end of the loan agreement period.  I was told that those fees were to pay the attorney to remove the home from the foreclosure process.  There were several different fees included to total $3352.75.  There was a woman at Seterus named ""Heather Umstead"" who said that any legal fees fall into the original term of the loan.  After looking at the original term of the loan, I don't see anything that says I am to pay fees to pay an attorney to remove my loan from foreclosure.  I feel Seterus is ripping me off and they are getting away with it.  I can't afford an attorney to fight this, so I have left this balance on their books, showing that they are charging me for something that is not due by me.  If anyone else has had this happen, I would appreciate hearing about it.  I am ready for a class action law suit, but I cerrainly don't have money to fight these people. By the way, I have over 20 pages of notes that I took from every single phone call that I made to the lenders during this process.  I documented everything.  Evidently they don't feel that an employee telling me there are no charges further for me, is a reliable action on their part.

										This all started when my husband at 43 yrs of age had to have an unexpected double bi-pass.  I called PNC Mortgage and informed them of the health issue and that we wouldn't be able to pay the next months payment ande asked if we could skip that payment.  They agreed but said that we would have to make the payment up in 3 months on their payment plan.  I explained that made our payment too unreasonable and asked if it could be added to the end of the loan.  They refused and stated that this was our only option.Every time we were at the 3rd month of the repayment plans, our check mysteriously would be late even though it had been mailed to them in plenty of time.  We would be told that they would have to start us over on the 3 month payment plan.Last June we were out of town and when we returned home there was a notice from PNC that because we were going to be 2 months late if not paid by a certain date they would file foreclosure.  The date was while we were gone so we were completely surprised.  We called PNC and they stated that it was too late, they already  turned us over to their attorney.  We had been in contact with PNC while we were gone and had made payment arragements and NOTHING was ever said to us about this letter that was sent to us.  We called their attorney who stated that if PNC would tell them to do so they would turn it back over to PNC and their would be no fees or foreclosure process.  PNC told us to call their attorney. This circle continued until the attorneys filed, we were served our papers, the information was put in our hometown newspaper and we were humiliated.It cost us over $8000.00 to get out of foreclosure.This year we had to miss a payment because we are still trying to catch up on all of our bills from after having to come up with $8000.00, the bi-pass and my husband breaking his leg and losing his part time job because he had to be off work for 3 months because of breaking his leg.PNC called us and stated they needed the money.   We explained our situation (AGAIN) and asked if we could pay $600.00 and then in a couple of weeks after getting paid the next payment we would pay $638.00 which would then have us up  to date.  The person we spoke with stated that we could.A couple of weeks later, just before getting paid, PNC calls stating they need $1238.00 now. We stated that we had paid them $600.00 and we would be sending the $638.00 in a couple of days after we got paid.  They stated that they don't except partial payments and that they cashed our $600.00 check and had sent us a reimburement check for that $600.00 and wanted the $1238.00 now.We explained that without the $600.00 that they were now sending back to us we could only pay them the $638.00.  They stated they don't take partial payments and that if wasn't their fault we were told that by someone else that works for PNC.  Once my husband received the $600.00 check from them he went to our local PNC to make the payment of $1238.00 and now our April payment.  He was then informed that they couldn't take our money (that would have us paid completly up to date) because they had turned us over for foreclosure again.We've spent the last week making phone calls to PNC who tells us to call their attorney who then tells us to call PNC.  Again, this has gone on until we were served our papers on Friday.And instead of being $8000.00 like that last time, it is only $4000.00.....we don't understand how for the same mortgage, same number of payments it's HALF the cost....We are seeing an attorney tomorrow to see what can be done....If anyone has any helpful information we would LOVE to hear from you!!",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Knight he never stated that there were any problems and he also stated that we shouldn't have a problem with having getting another loan under FHA when he was full aware that the home we are in now was an FHA. We asked him did we need to sale our current home numerous times before this process started and he stated that we didn't need to because our ratio was high. Then he call and stated that we need to rent our current house out even though this wasn't stated in the contract so we complied with this and the loan was still denied.

										I refinanced my home through Round Point Mortgage about 16 months ago. During that period I have routinely included additional principal payments. The additional principal is clearly marked on their payment statement stub. Over a half dozen times they have ""mistakenly"" either assumed this was an early house payment, considered the entire payment additional principal and charged a late fee. The policy seems to be that additional interest is assumed even though clearly marked on the payment stub and check. I even tried sending separate checks with a post-it note stapled to the check marked additional principal in addition to clearly marking the extra principal amount in the designated section of their payment coupon. I am not quite sure that their staff could actually be completely ignorant or illiterate. It amazed me the wasted resources they spend in sending the late payment notices, calling to inquire about the ""late payment"" and the time spent on the phone with us and their management to correct the misapplication of our payments. We have never been late with a payment, early perhaps, but their incompetence is  so consistent, I can only think it is a policy to maximize profits through late fees or excessive interest charges. I even asked them on the phone why anyone would want to pay the interest charge early when the coupon is marked additional principal, even the manager was trying to persuade us that it is common for customers to pay additional interest?

To Whom It May Concern:
This firm represents Richard Loether. Mr. Loether has requested that we contact you regarding the payoff refund/overage checks that Nationstar Mortgage, LLC (Nationstar) delivered to Mr. Loether following his re-finance of his Nationstar loan on the above-referenced Property. The checks in question are Nationstars check number 0001190320 in the amount of $798.66 and check number 0001185558 in the amount of $507.03 (copies enclosed). These refund checks were incorrectly made payable to both Mr. Loether and his ex-wife Suzi Loether. Mr. Loether has been unable to resolve this issue with you directly and has been forced to engage our assistance in this regard.
Pursuant to the terms of the parties divorce, these refund checks should have been made payable to Richard Loether only. Section 5.01(A) of the parties court-approved Settlement Agreement (copy enclosed) clearly provides that the Property and the Nationstar encumbrance thereon were awarded to Mr. Loether as of June 1, 2012, when the Divorce Decree was entered. To further evidence her relinquishment of all right, title, and interest and to the Property, Suzi Loether executed a Quitclaim Deed to Richard Loether on October 23, 2012. Richard Loether refinanced the Property on November 2, 2012, at which time Suzi Loether had no legal interest in the Property or in the Note and Deed of Trust encumbering the Property.
Please re-issue the checks payable to Richard Loether at your earliest convenience.

										I am writing this to save some folks some frustration. Do NOT waste your time trying to refinance with Nationstar. They won't talk to you and will go out of their way to  call you when you are not available and/or at numbers where you cannot be reached (if they reply at all).
It all begins in November of 2012, well, even before then. I had my mortgage with Bank of America (started as Countrywide). BOA refused to talk to me about a refinance. Finally, I get a letter that Nationstar is taking over my mortgage account from Bank of America. They have me submit a form online that gives me online access to my account. 
I click on a link on Nationstar's website about refinancing (on or about December 18). To date, no one called me back in response to that.
In March, probably around the 12th or 13th I submitted another form in response to a mail-piece I received by USPS talking about refinancing for a lower rate. A couple people call, one a man and woman named Jenna Bannister. I call Jenna back on the 14th. I get voice-mail.
Jenna emails me on the 15th (Friday). I had let her know in some voice-mail around this time I was unavailable during the day and to call me in the evening or between 2:30 and 3:30 (my lunch time) in the afternoon. 
I called again on the 19th. No answer. Left Message.
Emailed on 20th that I didn't have my phone, when is a good time. Response was that she was in 11-8 on Wednesday.
Called, again no answer. Left message. 
This goes on for another week or so. On March 28th we are still playing phone tag. I call her. I leave a message to call me back on my home phone. 15 minutes later she calls on my Cell which I do not have on me. I call back shortly later and voice-mail again.
There were multiple times I try to call. I try to give specific availability. I tell her when and where I will be available and without missing a beat I either get called while I am at work, at the wrong number, or both (several calls in the afternoon around 2 to my home phone).
So far it's been over 2 weeks without any contact whatsoever.
Obviously I am just getting the run-around. I guess I'll just have to refinance somewhere else. Nationstar  is just sending these emails to waste our time with no intention of refinancing anything. It is just their way to ""keep up appearances"". 
If anyone has successfully refinanced at Nationstar, please tell me who I can call who will actually help. Thank you,

 Gaithersburg, Maryland United States of America ", , 877-337-7508," FNC Insurance Agency, Inc. - Citi Bank Bi-Weekly Mortgage Payment Plan  Total Scam  Gaithersburg, Maryland","
										I'd had this service for several years. The PROMISE was that I would be able to pay off my home in ten less years on my 30 year mortgage.
Everything was fine, as long as I was with CitiBank (aka Greedy Corporate SCUM). When my insurance would go up or down, the Greedy Corporate SCUM would raise or lower the payment amounts, as necessary.
Then the SCUM sold my mortgage to some fly-by-night lender nobody's ever heard of. Fine, whatever. The GCS are this way: When you stop making enough money for them, they boot you to the curb. Same as always.
Now when things go up or down, I'm left holding the bag for the remainder of the payment to mail to my lender (even though the biweekly amount is FAR more than the monthly payment would require!), or left out without recourse to getting my money back without a LOT of paperwork. This is the thing: You can send mail to the FNC SCUM for MONTHS, and never get an answer, never get your change filed. I was about at the point of resigning myself to having to send the extra money, when I got notice that my payment would soon go up AGAIN. Oh hell no.
So I sent the paperwork in YET AGAIN, this time certified. I GOT IT BACK. The address, if you don't write it perfectly with the weird 3000 thing at the end WILL NOT GO THROUGH WITHOUT IT. Oh yeah? Fine. I went to my bank and put a permanent stop payment on it. And then I called FNC and told the SCUM that they were FIRED. They said I would have my money in 7-14 days.
And this is when you get to learn just how much of greedy corporatist scum this outfit is.
I had stopped the bank drafts in the middle of the monthly cycle. DON'T DO THIS. For the love of everything holy, DO NOT DO IT. WAIT. Seriously. WAIT. Never let these scumbags have any of your money to hold onto.
I called them on the second to cancel the service. I got a letter that was dated the 5th, and postmarked on the 8th, and probably sent out on the ninth, for it was not in my mailbox until the 12th.
Got all that. It's TEN DAYS since I called them before I got mail from them.
And what is the mail? My check? OF COURSE NOT! No, I've got a demand that I sign paperwork, not my check!
EXCUSE ME? Where's my stinking MONEY that you frauds said I'd get in FOURTEEN DAYS? That's MY money, you frauds--NOT yours! Where is it? Give it to me and give it to me NOW!
Of course, they can take your money instantly and electronically, but it KILLS them to give it back to you the same way. No, these filthy, greedy corporatist SCUM are going to hang onto YOUR money, MY money, until they can wring every penny of it they can from it before having it forced from their hands. And then they're going to send it to you BY MAIL, so that THEIR account balances are nice and pretty while yours and mine look like crap.
Whatever you do, DO NOT get this fraud of a payment system. They DO NOT send it to every lender every two weeks, like they say they do. They ONLY send it by month. You ARE NOT getting the benefit you were supposed to from it, which is your house payments coming down enough to pay off your home in 21 years. It's a lie, it's a scam, and it's a FRAUD.

Fort Worth, Texas United States of America ",http://www.colonialsavings.com/index.asp, 877-413-7214,"Colonial Savings Mortgage F.A.  Refused mortgage payments Fort Worth, Texas","
										My mortgage had been sold to Colonial Savings. I had never missed a payment, nor was I ever late making a payment until October of 2009. I became two months behind on my mortgage after losing my job and my spouse's income as well. I sent a payment for one month, only to have my check returned to me by Colonial Savings. 
I called and spoke with a representative for Colonial Savings, and it was explained to me that a payment would not be accepted unless it was for the past due amount, plus the payment due, plus late fees. 
During the months that followed, I tried to apply for a loan modification, at their suggestion. I faxed the completed paperwork more than several times before I finally mailed it ""Certified, Return Receipt Requested"". 
Each time I faxed the many pages of the modification paperwork I followed up with a phone call. Each time I was told they had not received it yet, and to call back the next day. Each time I called, I was told that either not all the paperwork came through, or, they never received it at all. So, I mailed it.
After I received the receipt as proof Colonial Savings received my loan modification application, I followed up with a phone call. I was told they did not have my paperwork. When I mentioned I held a receipt, proof that they did indeed receive the paperwork, the woman I spoke with told me she's have to look for it and call me back. When a few days had passed and I had not received a call, I called Colonial Savings. I was told that they did have my paperwork, but that I would not qualify for a modified mortgage loan because I was behind on my payments and was unemployed.
All of this was greatly stressful and left me feeling very helpless.  I feel Colonial Savings purposely placed me in a foreclosure position.  I did list my home for sale with a reputable realty company, however, the market in southern Wisconsin was down, and I was unable to sell before the house was taken by Colonial Savings.

										I will spend the rest of my life fighting this situation..........I guess Brenda and Mia of Home Trust Company thought I should just shut-up and just take it.It is not fear, it is not right and its unjust.I'm tired of being upset; I'm tired of being bullied.Roughly two ago, I called Canada Lend to get a mortgage so I can pay off Rev Canada. I got a call from one of the brokers there that told me I wouldnt have a problem getting the loan. At the time my mortgage was about $130,000 and my property value is about $400,000. To get the loan the broker told me it would cost me brokerage fee of 8712.00 after hearing this I asked for his manager
whom is Jay Palmar who took over and got me the mortgage. He reduces the fee to 4356.00 effective immediately. This is before I got the loan. He fax paper wish I couldnt read I request larger printed copies which was never submitted to me. Instead he said he needed me to sign the paper and fax it to him.When I told him I couldnt read it them he read it to me and instructed me where and what copies to sign and fax back to him. We had agreed that I would use my lawyer but last minute he told me I had to drive to Toronto to use Home trust lawyers. I did so hoping to have clarity but the lawyer had the same small printed docs.The lawyer left the room five to six time to enlarge the docs but couldnt stating instructing me where to sign. I called Jay from the lawyers office I made a few calls asking questions. Everything had changed. The lawyer fee changed, comment fee and added fees. It was too late for me to back out as I had sign paper but the mounts were different. After signing I asked the lawyer for a copy of what I signed and he said no. he would mail it to me with a check.A week later I got a check but no paper work and the amount on the check was wrong. I called Jay and the lawyer sent out another check but no paper I had signed. Sent email to Jay Again asking for my sign docs.
Everything was wrong. My mortgage payment wasnt $1000. I requested. My life got busy with bull and courts and I put my quest to clear this matter up on the back burner. As soon as I had some time to exhale I call up home trust. To make a long story short they told me I shouldnt have signed. I explained other info was read to me. Mai of home trust agreed that their printing is small. (I will be uploading info about my case by weekly I am working on the website hometrustsucks.com where you can view all records and recorded materials.) I am far from explaining why I got an email from home trust days before Christmas that they are going to take my house on Dec 24, or pay up. Instead of them remedy the situation.

										For the consumers that paid anywhere from $450-700 for appraisals for loans they weren't even qualified for I feel so terribly awful. The loan officers there are not properly trained and with the sales manager ""too busy"" to run automated underwriting findings and a branch manager who only tries to make the numbers of loans and loans amounts look high it's so sad. Even the branch manager didn't know that a FHA streamline requires you to have an FHA a loan. No loan there is pre qualified nor is the loans reviewed to see if they are actual loans so borrowers (you the consumer) are told you are approved for a loan gather a ton of documentation pay for an appraisal the loan goes through several hands before a lowly processor tells the sales manager and branch manager these deals are not in fact actual loans. The poor consumers this isn't for all branches but for this particular branch these are true stories. Also keep in mind even the moral and frustration of the loan officers is shown. Educate yourself before thinking about refinancing or purchasing but dont ever use this branch even employees send their friends and family deals elsewhere because of the lack of customer service and knowledge there. If you were to ask typical mortgage guildeline questions to the branch manager and sales manager even they wouldn't be able to answer you. If you have paid for an appraisal and your loan got ""denied"" it's because it was never approved to begin with cause no one took the time to look at it. Such a shame get a refund your entitled to it!

										I would like to give you the history of this account since 
11/2012.
I am self-employed and since 2008 have suffered economic 
devastation. I have attempted to keep my house, which is underwater by 
$58,000.00. In 2012 I was able to catch up my payments. In 12/2012 I sent 2 
payments that were returned to my bank because of a glitch in your computer 
system. It said I owed more than I sent therefore returned the payment. Finally
a person called Nellie was able to correct the mistake. On February 27, 2013 
I spoke to Donald Wright and he told me to send in 3 payments. I asked my 
mother to go to the bank for cashier check in the amount that I was told by 
Donald Wright. Prior to purchasing the cashier check she called the bank and 
was told different amount. Because of the problem in November 2012 and 
statement made by your custom service reps that only correct amount would be 
accepted anything else would be returned. My son and I called everyday to try 
and get the correct amount. On March 7 you place it in foreclosure. Now you
want almost 2400.00 in attorney fees and service charges and late fees. 
1. I have called everyday since March 1, 2013 even though 
your records do not reflect that I have called. I have spoke to representatives 
that have laughed and hung up the phone.
2. I have spoken to representatives that have given me 
absorbed amounts to be paid some that say it is this amount plus attorney fees 
but they dont know the amount of the attorney fees. Then I spoke to Matt on 
3/29 that said he was going to order the attorney fees and call me back in 2 
hours. No return call.
3. On 3/29 I called approximately 20 times from 0900 to 
2000. I finally spoke to Donald Wright by accident not because he answered he phone 
or because he returned any of my calls. He told me that when he talked to the 
owner of the house on 2/27 the amount was not the amount that the customer 
service reps would give and why did I call and not send the amount he told my 
son. I explained what happened in November. It did not seems to matter to him,  if he had answered his phone or returned 
our calls prior to March 7 he could have explained the situation so that we 
could have understood but he chose not to answer his phone or return our calls.
I also called Nellie who handled this loan in 2012, I left many messages for 
her and she would not return any calls. On 3/28 Donald Wright told me that he 
would have his supervisor call me in 30 minutes. No phone call. I called at 10 
PM and spoke to Dwayne Fenton who promised me when he came in the next morning 
at 11 AM he would investigate the loan and call me. On 3/29 I received no phone 
call. I called and got the same rep Matt and he told me that he had the 
amount owed with attorney fees. He gave me the amount. Two hours later I called 
and a representative gave that amount but said it did not include attorney 
fees.									",  Mortgage Companies ,0

Email was sent on January 9, 2013 with no reply, so it was repeated on January 116, 2013  which I got a reply the same day that it had been received.  Meanwhile, I had other debts mounting that I have been trying to catch up for the last 7 months and haven't succeeded. Because of there withdrawals my debts owed amount to $2000 in bank fees and unpaid bills.  
Timothy Ho, President responded first with a copy of the contract I signed that I wasn't aware of giving any authorization to do ACH withdrawals from my bank account. Also provided by him was statements on my account.  This was on January 18, 2013, but didn't fulfil all requested information. This came from Enova International of 200 W Jackson Blvd, Chicago, Il 60606.  The address on the statements were PO Box 643990, Cincinati, Ohio 42564- 3990 with the caption at the top ""Make Anyday Payday"" with the name CashNetUSA.
The 2nd to respond came from ENOVA, 200 W Jackson Blvd, Suite 500, Chicago, Il 60606 from someone called Season Wolfe with the words ""Compliance/Legal under his name.  The letter that came with the material had CashNetUSA.com on the stationary with 773-357-3634, swolfe@enova.com, and Fax: 312-212-1657.  Enclosed was a Business License for Kansas, Office of the State Bank Commision, Consumer and Morgage Lending Division, Supervised Loan License. Also a copy of all my statements and the contract was included which was sent onJanuary 29, 2013.
If the statements said Payday on them then this is not an Open-End line of Credit, but a payday loan with an APR of 299%. I checked with the Federal Trade Commission, Who informed me they were not licensed to do business as a payday loan business in the state of Virginia. The Better Business Bureau had 143 complaints listed against them about bad collection practices and handling of accounts. The Attorney General's Office had no complaints against CashNetUSA. The Consumer Protection Agency said when I explained what I had sounded like a payday loan. The ad online had the caption ""CashNetUSA Payday"" and when you open the website you see the question ""How much would you Like to borrow?""  Their ad did say they did Cash Advances, but nothing about lines of credit. I also checked online for other companies that did Open-End Line of Credit but could not find one that charged over 18% APR. This is clearly a payday loan and I'm sending the Consumer Protection Agency a copy of all the material I receiveived, which did not include the proof that the interest charged did not exceed that allowed by law. I'm also thinking Season Wolfe sounds like an alias and that I've been took for a very expensive ride.									",  Mortgage Companies ,0

										I bought my house 5 years ago, originally with AmTrust Bank, a few years back my mortgage got transferred to Metlife.  Upon transfer, Metlife required a $11 charge to make a payment online.  After much correspondence and arguing, I got them to drop the charge.  Fast forward, Metlife has transferred my mortgage to Green Tree.  Imagine my surprise when I went to make a payment, and they want $12 to make an electronic payment...or a payment over the phone!
It was a ripoff a few years ago at Metlife, it is a ripoff now.  I am paying them, I did not choose them, the internet makes things fast and easy, there is NO reason why a company should get away with charging you to make a payment.
I frequently pay in advance several months, I also like to add more to the payment to lower my equity, I hope to pay off in 15 years, but this is nonsense, it is 2013, I shouldn't have to write out and mail a check to these backwards clowns.  Two minutes of logging on the web and pushing a button...it doesn't cost them $12 to process my payment.  Unnecessary, capricious charges.  Shame on Green Tree.

By Ripoff Report 

 Vanguard Funding approached Ripoff Report with the intent of wanting to resolve any customer issues and reports posted on Ripoff Report. 

As a Part of the Corporate Advocacy Program the member business allows Ripoff Report to send an email to all of those who filed a complaint in the past, letting the customer know, the member business wanted to make things right with them, .. whatever it takes to do so. Ripoff Report always monitors these emails to insure the member business does what they agreed to. The people at Vanguard Funding did just that. 

Vanguard Funding has gone through great lengths to make sure they try and resolve any and all employees and customer issues. Vanguard Funding has joined the Corporate Advocacy Program because they want employees and customers to know they will resolve any and all customer issues.  They never want their employees and customers to feel like they werent taken care off. Vanguard Funding stated on the first visit our employees and customers are treated as royalty, and after that they are treated as family. As service professionals, we treat our guests and employees with respect and dignity.  

VANGUARD FUNDING CONTINUES TO CLARIFY WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY CAN DO FOR EMPLOYEES AND CLIENTS  Co-founded by Brian Ofsie in 2005 and officially named three years, Vanguard Funding has quickly become the leading name in mortgage lending throughout the New York metropolitan area. According to Ofsie, this has been accomplished by providing the best service in the business bar none. A genuine full-service mortgage banker, Vanguard has developed a solid reputation for overall customer service, and most importantly, for closing loans faster than the vast majority of its competitors.
While large enough to deliver the complete spectrum of innovative mortgage banking products and services, the companys core strength is the ability to give every client the caring personal attention and complete information to develop the precise loan package to suit their specific needs. Doing this begins by having the best professionals on our team. 

 WHY VANGUARD FUNDING IS BETTER THAN THEIR COMPEDITORS 

The Leading Name In Mortgage Lending.

Vanguard Funding provides innovative thinking and bold leadership to find individualized home mortgage solutions for every client. The company has always stood at the forefront in advocating  and adhering to  strict standards of honesty, integrity, transparency, and competitive pricing, ensuring the highest-quality service possible, and long-term customer satisfaction.

Devoted to providing the highest-quality service.

From its inception, Vanguard Funding has been devoted to providing the highest-quality service in the residential mortgage banking industry. Nearly a decade later, its a reality. From personal attention for each customer and closing as much as three times faster than the industry norm to giving clients a level of responsive, hands-on attention no big bank can duplicate, Vanguard Funding is a pioneer in going above and beyond the expected. So its no surprise Vanguard has become the preferred mortgage banker for so many frustrated by big, impersonal banks.

Closing Loans Faster For Greater Peace-Of-Mind.

While most big banks take as long as 45-60 days to close on a mortgage loan, Vanguard Funding state they can close the vast majority of its loans in less than three weeks. Thats up to 66% faster! And they do it at prices and rates that are just as good, if not better. than their larger competitors.

A Truly Full-Service Mortgage Banker.

With nearly a decade of experience providing residential mortgage loans, Vanguard Funding states they have the financial resources and professional expertise to provide a full range of services, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages, jumbo and non-conforming loans, FHA loans, reverse mortgages, and more.

Small Enough To Care. Big Enough To Serve.

A mid-sized company in the residential mortgage industry large enough to offer virtually any loan a potential homeowner could need. The companys size makes it possible to offer a standard of personal attention unseen at big mortgage firms. This combination of financial strength and personalized service is why such a large percentage of Vanguard Fundings business is referrals from accountants, attorneys, and financial planners who want the best for their clients.

 Vanguard Funding / Statements from the owner.   My name is Brian Ofsie and I am of owner of Vanguard Funding.  My company practices a hands-on consumer philosophy that lets our company close loans faster and more efficiently than the vast majority of our competitors. While the name changed officially to Vanguard Funding in 2008, the drive for excellence is the same as when I set out on my quest for success over a decade-and-a-half ago. Im very proud to say that Vanguard Funding offers its clients some of the best professionals around, combined with the advanced technology and dedication to personal service that guarantees their total satisfaction. At Vanguard, we learned the lessons of the financial crisis, and came out better on the other side.

CORPORATE CULTURE.  Because theres a lot of hard work involved in the mortgage banking field. And many long hours spent working side-by-side developing challenging funding solutions. Your co-workers have to be able to depend on your full support, and you on theirs. Its this level of mutual respect and cooperation that makes all the hard work pay off. Takes the drudgery and tediousness out of our careers. Makes our people want to come here every day. Do more for our clients. And get more for themselves and their teammates in the process.
ANY BUSINESS THAT CAN ADMIT THEY MADE MISTAKES AND CORRECTS THOSE MISTAKES IS A BUSINESS YOU CAN TRUST AND WORTH DOING BUSINESS WITH .

										Started refi process with Todd, he was very helpful in the beginning. Told me the requirements. 
We met them.  Said as long as credit score was 640 or above, no appraisal. Well it turns out the credit score was above 640. Ok Great! Well then he then says we need appraisal fee $400. We thought about it, and decided to just go ahead, because after all Todd said we would get our money back after the loan was closed.
We got the appraisal done and I received the appraisal the very next day. I emailed Todd asking the status of the loan, based on the appraisal. I would imagine the appraisal came in a little lower than he was probably expecting. 
He responded he had to wait on the appraisal info then they would proceed with underwriting. That was on March 19 2013. 
Ok no big deal, I waited a few more days. 
I emailed him a few days later, no response. My husband called him, no response.
Mind you, my husband called him on his cell phone and work phone. No response.
I figure the VERY least you can do is tell us the status, or even say "" we don't want to move forward w/the loan"" It would be fine by me! 
I emailed him again, no response. My husband called him numerous times, no response or call back for that matter.
We ended up creating a fake email and emailing Todd just to see if he would respond.... Lo and behold he did, and within 5 minutes! Amazing! 
So yes, it started out great, then after appraisal all communication ceased. Thank God I decided to communicate all via email, because I have everything he said on record.",  Mortgage Companies ,0

										Last July I started refi paperwork with Nationstar who holds my mortgage in Las Vegas. At the time my house was underwater as all houses in Las Vegas were. We had owned the house for four years at that time; bought at $270,000 with $70,000 down. Nationstar said the house was only worth $160,000--we owed $182,000. The processor at Nationstar said that in all probability we would still be approved for a 4.5% refi because of our excellent payment  record and excellent (over 750) credit rating. Our current interest rate is 6% and we had been convinced to do Equity Accelerator which means we pay $365/week ($1400 a month) with high penalties for changing from the Accelerator. So I filed the papers and waited. And waited. And every few months I would contact the processor and he said that it was at the underwriters. Four months at the underwriters. December it finally cleared the underwriters but I was told I needed to ""update our financial information."" Fine, did that. February was told the papers were now going to the processor's manager. March I tried contacting the processor. No response. Tried contacting the processor's manager. No response. Finally, today, I had a call from a NEW processor who said that she was taking over my file and we needed to update our financial information before she could proceed. Hmmm. . .this is beginning to sound suspicious. Is Nationstar unwilling to complete the refi because it will mean significant drop in their revenue from us? We had also been told we could go to monthly payments as we didn't want to pay the extra Equity Accelerator payments. 
In the meantime, thank heavens, the market in Las Vegas has improved and apparently our house is no longer underwater financially. So I told the woman that I was going to file a complaint with the Consumer Protection Agency (and anyone else who can do anything about this) and I was going elsewhere for either a refi or to sell it. BUT I also told her that I would continue to make payments so NOT to do anything about my mortgage, like change the terms to their further advantage.
My aim in posting this is to see if anyone else has had a similar experience with Nationstar and, if so, would they be willing to file a complaint with proper authorities too? I am thinking of going to the Mortgage Consumer Protection Agency in Washington and/or the Nevada Attorney General.									",  Mortgage Companies ,0

										My home mortgage was sold by BoA to this company effective March 1, 2013. I paid my BoA mortgage online and scheduled payments in advance. I had scheduled my march payment to be drafted out of my checking account on or around March 6th. I received a call from Green Tree on March 21st advising me that I had not made my March payment. I explained I thought I had to BoA. They advised me it may not have been drafted and I should make my payment to them. I told them I had wanted to verify it had not been drafted and would call them back to maker the payment. They explained I could make a payment over the phone or online like I had done with BoA. They told me all fees would be waived including their normal $12 phone or 1x payment fee for the 1st time customers to Green Tree. They told me if I was to set up auto pay, there would be no fees associated with that. I then verified and found that the March payment had not been drafted so I called them back today, March 22, 2013 after I tried numberous times to set up my auto pay online. After registering and trying to schedule my payment, it would never allow me to go past Step #1 so I was left to call. I was then told that I could not set up auto pay until I made my first payment which would cost me a fee of $12 to process. I explained I was told this would be waived and the guy Brandon explained they never waive this fee as they are not a bank. I explained to him what I was told. I then asked him if they record telephone conversations and to review mine. He quickly said yes they do and said there was no record of their agent talking to me about any kind of fees, I asked him to check again. He said the same thing, no record of them ever telling me they would waive anything. Brandon then got beligerant and said it is what it is, I'm going to have to pay this fee at some point. I told him this was very unfair and that I would look to refinance just to get away from these people. He then said I would still have to make my March payment and pay the fee, kind of making fun of the situation and being smart. I then asked him if he was calling me a liar and he wouldnt answer me. When I asked him again if he was incinuating that I was a liar he failed to answer me. I ended up hanging up the phone.

WEST PALM BEACH, Florida United States of America ",OCWEN.COM, 888-627-6463,"OCWEN LOAN SERVICING, LLC  REFUSE TO ACCEPT TAX EXEMPTION; PUT ME INTO FORECLOSURE WEST PALM BEACH, Florida","
										Ocwen bought my mortgage from Litton in 2011.  I am property-tax exempt thru the VA since 2009. At 3 different times I provided both their Escrow Dept. and their Tax Dept. a copy of the VA letter.  Yet, in June 2012 I received an email from them stating that I am only exempt from the Township, not the County or School.  When I called them, they told me they didn't send me a letter as they don't use email.  Well, I still have it - and it's from them.  I called the County Tax Collector who told me I owe nothing.  So I called Ocwen to find out why they are not exempting me and I was specifically told ""the VA is wrong; the Tax Collector is wrong - you owe these taxes.""  So I called the VA and one of their Legal Counsel sent a letter to Ocwen quoting the State law declaring me tax exempt and were told there was no reason not to accept it. Ocwen sent me a copy of their letter of response.  In it was stated they have decided I am tax-exempt as of 2012.  About a week later I called to ask why my escrow hadn't been adjusted and was told they didn't know I was tax-exempt so just paid my 2012 school taxes.  Then not too long after that I received a form from Ocwen to fill out proving I paid the 2012 township taxes or they would pay them and charge me penalty and interest!  Of course during these many months, they kept upping the amount I owe each month - the tax escrow and unknown ""other"" charges.  The amount got to where I could no longer make the payments.  Several times I tried to pay my actual mortgage due without the escrow and each time I got refused.  Since the letter from them claiming I am now tax exempt, they are still charging me $407 per month escrow.  Now they have also added thousands of dollars in attorney fees, filing fees, late fees, etc.  About 2 weeks ago the Sheriff knocked on my door and handed me a Foreclosure Notice!  In reading it I find they are charging me an additional amount each DAY for not paying this.  The letter to the VA also claimed part of my escrow is for hazard insurance - which is a lie - I have ALWAYS had my own and paid it monthly and they have proof of it - it shows up on my on-line account with them.  
They are also holding up getting my roof repaired from Hurricane Sandy. The homeowner's insurance co. sent them - by their ""regulation"" the check to pay the roofer.  It's obvious they don't know anything about roofs - told us he can do the 1st 3rd of the work, then their inspector will check it - then they'll pay the 1st 3rd, same for the 2nd 3rd and final.  He's trying to get them to understand it's a 2-3 day job!  He was told ""that's Ocwen's rule - he has to abide by it!"" He said when he asked to talk with the supervisor he was told ""No, no supervisor"" and the person hung up on him!  Today I received a partial payment to give to the roofer - approx. 1/7th of what the insurance co. sent them to pay the roofer. I let the insurance co. know and they don't understand it either.
I do not understand why Ocwen demands the taxes get paid - even if I did owe them. Aren't they supposed to put the escrow money in a separate account and not ""touch it"" for their own use?  I don't understand why they don't want my roof to get fixed the right way - they have a financial interest in this house.  Most of all, I do not understand how they are getting away with violating the State law?  In reading all the other posts, I realize there are thousands and thousands of other going through nightmares with Ocwen, yet Ocwen is getting away with it.  Why?  Who is letting them?",  Mortgage Companies ,0

										This has happened every September since 2010. I could be 6 weeks late and put into a home Re-fi with $1049 in fees every year like clockwork to make it go away. This years they got creative and issued force placed flood insurance on my non flood zone property, according the the old and new FEMA maps. I once had a CSR (after hours and weeks of communication) tell me that the CEO and President of Bank of America would call me the following day at 11:00 AM. Good thing I wasn't holding my breath. Tonight someone called from tel# 800-669-66503 ext 36219 stating she was calling on behalf of the President and CEO of Bank of America. Teah, Right... And 5 months late too!
I have contacted the State of FL Attorney General and, the OCC, The Whitehouse, My local Representative and most recently the office of Gov. Rick Scott explaining our situation to no avail. The story that matches thousands of seniors and elderly on fixed incomes in Broward County FL. My mortgage is over 26 years old and I have only fallen slightly behing in the 3 years I was unemployed from 2007-2010 thanks to the gelp og my 90 year old mother who lives with me. The following is the complaint I sent to EVERY Gov Agency and Politicians on a federal and state level.
This has been my complaint to every agency and government official after trying to clear this up with Bank of America since September 2012.
Bank of America pulls a loan acceleration scam on me every September if I am as little as 6 weeks late. They
send a letter of intent to accelerate my loan and demand $1147 within 30 days or else. This year I wasn't late so they decided my property was in a flood zone, which it is not, slapped forced flood insurance on my $209 monthly mortgage payment and demanded $597 as a minimum payment. It took hours on the phone and 3 months to find out why they raised my minimum monthly payment. They decided I am in a flood zone even though the FEMA maps show I am not. I have lost hundreds of dollars due to taking time off from work to deal with this. I have used up my cell phone minutes over a course of 3 days of being bounced repeatedly to at least 5 departments with every phone call to or from B of A.They would not allow me to make my regular monthly mortgage payment online, by phone or in person since September 2012. They just bounce me through 5 departments with no resolve where I have to repeat the entire situation to
every department to no avail. With the holidays I have also lost time at work and have no way to catch up. I would not have been in arrears if they had not done this. Every September (3 years in a row) they try to put me into a re-modification program I had not requested and tack on almost $1000 in undisclosed miscellaneous fees that no one is able to explain. Every year I lose 15+ hours of pay dealing with them in person or on the phone during business hours and usually dont get the situation resolved until I pay them what they demand. Then have to spend several more hours getting the undisclosed
fees removed. 
They create situations, inflate the minimum payment and do not accept regular monthly mortgage payments. They
either withhold payments in escrow and do not applying it towards your loan or demand a ridiculously high minimum payment within 30 days.  I was unemployed for 3 years and underemployed during the last few years however, I would make partial payments if I was unable to make a full payment. The minute you do that Bank of America holds ALL the payments in escrow (including full payments) and does not apply it towards the mortgage, then they send an intent to accelerate your loan and tack on nearly $1000 in miscellaneous fees. Please stop them from this egregious banking practice. This is the 3rd year in a row they pulled this and I was not behind on my mortgage when they found a new way to force me into arrears by tripling my mortgage payment with forced flood insurance despite living in a non flood zone area. I found Flood Zone Correction and supplied me with the FEMA documents showing my address is not in a flood zone even with the newly drawn maps. 
One CSR asked if they would be allowed to robo dial us and I said NO. They continue to robo-call both me and
my 89 year old mother hourly. 
They have been calling my mother's phone line as early as 8 am on a Sunday morning and harass her.  Today
12/29/2012 hey have called her 5 times in 5 hours and threatened they were going to take her car away and mine. She doesnt have a car. They are getting more aggressive and threatening and scaring her to death. This must stop!

										Nationstar manager admits they paid my taxes twice, expects me to pay for the difference while waiting for county to reimburse them. I refinanced my loan near the end of last year (a process which nearly took a year to complete).  The end result of which was a payment that was slightly lowered, which I budgeted for.
Recently, I was told by my mortgage company (Nationstar Mortgage) that they had paid my taxes to the county twice.  They have since investigated the issue with the county, moments ago I was told by a 
representative of Nationstar Mortgage that the county acknowledged that they were paid twice and that a refund is due to Nationstar Mortgage, but that they couldn't give them a firm timeline as to when that would 
be completed and refunded.
Nationstar insists that in the meantime, in spite of their erroneously having paid the county twice (and they did not detect this mistake until I called in, the result of which was my having to request to speak with a supervisor), I have to pay the difference for their mistake.
I insisted that this was unreasonable given the monthly mortgage payment amount agreed upon at the time of my refinance which I budgeted for.   They claim that if I do not make the payment that my account will suffer (fees and charges), as well as being negatively reported to the credit reporting agencies.
It is unacceptable to me that I have been financially responsibly in ensuring my bills have been paid as agreed, but because of they did not detect a mistake in their system and wrongly paid the county twice 
(which both Nationstar and the county agree is the case, as per the Nationstar managing supervisor I spoke with moments ago)... I am expected to pay an additional amount... or suffer the consequences of 
having my account and credit penalized.									",  Mortgage Companies ,0

										In December 2012, I contacted Navy Federal Credit Union to apply for a 100% financing loan for a new construction condominium. I completed the information online. After applying through the online system I received an email notifying me that my loan officer would be Mr. Marcus XXXX.
I immediately contacted Mr.Marcus and informed him that I am purchasing a townhouse condominium in  MD and would like to use 100% financing. From the onset my relationship with Marcus has been tumultuous as he did not explain the NFCU loan process and the documents that he required. At one point I was so frustrated that I told him to contact another member of my family because he and I were not communicating well. He was very unprofessional throughout the entire process and I had a difficult time getting him to respond to my emails and phone calls.
As the process moved on I was stuck in the middle between him and the construction company-Ryan homes and their financing procedures. Ryan Homes does not provide 100% financing so I did not use their financing but decided to use NFCU instead. A few weeks ago I was notified by Ryan Homes that I was to pay additional monies for preconstruction/downpayment. I contacted Marcus and he informed me that he was not getting in the middle of the dispute between Ryan homes and I and that was something I would have to figure out myself. 
I was confused because I thought that if I used NFCU 100% financing, I would not have to pay anything other than the down payment and closing costs. I was stuck in the middle because I was given instructions by Marcus and totally different instructions by Ryan Homes. I finally insisted that Marcus talk to the Ryan Homes sales representative and get the matter straightened out. I am not sure if he did because I called Marcus inquiring about the conversation he had or shouldve had with the Ryan Homes Sales Rep and he never returned my call. On Friday February 8th I received two emails from Marcus. The first email informed me that since 60 days had passed I would have to go through the approval process again 45 days before setttlement and to contact him then.Then 4 hours later I receive another email  informing me that NFCU would not provide a loan for a new construction condominium. He asked for the Ryan home sales reps contact information, which I provided. At that point I asked Marcus to keep me abreast of the situation so that if necessary I can cancel my contract with Ryan Homes. Although he sent that message at 8:40pm and I responded at 9PM I have yet to hear from him. I am very displeased at the service I have received from Marcus and NFCU. From the beginning I told Marcus that I was purchasing a NEW condominium and never withheld any information from him. I contacted his supervisor Amanda and she was no help at all and told me that she didnt see what the problem was and that I would not be able to get a loan for a new construction condominium although Marcus said I would and there is nothing she can do and told me goodbye. 
At this point I am working again with Ryan homes who is providing me with better financing but I am just disappointed and angry at how NFCU mortgage department dealt with this situation. I paid $400 for this loan to be processed but have not received a refund even though I was given erroneous information from Marcus. I will NEVER consult NFCU mortgage department when purchasing a home and will NEVER use their financing for anything. I have referred numerous family members to NFCU and I am sorry I did because the way I was treated was unacceptable.									",  Mortgage Companies ,0

										Had fire that totaled a temporary building , they wanted me to sign insurance check and send to them for their sinature. I decided not to rebuild and asked them to return check to me. They refuse saying I have to rebuild the building , now bear in mind this was built out of my pocket and in no way tied to my mortgage and no money owed to them on top of all that.        So with gun to the head I either build a building I do not want or they steal a sizeable amount of money from me. Welcome to the new USA.       Not only this , but I have also read the rest of the letter in this section and can relate to misalocation of funds so they can charge you penalties and I just love the certified letter BS , wonder how much they make a year just off that scam.

										My husband and I purchased a home and closed escrow back in November 2012. Before closing we were told that the mortgage currently on the property was a non-qualifying assumable loan. I questioned this because I had worked for years in the escrow/mortgage industry and know that those kind of assumptions are almost non existant since the 1980's. I repeatedly asked everyone involved, the realtors, the seller, the lender if this was a non-qualifying assumption. Everyone assured me that PNC stated it was indeed. 
Curiously, PNC refused to send out ANY paperwork to our escrow company before closing. I thought this was odd. Most assumption packages are done before title passes. Again I was assured that is the way PNC does it, and not to worry.
We closed escrow in mid November, 2012, and since then it has been a nightmare. The assumption package that PNC sent to us asked for two documents that would in effect make this loan a QUALIFYING assumption.
They want access to our tax returns and they wanted copies of our social security cards to prove our identify.
We refused to give them these two documents. Access to our tax returns is unnecessary on a non qualifying assumption and moot. None of their business. If we felt comfortable giving out that information we would have gone and gotten a new loan in the first place. 
Social security cards are not supposed to be used for any sort of identification. It says so right on the card. Federal Law does not require that any company ask for this. One of the reasons we have so much identity theft is because people give out their private information without a second thought as to who will have access to it. 
When Rose Ann Jackson at PNC repeatedly refused to finish the assumption and put the loan in our name, I asked for the email of her boss. She gave me that and I wrote a complaint to her boss -Crystal Carter-Rhodes. Ms Rhodes did not respond to me for a month and only then when I continually asked Rose Jackson to have her respond. I got a brief email saying that Rose would get back to me after my problem being sent to the legal department.
Rose called me on January 30th stating that the legal department refused to respond as well. I asked for a name. She refused to give me one, with no explanation as to why or any further information other than if I do not sent her the two documents I will essentially being ""renting"" from the seller. This is of course absurd, as title has passed, the deed has recorded and we own the house.
In short, it has been almost three months, after repeated emails, phone calls and requests, and still no service, name change or response to my concerns and questions. Our homeowners policy was rejected by them because it had our name on it instead of the seller. The seller we purchased our property from is now being harassed by PNC and threatened that they will force place insurance on the property due to non compliance. So basically, they are blocking all attempts by us to comply with the terms of their own mortgage which requires homeowners insurance to be in place on the dwelling. 
I am retired but worked in the industry as a professional for many years and in all that time I have never experienced such a lack of customer service, professionalism and basic human courtesy as with the folks at PNC Mortgage. Since my dealings I have gone online and found complaint after complaint about this company as to their horrible relations with their customers.
We have an appointment with our legal counsel in a week to see what can be done about this issue. If necessary, sadly, we will bring a suit against PNC Mortgage. all because all I wanted was an answer and a response as a customer which I have yet to receive to this day. 
In the meantime PNC have been cashing our mortgage payments and taking our money without giving us anything in return. They are creating a reputation that sadly many banks and lenders have today-one as a rapacious, uncaring, hardnose predator. 
I do not know the outcome of this, as I have yet to speak to legal counsel, however I will say this. Run away from PNC. Do not deal with them. 
Jim Rohr are you listening? Do you care? Are you aware of what your company policies do to people and the stress they cause your customers. If so, and you do not care, eventually someone will force you to. Maybe someone will file a class action law suit against you for your unscrupulous business practices. I hope I live to see that day and justice is served. 									",  Mortgage Companies ,0

										 I bought my home in 2004 with Cornerstone mortgage they sold it to HSBC almost immediately, after I was reassured that they would not sell it. I was not notified or given a choice of finding some one else. When I started to make my payments on the home with HSBC I was getting a payment amount that seemed to be going up and up (Yes they put an arm on the mortgage). I count not remove it or get a fixed. The arm never went down always up.    By the time I had to file Bankrupted ( chapter 13) the payments were @1200 and my rate was through the roof. The mortagage rates were way down at the time and I could not take advantage of the opportunity do to having to file to save my home. Now I am facing a chapter 7 and lossing my home even in the ch.13 the arm on my mortgage went up the rate went up and I could not keep up with the payments on the home and the trusties. HSBC has wreacked my life they have taken away land I have lived on for 19 years. I loved my home my grand kids played here my daughter got married in our front yard some of our best time were here, now that is all gone. 									",  Mortgage Companies ,0

										We have been trying to complete a VA home loan with FNBMTG and have been told for the past 2 months that we would not have to pay anything out of pocket and that nothing would be added to the loan. They told us this even 2 days ago.
So today we have a appt with them and received our final HUD and were surprised to see that they have added $3,500 to the final loan amount. (Not including escrow)I asked the mortgage consultant and her manager why this being added and the answer we received was that since the loan took so long to process, all of the money that they received from the government had dried up so they (FNBMTG) no longer had the funds to offset the costs.(That is why we have to pay)
We asked why the loan took so long to close and the reason they gave was that they did not have the staffing to close all of the loans in time. This is not accurate since every time we asked why the loan was taking so long to process the answer was always that they were waiting on other companies.
The loan manager tried to keep us in the loan by offering to pay us $500. Most people would take this to get $500 and have the $3,500 added to the loan.
We asked why we were not told about the $3,500 2 days ago and the answer was ""we did not understand what you were asking"" In the end the manager would talk over me on the phone and I could not get a word in.
We sent an email asking that they cancel the loan app, destroy all documentation and confirm that we would not receive a bill from them for loan processing. We have yet to hear back from them. I wish I would have researched them a bit more before starting as I have now found other complaints against FNBMTG.Scam warning in generalAnother person reporting FNBMTG

They have also stated that on top of this our payment will be raised an estimated $340. a month.
We have talked on the phone with them and they told us the MIP money was sent in as principal.
Again, against the contract we signed.  We are sending them copies of their own paperwork showing that the money was divided for P&I, Taxes and MIP.
What do we do now?  On the phone they say changes cannot be made. We don't have the $2000. up front and being on social security cannot pay another $600. on our house payment.
