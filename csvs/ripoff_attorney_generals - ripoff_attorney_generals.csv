Jerry Moore,"Jerry Moore4020 N 44th Pl phoenix , Arizona USA )",,(602) 402-0175,," I rent rooms in my home, and have done so for years. I made a serious mistake in trusting this man, who seemed to be honest, even though he would talk my ear off, and went on and on about insanely ridiculous stories that I had absolutely no interest in… I had an empty room, and he had some cash, and I let him move in without really trusting my gut feeling, that he might be a problem. I have a washer and dryer that roommates use, and a camera that keeps an eye on the patio where these machines are located. I saw him put a single blue bath towels into the washer, and after the machine cycle was completely done,he added a little more soap, and turn the washer on again, a second washing for a single towel! then, later after he came home he put the towel, all by itself, into the dryer, and proceeded to waste even more gas and electricity to dry it. I took out the towel, knocked on his door, and told him that these machines were designed to handle eight or 10 times as much laundry at once, and would he make sure that he doesn't ever wash a single towel, or any such small load, if he needs more things to wash with his single towel, either wait until he has a full load, or ask me for other laundry items that could fill out the load… I was clearly upset, and he said he would never do it again. two days later he did the same thing, with a couple more small towels, still, about 1/8 of a ""normal load"". because I had the camera footage, I was able to tell him in no uncertain terms that he had better never do this again, as I have it on camera, and he will be kicked out if this ever happens again! I yelled at him.  you're right, – – he did it again just two days later! another single towel., I think he was basically trying to rub it in my face, thinking that he had the right to do anything he wants, even though it is my house. I put him on a one day at a time, with instructions to get out of my house, and he had something else in mind, even after he said he would move out, he persisted and staying, which required me to get him and it fiction notice, and delivered, in writing,so I wasted a lot of time, resources, and he thinks he can pretty much do anything he wants, without recourse. if you are lucky enough to have searched his name and found this report, before renting him a room, or a house, or an apartment, Then I wish you well, if you should decide to go ahead anyway, and rent to this nonstop talk your ear off fool, then you will get what you deserve--as no good deed goes unpunished! I tried to be kind and give this very strange man a break – – as he claimed he had lost his home to some evil bankers and such… I guess that's where my kind heart opened up an allowed this stranger into my house. I will be keeping his deposit, and he has not given me another cent for 13 days and counting, his rent has been unpaid, and I even the police showed up and told me that I would still have to do formal eviction on him, which makes for a very unsavory household while you have a hostile person digging in and refusing to leave, even though they are wasteful, and non-paying     Ain't life grand?

Great, prompt communication. 6/2013 All questions answered, phone calls immediately returned. I was assigned to David. He came by our home, with his daughter built a rapport with my Family and I as we have kids as well. He was personable, friendly and took his time to explain the process carefully. Best of all, they were willing to work with us on the 5,000 Fee, 1,500 down and 250 a month until its paid off... WOW! In the beginning was responsive... I mean calls back in minutes, correspondence by text message.. it was great. Until, 5-6 months later...November: nothing happened... No progress and no communication. Tried Calling, Texting, malled office, I had to take a firm tone before I got any feed back. But, thats what it took to finally get a response a month later, and it was all good for a short while... things were progressing. [continued below]....

Where by there was additional information requested, because it had never been submitted with original Docs as should have been. He was no where to be found. Calls, Text, Call office again.. firm tone...We had to send the requested info ourself, or would have missed the mark. Then finally we touched base, he was supposed to keep tabs on it and get back to us. He swore the docs were sent, but couldn't explain how they never got them, and couldn't offer to do anything about it. 5/2014 We finally got a denial letter, due to information requested from them never received... We called, texted, called office... We finally got in touch and it only took us 2 weeks this time to get a text response from him. I finally spoke with him, he said ride it out, he thought they found the docs and that we should just wait and see what happens. We sent him copies of the denial letter, no courtesy return message to let me know he had gotten them. 10 Days later, since he had gone silent, I sent... ""Let me know if you need anything else from me""... no answer. 6/2014 A month later, I sent a text that read... Checking in to make sure the wheels are rolling please keep me in the loop. If you need anything else let me know. - No response. (not surprised) 7/2014 2 weeks later, I sent...""Please let me know where this stands"". No response.

Connor Group Atria At Crabtree Valley Apartments,"  Connor Group Atria At Crabtree Valley Apartments  4601 Baymar Dr 
Raleigh, North Carolina USA ",http://www.atria-apartments.com/,9197837425,,"  Do yourself a favor and avoid this apartment complex. If you've already put a down payment down forget your money and run as fast as you can. The following is a list of headaches and issues that I had to deal with. 1. When I first visited the apartment I was awed by the woods that surrounded it and the beauty of driving back off of route 70. I thought it was perfect (my first mistake). When I put down a down payment I was told that the pet fee would be a $300.00 one time fee. When we moved in it became a $250.00 one time fee and $30.00 a month every month. Big difference from a one time fee of $300.00. 2. I really wanted a view of the woods and the running trail. So they gave us that view but the apartment they put us into to had mold covering the walls in the master bed room closet. When we said this won't do, they said move in and we can make the repairs later. They obviously didn't know that exposure to mold can significantly affect ones health(http://www.cdc.gov/mold/dampness_facts.htm) They tried to tell us they didn't have any other apartments in this size, we told them we would take a 2 bedroom for the same price and suprise, suprise they found a one bedroom in the size and layout we originally wanted. 3.I scraped a knife on the counter top by accident and it was damaged. I requested that they fix the damage. They said no problem, remove everything from the counter top, we will come in and sand the counter then reapply paint and a sealer, give it 12 hours and then you can use the counter top again. I said that's fine, I don't mind the wait, after all I damaged the counter-top. So they came in and sanded the counter top, and then painted it before realizing that they didn't have the required sealer to complete the job. A month later they were able to complete the work, in the meantime countless plates, pots and pans were stained by the black paint on the counter top. 4. Wood roaches/water bugs/fast moving disturbing looking creatures inside the apartment. 5.First Billing. This is a scam, you are led to believe that by them bundling all your normal utility costs they're saving you money. They're not. What is normally included in your rent is piled on top of it in a totally seperate bill that you must pay online before your allowed to pay your rent. This bill is for water, water usage, sewer, sewer usage, trash charge (for the one dumpster on their property, they don't pick it up at your door, and it's usually overflowing with trash.) Stormwater, Sanitation Fee (I'm already paying sewer twice and trash so it gets redundant), Recycle admin fee (I'm happy to pay as long as we are saving the environment), and your internet and cable bundle which is always $99.99. Normally this bill adds up to anywhere between $180.00 to $200.00. Don't forget that you pay a seperate bill for electric, gas, and a fee to TWC if you want an HD box. 6.Renewing the lease. They sent one of their revolving attendents into survey the apartment and present me with an offer to stay in that apartment. The person asked me how this process went, and what she was suppossed to do. I told her this was the first time I've had this done, I assumed they would have trained you to do this. They hadn't. Then they made me an offer of $937.00 a month in rent to stay in my current apartment. This cost didn't include the pet rent fee of $30.00 a month, which she didn't mention to me until I looked at her papers and said so my total rent per month would be $967.00? $208.00 more than what I'm paying now? (I know rent goes up each year you stay in an apartment but $200.00?) Then she said well we can cut you a deal if you sign today, with pet rent it will be $937.00 a month. I said no thank you, I'll look else where and I did. Meanwhile a new renter moved in across the hall and above us a level his rent, $748.00 a month. Yet I was going to pay $937.00? Turns out he knew one of the many workers in the office and got a special discount. More power to him, and if you have that special arrangement consider these apartments if you can get past all the other issues. 7. When I decided to move out and informed the office of my intentions with a letter that I requested they sign (they did), they begged me to stay. I told them if they would have made an offer that kept my rent the same or decreased it I would consider. They said sorry we can't do that. Then a week before I move out they tell me that I can pay the same in rent and we will knock $250.00 off the first month because of your down payment on your new place. I reflected on the previously listed reasons and declined their offer politely. 8. One week after I move out I recieve a letter from the Atria at Crabtree Valley. In it is my apartment inspection, there was nothing wrong with it, as well as two bills. The first bill was for First Billing, an exorbant amount because aparently some of my services are billed a month behind. I regret not saving the first bill I got from this service to double check that statement. The second bill was for $10.10 for pet fee. When I called to find out what this was about, I was told it wasn't included in my final rent payment. I asked how could that be? You told me my total rent cost for a shortened month and I paid it, I paid you final amount and now you want to charge me more? (Yes, its only $10 but after all the frustration I didn't want to pay it,) I told the manager that I thought this was illeagal and that I would consult with a lawyer. She said she wasn't going to argue with me about the bill, and then hung up the phone on me. When your no longer living there they don't care about you. If you like the apartment and you already live there, enjoy it, you maybe one of the lucky ones. If you considering moving in, run away as fast as you can, it is as close to hell as I can imagine. You might find a better apartment and apartment management in Iraq. ",Attorneys General

new orleans, Louisiana USA ",brunoinc,504-304-4687,,"  I rented an apartment from Metro Wide Apts. aka Bruno Inc. I lived in the Apt. 1 1/2 yrs. I paid my rent on time every time every month. I paid all utilities on time. I gave the required move out notice. My contract says that Bruno Inc has 30 days after I move out to return my Security Deposit. Apparently they refuses to do so. It's been nearly 60 days now and have received nothing. I contacted anoter renter that moved out just prior to me and he said they have'nt returned his either.  In investigating I think I understand why. Louisana imposes No penalties against Landlords for not returning rental deposits. IF they are taken to court they will only be ordered to pay or return the original amount of the deposit. They have nothing to lose by not returning it and then wait to see if your going to pursue legal action against them. If you do and they lose then their not out any extra monies except maybe court cost and figuring that maybe only one in ten renters will pursue legal action to get their deposit back then they are saving a lot of money. I might add that when I looked up Civil Courts of New Orleans, one of the Judges is a Christopher Bruno. I was curious if he is related to Joshua Bruno of Bruno Inc. ",Attorneys General

Eden Prairie , Minnesota USA ",,18007645250,," I received my credit report recently and there was a collection on my report that I did not recognize. I immediately disputed the collection and contacted the collection company. The collection company could not verify any of my personal information. They informed me that the collection was from Columbia House and it was filed 6 years ago. They said that I owed $88.00. I argued that I did not know what the collection was and that whoever the collection belonged to, It wasn't me. I contacted my parents once I got off of the phone with them and my parents told me to just pay the collection and have it deleted from my report, the amount was so small that it wasn't worth fighting. I contacted the company back and they let me know that if I pay in full the $88.00 that they would have the collection completely removed (deleted) from my report and my score would go back to what it was prior to the collection. I was actually going to pay the collection because it was such a small amount and it effected my credit score so much but then I googled the company and found that hundreds of people had the same experience as me, even down to the $88.00 payment to have the collection removed. The thing that really got me was that I called Experian and found that the collection was already removed from my credit due to the dispute I had opened. Then I called the collection company to verify if I still owed them and they told me that the full amount was sill due. If the collection was already removed, then why would I still owe? The company is obviously a fraud. ",Attorneys General

I had to bring up this website, and will REMOVE it, or post that he 'finally kept his word', in 'sending the agreed amount'. My concern? Is that if it must resort to such things as this? To get any Attorney to 'keep their word'? Just how good is it? To begin with? When he does keep his Word? I will post that he 'finally paid his agreed payment' (with whatever interest acrued) as they tend to do 'similar things' IF? Their client does NOT pay them within a certain amount of time. I will post, that Mitch did pay, what he had promised. Once it is received. Not until then. People put their 'trust' in Law Firms, to get or try to get a ' service' honestly billed! To be forced to use this Forum? Caused me concern for others, who may have possibly gone through similar issues with this particular Law Firm. To have to even 'write'? Not one, nor two? But three separate emails, then mentioning this site? Would it not cause you concern? When he pays? I WILL post it.... We even had to threaten to 'use' the emails to 'dispute' the overcharge.....

I was referred to them by a very prominent family in town when I called they wanted to size me up by what I could afford so they but me with a junior attorney instead of Linda Tavis herself acting like they wanted to save me some money. When we got there we met with Shawn Bunyard. To make this a short story, we worked out a payment plan to cover their huge retainer fee. We left there with him telling us he would email the fee agreement back later that day. After calling him back the next day and leaving messages, he finally emailed me back the next day at 5:00pm saying that he would have to have all the money upfront and it would be more, a lot more. I told him that was not our agreement. He basically just said sorry. So you can't trust them. [continued below]....

SHAWN BUNYARD,"  SHAWN BUNYARD  4010 Montecito Avenue 
Santa Rosa, Select State/Province USA ",http://www.tavislaw.com/attorneys-bunyard.html,707-578-9386,," I went to the Tavis firm in November hoping to have Linda Tavis as my lawyer. But after telling them my single mom financial status, I was given to Shawn Bunyard. His initial meeting was mostly spent on trying to figure out the assets. He actually appeared to get excited if it seemed like there was money to be had. Once I hired him (against my better judgement but with the reassurance he would be meeting weekly with Linda who would oversee his work), I realized what a mistake I made. Papers were not filed to the court on time, I would rarely get responses concerning important matters, and he mumbled in the courtroom and made horrible decisions. I ended up worse than when I started (when I didn't have a lawyer!).  After a devastating court hearing, I sent an email asking Shawn Bunyard what happen and why things went so horribly wrong. I got no response for 10 days, but in those 10 days, I somehow managed to accumulate $2000 in fees. His firm lied about not receiving a check that they had received and only confessed when I told them I had a copy of the canceled check. We parted ways in February, but I did not receive a final statement (despite asking several times) until end of April!!!!! Shawn Bunyard also was friendly with opposing counsel and unprofessionally discussed my case with her (found out because my ex told me things he should not have known!).  One day in the court room hall, I met a man who had used Shawn as well. I asked him why he no longer used his services, and he said he could not afford him anymore, his money disappeared too quickly.  Shawn would also brag about how he and several psychologists such as Bob Cassinova, Ph.D. had ""an understanding"" showing me his elbow, like they were buddy buddy and would work towards serving each other's clients. This seemed very dishonest on his part.   He is a very scheemy lawyer, that does not really take a personal interest in your case, but more so in your wallet, and in conning other professionals in the field to get what he wants. I never met Linda, so I can't say if she works under the same principal. I think hiring Shawn was a mistake on her part. He is doing a diservice to a reputable firm, and does not live under the reputation Linda has worked so many years to obtain. ",Attorneys General

The defendant residing outside Placer County Region. Was Arrested on 4-17-12 for a incedent that took place in 2010 by Det.  Chris Glaspell at his Residence without a Warrant, dispite several prior atemps to locate defendant over a 3 month period. Defendant was working and not home most of the time Det. Glaspell was aware of this and the location of defendants work.  In stead A DECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF A WARRANTLESS ARREST WAS CONDUTED, by the patrol unit the detective dispatched to transport me. No laws that abridge the constitutional rights of its citizans shall be inforced. The Public Defender that was assigind by the courts to me for this matter was Erik Randall Beauchamp, the (DDA) was William David Marchi.  During Court Proceedings William had Det Glaspell contact Erik to get me to submitt to a DNA sample. Erik asked me and I sad no, Erik told me it would be in my best interest that was his advice to me, as my Public Defender. Then on 8-15-2012 in the Am I met with Erik at the Placer County Sheriff's Office.  We went inside where we met J.S.Davis the Tech doing the dna extraction. During extration she took (4) referance swabs instead of (1) swab. I questioned her as to why (4) and not (1) she said it was proceedure. The following court appointment Erik Beauchamp was absent & I needed him. Because William told the Court he needed moore time because of dna comparisan results the Defendant had requested. The substitute attorney could not object and told me to inform erik. When I informed Erik he said he was not happy with the DA but never corrected the matter.  This is a Federal Due Process Violaton against the Defendant. Then Erik asked me to waive my rights at the hearing I told him I would not do so. He got mad and said he would waive them for me.  Then at the next hearing William & Erik did not show and the sub attorney told the court it was going to be a stipulated continuance. I told him that is not what me and Erik decided so he informed the court. The Judge then set Preliminary Hearing for the Next week when I came to the hearing both the DA & my Attorney were telling the Judge they were not prepaired and had no ideal today was preliminary.  Later when I checked the case file it said it was the defendants falut because he changed his mine why would they blame me. After that they added a new case saying the same place was victimized twice. Also Jeffery Claytom Moore took the Procecution over.  Then the (DA) begain to waive my rights because of good cause per presiting the Judge. After Multible times telling my Attorney I did not want to waive my rights Erik Beauchamp started waiving my rights knowing how I was against this. The Court in the proceedings have also failed to look into the case file despite open court transcripts by the presiding judges acknowledging my contitutional violations.  Even after (2) years the court still continued the court proceedings. The court in the proceedings also held unconstitutional proceedings by holding court without prior informing the defendant or attorney until after continuing proceedings were granted.

When I asked why he said the arbitrator should be held culpable for what happen during the course of the arbitration. He never explained the repercussions of suing AAA and that we would be liable for their attorney fees $83,000. We now have a judgment against us for $83,000. When it was about 2 months before my court hearing he withdraw as my attorney. We did not understand why until we went to find a new attorney.  He never requested any doctor reports from the dozens of doctor that treated me. Because of this discovery was over and I could not link my injuries to the attach. In conclusion:  He did not do what he was professionally responsible to do.   He got a $83,000 judgment against us.

Each of these men have serious health issues and depend on their health insurance. They were hired in the 1970's and a district handbook states that the employees and their families would receive health insurance for the rest of their lives. In January of 2014, the board of fire commissioners decided to cancel the health insurance for the retirees. This is the thanks they received for the many years of hard work and service they have done for the district. It was more important for Mr. Hafner to purchase $130,000 worth of heart monitoring equipment that was not needed, then to pay for the insurance for the retired employees that was promised to them.

I was in a car wreck 2 years ago, (04/17/2012-03/27/2014) and I am still waiting to get paid. Allstate paid them 3 weeks ago, the check cleared, but for some BS reason I'm still waiting for my money like a bum. I am tired of calling them just to get sent straight to voicemail, tired of them never returning my calls, tired of hearing lame standard lies and responses from them. As much crap as I've been fed from them throughout the years, I should be a well qualified candidate to work at that joke of a law firm. The reason they claim my case took so long is because the company we were suing went bankrupt, therefore, the process changes and drags on. Not to mention, they lost my file, misplaced my MRI reports, (which I had to go get personally From DFW MRI), and continuously did their best to dish out their premium grade A Bull crap to me. I went to their Quacks on Jefferson St. only to have them tell me ""drink plenty of water, watch your movements, and see you tomorrow"". And their doctor Farley, who by the way has since ""quit"", was an even bigger disgrace, advising me to put ice on a fractured ankle so it would heal. How insulting and incompetent these freaks were. Like some bums off the streets just came in and put labcoats on trying to play doctor all of sudden. I quit going to therapy after it was doing my herniated disk more harm than good. It was as if they were purposely aggravating my injuries in order to goad me into going to surgery to get more money from the insurance company, and all at my bodies' expense of course. Oh, and boy were they quick to recommend I go under the knife as if there was no other alternative. It was all very surreal. I kept wondering and looking around for Ashton Kutcher to come around the corner any minute and kick me in my ass and scream in my face ""you've been punked!"" Atleast then I would've understood all the subhuman treatment and despicable customer service from these crooks. All in all on a scale from 1 to 2, I would rate this ""Flaw Firm"" a -100.

How can she have this and still become a lawyer?  She had to go & speak to the bar committee.  They questioned her about the peace order and anything else that would stop her from becoming a lawyer.  She threaten me & said if I told anyone about her past violent behavior, what she did to my mother & father, when she was previously married, her husband threatened to leave her, she admitted to me that they got into a heated argument of him leaving, she smashed a wedding picture, & set the bed on fire while he was sleeping.  Later on that night, she was going to take the gun, kill her husband, her children and herself.  There are other things, that I choose not to discuss.  To me, its very apparent, her mental state is questionable & should NOT be practicing law anywhere.  She discriminates against, ethnic groups, making comments about ""white trash"" etc.  I have kept this to myself, but my conscience will not allow this to be kept secret.  My mother is on stage 3 hospice care, close to dying.  Ms. Cockerham continues to harass me contacting me, asking me where I am at, what I'm doing.  I find this very un-professional.  I have asked her to stop contacting me, which she continues.   She has called attorneys ruin cases for me, she seems to have this personal vendetta against me.  I'm at a loss as to what to do.  Do I call her boss to make a complaint?  Do I report her to the state bar?  What can I do?  I need help!!!!!!

Hoffman Law group,"  Hoffman Law group  860 US Highway 1   SUite 206 
North Palm Beach , Florida USA ",,561-296-3311,," I received a phone call from a Mark Lucas from the Residential Litigation Group in August 2012. He clearly stated that his company and firm would be doing a action suit against banks  and that i would be eligible to receive a loan modification and compensation for my banks actions against me. I made a mistake. a Big Mistake. First in believing these people against my better judgement then they say over 6 months you can pay is 1,000 a month and you would get money back on settlement.AFter the 6000 was given to company they required a maintenance fee of 495 a month. I was told in begining these matter usually take within 5 to 8 month to complete. That we the biggest lie in hinesight. To date we are going nowhere. They have my money up front and refused to answer my calls since October 2013 when i spoke to an attorney from the office and told him i want to discontinue being part of the settlement. I was told  "" We would do it pro bono "". I said no. I had received foreclosure papers last February and called the company ... I needed to respond within 20 days or else the judge would sign onto the defualt. I had to file the papers myself because they took so long to act on my behalf after saying before they took my money that they would provide presprentation. I have now recieved thr loan modifciation through my own work. I did not have this company do anything for fear they would screw it up. I have been asking them for my money back that i layed out. I said.. "" Please return the 6000 and i guess you keep the monthly maintenance fee of 495 per month times 7 months.   To date i have not recieved a reply. I was told it might take a couple of weeks to put file in order. I am waiting over 2 months and im sure the legal fee to leave the firm will negate any of the money i have coming back to me. PLease be careful with sweet talking people from these kind of firms.....     ",Attorneys General

Delaware Crossing,"  Delaware Crossing  901 SE Delaware Ave,  
Ankeny, Iowa USA ",www.delawarecrossing.seldin.com,(515) 965-2515,,"  In June 2013, I came to Delaware Crossing Apartments looking for a six month lease.  We talked to the office manager, and we decided to go ahead and put in our security deposit and sign for a six month lease.  A few days later, the same day we were moving in, we stopped in the office to go over the final paperwork.  They had us sign lots of different paperwork including fire safety, utilities, etc, that included about 30 plus pages.  During this conversation we also asked about a month to month lease after the six months were up because we weren't sure exactly how long we would need to stay.  We signed all the paperwork they requested, and proceeded to move in to the apartment.  The reason we didn't need a full 12 month lease is because my fiance and I were getting married in October and were planning on buying a house once we got married. In the middle of October, we had been house shopping, and were ready to put in an offer.  I went into the office at the end of October to see exactly what day the end of our lease was.  At that point was when we found out we had a 12 month lease.  I told them that is not what we had signed up for, and I went and found the original paperwork that said 6 months.  They pulled out the lease and said the original paper wasn't a binding contract.  The lease they had us sign later had been changed to a 12 month lease.  I'm actually assuming the office manager didn't mean to put 12 month in there and screw us, but neither her or I caught the mistake and it was done. I went back in and talked to the office staff, who told me the lady that had us sign the lease conveniently no longer worked there.  I asked what we could do to get this changed because we had absolutely no intentions of staying for 12 months.  I was told I could talk to the corporate manager, and left 3 messages for her with no returned phone calls.  I went back to the office and told them that I wasn't getting a call back and they said the VP of the company would be giving me a call that day.  I had to call the office three days in a row before hearing from the VP.  After speaking to the VP, she told me there wasn't anything she would do, and threatened if I tried to get out of the lease, they would take me to court and get it on my credit record.  She later told me she would try to get a hold of the original lady in the office to see if she remembered the original conversation and she would get back to me.  Needless to say, she never called me back. So after all of this, we had to put a hold on house shopping. ",Attorneys General

I was informed it did go out in march only to be returned because they left off my apartment number. Then I was told because they left my apartment number off I had to fill out a change of address form and that the form and check were in the mail by a company manager who Iasked to speak to . Now this was in April of this year I didn't,t receive this form to fill out for almost three months and of course I ended moving town months later. I called about a month after they received the letter to be told that the check was in the mail and I called a week after that to be told i never spoke to a supervisor and that supposed supervisor did not care that an employee lied to me about being a supervisor And of course the check is in the mail. When I did move in August I was told I could just give them the address over the phone and. I did to be told the check is in the mail. Now I found out they sent the check again to the old address so it has to be re issued and I might receive it by December wow I,m still waiting for the post card saying I would receive a check . when I called the office of the controller of the currency to complain  told given a case number and told the group that would help me would call me and when I do get a call its from rust incorporated the same people I have the complaint about and they tell me the checks in the mail. What's the point of having a complaint line through the occ. another part of this mess is I was divorced and my last name changed so I sent rust incorporated a prof of name change along with my case number and another personnel information twice now to the address they provided by there of their employees on three separate occasion this required bying stamps and paying for proof of my name change at my local court house. Only to find out that the address they gave out was wrong and I never received any of it. Now they want me to send another form I told them to stick it. So even if I do get the check I can't cash it, but I will probably try and take them to small claims court. ",Attorneys General
Blount County Police,"  Blount County Police  930 East Lamar Alexander Pkwy 
Maryville, Tennessee USA ",http://blountccc.com,865-273-5450,," WARNING - DO NOT CALL 9-1-1 unless you are prepared to go to jail! Only Blount County would think of establishing a policy like ""whenever 9-1-1 is called, someone WILL be arrested."" Unaware of this moronic and short-sighted policy, which gives the police way too much power and basically ensures the Attorney General maintains a bottomless caseload with the accompanying increase in income, I called Blount County 9-1-1 for help with my schizophrenic daughter. I am a 61 year old woman with a 32-year old daughter who has been diagnosed with paranoid delusional schizophrenia. She had balled up her fist and was about to strike me, which is why I called 9-1-1. After I made the call, my daughter calmed down so I got into my car and drove home, phoning 9-1-1 on the way to cancel the emergency. I had no idea the Blount County police have a policy that someone must be arrested whenever 9-1-1 is called! My daughter was angry with me for taking back my coffee table, but that was a personal family matter, not a police matter. Unaware that my daughter had accused me of domestic assault (she claimed in one story that I picked her up--she weighs 230 lbs.--and threw her off of the coffee table, and in another story that I picked her AND the 54 lb. coffee table up and flipped her and the table over. Never mind that I am a 61 year old woman and could not possibly lift her, much less her and the coffee table.), I told the 9-1-1 dispatcher and the police that I saw no reason to return to my daughter's apartment since the emergency had passed and I was in the middle of moving into a condo and had a thousand things to do. I have made similar calls to 9-1-1 over the years for help with my daughter and NEVER had the officer order me to return to the scene without any explanation of why. Within an hour, I was shocked to find myself surrounded by police cars in the driveway of my new condo with all of my neighbors looking on as I was arrested for domestic assault, placed in handcuffs, and hauled away to jail for the first time in my life. I was released the following night on my own recognizence, but I am now facing criminal charges and possible incarceration for a crime I did not commit based on a lie from a known paranoid delusional schizophrenic. Now my son won't speak to his sister or brother-in-law, so this is tearing my family apart. If I am convicted of this, I will no longer be able to help my daughter who is also blind, diabetic, and married to a lazy, abusive pothead who has lived off of her Section 8 and SSI for years though he earns $50,000 a year. She is nothing but a free meal ticket to him, and he makes her go without her insulin and medications until she is so sick she has to be hospitalized, out of her mind and defacating on herself. This is unconscionable! At the initial hearing, my muscular 31 year old son told his sister in Mike Flynn's presence that he could not lift her and the coffee table and flip them over without difficulty, so he knows I couldn't do it, so it is obvious her story is a lie. Mike Flynn quickly hurried my daughter and her useless husband away from her brother. Mike Flynn's motivation for pushing my daughter to go to trial no matter the price to me or my family is that he only gets paid when a case goes to trial. The police and the attorney general are supposed to serve their community, not put innocent citizens in jail!!! Blount County citizens must demand that this unjust, arbitrary policy of putting someone in jail whenever 9-1-1 is called be stricken and removed from policy. This policy is unjust, wastes the tax payer's dollars, and needlessly destroys the reputation and livelihood of innocent citizens. Mike Flynn and Hatcher, who signed the arrest warrant, should be tarred and feathered and run out of town on a rail. ",Attorneys General

He did not care at all about me, my case and the documents that I had given him, all he cared was to take my money, as much as he could. He found any excuse to provide me with a new service at an additional charge, that he told me it would be useful to win the lawsuit. He also involved his crew in the lawsuit, saying that they would have helped me. In the end, I came to the realization that he must have done very little work on my case, and guess how I found out!?! In court, he didn't have a clue as to how to present my case, he made countless mistakes, he embaressed me and himself. I know now that he didn't even bother to READ the documents that I had provided him since the beginning of the lawsuit.  Guess what happened?!?! Of course, I LOST!!!

Due to this they decided to move out of the property, and left the lawn unmowed with weeds growing every where. Chase has been called to advise that the condition of the lawn was causing the foot high weeds to slowly spread into our back yard, and that my husband ended up having to go over to trim the weeds and grass.... asked when they were going to get someone over to take care of the maintenance to the property and was advised a work order was opened and property was being transferred to HUD so it may take awhile for the maintenance to begin. I requested being that they were not taking care of the property, that my husband be reimbursed for his time, gas to our mower, and wear and tear to our mower (even if it were $20). They told me no they are not able to do so, and just stated to allow the work order to process and they would have the vendor take care of the maintenance here on out. As these weeds are already taking over their yard, that is the biggest issue for us - we do not want those weeds creeping into our property and stated I wanted a time frame of when they would be there to finally spray the weeds and what not and was advised it will take some time and that was not sure whether they would spray or not, and not to expect it being completely anytime soon. When I was told this I advised how can you tell someone who does not want the unmaintained properties weeds in their yard, that no they are not going to be reimbursed for trying to ensure those weeds are not being spread into their own yard if no one from their company will come to maintain it. This company does not give a S((( about anyone unless you are giving them money, sorry yet last I knew homes are generally in communities like we are in, and none of the neighbors will generally want the unmaintained property spilling over to their own property. Hope that the majority of the employees of this company have to experience a neighbor being foreclosed on, and the property not being maintained - so that they can feel a little more for others, and understand most other mortgage companies will pay individuals the measily $20 to take care of the maintenance when it is a need, yet they are one of the only that feels they should not have to do so....... Glad I do not have them for a mortgage company the snide employees have no compassion!!!!!! ",Attorneys General
Wayne Kristall,"  Wayne Kristall  17200 W 10 Mile rd 
Southfield, Michigan USA ",,248-440-9093,," Why would I be upset about an attorney that lies? All attorneys lie, right? Not necessarily. Most of the time what attorneys do can be attributed to zealous representation. This is when you present your clients information in a way that might lead someone to view it in an nonfactual manner. And I agree fully that doing so is not telling a lie. It might be misleading but what would our system be if you were not able to mislead someone.The ""Pick Up Order"" On 9/22/2011 I went to my sons school to pick him up. Angela Gardner interfered. The police were called. Both attorneys were called. Wayne P. Kristall told the police officer that I did not have my ""Pick Up Order"" and without it, I had no legal right to pick up my son.  As a result of this lie, which Wayne made up, the police released my son to his mother.  What's worse is that when we appeared in court, old Wayne didn't even deny it. [continued below]....
									
										..... He just said ""In all my years of practicing law, I have come across cases where Pick Up orders were in place"". I argued that I didn't give a shit about his history only the fact that he knew very well that there was no such order in our case. Wayne commented that perhaps there should be. Judge Adams ignored the parenting time violation and the fact that an attorney had just admitted to lying to the police and assisting his client in violating a court order.Blind Accusations You would think that an attorney would limit their accusations to statements that their client makes. Wayne attacked me a few times in statements that were not rooted in truth or client statements.  Blind Accusation Against Mediator In 2009, Mediator Angela Asteriou issued a report that said change custody to dad immediately. Wayne went on the attack accusing her of hating mothers and always siding with fathers. This statement was without a single shred of investigative proof.General Ignorance And Unprofessional During our trial, our court ordered pediatric asthma specialist issued a letter to the court stating that they would no longer treat our son. They specifically listed Wayne kristall as the reason. The letter said that Wayne had arrived at the office unannounced demanding to see the doctor. When he was told that the doctor was very busy, he threatened the staff with their jobs. In court, Judge Adams referenced this as ""You all are causing all these problems"". No joke, her dumb a** blamed us, me and my attorney. ",Attorneys General

STATE OF COLORADO,"  STATE OF COLORADO  136 State Capitol 
Denver, Colorado United States of America ",,303-866-2471,"STATE OF COLORADO Governor John W. Hickenlooper STOP THE STATE OF COLORADO'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND ILLEGAL MANDATORY PAROLE LAWS Denver, Colorado","
										Greetings to the American people:
We are the National Committee Against Judicial Corruption (NCAJC), and are asking you to join us in this fight to overturn and stop the State of Colorado's Illegal Mandatory Parole Laws. We encourage you to stage protest at the Colorado State Capitol Building, as well as to write your representative in Washington and voice your concern with these illegal laws that place all of us at risk of having a future destroyed U.S. Constitution.
This is a Petition to the Federal government of the United States as well as the Colorado State Governor and Legislature to issue an order to declare that the Colorado Mandatory Parole Act, Title 18-1.3-401, violates the ""Separation of Powers"" provision of ArtIcle III of the Colorado Constitution and the United States Constitution and therefore, the sentencing of Mandatory Parole imposed upon the American people is an illegal and/or Unconstitutional Sentence. In support of such Relief, we submit the following Claims and Arguments:CLAIM FOR RELIEF:
We, the (NCAJC), in defense of the American people, claim and argue that Title 18-1.3-401, The Colorado Mandatory Parole Act Violates the ""Separation of Powers"" provision of Article III of the Colorado Constitution and the United States Constitution.
Title 18-1.3-401, the Colorado Mandatory Parole Act, makes it absolutely mandatory that the Sentencing Judge impose a term of Mandatory Parole to run Consecutively to any imposed term of imprisonment, and the respective sentencing judges do not have the authority and discretion as to whether to suspend or to actually impose a sentence of Mandatory Parole, or to order said term of Mandatory Parole to run Concurrently with the term of imprisonment. The (NCAJC) claims and argues that this Mandatory Sentencing Violates the ""Separation of Powers"" provision of the Colorado Constitution and also the United States Constitution.
In United States vs. Klein, 80 US (13 Wall) 128, 147, 20 L. Ed. 519 (1871), the United States Supreme Court proclaimed: ""It is the intention of the Constitution that each of the great co-ordinate departments of government --- the LEGISLATURE, the EXECUTIVE, and the JUDICIARY --- shall be, in its sphere, independent of the others.""Now in Hadix vs. Johnson, 144 F. 3d 925, 943 (6th Cir., 1998) the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit declared: ""The Judiciary's fulfillment of its Article III responsibilities requires at its core, meaningful judicial decision making."" See United States vs. Rojas, 53 F. 3d 1212, 219 (9th Cir., ((S)eparation of powers would be implicated when the actions of another branch threatens an Article III Courts independent and impartiality on the execution of its decision making functions."" ), Cert. denied, 516 US 986, 16 S. CT. 478, 133 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1995).
In Rodriguez vs. Cook, 169 F. 3d 1176, 1181-82 (9th Cir. 1999), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit proclaimed: ""Separation of powers is intended to structurally protect the independence of each of the three branches of government."" United States vs. Klein, 80 US (13 Wall), 128, 147, 20 L. Ed. 519 (1871).
In Inmates of Suffolk County Jail vs. Rouse, 129 F. 3d 649, 655-56 (1st Cir., 1997), the United States Court of Appeals of the First Circuit declared: ""Few Tenants are more central to the genius of our Constitutional System than the Separation of Powers Principal."" See Donoghue vs. United States, 289 US 516, 530, 53 S. CT 740, 743, 77 L. Ed. 2D 1356 (1993) (describing separation of powers as basic and vital to our scheme of government). This principal has many configurations. In one such configuration, it insulates the judiciary from unwarranted legislative intrusion.
See also Benjamin vs. Jacobson, 122 F. 3d 1081 (8th Cir., 1977). Dougan vs. Singletary, 129 F. 3d 1424 (11th Cir., 1998). Rivera vs. Allen, 169 F. 3d 1176, 1179-82 (9th Cir., 1999).
The Florida Supreme Court in Allen vs. Butterworth, 756 50. 2d 52 (fla., 2000), declared that the State Death Penalty Reform Act (which mandatorily restricted post-conviction relief for death penalty prisoners), violates the separation of powers doctrine of the Constitution and was therefore Unconstitutional.
In US vs. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), the Supreme Court declared that the Federal Sentencing Act violated the separation of powers of the United States Constitution due to the mandatory requirements involved in the sentencing of Federal defendants by US District Court Judges.
Once the United States Supreme Court decides that a type of statutory provision is Unconstitutional, then its ruling means that the Unconstitutional statute --- or its portion thereof --- has been Unconstitutional since it very first became law. See Rivera vs. Roadway Express, 114 S. Ct. 1510 (1994).
The United States Supreme Court decision in US vs. Booker, Supra, does not merely establish a new procedural rule --- which would render it only prospective in its application --- but rather passes on the very constitutionality of certain statutory provisions. See Schriro vs. Summerlin, 112 S. Ct. 2519 (2004).
In Miller vs. French, 120 S. Ct. 2246, 2246, 2247 (2000), the United States Supreme Court emphasized:""While the boundaries between the three branches of government are not hermetically sealed, the Constitution prohibits one branch from encroaching upon the central prerogative of another."" 
We the (NCAJC) submit and argue that while the Colorado Legislature can establish the minimum amount of sentence and a maximum amount of sentence for each respective felony crime and misdemeanor criminal conviction, the Legislature of the State of Colorado cannot require the sentencing judge to mandatorily sentence a defendant to a mandatory sentence; the sentencing judge must have the authority and independent judicial discretion as to what particular sentence would be proper and appropriate for the separation of powers of Article III, ""Distribution of Powers"" of the Colorado Constitution, the sentencing judge must have the independent authority and judicial discretion to determine what sentence is appropriate in each case.
Since the sentence of Mandatory Parole that has been imposed upon the American people and the Citizens of the State of Colorado violates the 'Separation of Powers"" provision of ArtIcle III of the Constitution of the State of Colorado, the Federal government of the United States, and the Colorado Legislature, must declare that the said statute violates the Colorado Constitution and vacate and set aside the sentencing of American Citizens to Mandatory Parole that Colorado Courts have imposed on the American public.CONCLUSION
Wherefore, we the American people, do hereby pray for the following relief:1). That the Federal government of the United States issue an ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE to the Attorney General of the State of Colorado to show cause within the next twenty (20) days as to why the Colorado Legislature should not declare the Colorado Mandatory Parole Act, Title 18-1.3-401 to be in violation of Article III of the Colorado Constitution and show cause why the Legislature should not vacate and set aside the Mandatory Parole that has been imposed upon the American people.2). That the Federal government will issue an Order to declare the Colorado Mandatory Parole Act violates Article III of the Colorado Constitution and the United States Constitution.3). That the Federal government will issue an Order to Vacate and Set Aside the Sentences of Mandatory Parole that the Colorado State Legislature has imposed upon the American people, and the Citizens of the State of Colorado.4). That the Federal government may grant any other relief deemed fair, just, proper, and appropriate.We of the National Committee Against Judicial Corruption (NCAJC), do hereby sign electronically this document this very day, April 12th, 2013, and do encourage the American people to forward this Protest to as many people as possible.DATED: April 12th, 2013

										I was referred to her by her ""very deceptive"" radio show. 
She was a total waste of time, never replied to my answers without insulting or being rude. She would even send personal remarks in her emails instead of answering the question. 
She charged me twice for her ""storage fee"" and upon asking, she treated me like I had no right to know why my credit card was charged twice, did not give me any explanation, instead sends me a sarcastic remark in the email. 
She threatened to report to the embassy if I share my experience with anyone. 
She ripped me off of $2700 (money I had borrowed) 
Months later, she ended my contract, WITHOUT doing anything for me. 
She wasted my time, money and energy. She humiliated me with her sarcastic remarks, very rude and abusive behavior. She makes you feel so little and she treats everyone as if she is ABOVE everyone because she has a big mouth. 
Please do not waste your hard earned money and time on her. 
Her radio show is very deceptive. Most of the bad reviews on other websites are instantly hidden by fake good reviews. Trust me if you have dealt with her, you will NOT leave a good feedback for her.

										This company possibly did some illegal things to their own customers in order to get more money from both sides. I hired this company to help me evict bad tenants who didnt pay the rent. At the last steps of writ of execution and sheriff service, this company kept lying to me and didnt do what they told me to do at all. In the end, I found out it was not necessary to do such kind of things prior to writ of execution. The purpose of these lies from this company is just letting the bad tenants stayed at my property much longer than it should be. It made me confused. Their behaviors made me feel they were helping the tenants instead of me. It looked like they were the lawyer company of my tenants instead of mine. So, I did some investigation. I called one of the tenants and asked him if he paid money to this company. The answer is yes. This tenant told me he paid about $1000 to this company. This explains everything.

New Faces Development,"  New Faces Development  272 Duffy Ave. 
Internet United States of America ",www.modeltalentdevelopment.com,516 822 4208,"New Faces Development Model Talent Development Scam took $2,795 in total. Told us our son could be a model. Internet"," My husband and my son were approached in the Queens Mall sometime in January 2012.  The agent told my husband that my son could be a model and took all of my husbands information. A week passed and we received a called from Jennifer asking us to bring my son in and that we must come both of the parents for an interview. On January 27, 2012 we had an interview with Omar Tovar who showed us pictures of kids who made it to the magazines and told us that our son looked very cute and he does not hesitate he would be able to get a contract. We were unsure, but he convinced us and gives a discount from $700 to $500 for the photo shots and for one year contract with GigaComp. We also paid $45 to get the pictures in a cd. My husband and I totally understood that modeling is a risky industry and we agreed to take the chance for one year. We figured at least we got pictures if he does not get a contract. 
In March we start receiving calls from Jennifer saying that my son out of five more kids have been chosen by Childrens Place for a four year contract and he will have to go for a photo shot once a month and that it usually takes two days in which he will be paid $200 an hour. She also said that the photo shot with Childrens Place will take place in two weeks from the day she called me. However, she said in order to get this contract I needed to extend my contract with them for one year to 4 years contract so they can keep his pictures in the internet so other companies can call him. She told me that the extension cost was $2250, but I needed to do it fast otherwise Childrens Place will choose one of the other five kids. 
On April 5, 2012 we went to Hicksville and we were convinced to sign the extension for four more years. At this point we were very hesitant with Jennifer. Jennifer decided to have us talk to Michelle Smith who supposedly is the second in command after James.  I expressed my concerns to Jennifer I told her that I was willing to risk the money for one year, but $2,250 sounded bizarre and we were not willing to expend that much more money. She said that she will commit herself that even if Childrens Place will not work out there are hundreds of other companies out there that will be interested in our son. Jennifer said to us that if my son will not get any contract within one month of the extension of it; she will refund us the money. After reading the contract extension it did not mentioned at all that a refund will be done in case of dissatisfaction; however, Jennifer said  I give you my word there is nobody higher than me other than James. I am also a mother and I will not do that.
Well she did it. One year has passed and I have been trying to reach her by phone and email and I never heard from her. E-mails she will not answer and my phone calls will go straight to her voice mail. I finally decided to write to newfacesmgmt@gmail.com and got an answer from Nicky and I also spoke with her. She sent a contract like where it said that they will refund my money $2,250.00 in 21 days from the date that I signed. It also said that with this I will commit myself not to seek for an attorney or do any formal complaints against the company and/or dispute any charges with my credit card company. 
In my last email sent to them I told them that this is no longer valid since no reimbursement has been done. I am willing to go all the way with this and take them to court. My first step has been to inform of this scam to the Office of the Attorney General and I will post my dissatisfaction in any website about them. I hope this was useful for all those parents who like us had a dream. Dont let them scam you like that take your kid to Disney instead or open a savings account for college. 
Will be happy if other parents with the same issue can reach me. It will be great to stop them to scam more families like us.

										I received a call this date  12-26-2012 from a man stating he worked for Dynamic Recovery Solutions requesting that I pay an account  13 years past due with Spiegel Co. in the amount of $11,000.00.  First I explained I never had an account with Speigel and that my son  ( deceased) Donald Cherms, Jr.  had used my name and social security number several times in the past.  The collector stated that I was a liar and that this was my account and  repeated my credit card numbers to me asking which card I would like to transfer the balance to.  I told him not to use my credit cards and that it was illegal for him to vocalize my numbers in front of others who may be able to use my credit cards for identity theft.  The man then stated that he was going to put this aalance on several cards and that I could deal with it. I told him that I did not wnat him to put any charges on my credit cards.   I told him not to call me anymore and he informed me that he would do what he wanted until I paid this account.  I find it hard to believe  that anyone  could owe a catalog co $11,000.00 dollars before the credit line would be closed. This guy was rude and harassing and would not let me speak.   He kept calling me a liar and that I was not an honest person and that I had good credit that he could ruin  with my credit cards.  He kept repeating my credit card numbers to me in detail and yerlling that I would be sorry if I didn't pay.  I told him I was reporting him to the Attorney General for this behavior and he stated that I didn't have any right to do so, as he was collecting a debt from a dead beat.  Dynamic Recovery Solutions is a non compliant collection agency to say the least and a harassing group of collectors that are rude and obnoxious.

Providing aggressive, effective legal representation to clients throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee. *UPDATE: Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. recognized by Ripoff Report Verified™ as a safe business service.  "," Ripoff Report Verified™ REVIEW:

EDitor’s Positive rating and recognition has been given to Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. for its commitment to excellence in customer service.

Ripoff Report’s review of Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. revealed a full staff of attorneys, case managers, and specialists with unparalleled commitment to their clients; Kanner & Pintaluga clients can expect aggressive, ethical, and effective legal representation from the attorneys and knowledgeable staff members who are available to answer the phone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week whenever you call any of their offices. This dedicated team of professionals works tirelessly to get the maximum compensation to which their clients are entitled. Further, they understand that every case is different, and carefully listen to each individual clients’ unique needs and concerns.

Kevin Sobel, the managing attorney of K&P's Georgia offices fights hard for his clients because he knows what they are going through from personal experience, ""I've been there. I hurt my back in a car accident a few years ago and had to undergo therapy, injections and even back surgery."" Mr. Sobel went on to say that he knows “…how frustrating it is to be effected at work and limited in my regular daily activities, so I am happy to be able to help guide my injured clients through their recoveries.”

Eric Pintaluga, one of the founding partners, echoed Mr. Sobel’s enthusiasm, stating, “I have a responsibility and a duty to make sure the clients’ rights are protected when they’re injured in an accident.”The information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Louis Mosca during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..

Kanner & Pintaluga is an accident injury law firm with offices in multiple states. “We provide aggressive legal representation for people injured in an accident. We strive to make sure our clients recover physically from whatever medical care they need and ultimately receive the maximum compensation for their medical bills, pain and suffering,” states Kevin Sobel, a representative of the company. “We are licensed in numerous states and we have a track record of success. I, myself, am licensed to practice in GA, FL, MA and MN. We have no bar issues and thousands of satisfied customers,” he explains. Leads are typically acquired through telephone, radio and internet advertising, as well as referrals from current and past clients.

The sales process typically involves an office associate receiving a phone call from a potential client who is interested in retaining the services of the law firm. The representative will discuss the details of the case and the process with the client to determine the next step. “We like to hold the client’s hand through the process as much as possible to make sure they receive the care they need and receive as much money as possible,” explains Mr. Sobel. The associates at Kanner & Pintaluga strive to be very hands-on with their clients, keeping a detailed file for each client, documenting every step in the case. “I personally touch every file that comes into my office,” states Mr. Sobel. The law firm is also entirely paperless, which allows them the opportunity to work with their clients from anywhere. “The phones are open 24/7. I answer e-mails any time I’m awake. We really try to help our clients get through a difficult time,” states Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. Client Care & Complaint Resolution 

At times, clients may not feel satisfied with the services they received. “The frequent complaint we get from clients is either they didn’t get enough money, or didn’t get money quick enough. Unfortunately, this is going to happen through no fault of our own,” explains Mr. Sobel. He further explains that this can be caused by a federal or state law that is impacting the case, the amount of medical damages they may have, or simply the facts of the case itself. To try and avoid these issues in the first place, Mr. Sobel and his team strive to educate the clients up-front with regard to what they should expect, what types of damages are covered, and what documentation is needed. After a complaint is resolved, Kanner & Pintaluga make following up with the client a priority. “We always follow up after a complaint. I do take it personally with my business,” states Mr. Sobel. “Happy clients don’t post negative complaints on the internet, so we go out of our way to make sure the customer is well educated on the things we can and cannot control. We follow up and the goal is to see clients pain free and walking away happy.”

Mr. Sobel and his team take into consideration the time and money spent by the client, and strive to get the client what they need. “Missing out on a gym membership, lost wages, paying for extra help at home… It’s important that’s clients get compensated for every element of their damages, pain and suffering,” he states. They also strive to keep their clients informed throughout every step of the process, utilizing any form of communication necessary to keep in touch with the client, whether it’s a phone call, e-mail, or text message.

In response to complaints lodged against his company on Ripoff Report, Mr. Sobel states, “I would like to point out that a number of the complaints seem fabricated and appear to be posted out of places that I do not work, by named that don’t match any of our clients or past clients’ names. Even still, we address every complaint, no matter how legit or complete.”

Since receiving complaints, the team at Kanner & Pintaluga has instituted a property damage department where they can assist clients’ recovery, and they strive to be available to their clients at any time of the day. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. / Senior Managing Attorneys  ""The passion for client advocacy and service is obvious at Kanner & Pintaluga. Each client's case is overseen by a senior managing attorney, such as Kevin Sobel for the Georgia offices, who assigns an associate attorney and two (2) case managers who are available via email, text, phone and in person, to respond to questions or concerns at every stage of the process. These case managers are knowledgeable about their clients’ cases and use the same methods of communication to keep clients apprised of any developments in their case.

Kanner & Pintaluga provides aggressive and effective legal representation to clients throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennesee ando ther states, with the highest standards of excellence, compassion and integrity. K&P is committed to obtaining the maximum compensation to which our clients are entitled. We always provide personalized attention and deliver prompt communication so that our clients always know where their case stands.”STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM YOUR COMPANY NAME. ""In response to client demand, and in an ongoing efforts to help clients in need, Kanner & Pintaluga created an entire new department consisiting of staff that specialize exclusively in handling clients’ property damage claims; property damage services are provided at no cost to clients who have bodily injury cases with the firm. This business move underscores K&P’s goal: allowing clients to focus on getting better while K&P focus on dealing with the responsible party and navigating the intricacies of the case. “We want our clients to use their time and energy towards their recovery. They can’t get better if they don’t get medical attention, and they can’t get to the doctor’s office without some sort of transportation,” said Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga property damage experts are happy to coordinate damage assessments, rental car services, and more.  The majority of our complaints (besides the fakes ones) are clients wanting more settlement money and/or settlement money faster. We combat this by providing as much information as possible up front to the clients, repeatedly by way of letters, emails conference calls, and/or meetings, to set appropriate expectations for how cases work.

We work tirelessly for our clients, long days, nights and weekends, to ensure they get what they need. Our phones are answered 24/7 and we respond to emails at all hours. We are entirely paperless and have smart phones, iPads, remote access, etc. so we can work on files and/or update clients from anywhere.”

In summary, after our review, which included discussions with Mr. Pintaluga and Mr. Sobel, Ripoff Report is convinced that Kanner & Pintaluga is committed to quality delivery of legal services resulting in the maximum client recovery and satisfaction.Read more about why consumers should feel confident when doing business with a member of Ripoff Report's Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.

										On August 17th I contacted this Traffic Ticket Lawyer for assistance on my speeding ticket that was $185.00. I was told by the lady on the other end of the phone they could handle it for $60.00. I told her okay that I was checking around and would get back to her, with no such luck of any cheaper rates or with offices handling Richardson City Municipal Court, I went ahead with this company. When I called back I was told another amount this time...but quickly told her that she had already quoted me $60.00 so she agreed to the cost. We processed my payment and at that time I asked what I needed to do now since this was all new to me? She said ""Nothing we will go to court for you and try to get your ticket dismissed if not at least deferred or lowered."" She went thru a quick spill and it seemed easy enough so I let her go and let them do their work. 
After a few weeks I got a letter in the mail from the City of Richardson advising of my new court date. I found it odd that I didn't get anything from my attorney not a call, not an email, not even a letter in the mail. So I emailed them to advise of my letter and to ask what the status was since I hadn't received anything. I never got responded to. 
Sept 18th I get an email that simply says in the subject line ""Court Results""...so I open it and it is a stamped lettter from the court showing my ENTIRE ticket amount is due in 10 days AND that I am no longer eligible for Deffered Adjudication, Defensive Driving or Dismissal of an Expired Violation? 
So what exactly did I hire this lawyer for? To take my $60.00 and get me nothing? Not even keep it off my record?? I call the Lawyer and they tell me its because I didn't show up in court? The last I checked that is what I hired you for and that is what your JOB is....to represent me besides the fact that the person on the phone told me that I didn't neet to show up at court that the Lawyer handles that for me.  So I was not letting it go, I then called back another time and spoke to a somewhat intelligent Ms. LISA...who was very caring and seemed concerned and that I something seemed wrong and she would get back to me after she spoke to the lawyer. Well I didn't hear from her so called her back only this time to speak to MR. HYDE...she was completely different on the phone and yelled at me and told me that if I could have done better I should have done it myself and she wouldn't reccomment me hiring them for another of my tickets and would not let me speak after she asked me ""what exactly is it I want for them to do about this??"" HHHHHMMM let me see, HOW ABOUT YOUR JOB! she said my feelings were not important to her and that she does not know why the lawyer could not get anything better than what he got me which was nothing, and that if i wanted better results that I should go myself to the court and request time with the Judge......REALLY? And when I do, and I do get better results maybe I should go back to them and get an application and get a job there since obviously they cannot do their job right or with any profesionalism. She then hung up on me. It seems to me that the CUSTOMER is always right and you should treat them with respect and be professional. This lady knew nothing about those concepts. I reported them to the BBB and filed a complaint. This is a very bad company to do business with and I would not recommend them to anyone wanting RESULTS.									",Attorneys General

										Tradebank International knowingly engaged in a pattern of conduct whereby they make material misrepresentations regarding positive account balances to franchisees and members of Tradebankacross the country. Positive account balances are situations where an individual barter consumer (a member of a Tradebank franchise) has a positive account balance, meaning they have taken in more barter currency than they have spent. Positive account balances are considered liabilities of a tradeexchange, because they represent already earned barter currency that the trade exchange is obligated to redeem  and because most members with large positive account balances will be reluctant to sell any more of their goods or services in exchange for barter currency unless and until they spend theiralready accumulated reserves. Tradebank of Chattanooga is a perfect example of this activity. The cumulative total of positive account balances in the entire Tradebank franchise system is approximately $15 million dollars (1,2 million in Chattanooga), versus only approximately $200,000 in negative account balances which negative account balances represent unpaid obligations to theapplicable trade exchange, and which in the barter industry are considered assets of a trade exchange. It is the prevailing view in the barter industry lines of credit are essential, and negative account balances in a trade exchange offset the positive account balances and creates a healthy micro-economy within the exchange. Tradebank is all aware of the problems associated with deficit spending (when a trade exchange has far more positive account balances than negative ones). The negative account balances represent goods and services owed and promised by those members of the trade exchange to the members with positive balances, assuring there is sufficient demand for thebarter currency Tradebank have also engaged, on an ongoing basis, in what is known as cash converting.  Tradebank to use trade dollars or trade credits to purchase hard goods (such as a car, orcanoe, or television, or jewelry, and so on) that came into a franchisees trade exchange, without the franchisees prior knowledge or consent. Tradebank then sells such hard goods for actual cash currency and those goods are no longer available to other members of the exchange. Upon information and belief, Tradebank has for years, with the full knowledge and participation of Defendants, failed to properly report all of their own ongoing trade credit purchases (deficit spending) as fully taxable events to the IRS and pay appropriate taxes on such income. Such actions have the effect of putting all of Tradebanks franchises at ongoing and immediate risk of insolvency or collapse. Thus crediting a barter ponzi with all the local supporting businesses left with nothing.  By knowingly causing Tradebank to engage in a pattern of income tax fraud and avoidance (or at the very least by knowingly acquiescing to such conduct),  Tradebank is in immediate danger of potential criminal and/or regulatory actions against it, which could cause every Tradebank franchise to have to cease operating and/or absorb potentialliability of their franchisor Tradebank, which lack the assets to offset the positive balances. I have several supporting affidavits from third-parties with knowledge of certain facts and allegations raised herein. I am in the process of obtaining numerous other affidavits from similarly situated parties acrossthe country, and I have spoken to multiple parties with knowledge of the facts and circumstances which parties have confirmed the same.  Tradebank has a pattern of  misconduct is a clear and ongoing pattern. Taking money from small businesses canceling their unusable from the benefit of Theregion owner of Chattanooga (junner Mootz former owner of the Loft). These Trade dollars are then converted to cash or hard goods then sold for cash. Mootz continues to borrow Trade dollars from local clients and then fails to repay local businesses back. During the last billing cycle some of these accountswere canceled due to the cash fees not being paid. The fees were generated by the regional owner, not the owner of the account. Mootz recently was told by a current client to close his account and take the trade dollars and put them into a non-profits account. Instead he instructed to manager to debit business the remaining amount and credit Mootz`s account instead of the non-profit. There have over 1300 small business`s purchase a membership for 495.00, of the 1300, 800 plus have canceled. Many of these accounts have had positive balances and before they are closed the balances have been transferred to the benefit of Tradebank of Chattanooga and Mootz personally. All 1300 businesses paid 495.00, to my knowledge there have been non that have received a refund of the 495.00. I can furnish the following documents. The radman reports to support the Tax issues, deficit spending, and all local radman reports with a list of canceled accounts. The last non-profit theft and the member who was closing their account.

Verna has personally told me that she is not going to give me the address to my landlord so that I may write them, violating my tenant rights.
The property has sustained damage causing illness and Josh refuses to clean it up. He states lies, gets tenants confused when talking to us states to us that we said one thing, when he is talking about my neighbor and states it is ""on us.""
Josh and Verna have told landlords whose property they manage that they ""just are not going to get any more pictures, they don't care what the contract states.""
False repair charges are made upon the tenants when requests for repairs are done and then we are told if we fail to pay them they will evict us. They have stated this to me as well as the other tenants in my building. I live in fear of being evicted if I report needed maintenance.
The carpets have not been changed in ten years. All of the apartments have had floods in them several times from the A/C units over the course of the past 12 months. 
The yard personell constantly damage personal property when mowing. Both Josh and Verna have been notified of this. They refuse to relay the message to hold them accountable for the damages caused.
When specialists, whether it be plumbers or A/C repair personell have to be called, Josh makes up lies about what was said by them and then charges us. I have called the people who have come to my place to make repairs. Both times they stated ""I never said that, I wish they would stop doing this."" in regards to Josh making up statements.
The carpet is molding. 
There is mold growing on the walls.
The mold within the walls has made me and other tenants ill. We need a housing authority to come and inspect the building and the inside of the walls for mold. Past tenants state that after they moved out they were no longer ill. All of us have gone to the doctor and have doctors notes for the illnesses we have gotten due to unsuitable living conditions.
The paint on the baseboards are buckling due to flooding.
The back doors are completely rotten.

The seals on the windows are damaged and the windows are not able to be seen through.
None of the apartments have been cleaned in regards to new carpet, professional cleaners coming out, painting, locks being replaced/changed between tenants, A/C and heating units being serviced between and during tenants and proper maintenance of the plumbing and electrical systems.
A fan fell out of the ceiling and hurt a tenant and was left for repair with bare wires that arced for a week.
I had to pay to have my lock on my front door fixed when it was the managers (that being Isbell) responsibility to do so.
Failure to live up to contracted responsibilites to the landlords they manage for.
Verna is a slumloard who teaches at CTC college. She states this on her website. She teaches business classes. CTC needs to be warned that she is a slumlord and remove her from their staff before she teaches new business students that it is ok to treat tenants in this manner.
Verna and Brittany and Josh will yell at you and treat you as if you were not a paying tenant.  For the record, I have always paid my rent in advance and have never been late. The other tenants have paid theirs in a timely fashion as well. To be degraded as a paying tenant in intollerable.Reports to the BBB have been made only to be told by the BBB that if we, the tenant, do not pay to have a professional come out and say yes this is an issue and they need to fix it out of our own pocket, we lose the BBB report and they find in favor of Isbell.

San Antonio, Texas United States of America ",,864-274-2604,"Christi Messer  DEADBEAT MOTHER OF THE YEAR!!!   STILL..... San Antonio, Texas"," When I posted a little bit of information about Christi Messer about 3 years ago, she was a mere $5000 behind in child support. As of this date she is almost $18,000 behind in child support, in addition to the roughly $15,000 she will soon owe me for past attorney fees, travel expenses, etc. for my having to travel to and from TX to clear my name due to the false allegations she continues to make about me. See, I have custody of my daughters for good reasons and this is seen by her as a golden opportunity to make a better life for herself, excluding her daughters in almost every possible way. She still continues to send no child support, claiming that she gives me her $100 tax return each year (which the government strips her of because of her failing to help support her daughters financially, not to mention emotionally or in any other way), and ""what more do I want from her..... don't you understand that I'm a student....."", and any other excuse she can give to try to preserve her name. 
Christi Messer is manipulative, narcissistic, and I'm certain that she is an undiagnosed sociopath. Watch it if you have any interaction with her, business or personal, because she uses people to better herself in whatever way she can. She has caused my daughters much strife, stress, and emotional turmoil, only to blame me for all she can so that she feels justified in what she is not doing as a parent. Suffice it to say, she isn't even a ""part-time parent"" because of her consistent lack of communication with our daughters via birthday cards, Christmas gifts, or anything that makes a child feel special in the eyes of their parent. There was a book fair and me, being the Dad that I consistently strive to be, struggle with having to tell my girls no for anything (although it must be done at times). They asked me for book fair money and I gave them a few bucks. Their mother, Christi, told them on the phone that she'd send them $20 for the book fair. A week later she told them that it wouldn't get to them in time, which it would have if she'd sent it when she told them she was, so she decided to not send it at all. This is the type of thing that a child sees and in due time is able to form their own opinion about the types of situations they're placed in. However, as a Dad who struggles to provide everything for my daughters, it is very hard to not call a spade a spade - mommy is a liar. I bite my tongue as tough as it is. This is her character, don't let her snow you if you are involved with her in any way, and maybe one day the TX child support enforcement will do the right thing, being in the best interest of the children so they say, and hold Christi accountable for her actions. My suggestion for anyone looking to work with her in any way - look elsewhere so that you have peace of mind in knowing the truth. Don't be snowed by innocent words and the ""woe is me mother"" card she loves to play.  I have documentation to back up all I claim, including the fraud on the court she pulled when she drove to SC and yanked my daughters out of school, telling them they were never coming back so say bye. What kind of mother completely neglects her children and manipulates them in such terrible ways? WATCH OUT FOR HER!!! ",Attorneys General

People associated with the law office include DARRYL MITCHELL. Look them up on google, they both have a criminal records for scamming people out of money. When confronted, they both claimed they did not even know each other and that they were not partners in the law practice even though they are both listed on the business card.
OJ Odunna is NOT LICENSED to practice law in the state of Florida. Look him up the Florida Bar website. His license has been revoked. Darryl Mitchell has had disciplinary action taken against him by the Florida Bar for falsely claiming he could represent someone and did not do as claimed. He was ordered by the Florida Supreme Court to return the money he was paid for services not rendered. [continued below]....
									
										..... We have filed a complaint to the Better Business Bureau and have also filed a complaint with the Florida Bar. Do your research before you hire anyone to represent you. 
If you google OJ Odunna's name, he was one of the 25 lawyers disbarred for committing fraud and scamming people out of $374,000 in 2008. Darryl Mitchell was arrested in Broward County in February 2012. His father Marzell Mitchell was also disbarred for setting up false trust accounts and falsely underreporting income from his law office. This information is all available on the Florida Bar website as well as google. 
Specifically, these two prey on immigrants who do not know any better and are looking for a change in immigration status. They will take their money and promise them a green card, but do not file any paperwork. In addition, they will never give you an itemized receipt or detailed costs. They will ask you for large lump sums of money. OJ is known to disappear - when he calls you back, you will see he only calls from a Skype account and constantly changes his phone number. When he feels you realize he is stealing your money, he flies back to Nigeria and will not call you back. Darryl Mitchell will pretend he does not know who OJ is and will claim they are not partners since he knows it is illegal to have a non-lawyer practicing law under his law firm. These two have their scam down to a science. They know immigrants have so much to lose that they will not report them to the police, etc, so they continue to scam them out of their life savings since they cannot afford to hire an attorney to get their money back and they fear for deportation. 
I have personally written the Florida Bar, contacted several lawyers about these two con artists. I have taken to Yelp!, Merchant Circle and any other avenue to expose these guys. They are unethical, unlawful and need to be stopped. 									",Attorneys General

										Had the worst attorney experience with this law firm.  I thought I was getting the best out there.  He had everything right going for him on paper.  He was a part of Family Law associations, he preached a ""let's work together"" philosophy because I was already very active in my case at that point and felt I had enough knowledge, legal wise, but needed the professional to really push my case through and help get things done faster.  He asked for a profile, I did it, I doubt he even read it.  He asked that I fill out a form that outlined what I was asking for in the initial petition, they literally copied what I wrote word for word basically just adding the legal template and that they were representing me.    He never showed up to a court appearance even though that was discussed in our initial meeting, he sent his assistant, it was always something that came up.  One time the excuse was that he had a doctor's appointment, but of course he was too good to call to let me know that or even have the courtesy to have the receptionist let me know another person would just show up.  My point in all this is that this attorney gives a rat's behind about you.  As long as he knows you can pay and can pay for the long haul that's what his focus is, not about getting things done for you.  Court cases can be tedious and we all know things can take forever but when looking for an attorney, especially in Family Law, you should want someone who CARES.  This one does not.  The rebuttal to the other post about this attorney is probably the law office trying to cover their backsides.  There are pleasant people working in the office but the person they are working for is HORRIFIC.  I wouldn't trust him. 									",Attorneys General

										I am writing this report about Gina Alford in the hopes that I can help someone avoid being scammed in the way Gina Alford scammed me.  She is a disreputable, dishonest and untrustworthy person who, like most scam artists, is a smooth talker and a convincing liar.  She gains your trust and friendship and then steals your money.  Here's my story:About a year ago I was looking for a show quality male cream sable Pomeranian and while searching I saw Gina Alford's Website on the Internet.  From the looks of her Website you would think that she was a reputable show breeder that breeds beautiful Poms. However, PLEASE, don't be fooled by her Website.  I initially e-mailed her, and after some time she called me and told me that she had a litter of puppies due soon.  In the next couple of days she called and told me they were born and there was a beautiful male puppy in the litter.  I discussed this puppy with her and after a couple of weeks she called and told me he was a show quality cream sable with AKC registration etc., so I decided to buy this puppy for $2,500 and sent her a deposit of $800.  After sending the deposit I asked for pictures of the puppy, but she always had some excuse why she couldn't send them to me.  Finally, when the puppy was 8 weeks old, we demanded pictures of him.  She sent me a few pictures of a puppy taken with her cell phone.  Because of the poor quality you couldn't even see what he looked like, but I trusted her representations that this was a show quality cream sable puppy.  She then asked for more money and, stupidly, I sent her another $1,000. (Please everyone do NOT do this when buying any puppy. Reputable breeders won't ask for this.)  She needed the money so I even paid $20.00 to mail the check next day.After sending Gina Alford the second payment I asked for more pictures, but Gina told me she worked by contract (not yet sent to me) and in her contract it states that she would not send out pictures until the puppy was 10 weeks old.  She also told me her contract stated that he was guaranteed to be show quality at 1 year of age.  She said the contract stated that if the dog was not show quality it would be replaced by a dog that was show quality.  So I waited until he was 10 weeks old and asked for pictures.  Again she refused.  We finally demanded pictures, and she then sent us a couple of pictures of a Pomeranian puppy.  We looked at the photos and the puppy looked nice but the color seemed orange, not cream.  By then we were getting suspicious, so we consulted with friends who are experts in show Poms, and their opinion was that based on the photos Gina sent to us this puppy was definitely orange, not cream sable.  But again, the photos were not the best quality, so we called Gina, told her our concerns and asked for more pictures that would clearly establish the puppy's color.  Gina was angry about our request for more pictures, but after stalling for a couple of weeks she finally sent us another picture.  This puppy was definitely cream sable, but to us it looked much younger and different than the puppy in the initial pictures.  Bottom line:  We didn't think it was the same puppy as the one shown in the first photos.  We again consulted with people who were experienced experts in Pom show dogs, and their opinion also was that the puppy in the second photo wasn't the same puppy as the one shown in the first photos.  He didn't have the same face, ear set, tail set, etc.At this time we also learned that this puppy had not yet been registered with AKC.  In fact, we learned that not only was the puppy not registered with AKC, but we also learned that the puppy's MOTHER had not yet been registered with AKC.  We were shocked by this fact, since Gina Alford had represented this puppy as AKC registered since the beginning of our discussions. So Gina was going to ship us a ""show puppy"" that wasn't AKC registered. My husband and I discussed the situation and decided that since we had already paid $1,800 on the dog our best option was to NOT let her ship the dog to us.  Instead, we would pick up the dog ourselves.  That way, if in fact it wasn't a show quality cream sable we could at least refuse final payment on the balance due and avoid shipping costs.  We called Gina Alford, told her we were going to New Orleans on vacation and that we wanted to pick up the puppy in person instead of her shipping him to us. She immediately got very ANGRY and told us that NOBODY ever came to her home to pick up puppies. She didn't allow that.  Then, she agreed to let us meet her somewhere to get the puppy, but she wanted us to send her the final payment before we picked up the puppy. Despite her protestations, we insisted that we would NOT agree to have her ship the puppy, insisted that we pick up the puppy in person and we told her we would not make the final payment until we saw the puppy.She yelled my husband and me for 10 minutes and then offered to refund our money.  We immediately accepted that offer.  She told us that before she would refund our money we MUST sign her contract, which we had yet to receive and had never seen.  When we got the contract we discovered there was no show guarantee in it, as Gina had previously claimed in her e-mail to me. There was also no clause in the contract regarding photos, as she had previously claimed.  After reviewing the sales contract, we refused to sign that document since it did not clearly establish our right to a refund.  Gina and Rick Alford then sent to us a revised contract that established they would refund our $1,800 in monthly payments of not less than $200 a month.  Under this contract, if payment was made we agreed not to take any legal or social actions against them. After executing this repayment contract, Rick and Gina Alford sent us three payments totaling $600 over five months and then defaulted on the contract.  During those five months, we sent numerous e-mails to them advising them of our willingness to resolve this matter in a friendly and amicable manner and telling them we did not want to harm them legally, socially or financially.  We told them we would work with them to resolve this matter.  During this time we learned by e-mail from Gina herself that she sold a puppy, but they clearly did not apply the proceeds of that sale toward their financial obligation to us.   Now, they have defaulted on the repayment contract that they themselves drafted, and we can't get any response from them.   They still owe us $1,200 that they received for a puppy they did not provide.  This is criminal fraud and we intend to file criminal complaints against them with the Mississippi Attorney General's Office, the FBI Internet Crime Unit and the Winston County (Mississippi) Sheriff's Office. We have documentation to support everything in this report and will gladly provide it to anyone who is interested in this case.  For anyone reading this report:  PLEASE do NOT allow someone to use ""friendship"" and smooth talk to convince you to forget about smart business practices.  If you're planning to do business with someone via the Internet, do your research BEFORE you send anyone money, no matter how ""nice"" or ""friendly"" they seem and no matter how professional the appearance of their Website.  If you're planning on buying an AKC puppy, buy only from reputable breeders.  Ask for and check references, do a Google search on their name and kennel and sign up for a breed forum and ask for people's opinions on the breeder.  We wish we would have.

										This letter is to file a complaint of misrepresentation I recently received from attorney Briley RichmondOn or about 24 July 2011, I was charged with simple assault and DUI 1st offense.  I entered a plea of not guilty on 1 September 2010, with the City of Diberville Municipal Court located on 10383 Auto Mall Pkwy, Diberville, MS 39540, which continued my case to the date of 3 November 2011. I called Mr. Richmond on 25 October 2011 to meet with him for possible representation. We both agreed to meet on the 27th of October.  He said he would call me back with a place to meet. I thought meeting outside of the usual office setting was a good way to establish rapport. On 27 October 2011, we met at Starbucks Caf located on 2404 Pass Rd Biloxi, MS 39531. He showed me all of his credentials to practice law in the state of Mississippi. I was pleased to know that he was involved in different fields of law which made me more comfortable to press on. I presented to him the abstract and case description for the DUI (The City of Diberville would not provide me a copy of the abstract for the simple assault because it was on a minor) (see attached abstract and case description).  He said that this case was easy because of the details that involved the arrest. I told him the court date was on the 3rd of November, but I can ask for a continuance so he can better prepare himself for the case. He said he did not need the extension but if it would make me comfortable than ask for the extension.  I called the court house on the 27th of October to ask for an extension. They advised me that I had to come in person to extend my court date. The date was extended to 17 November 2011.On or about 13 November 2011, we met in a park and ride located in Ocean Springs, MS right off of exit 50. I paid Mr. Briley Richmond $500.00 in cash to represent me (see attached receipt).  I thought it was unusual that we did not conduct this transaction in a business setting. I did not speak with him until 17 November 2011, the day of court. Mr. Richmond showed up for court and presented himself before the District Attorney as my lawyer.  He sits next to me and starts biting his thumb nail until it begin to bleed. Once he returns from the bathroom, he starts commenting on the two womans breasts wondering if they were real or not. I ignored his comments and asked about my case. He said he just read my abstract from the DA and he then shows me a piece of paper, that he clearly went on the internet to find, on what the state of Mississippi says in regards to the ins and outs of simple assault and anything that follows, with that charge, will not hold up in court because the simple assault would be dropped.  I told him that I have pictures of the victim staying at my residence and expressed that if you the mother felt that I posed a threat to her child than why would she ask my roommate to ask me to come and get her children. The victim in question resided at my residence on 14 November 2011 due to a family dispute. The mother of the victim called my roommate, Brittney Winkfield, and asks if I could come back and pick up her two children because her husband was threatening to shoot her in the head.  I originally was at her residence to pick up my roommate to bring her to school that evening. I turned around and picked up the children because I felt regardless of our pending issues that doesnt mean the children should be in that environment. Especially, since they had nowhere else to go to in such a small timeframe. The victim and her brother stayed the night at my residence. I took pictures of them at my residence to help with my case (see attached pictures). I also dropped the children off that morning before I went to work. The individual who pressed charges on me did not show up for court. I thought for sure the case would be dismissed. However, there was a continuance set for the 15th of December. Mr. Richmond told me they did have anything on me so they, the DA, asked for a continuance and I had nothing to worry about.  I called Mr. Briley Richmond several times that evening and early night. He returned my call around ten oclock. I ask him why he didnt ask for a dismissal. Mr. Richmond said the DA was concerned about how high my breathalyzer test was and wanted to research the case further. I did not like his answer, but since I didnt know the law I figured it was ok.On 15 December 2011, I showed up to court. Mr. Richmond was present but did not acknowledge me. I sat in the front of the court room adjacent to the victims parents. Mr. Richmond was in the back of the court room entertaining a young blond woman. After sitting in the courtroom for nearly two hours I received a text from Mr. Richmond stating that I did not have to be in court and he would take care of everything. We did not speak at all in person that day. I then receive a call from my roommate who informed me that he entered a plea of no contest. I did not authorize him to enter that plea on my behalf. I still wanted to plead not guilty for both charges. I called him several times and he did not return my call until around 9 p.m. I asked him why he pleaded no contest instead of not guilty; he did not answer my question. He said, Well, we are going to appeal the case to have everything thrown out and I will get with you about the appeal paperwork to process it. I called Mr. Richmond several times before Christmas and did not get a response. I was a bit concerned because of the holidays and things (i.e., paperwork) get lost. I called him on 27 December 2011 and he said that he was on vacation, that he will have the paperwork, and not to worry we have time. I called Mr. Richmond several times thereafter on his cell phone. The answering machine was full and I was unable to leave a message. I did not hear from Mr. Richmond until 10 Jan 2012.Mr. Briley Richmond called me on 10 January 2012 about the appeal paperwork. He asked when and where was a good time to meet. I thought it was odd that we never once met in an office to conduct business. On 11 January 2012 at 1600, I met with Mr. Richmond in yet another parking lot located across from the Hard Rock Caf on Beach Blvd. He hands me two pieces of paper and tells me to go to the court house, bring this paperwork, and call the person who bonded you out the first time. I said ok, and asked him for directions on how to get to the court house. When I arrived home I saw the condition of the paperwork. The paperwork was incomplete and unprofessional (see attached paperwork and photo of original condition). I was also convicted on both charges. I was flabbergasted because I did not know I was convicted for both charges. I called him about the paperwork once again his voice mail was full and I did not receive a call back.On 17 January 2012, I went to the County Court of Harrison County, Mississippi, Second Judicial District located on 730 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd, Biloxi, MS 39530. I presented the paperwork to the clerk and she explained to me that first my lawyer was suppose to file the paperwork within 30 days. She further explained after 30 day period has expired I can never try to motion for an appeal for this case again. I expressed to her that even with the holiday season it still applies and she replied, yes the 30 day period to file still applies. Second, she told me the paperwork he provided to me was not the proper paperwork required to file an appeal. Finally, she expressed to me that there were fees up to $500 that was to paid before filing the appeal. Mr. Richmond did not tell me any of this. I called him the same day and told him what the clerk said about who is to file the paper and he said, That is ludicrous. Administrative paperwork can be handled by anyone. Either I or you can do it, it a simple process. I also asked him why he did not tell me about the 30 day filing period and the fees. He said, I thought you were going up there the same day since you asked for directions. I told him, No I had something else to do and I asked for the directions so I can go up there on Tuesday. I called the court house in DIberville, MS, and spoke with a clerk. She told me that your lawyer should have known that after the 30 day period it is almost impossible to file an appeal. I asked the clerk what I had to do. She said I had to come in and get a court date for payment arrangements on both charges which totaled approximately $1,800.On 9 February 2012, I went to the City of DIberville court house and was ordered to pay $908.00 for the DUI 1st offense. This offense also includes an additional $170.00 in driving courses in order to get my license back for the state of Mississippi. The simple assault was postponed due to evidence that I presented, the same evidence I gave to Mr. Briley Richmond, to the DA concerning the case. The case was continued until 12 March 2012. I texted Mr. Richmond and asked why he did not show up for the case. He called me three days later and said, He did not know about the court date, and then asked if this court case was for new charges or the same charges. I told him it was for the same case. He said, Ok. I said, Everything will be taken care and I will keep you posted. I once again have tried to get in contact with Mr. Richmond only to receive a voicemail and no returned phone calls. I have not tried to contact him since 16 February 2012.I believe I was misrepresented throughout the entire case from Mr. Briley Richmond.  His lack of communication and work effort as described is below standards. I expected a much higher level of service from Mr. Richmond and I am quite disappointed.  I will be informing my friends and family about this experience.

Avoids paying court ordered Medical Insurance on his children. Avoids court ordered mediation for Anger management in Domestic Violence charges. Avoids paying Court Ordered Spouse Maintenance for 3 years. Has a Permanant order of protection against him. Works in the Oil field yet claims to court, he's not physically able to even work in Wal-Mart, once he got childsupport payments lowered, he went back to the Oil Field in North Dakota. Now has quit the Oil field again December 16, 2011  and moved back to Texas after 6 months on that job. [continued below]....
									
										..... In the last month he has purchased a new Truck, a new $4,000 diamond ring and diamond necklace for girlfriend, buying airline tickets  for g/f to visit him ,remodeling a home in Texas worth thousands.( None of this is my business, but when he cannot pay one dime on his kids, he makes it my business) Yet, cannot and does not help his two daughters, both  now in high school. I pay 100% for food, clothing, graduations, proms, school supplies, vehicle insurance, phones, medical insurance,sports, gas for vehicles, repairs, the list goes on.

										HORRIFYING LAZINESS and INCOMPETENCE!!! Storer injury lawyers should not be allowed to practice law anymore! Bryan Storer should have lost his license years ago. I wish I would have know what I know now I would have run a fast as I could out of his office. He will rip you off and settle your case and screw you out of the money you deserve. He will make you do all the work and then take most of your money. He cannot get any medical records anywhere in Idaho because he has ripped off most of the doctors offices and hospitals. I was told by St Lukes records office personally that he never paid for the records he received. 
He will not defend you and will delay your case simply by being too lazy to do his job. They have no clue what they are doing and will not return calls. They will settle your case for the first offer that makes them a profit irregardless  of whether or not you get enough money for you or your bills. After my case was ""settled"" I still owe THOUSANDS of dollars for my medical bills and he never bothered to try and get them reduced as he promised he would. He never even made an attempt to discuss how much I would be getting and when I brought it up Bryan would get very angry. He would claim that he would take less money as his fee to insure that his client received more than him. Would you be surprised to know that the only person who made money off of my injury case was HIM? I am in the hole and my credit is ruined but his wallet is a lot fatter. 
If you are still considering using him check out how many complaints he has at the Idaho State Bar Association's website. If anyone else has had similar problems contact us we will be pursuing further action against him and I know there are enough of us to form a class action lawsuit.									",Attorneys General

										I went to the ""Forever Lazy"" website to investigate the item as a possible holiday gift.  They advertised a ""Buy One Get One Free"" option.  I have ordered online for years, and I know the standard procedure.  You can add items to your cart, and you can take the first few steps to get a total and make a decision.I selected one pink and one grey Forever Lazy in my ""cart"".  When I entered my address in order to find out how much shipping would cost, it had the credit card field first.  I remember thinking it was very unusual to ask for a credit card up front, but I thought to myself as I am not submitting the form or proceeding, my information is safe just to get a total.  I realized that the shipping seemed kind of high and it would cost around $65 for the 2 items.  I decided that the cost was too high and I closed out the browser.  I then closed out the Internet Explorer.I went back in and found a much cheaper option, a fleece blanket, and I ordered that instead.To my shock, about a week later, a large bag showed up at my door.  I opened it and realized there were four ""Forever Lazy"" blankets inside, 2 pink and 2 grey.  I was completely baffled and shocked as to how this had arrived when I had never placed an order!  I searched for paperwork in the bag but there was none.  It did not go unnoticed that they provided absolutely no contact or return information.I contacted the company immediately to complain.  I explained to the person from the company that I did not submit an order.  He informed me casually that the website is set up so that if you close out your browser, it will put the order through!I informed him that I have never heard of this and it seems fraudulent as I did not knowingly place an order, there was no review, no submit, no confirmation page, nothing!  He told me to write ""return to sender"" and bring the package back to the post office.I was charged $99.72 for these 4 unwanted items.  I felt absolutely sick and robbed.  I returned the package to the post office, scared that the company would deny ever receiving the items back.  I had no papertrail where the package was concerned.  I waited about 10 days.  I finally saw an e-mail stating they had received the package and issued me a refund.I checked my credit card and to my disgust, they only refunded me $65.14.  They stole about $35 from me!  I have contacted my credit card company to file a dispute and I have tried calling the company but was placed on hold and disconnected.  I am calling again on Monday.I feel as though someone knocked me down and stole my wallet.  I have seen many complaints like mine, either people who didn't put their order through, couldn't return the items, or were mislead into thinking they were only buying 2 when in fact they ship out 4, 2 in each color.  Why isn't someone looking into this?I am having a horrible time even finding anything out about this company.  They are shady beyond shady.  How can it be legal to have a system set up to put an order through when the browser is closed?????I will never ever enter my credit card again without deleting the information before closing my browser!

										Sweet Innocent Lady was battered by a criminal fleeing from police in a police chase in Riley County Kansas 0n 4-17-2005, while on her way to work, going through a green light on Fort Riley BLVD in Manhattan, Kansas.  The Police chased the criminal in the city limits of Manhattan Kansas and gave no precautions or preventions to not have the USA citizens be endangered from the criminal they were chasing down with their police cars.  The police chase had highspeeds of 70pmh and no streets were blocked off or regulated during their chasing down that criminal who ran a red light and impacted that innocent lady's body and car with permanent damages.  The county attorney's crime victim's/witness division was given a claim of damages to be paid by this lady and the county gave her no assistance to recover financial, medical, property and other life essential damages.  In fact they gave false representation, since they hid from her the goings on of the case and how the case enolved.  They provided NO assistance to her in any way.  And now they say there was no form recieved to them on time.  This lady seeks restitution and wants to have this matter settled fairly and collect full financial costs for all she endured and she is still suffering from the injuries inflicted on her from that happening.It seems to her that people in job positions ought to take a stand on this issue and speak up and take pride in being able to produce fair payment to her, since it ought to be the True American way of life.  She has difficulty sitting and standing for short periods of time and has to constantly reposition herself to withstand sitting and standing so she can have less pain issues and more range of motion.  She had to work her drive-thru window job just few weeks after this injury happened since the doctors she was appointed to did not want her to be off work.  Her injuries worsened, since she had to work with fractured ribs, shallow breathing, broke fibula, sprained neck, bruises, bloody gashed knee, non moving stiff hips, broken toe, bumped forehead, multiple spine issues, sciatic nerve pain from waist to toes on both legs, her knees were out of place in 3 different places, her ankles out of place in 5 different places, her hips out of place in 3 different places.  The weight of the headset was too heavy for her and she could not even sit down a second without huge pain and strain and had to keep moving to alternate positions to lessen the pain.Seems the police, the county, the crime vicitims division of that county ought to have spoke up for her in her defense from that criminal battering her with damages.  A simple sorry is not acceptable for payment to her.  Seems someone ought to take a closer look at this tragedy and give this matter the attention it deserves and pay this very fine lady what is owed to her and accomodate her with future medical essentials and assist her to find gainful employment with an employer who can give her hope for her financial future, as she has to provide for herself.She is a rather tough lady and she has a high level of ambition.  Seems she tuffed out this tragedy with her strong ambition towards life and she is a Christian.

There's water leaks and water intrusion when it rains.  They had people removing some molds and were throwing the moldy materials from what had to be 6 or 7 apartments in the dumpster.  So now everyone got a good dose every time they threw stuff away.   Other tenants were promised a whole wall would be removed for mold but that never happened, so who knows how much is still there.
People have lost personal belongings due to mold and water damage, pipes leak and yet one of my friends that also moved out has never gotten a phone call back about the items he lost.   The most toxic molds you can imagine are in fact at this property.  Before moving there were citations from Environmental health.  So that should tell you something.   Another friend I had there had water pouring into his tub from the upstairs bath drain.   That went on for years he said.   It's a nice neighborhood with mostly great people and in a good location but I wouldn't let anyone I care about live there.

What's more is how successful they have been in quieting all opposition placed against them. I will not be silenced.My main area of concern is with their sales department. Most companies have quotas. But most sales managers TRAIN their suvordinates how to achieve the goals properly. Not at PES. The sales manager is entirely incompetent. Non-communicative. Mean-spirited. Hires and fires on a whim. Has an ""inner-crcle"" of three female, die-hard alcoholic employees who feed him hearsay and drama. (After they ""befriend"" coworkers to glean personal details.) Which he loves. He micromanages to a stifling extreme. Once an employee outside his circle churns tp enough potential business, he fires them and hands the boiling hot leads to his Evil Trinity members. Who rip each other apart on a regular basis -- like pitbulls on crack. The workplace is a dirty battlefield at PES. Sales leads stolen. Clients misinformed. Anything to land a deal.The CEO/CFO/Whateverhecallshimselfthisweek advised me that he encourages female emps to offer ""favors"" or at least phone sex to potential cllient prospects.Not a big shock. He propositions his underlings frequently.Added to these issues, PES never issues performance reviews, pays poorly and changes the comp package constantly, Refuses ro offer plans for improvement to syruggling staffers and has such a lousy reputation in Spokane that I took them off of my resume.

Indymac had previously sent me a quickie modification package that would cause me to have an outrageous $200,00.00 balloon payment near the end of my loan. I took it to reduce my monthly mortgage amount and I did good in paying for 6 months until the wage garnishment hit. Indymac had me complete the HAMP application in March 2010.  I am still waiting. My documents have been lost repeadly. I kept recieving letters from Indymac stating my paycheck stubs were ilegible, so I faxed them an example from my Human Resources Dept on ""How To"" read a Los Angeles County paycheck stub in April 2010 which had a make believe employee name of ""Samatha Saver"" as the example employee on the explanation. Indymac then added ""Samatha Saver"" as a contributor to my mortgage and asked for this make believe persons's paycheck stubs and income information until September 2010 until I contacted their Office of the President to complain about their errors.  Next they demanded my divorce decree and I have never even been married. Indymac has denied my modification and they state my home will be in foreclosure by Feb 2011.

Wow! post saint lucie, Florida","  I  just thought i would take a minute to let everyone know about my experience with this law firm that call themselves Steinger Iscoe & Green. On May 22nd 2008 I was involved in aaccident shortly after I went out and retain Steinger Iscoe & Greene for legal reprsentation. In the beginning I was assign to Attorney Jeffery Rollins.Almost two years later from that date my case had been set to go to trial about three times. About couple of weeks before my trial date I  met with Senior attorney Sean Greene, Micheal Fiener as Co- counsel.After being pressured to settle my case several times and theaten that if I didn't settle Steinger Iscoe and Greene would with draw. I began to not trust this company.On May 19th i recieve a call from Attorney Sean Greene, MIcheal Feiner, and Jeffery Rollins asking me what time I was coming into their PSL offie to meet with them. I than informed all three attorneys on the conference call that I would not be coming to met with them unless I could record the conversation. Sean Greene Speaking as a SENIOR ATTORNEY ON BEHALF OF sig SAID FINE! that's not a problem.So My husband , two year old daughter and I went into the PSL office shortly after to discuss the case.I refuse to settle once again and I advice the law firm at that time that I would be filing a Florida Bar complaint because the way their stories change and their unethinical habits I wasn't comfortable with. A week later I recieve a notice in the mail were Jeffery Rollins filed for Distructive Discharge. The court date came and the judge advise this attorney to either represent or withdraw from the case. Three days later I reieve a notice for withdrawl with cause. On that day in court the withdrawl motion was heard Jeffery Rolllins told advise the court that the evidence I submitted to the judge was illegal without his knowledge , therefore Jeffery Rollins stated that he had contacted the PSL Police department in Ref to criminal Investigation for illegal recorded conversation. Now I found this to statement be so convient.This evidence didn't become illeagal into I submitted it to the judge to prove that SIG hadr efuse me my day in court.Ok so than I was contacted and asked to come down to the PSL police department to give a statement ,which I did about two weeks later I was arrested at 4:00am in the morning in front of my four kids and husband and charged Unlawful comminications with a device. Remind you this is A felony charge if Iam convicted. Now it's my belief that SIG attorneys Sean Greene, Jeffery Rollins and Micheal Feiner had me arrested hoping I would walk away for my Florida Bar Compalint and this civial case. It's funny how they use this blond lady in the commericial saying.""You won't pay a dime.Unless we win your case."" two weeks after SIG dropped my case.A lien was file against my case.What a contradiction.

The lawyer was to get 33 1/3% and the balance was mine.  I got a call from his office stating that I could come and pick up the check, I went and opened the envelope and all of these medical bills totaling $6690.00 plus $95.72 for medical records were deducted from the check.  There was no prior mention of this fee or that I would be cheated in the retainer. There was even a charge of $1007.00 from the emergency room (that my insurance had paid already in the amount of $130.00) but the $1007.00 was deducted from my portion of the check.  I ahve a copy of the payment to the emergency room from my insurance and I sent a copy to his office.

Nothing in my employment agreement with this company has any clauses about payment in this fashion.  I am a second generation realtor myself and have had 5 years of experience, my father is a retired broker with 35 years in the business.  The company, ""1st USA Realty"", lures agents in with low monthly dues and then steals their commission checks to make ends meet.  I have called over 25 agents so far and they ALL report not getting money, some have settled out of court, others are taking payments.  There are so many loop holes in this system.  They filed bankruptcy on Friday the 21st.  Bryan text me to talk to his lawyer and gave me the case number.  I have contacted several lawyers of which I can not afford, in order to put a lean on their houses or vehicles, start a class action, or stop this Fraud!  This family is putting many others in a place of hardship in order to keep living their lifestyles.  I called a real estate lawyer that could not represent me because there was a conflict of interest.  He has represented the shady broker in the past.  He was very nice and sympathetic of my situation.  He told me they take commission checks betting the agent will feel defeated and walk away from the situation.  I was in shock.I'm in the military and need this money to finish my last year of college at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.  I'm working on a pilot career, but need this money to finish my goals.  I just came off of orders in March of this year, I was gone for six months prior.  He basically stole all of my money for school.

										..... Property value dropping but him in his wife with coldwell banker(memorialdrive) all involved in strawbuying. Appraiser on the run. A Houston Grand Jury handed down indictments on eight individuals for a series of mortgage fraud scams in the Houston, Texas area, involving close to 300 properties valued at approximately $40 million.Most of the fraudulent transactions involved finding a straw buyer with a high credit score, and persuading that person to purchase one or more properties. The perpetrators would obtain a phony appraisal that was significantly inflated.  Because of the buyers favorable credit score, their loan would be approved with minimal scrutiny by the lending institution. Once the sale went through, the scam artist would pocket the difference between the selling price and the inflated loan amount by charging consulting fees, remodeling fees, or other service charges that would be disbursed at the closing by the escrow officer. The unsuspecting buyer would then be stuck with a mortgage that was much higher than the true value of the property. In many cases the buyer was promised that the property would be leased and the mortgage payments would be made, only to find that the property was left unoccupied and the buyer?s credit damaged by nonpayment.rod kelley wife liz kelley are involved in strawbuying in houston.

And a jar of ""Sturgeon caviar"" was, in fact, Mississippi paddlefish.Some honey makers dilute their honey with sugar beets or corn syrup, their competitors say, but still market it as 100 percent pure at a premium price.And last year, a Fairfax man was convicted of selling 10 million pounds of cheap, frozen catfish fillets from Vietnam as much more expensive grouper, red snapper and flounder. The fish was bought by national chain retailers, wholesalers and food service companies, and ended up on dinner plates across the country.""Food fraud"" has been documented in fruit juice, olive oil, spices, vinegar, wine, spirits and maple syrup, and appears to pose a significant problem in the seafood industry. Victims range from the shopper at the local supermarket to multimillion companies, including E&J Gallo and Heinz USA.Such deception has been happening since Roman times, but it is getting new attention as more products are imported and a tight economy heightens competition. And the U.S. food industry says federal regulators are not doing enough to combat it.""It's growing very rapidly, and there's more of it than you might think,"" said James Morehouse, a senior partner at A.T. Kearney Inc., which is studying the issue for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents the food and beverage industry..John Spink, an expert on food and packaging fraud at Michigan State University, estimates that 5 to 7 percent of the U.S. food supply is affected but acknowledges the number could be greater. ""We know what we seized at the border, but we have no idea what we didn't seize,"" he said.The job of ensuring that food is accurately labeled largely rests with the Food and Drug Administration. But it has been overwhelmed in trying to prevent food contamination, and fraud has remained on a back burner. The recent development of high-tech tools -- including DNA testing -- has made it easier to detect fraud that might have gone unnoticed a decade ago. DNA can be extracted from cells of fish and meat and from other foods, such as rice and even coffee. Technicians then identify the species by comparing the DNA to a database of samples.Another tool, isotope ratio analysis, can determine subtle differences between food -- whether a fish was farmed or wild, for example, or whether caviar came from Finland or a U.S. stream.The techniques have become so accessible that two New York City high school students, working with scientists at the Rockefeller University and the American Museum of Natural History last year, discovered after analyzing DNA in 11 of 66 foods -- including the sheep's milk cheese and caviar -- bought randomly at markets in Manhattan were mislabeled.""We put so much emphasis on food and purity of ingredients and where they come from,"" said Mark Stoeckle, a physician and DNA expert at Rockefeller University who advised the students. ""But then there are things selling that are not what they say on the label. There's an important issue here in terms of economics and consumer safety.""..Business JobsComputer JobsConstruction JobsEducation JobsEngineering JobsHealthcare JobsLegal JobsManagement JobsMedia JobsNon-Profit JobsSales JobsScience JobsFind Your Dream Job Now!GoJobs by SimplyHiredFEATURED ADVERTISER LINKSLawsuit: Cochlear Implants, Toyota, Yaz Gallbladder,Fracking, HydroxycutErin Brockovich, Mesothelioma, Asbestos & Vets, Lung Cancer, BoilersRoll over your old 401(k)s to Fidelity Investments.Get peace of mind now with Equifax ID Patrol.Russia Now: In-Depth Coverage of Russia News, Business, and More.Double Your Vanguard Profits with the Best Funds to Own NowNEWS | POLITICS | OPINIONS | BUSINESS |LOCAL | SPORTS | ARTS & LIVING | GOING OUT GUIDEJOBS | CARS | REAL ESTATE | RENTALS | CLASSIFIEDS

										I should have done more research.  It's probably legal, but the billing practices of this firm border on absurd.  I can envision a pep squad like internal meeting being conducted on how to inflate, puff up, and create extra billing.  Like send an incomplete e-mail to cause an additional billable phone call.  They have to be instructed internally how to ""add"" to the billing rates.  Also, mistakes on their part, then a bill to correct their mistake.  Change in there internal staff, so added billing for further review, etc..  I feel, by my personal standards, their billing practices are at best disingenious.  They either cause, or allow items to happen to add to the billable hours, I expect a professional firm I have working on my behalf to make every effort not only represent me competently, but simultaneously do so in a professional fashion which minanmizes cost.  I am not sure on the legal competance, but it was obvious their primary concern is most likely pumping up the billable hours.","  Lawyers, Attorneys General "
