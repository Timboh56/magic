										.....  Bottom feeders like Presser & Pressler bank on that you don't have time or energy to fight them off or that you cannot afford an attorney.  Trust me I know.  I am well versed in the legal system and they tried my patience.  I also reported them the Internal Revenue Service because think about it, after the debt is paid they are still hounding you for more money.  What do you think they are doing with the money?  I requested the IRS to audit their books.  Now another piece of information for you, when they levy on your accounts, a court officer is involved from the Civil Part.  Contact them as well..show them your proofs.  Those government offices are not going to play these games with Pressler & Pressler.  Also beware, those information subpoenas Pressler sends out? The bench warrant (providing you don't return the information subpoenas) is good only for two years.  Pressler requests this subpoena just to make their lives easier...all your assets are listed, your personal information and employer).  I have dealt with this firm for a relative of mine and I went toe to toe with them.  They are nothing.  I consider this firm ""you couldn't hack it as a real lawyer so you are doing collections.""  Don't let them intimidate you.  They tried with me and they didn't know who they were dealing with...I was not going to allow my family to be intimidated or abused by these guys.  Good luck!

										     July 31. 2009 I was recommended to the Law firm of Brett Margolin PC (BMPC) to negotiate a loan modification from my lender, Wachovia Bank. Before signing their documents I emphasized to BMPC that if they were in any doubt as to the possibility I needed to know up front so that I would not engage them.
     I submitted my documents to BMPC's representative Cheryl LaPuma, and after review she reported to me that from what she saw there should not be a problem.  She sent me their documents and requested legal fees of Four Thousand Dollars to be paid immediately. I paid $4,000 promptly in two instalments within 21 days, I was desperate.  At the beginning everything appeared to be going well on my case but after three months BMPC changed the person handling my case and getting feed back from BMPC became almost impossible. 
     Wachovia subsequently placed my home in foreclosure, that is when another BMPC representative telephoned me urgently, asking several questions some of which I explained that I could not answer because I was on the road in my car, on a cell phone and did not hae any documents in front of me.
     The pattern of no feed back to my inquiries continued; my case was transferred to five different representatives then finally in May 2010 BMPC representative - Nicole Colson told me that BMPC could not help me and that I should find a local attorney and file bankruptcy.  
     Since then I have been requesting a refund of at least a half of my $4,000 but BMPC does not respond to my emails, they ignore my letters, and when I telephone BMPC representatives either keep me on hold endlessly or they pretend to transfer my call and disconnect me. 
     This is so unfair, I am entitled to most of my money back and there should be some way to stop this dishonesty, it is a crime.									",Lawyers,0

Jawn Ross does not try to resolve anything or have any strategy other than to suck billable hours out of her client.

As the verdict is being read, she is too busy counting YOUR money that is now in HER bak account to even care how the case panned out for you !! 
She lies to the court, she creates issues where there are none, she makes a fool out of whoever she represents, she is petty, minutia-focues, and irritating kinda like a pimple on your a**.

What makes this so hard to investigate is the fact that the scammers are using a recognizable name and litigation that is actually a valid case.
But unless you really sign up with Philip A. Kramer, from Calabasas, it is not legitimate. The fraudsters use really similar names, which makes it really hard to decide if it is a scam or not. 
So Mr. Kramer has tried to put a stop to it by making a cease and desist order on all the fake company’s and websites, that are using his name and reputation to lure you in to there scam.

										Janian And Associates took my money ($2500.00) with the promise they would return it if they could not put me in a better financial position with my mortgage company.  They not only could not put me in a better financail position, their unethical business practice during my attorney/client relationship is a disgrace to the legal profession and the fact that they are taking advantage of a government funded program designed to help people, by hurting them even more, is a disgrace to our country.  SOMEBODY please stop them.  Below is my copied complaint to the CA Attorney General's Office:
Early 2010, I filled out an online form requesting information about the home loan modification program. Soon after, I was bombarded by phone calls and e-mails from a man by the name of Rich Aronovitch at a company called Janian & Associates. 
They claim to be a law firm, but you can never, ever get ahold of the lawyer, Armen Janian, which is the reason I am filing this Consumer Complaint against a Business/Company, in case that is his angle in attempts not to be associated with this leg of the business...but the name of his business clearly indicates he IS associated and the way Rich persuaded me to go with his firm had a lot to do with the fact that he was representing a law firm, with a lawyer who was a member of the CA State Bar Assoc. for X amount of years, who knew the nuances of this modification program and how to get cases approved, who I should trust above anyone with lesser credentials...blah blah blah. From what I understand now, CA companies are prohibited from collecting upfront fees associated with home loan modifications. 
Please read all the complaints from the people from whom this 'firm' DID in fact not only collect upfront fees with the promise to refund if they were unable to obtain a modification, but also who do NOT honor their promise to refund. I hired this firm on Feb. 5th of 2010 for $2500.00 with the understanding (and ambiguous contractual agreement) that I would recieve a refund if they were unsuccessful. They were not only unsuccessful once, they were unsuccessful 3 times and I requested a refund in writing and by phone after each of these 3 times. 
They misrepresented my income the 1st time, lied to me and told me I had a 30% reduction the second time, and just gave up and went with the denial the 3rd time. After each request for a refund they would just put me off, acting like if I pulled out now, it would all be a waste of time because my file was considered to be 'in review'. 
Once I threatened to file formal complaints, I did receive an e-mail from Erica Rodriguez apologizing for the miscommunication and that I would, in fact, receive a full refund. That was October 26th, 2010 and I still haven't received a refund and they won't return my repeated attempts to get a response from them by phone, fax and e-mail. It's like they are thumbing their nose at all the stupid people who came to them for help. 
Please look into taking action against this organization, whatever it is. Mr. Janian is a member of your State Bar and you should see to it that he upholds the higher standard that we as consumers should trust to be associated with the legal profession. He has hurt many, MANY people. Again, start with the BBB website and you will have a very good idea of what he has been up to. I have not contacted another agency for assistance, but I will if I need to. I have not contacted an attorney, as I shouldn't have to retain a 2nd attorney to get back $$ that this one fraudulently received and is keeping from me. No court action pending....no lost lawsuit in this matter. I would like a full refund in the amount of $2500 + 1 full year of interest. Thank you. ",Lawyers,0

I called the lender and spoke with a lady whose name I want mention but she stated no they had not reported my name to anyone and that I need to call them back to cancel that transaction.  Of course when I called the number back some other gentleman answered and he acted like he couldn't understand me I looked the number up in the whitepages and It belong to someone in PR and the fax number which I had just used and hour earlier no longer work either. Needless to say they have scammed me for my info and now I have place a complaint with my attorney generals office here in NC as well as putting security freezes on my credit reports and I have canceled the card they are suppose to draft from my account and now in the process of closing that account and opening a new one.

Internet"," After a ""Slip & Fall"" accident, I retained the legal services of Carpenter & Zuckerman in Beverly Hills. I provided them with a list of witnesses. John Carpenter, who was handling my case, failed to contact any of those witnesses. When the case went to Trial, the only witness who was available, had been tampered with by the defendants, and turned against me. This would not have happened if my ""lawyer"" had done his job, and secured my witnesses by making contact, deposing them and ensuring that each witness would be available for testimony at Trial. The level of incompetence displayed by this law firm, is unbelievable! Legal documents sent out with mis-spelled names, incorrect dates, wrong addresses... Laurel and Hardy The Trial was a Circus...!!! The most degrading, humiliating experience of my life. Even the Judge told my lawyer that he should go back to Law School. After a 2 week long trial, what should have been a minimum of $250,000 verdict, was reduced to $64,000, but because my Lawyer had screwed up, by failing to acquire certain important documents, which would have proven crucial elements of my claim, and by failing to contact witnesses, and by failing to Subpeona critical witnesses from the City, this award was reduced to $24,500, and to this day, I have not received one cent. As a result of the accident, I was unable to walk for several months, the pain was unbearable. I suffered broken bones, bruises all over my body.I lost my business that had taken me 10 years to build. I lost my savings. I was retaliated against by my landlord, and suffered years of abuse as a result of this mockery of a trial. My lawyer lied to me on several occasions, and became hostile and malicious and downright vindictive, when I asked for my share of the award. My credit has been ruined, and years later, I am still hounded by debt collectors, who are pursuing me for unpaid medical bills. John C Carpenter is an ineffective, negligent, arrogant, incompetent, dishonest individual masquerading as a Lawyer. He should be disbarred from practice, along with his partner, who was aware of the issues at the time, but chose to do nothing.       ",Lawyers,0

American Law Firm,"  American Law Firm  1600 N. Broadway St. Suite 700 
Santa Ana, California United States of America ",www.americanlawfirm.net,214-740-8470,"American Law Firm  Amercian Law Firm is a firm full of scam artist preying on desperate consumers looking for ways to save their homes. Santa Ana, California"," On February 2010, I contacted the American Law Firm, and I initially spoke to Joseph Shalaby, Executive Director of the Firm, and at the time I was about one month behind on my mortgage. He advised me to skip a couple of payments on my mortgage, because it would look more favorableto the lenders giving me a loan modification. I had no idea I was going to have to pay nearly $5000.00 in the hopes of getting a loan modification for 2 properties that I was looking to get modified. However, the deciding factor for me was the fact that I was lied to by one of the employees assuring me that if they weren't able to assist me on obtaining a loan modification, that I could get a full refund. Hearing that was what convinced me. Over the course of 10 mths I supplied the American Law Firm with every piece of documentation they asked for. The first Processor that was assigned to my case was Kim Shipp. She was actually very professional and I heard from her on a regular basis. After about 6 mths, my case was assigned to someone by the name of Joann (Last Name unknown). Needless to say, once she took over my case, It was nearly impossible for me to get a response to any of the emails I sent to her on any questions I might have had. I was always receiving emails from the initial processor, Kim Shipp informing me that my house was not in the process of going into foreclosure. Then when I received a foreclosure notice in the mail, and I scanned it to the processor stating my concern, my email was ignored. I scanned that letter 3 times, and all 3 times my email was ignored. At that point, I decided to take it upon myself to call the lender to see what was going on with my house, and that's when I discovered that my house actually had a sale date of the 7th of December. Mind you it was already the 2nd of December, and the letter was scanned to the Processor the 1st week of November, which was more than enough time to contact the bank to see what could be done to avoid or postpone the foreclosure. On the 6th of December, the day before the sale, I was on the phone with a customer service representative from my lender, and when she discovered that I was a U.S. Army soldier, overseas serving my country, that was my saving Grace. I got absolutely no sleep that night ensuring that I faxed every piece of documentation possible to ensure my house was taken off of the foreclosure list. On themorning of the sale, the 7th of December, I was on the phone with another Customer Service Representative for 2 hours ensuring that my house was removed from the Sale List...and in the end, I was successful...Again.....I was successful. Quite naturally the American Law Firm tried to take credit for being the ones responsible for stopping the sale at the last minute, stating that it was the documentation that they faxed at the very last minute was what stopped the sale, and when I contacted another Customer Service Representative to verify if this was in fact true, they confirmed what I already knew, that the American Law Firm faxed and did nothing at the last minute to stop the sale....But it was infact everything that I faxed to them the day before that stopped the sale. I just so happened that the very next day, the 8th of December, I was going home to the States for the Christmas holidays, and there was a note on my door from the people who actually purchased my home stating that I needed tovacate the premisesASAP or start paying them rent. When I contacted my lender, it was discovered that my house was actually sold on the courthouse steps the day prior, but the sale was rescinded at the last minute because of the docs I faxed. When I emailed a letter to the American Law Firm seeking a refund for services that I felt were not rendered, I received an email from one of the Managers Tony (Last Name unknown) basically berating me for beingthe irresponsible one forfalling behind on my mortage, and in so many words ensuring me that I would not be getting a refund. A few weekslater, just as I had expected, I received a letter from the American Law Firm stating that they basically did their job and I am basically not due a refund and my case was closed. Again, I am not the least bit surprised by this, because it's firms such as this that prey on desperate hard working people such as myself who have fallen on hard times willing to pay an astronomical amount of money in the hopes of saving their property from foreclosure, and in the end, when people have lost their homes, they refuse to keep their promise of refunding the consumer. I would like to believe that I was one of the fortunate ones that was able to save my property from foreclosure, but I have read countless complaints on the internet about people who have sought the help of the American Law Firm in the hopes of saving their property, and in the end they still end up losing their homes as well as their money. As a result of this, I am prepared to take this firm to Small claims court in the hopes of receiving some form of refund...any amount would be worth it...but I wanted to tell my story in the hopes of putting an end to this firms continuance of scamming hard working people out of the money that they don't have.

Farmers Branch, Texas United States of America ",,215-227-2727,"Efrain Sain Law office of Efrain Sain Incompetent, unreliable attorney Farmers Branch, Texas"," My attorney, Efrain Sain, from Farmers Branch, very poorly represented me in the case in court. In all honesty, it appeared as if he was working against me, rather than on my side. When he appeared at court, he was wearing what appeared to be some worn out khakis, dirty shoes, and a sloppy shirt. It looked more like someone requiring defense himself than an attorney.  1. I was having my doubts about whether or not Mr. Sain could handle the case due to his apparent lack of interest in discussing it with me. Finally, I just showed up at his office to ask him if he felt this was a good case for him, or if I should get another attorney. He assured me, that he was very excited about this case, and he believed that I the defendant was innocent, and assured me he wanted the case. He was not prepared for the case at the time  2. He swayed my witness, Linda Kiel, the woman in the vehicle with me to ""act as a hostile witness"" against me. She told me this after the trial when she and I had gone swimming at the club she belongs to. She told me that he told her he  Believed it would look better in the case if she conveyed we were not friends anymore. I was not made aware of this by Mr. Sain at any time, before or after the trial.  3. When we arrived at trial, he was not prepared at all. It was then that he asked me if I could provide any notes on the case. He appeared to just be starting to write notes on how he was going to go forward. This is when I knew that he had not prepared anything until the actual trail date.  4. During the case, I would write him notes on issues I felt needed to be addressed, and he just disregarded them. These were issues involving false claims made by the prosecution, and events that occurred during the incident that were not being disclosed.  5. During every break of the case, Mr. Sain would spend his time flirting with the prosecuting attorney. When the judge would announce break, he would usually head right over to her table, and talk about how he was a saxophone player. My family and I shocked by his lack of attention to discuss any issues with me during break, but would rather go over to talk with her. 7. At the beginning of the trial, the judge stated that neither prosecuting nor defendant is allowed to meet with witnesses during breaks. Every break, my family and I had witnessed the prosecutors client with all his witnesses together meeting in the hallway. I told my lawyer that I thought it should be mentioned to the judge, and he just said ""nah"".  8. At the end of the case the prosecution approached the jury with her rendition. She was fluent, and acted like she knew what she was doing. When Efrain Sian went up, he took some memory cards up with him, which he clumsily read through, and even lost his place in the middle of his closing statement, excused himself in order to find composure. It was a total embarrassment, 9. At the end of the trial, my lawyer immediately stated he does not do appeals, and persuaded us that we should not try and appeal because we would not win anyway. All of the prosecutions witnesses were related (i.e., husband, wife, mother, and wife??s ex-husband). They of course shared the same story. When the one witness they had that was not related went on the stand, his story was not consistent with the others, but more similar to mine. I highly emphasized this to my attorney during trial, but he shook his head and did not address it all. I personally felt this was detrimental in the case. I lost the case because of his incompetence. This has cost me an incredible loss, to include my job, because he never did prepare for the case. Mark, Irving, TX ",Lawyers,0

It only showed that we have a $0 Savings Account Balance which makes me wonder if everything for 9 months has just gone to Bay View and tono creditors!

Las Vegas, Nevada United States of America ",www.sdfnvlaw.com,216-566-9908,"Attorney Alan D. Freer   Financial Exploitation & Abuse of Elders, Las Vegas, Nevada"," Alan Freer Corrupt Lawyer In Las Vegas Guardianship Racket: Back in 2008 my father died in an auto accident in Las Vegas, leaving my mother
alone. My mother was in the beginning stages of Alzheimers and we had no other
family members living in Las Vegas because my parents had fallen for
propaganda from a home developer that moving to a retirement community in
Nevada would be good for them, so my parents moved away from their family in
Colorado. Because I was on the east coast giving a seminar at the time of my
fathers death, I was unable to get to LasVegas immediately. Just days after my fathers death,
a private guardian was put in charge of my mother. It turned out that a
neighbor, thinking she was helping, called the Clark County
Senior Protective Services and explained that my mother was alone and was
acting funny.  This county agency told the neighbor to call the guardianship
commissioner office of Jon Norheim for help. Someone in that office gave the
neighbor the office number of a private fiduciary, Jared Shafer of Professional
Fiduciary Services of NV, who was suppose toprotect my mother until I
could arrive from the east coast. When I finally got into town, Mr. Shafer told me that he would draw
up paperwork for me to be co-guardian with him for my mother because I was not a resident of Nevada and therefore I was not allowed to be her guardian, that a resident of Nevada was necessary to serve as a co-guardian with me. Mr. Shafer said I would be hearing from his lawyer, Alan
Freer, in a few days and not too worry since a caregiver was placed in moms
home and that she would be in good hands. Mr. Shafer also told me I
could visit, but that I couldnt spend the night at her home. I thought this
was odd, but thought maybe this was how it was supposed to be. He also told me
I was not to remove anything from the home. I thought these restrictions were unusual but because I was quite distraught over the death of my father and
concerned for my mother I let it go and I went back to work in Colorado and
waited to hear from Mr. Freer. After 3 weeks went by with no word from Mr. Shafer or his attorney
Alan Freer, I contacted Mr. Freer, who told me that Mr. Shafer never accepts a
co-guardian and that it was too bad because he already had temporary
guardianship and they had already filed for permanent guardianship and that I
could come and petition for guardianship myself but Id needed someone else in NV to
be guardian with me. He also told me that if I objected to Mr. Shafer or filed for
guardianship that judge Norheim would give he and Mr. Shafer what they wanted
so there was no point in even trying. He said, Mr. Shafer and I tell judge
Norheim what we want and you cant do anything about it. You will never be
guardian of your mother and if you go against us well make sure the judge
always rules in our favor and well make damn sure your parents estate will be
emptied, leaving you nothing when she dies. And then he hung up the phone. I was floored at hearing this. Since this conversation with this lawyer Alan Freer, I have been fighting him to gain guardianship of my
mother for over 2 years. They have gone through over $400,000 of my parents
estate and are about to sell moms home, with the help of Wells Fargo, and put her in a
rest home. She is very depressed and wants to come to Colorado and be with her children and grand
children, but Mr. Shafer and Mr. Freer will not allow her to leave. I am fearful for
her safety and well being. During the last 2 years, Mr. Alan Freer has done nothing but lie and
make up bad things about my family and me. Every time Mr. Freer or Mr. Shafer
tell lies in Jon Norheims court he does nothing about it, it is as if he is
deaf and blind to any of their bad behavior in court. In fact, Commissioner Norheim allows them
to use inappropriate words and comments in court. Once Mr. Shafer referred to my mothers property as a
pile of crap. Another time I tried to speak up to defend myself against their
lies about me and my family but Commissioner Norheim had the baliff threaten
to arrest me if I spoke again.  This is all very unfair and this Clark County
Family Court is run like a free for all, with Mr. Norheim, Mr. Freer and Mr.
Shafer all saying and doing want they want to exploit and abuse the ward and
their families. To add insult to injury, Mr. Freer and Mr. Shafer smirk and
laugh at us and Commission Norheim turns a blind eye and ear. Mr. Norheim also
exhibits some very bad behavior, even admitting that he doesnt have to follow
the law all the time. Attorney Freer did tell me that Mr. Norheim gives them
want they want, which sounds like Mr. Norheim is accepting some kind of favors. This lawyer Alan Freer is the most horrible excuse of an attorney. He
lies, he threatens and he over bills my parents estate for nothing and so does
Jared Shafer. He repeatedly files the same documents time after time all to create
more billings. He insults me and my family and my mother. He even insults my
attorney and my moms doctors. He is very rude, mean and corrupt and I dont
understand why he is still practicing law. My experience tells me that the
Clark County court system, the judges, the guardians, the attorneys and the
banks are all working together to take advantage of old people like my mother.  We are also having a difficult time with Wells Fargo Bank, the
trustee for my parents trust. A Ms. Eve Mills is the person working with
Mr.Shafer and Mr. Freer to make sure the estate is being disgorged of its
assets, with the highest amount of money being paid to attorney Alan Freer, which makes my family think that Mr. Shafer is possibly getting a cut of Mr. Freer's excessive fees. Ms. Eve
Mills will not answer my questions or return my calls, she acts like the trust
is hers and I that I dont have any rights, even if I am a beneficiary. She
told me that Mr. Freer and Mr. Shafer are very important people in the
community, which sounded as if she admired these miserable excuses of human
beings, which doesnt say much for her or Wells Fargo Bank. I just found that others have posted complaints about attorney Alan
Freer and guardian Jared Shafer and that they are being investigated by the
government. I certainly hope so, I will file my own complaints to as many
agencies as possible, as will my relatives and friends. Anyone with any
information on these 2 and their associates should add comments to my posting
to help all of us victims and to stop further abuse of our elders by attorneys
like Alan Freer and guardians like Mr. Shafer. After one of our hearings, in the court hallway, I heard attorney
Alan Freer tell Mr. Jared Shafer and his assistant, Patience Bristol,
Well, we screwed another jerk who thinks hes going to save his mother and
family estate. These out of state kids need to just go away and let us rip off
their parents. Mr. Shafer and Miss. Bristol laughed. They did
not know that I was standing behind them but even when they saw that I heard
them, they acted as if they were happy I had heard. These are very creepy
people. Attorney Alan Freer should be disbarred and he and professional
guardian Jared Shafer should be in jail for exploiting my mother and all the
other senior citizens that moved to Nevada
thinking they had found their paradise. What a joke. Lets hope the joke is on
them soon when all their dirty deeds catch up with them. Im one of those
people who feel that justice will be seen so fellow victims, please speak up. ",Lawyers,0

Steals Money From Senior Citizens By Excessive Billings To Estates Of Wards  On Behalf Of Corrupt Guardian Jared Shafer- Las Vegas, Nevada"," Alan Freer is stealing money from my uncle in Nevada. He works for a corrupt guardian by the name of Mr. Shafer. The court system is a mess there, they don't listen to the families, only to Freer and Shafer, who exploit the wards. Freer over bills Shafer's wards, which comes from the estate of the senior under Shafer's care. Care is a loose word here because all Shafer does is send out his assistant, Patience Bristol, to check on my uncle once in a while and then bills about $3000 a month for her little 5 or 10 minute visits. Freer helps Shafer fight the families because he can charge the ward's estate or trust and the bank, Wells Fargo, gives Freer and Shafer all they want with no questions. They are all working together in this guardianship racket in Las Vegas.  Alan Freer is very vicious and unethical, flinging lies about the ward's family members who want to remove the ward from Mr. Shafer. My cousin has been trying to be guardian of my uncle for months but Freer keeps making false accusations and threats to my cousin, who is a good person and loves my uncle very much. Freer even laughs in court when he get his way and insults my cousin with little comments that are very cruel. He seems to get a big kick out of stealing my uncle's money AND treating my cousin horribly. Shafer also laughs and grins and makes desrepectful comments about my uncle, referring to him and his assets as ""crap"" or some other distasteful adjective. I have gone to nearly all my uncle's hearings and witnessed this repugnant behavior by Alan Freer and Jared Shafer. The family court commissioner, Jon Norheim, condons this bad behavior and gives Freer and Shafer what they want, which is very suspicious andwe've heard rumors of bribes being given to the court. The state of Nevada and the U.S. government had better do something about his Las Vegas crime of elders. And, my uncle is a veteran, and veterans are given no respect by Freer or Shafer, in fact they think it's funny to take his veteran benefits away from him. If you are a victim of Las Vegas attorney Alan Freer, please report him to all agencies. I have never seen such a creepy and despicable attorney ever in my life. His fees are over the top high which leads us to believe that he's giving a cut to Jared Shafer because, after all, they are stealing money from my uncle. They have no respect for the elderly or anyone that may fall under their control. They are not human beings because they have no soul or heart only a big fat appetite for greed. They do not care about anyone but themselves and how much money they can steal. Freer acts like it's his money to take as does Shafer. Alan Freer, Jared Shafer, Patience Bristol, Jon Norheim--keep your eye on all of them because they are all working together to rob senior citizens and veterans just like my uncle in Las Vegas.

Several problems existed with this debt.  First, and most importantly, it wasn't my wife's, but someone with the same name.  (The address for the other party wasnt' even anywhere close to any place myself or my wife have ever lived.)  Second, there was no paper trail for Assignment of Account, (which has to be completely intact, from original creditor to current debt collector) that had either the original owner (the CC company) or any notice of Assignment from same.   Third, there was no signature on any paperwork (of course) anywhere that gave any indication ANYBODY was obligated for the debt.  Fourth, as a Credit Card debt, the Statute of Limitations was long past (written - signed and amortized - contracts in Iowa SoL = 10 years, open (Credit Card) contracts = 5 years.  (This debt was purported to have been charged off by the CC carrier in 2002, meaning the SoL expired in 2007.) Fifth, as if needed, an Affirmative Action defense would have involved ""dirty hands"", because L & S Financial faked an invoice with my wife's name on it; the invoice is dated October 2002 and within their own filing paperwork, they admit they didn't own the account until October of 2009. This is not only unethical, but is illegal. The most AMAZING factor is my corporate attorney, (my firm; on retainer for some 25+ years now) informed McCormick of ALL these factors during pre-trial negotiations, during discovery over the past year, yet McCormick insisted it go to trial.   Now, this case came to my attention, of course, in October 2009 when L & S Financial, LC and Neiman, Stone & McCormick filed their initial paperwork.  I didn't even study the filing; I simply directed it to my law firm to deal with.  Imagine my surprise when my guys informed my wife early last week that she would need to be in court early THIS week. So my wife and my lawyer showed up, McCormick showed up, and while still in chambers (with the two lawyers and the judge) the judge asked McCormick if he was really serious: there wasn't anything there.  Yup, he was serious.  So my wife took the stand, couple questions got asked and answered, and the judge dismissed the case in its entirety. One can draw one's own conclusions from the details.  McCormick had to drive over 3 hours each way to lose an obvious lost case.  Did he hope my lawyer wouldn't show, or my wife? (It was a very substantial amount of money; gaining a summary judgement in his favor would have paid very well.)  I don't know.  I do know McCormick & McCormick's behavior was predatory and very much in abrogation of their respective industry's established ethics, as well as deliberately in violation of the FDCPA. I also have to wonder how many people these folks steamroll, who might feel a tinge of guilt over an old debt, or who don't have the financial resources or intellectual wit to fight back.  (Anyone out there in these types of shoes would do well to remember the Statutes of Limitations are there for a reason and a purpose.) I also know that now that the case is settled, it is now MY turn. Notice on this page is not the only venue I will be using to gain more ""attention"" for these two bad actors.  In fact, on Wednesday December 8 I will be speaking with the FTC about the law firm; it is a violation of the FDCPA to sue, or threaten to sue, consumers to recover a time-barred debt.  It is also a violation to attempt to collect a debt (in Iowa, anyway) when your company is not registered to do so.

										In the midst of a malicious prosecution against my daughter we went to see a lawyer named Peter Knecht, who professed to be an expert of sorts in malicious prosecutions. Peter Knecht tolds us how persecuted she was and how it would cost him 30k because of the mess made by this malicious prosecution. He then recommened a lawyer who worked in his office and told us that this guy was like him when he was young and if we hired this guy he would help. The guy we would meet, James Silverstien, seemed like a clown but we thought that for 10k now we would get the services of Peter Knecht. Peter Knecht kept coming into the office and was talking strategy and kept saying, "" We will take good care of you."" Otherwise we would never retain for 10k James Silverstien for a misdemeanor.  James Silverstien told us all how easy the case was and even called the same night to make sure we signed with him. [continued below]....
									
										..... Well, it got complicated and the prosecution became more malicious. There was without charges or basis a ""coercive confinement."" and Silverstien did nothing to get my daughter out of jail when any lawyer doing the most minimal work would. It's incredible considering the facts of the case but rotten Jamie Silverstien doesn't bother with things like learning the factss of the case. When after 31 days she was released without explanation on bail James Silverstien and Knecht tried to pressure her into a plea for a worse deal than was offerred with the public defender. If the facts of the case are known than the idea that anyone would pay this bastard 10k to plea when the public defender had already offerred the best plea possible. Knecht behavior  is even more egregious, really, considering how he adverstises himself and wants to be seen as a man who will fight the government.  When she refused James Silverstien, to curry favor with a malicious prosecution and judge, went on the record to say that he had told my daughter to plea and he believed she'd be punished harsher if she didn't. Then, James Silverstien just took the money and ran- withrew from the case and instantly alerted the adversary that he was doing so so they could prepare. Which they did.James Silverstien  stole the last cent of innocent and trusting people and left them pennilesss and stuck with the overburdened public defender.Well, my daughter didn't take the plea and with a overworked underfunded public defender who could care less really, she  was aquitted , by a JUDGE at trial  .The case was a vile joke with no merit whatsoever and so many witnesses.

The names they provided were : Daniel Baker(supervisor), Tony Smith, Ralph Hamm, and Jack Anderson. They called from two different numbers which were 240-720-1997 and 901-620-0276. The callers stated that their law firm represented Cash Net Express and had provided me an online loan which I had defaulted on. They wanted to know my attorney's info and I said I didnt have any attorney. They asked how I planned to handle my problem without an attorney. I responded by wanting to know why there was a problem because I never got a loan from their ""client"". They threatend that I would be arrested and go to jail for theft and bank fraud for not repaying this loan. They then statede I had what they called a ""Out of Court Restitution"" document attached to my file and that I could avoid being arrested by giving them my credit/debit card number and by faxing a ""hand written"" letter authorizing them to charge my account 510 dollars to resolve the issue. The fax number they provided waqs 818-450-0780. I told them I never recieved or signed for any loan and that I wasn't paying them crap. I also told them I was going to report them to law enforcement and they began to curse at me and make continued threats of being put in jail for things such as bank and check fraud. I was so mad I just hung up the phone. They called four or five different times  harrassing me. I check with my bank and verified that there had been no transactions like they had described made since the account had been opened and the only deposits made were the ones I personally made. To be safe I went ahead and placed a freeze on the account. This has been very distressing and I dont appreciate these people attempting to steal from me. I really don""t like the way they cursed at me and threatend me. Hopefully these people are shut down and put away before they cheat too many people out of their hard-earned money. ",Lawyers,0

On 13 November 2010, at 8:57am, I got a phone call from this telephone number on my cell phone 210-418-1011. I was unable to answer the phone at that time. I got a voicemail several seconds later. *Broken English Male**India* or other foreign accent. The voice-mail said and I quote ""This message is intended for, my full name, with the last four of 1234. Of course he used my real last four. David the very second your receive this message I need you or your attorney to call the issue at hand is very time sensitive. My name is Kenny Rogers, my contact information is 210-418-1011. Do not discard this message, David if you discard this message and I do not hear from you or your attorney today, then the only this I can do for you is wish you good luck as the situation unfolds on you. At 9:15am I returned the call. The first time I got a voice mail saying the person at extension 987 was unable to take my call please leave a message. At 9:20am I tried again. This time I got through to a Leo Fernandez, I told him that I just received a call from this number and I was returning the call as it was urgent. He went through some papers and told me to please wait just one moment. After finding my records he said is this David using my last name with the SSN# 123-45-6789? I said yes. What can I help you with? The man named Leo said that he was from Morgan and Associates in San Antonio, TX. I said hello, what can I help you with? He asked me if I lived at an address that I lived at over 10 years ago. I said no, I do not live there and havent for 10 years. He tried to get off the phone with me. I said listen here, you said this was urgent; you have my SSN so you got me on the phone what the hell do you want? He said that charges were filed against me in the state of Indiana for fraud and theft. He started reading me this statement which I could not interrupt, which sounded like he was reading me a subpoena, Count one fraud, Count two theft, blah blah blah. When he finished he said do I have any questions. I said yes. Who is the company that is suing me?He said he could not give me that information. How much do I owe this said person? He could not give me that information. After about 5 min on the phone, he told me that US Cash Advance gave me a loan to my bank, knew my bank and the address, by direct deposit and I have failed to make payments. The company was not willing to settle the debt and they will be taking me to court in Indiana. What is the name of your attorney? I verified the information and asked if he was a lawyer. He said yes, for Morgan and Associates. I said that I never heard of US Cash Advance and that I would not use a company for a payday loan. He said that he will have to notify my place of business USAF... NOTE: Everyone in the world sees USAF and the first thing they think of is United States Air Force... but he didn't know that he just said he would have to notify my place of business at USAF what I have done and the legal matters that were against me. I asked him how we can work something out.. He said if I pay the amount that I owe off today, which was $1,499.00 then this would all go away, but he would have to speak with the company first to see if they would accept my offer without court. He said the court cost would be in the amount of $4,000.00. I said I can't pay that amount today and he said that he was sorry and that he will proceed with the court. I said that was fine with me. He would not send me anything in the mail or anything. While I was on the phone with my bank to freeze my accounts, my wife got a phone call from Kenny Rogers. A completely different number than mine, so this told me this guy had my wifes cell phone number and my number. He was asking for me. The same phone numbers everything, except the law firm was Jesse and Jesse. He asked me the same stuff I asked him who he was.. He told me Kenny Rogers.. I told him Kenny Rogers is a singer not a lawyer. He got really mad and said I know that and it is none of my business what his parents named him and he starting speaking to someone in another language and hung up the phone. I called back. The person answered and said can I help you? I hung up... I contacted my bank, credit bureaus, local, and county authorities. What worries me is that our cell phones are only 3 months old and on Verizon network. Did Verizon have a leak of information? Who are these men calling and what is he going to do with my information? I will also contact Morgan and Associates. I traced the number to an invalid number, and looked up Morgan and Associates on Google.. I didnt even find the Firms webpage until page 5 all these complaints and scams about this peoples stories. BECARFUL! Leo Fernandez or Kenny Rogers could call you next.  ",Lawyers,0

During the course of instruction in its Graduate program in Forensic Science, I had the privilege of encountering one of National's premier professors - - James Eckmann. I provided James Eckmann with well cited work, and even notified him of another student who literally cut and paste roughly three pages of material from the Internet and posted it. Given the nature of the Forensic Science field, there is no room for dishonesty. However, James Eckmann could care less as he actually reduced work provided to him despite the fact my work was well cited.  Next, James Eckmann decided to whine as he reported a statement I made to the administration. Was it profanity or being dishonest? It was my decision to challenge his grading by stating in part, ""As I said, your grading, even for a third tier school is laughable and demonstrates your lack of effort in the class as well."" Equally laughable is the fact Curt Williams, Judicial Affairs for National Affairs, decided to write me alleging I may face discipline. My statement simply places my opinion of what my thoughts are and provided the fact National University is a very low ranked school. Simply put, it appears James Eckmann has an excessive superiority complex where if you dare challenge him, he will reduce your grade, and report you for discipline. There are multiple reasons why National University is a bottom tiered school. James Eckmann is only one of them.  FYI, I repeat James Eckmann for the purpose of increasing search results.   ",Lawyers,0

This firm is concerned more about, the self- promotion of their law firm through their website, various media outlets, i.e., the Washington Post, Washington Business Journal, The Chamber, Politico, Fed-Times, CNN, Military Times and participating in an Army 10-miler expo and making money off of their clients than they are about defending the rights of their clients. This firm has lost focus and gotten off the task of providing competent legal services for their clients. The attorneys assigned to my case lacked courage/court room presence and were afraid to speak up before my Agency/the EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ) and aggressively defend my case. The attorneys were unprofessional, incompetent, lacked integrity, did not possess the necessary skills to persuasively argue my case and charged excessive legal fees. I was billed for information I provided and research I conducted that they should have completed. Twice they used a tactic of assigning a junior attorney to my case. These junior attorneys increases their billable hours by calling me basically to rehash facts that had already been discussed with the senior attorney assigned to my case. I confronted one of the junior attorneys about this and he became angry and hung up the phone. The lawyers seem to forget that they are employed by the client and should acknowledge the client's recommendations as to what direction the case should go. The firm represents themselves as knowledgeable about federal government EEOC matters yet the attorney for my case was ""clueless"" and did not know who to contact at the EEOC to find out what AJ would be assigned to my case when the original AJ left the EEOC to become a U.S. Magistrate. Please check your invoices/ court filings for errors. Twice, I was billed for services that were rendered to another client! The firms lawyers also misrepresented the cost of my legal fees to the EEOC AJ reporting that my fees were approximately $40K more than what I actually owed , chose to ignore and not address/report the unprofessional conduct/bias of the EEOC AJ assigned to my case (as the lawyers code of ethics requires them to do) because they may have to appear before this AJ again on another case. The lawyer stated that he did not want to be involved in an investigation regarding the AJ in this matter. In July 2010, I informed the junior attorney that as a result of the pre-hearing telephone conference with the hostile/biased EEOC AJ , I decided that it would be unproductive to proceed to hearing. It was then that the junior attorney said that there was ""Money on the table for my legal fees!"" Meaning, that the Agency was willing to settle and pay my legal expenses. This did not make sense. I waited another four weeks to hear about settlement results with negative results . In August 2010, I became so frustrated with the lawyers at Tully & Rinckey's incompetence/lack of interest in my EEOC case, lack of candor and the fact that I had limited financial resources that I requested that the firm voluntarily withdraw my case before the EEOC AJ. In the end, after 2 years I paid Tully and Rinckey PLLC approximately $80K of my hard earned savings. Just imagine what they would have charge me if my case was in federal court. They couldn't even negotiate a basic settlement, which should have been their first order of business. If you are looking for competent counsel to represent you before the federal sector of the EEOC you will do better going with another firm. Someone should investigate the practices of how this firm bills it's clients. Not recommended! ",Lawyers,0

										They contacted me after they purchased a credit debt which was deemed and lost stolen/fraudulent almost a decade before these guys purchased it as secondary debt collectors.  I was never given validation of the original debt when I asked for it.  They served me one time by process server.  I answered and validated that I had no way to pay them and also stated that i refused to pay for a debt that was deemed as fraudulent.  We agreed on the fact through mail correspondence.  They left me alone for some years and then I come to find that suddenly they have placed a default judgment against me behind my back and I was never properly notified by them or the courts.  So, I show the Pima County Justice Court that their judgment was based on fraudulent account and removed by all major credit bureaus.  They make my balance a 0 as to what is owed in court but, keep this record and lien against my name.  I make several appeals and I am railroaded out of court.  The attorney general themselves told me to watch out for these people as they have strong political ties and Peter Balsino is on the ethics committee of Arizona.  No matter what appeal I try I am never given a fair chance to display the facts that they are collecting on a fraudulent count and I am railroaded out of court by the judge.  I am not even allowed to secure a lawyer and the Judge herself has fabricated reasons to dismiss my appeals such as ""ex-parte communication with the judge"" which I never tried to speak to her at all in writing or any means during appeal process.  I had written proof in writing where lawyer Peter M. Balsino admits that he acknowledges he is collecting on a fraudulent account passed to Attorney general's office revealed to Arizona state Bar as a complaint of ethical violations""Willingly doing something unlawful"" and they refused to do anything.  Finally I contacted Arizona Department of Financial Institutions and came up with a valid report that them and their plaintiff Action Financial IV, LLC out of Phoenix were practicing illegal and unlicensed ""debt collection"" in the state of Arizona.  The Arizona State Bar still refused to do anything and I had involved the BBB and FTC at this point because of Federal not just ethical violations being done here.  My appeal is no longer in litigation as I have been railroaded out of court again.  So, I have reported them once again to the State Bar in hopes that they will comply because they are practicing ""debt collection"" completely unlawfully in Arizona.  As a member of ethics committee they should be held to much higher standards.  And I have also reported the Judge Maria Felix to the Arizona Commission on Judicial (Mis)Conduct because all my appeals are turned away, my request for a new judge completely ignored, and fabrication of details in order to deny my appeals.  I have my last letter to the court concerning my appeal and there was never any direct conversation to the judge although I had complained to the clerks about not having paid me the money they owed me back and losing track of what they owed me.  They claim that fraud had occurred and so this had distracted them from getting my appeal properly filed.  I am real fed up with Pima County Consolidated Justice Court and with the illegal practiced of Action Financial IV, LLC and Aron & Associates, P.C.  I hope the Arizona State Bar will finally take my complaint as I have valid proof.  But, for now I urge all to boycott these guys and spread the word about their misconduct.",Lawyers,0

We made an appointment and were told about the Government Obama Remodification Program. To qualify we must first have a debt ratio of 36% or more. Based on our income and expenses paid out we were found to have a 51% debt ratio and we qualify for the Obama Remodification Program. We were also advised that we should consider filing for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy so we will be protected. However the Remodification and Chapter 13 will be filled separate with separate service fees. They sound so sure that this is the help we needed in order to save our home. We agreed to file for both remodification program and chapter 13 paid our $200 retainers fee and paid the balance of $1800.00 with in one month before the actual court filing of our documents. A payment plan was worked out in the amount of $2580.00 to be paid every month and that we can not miss a payment or we will be disqualified from the program. We are to continue to pay this amount until our remodification was done and the monies received will be in care of our appointed trustee Kathleen Leavitt. The monies will not be distributed until our remodification loan was final. We paid 13 months amounting to $33,171.00. When asked how much longer they replied to just keep paying your monthly payment. On 29 September I went in person to see Haines&Krieger to see how our remodification was coming along because it was just too long. I was told to see a negotiator located next door to their office to check on my status. I signed in and saw negotiator Kevin. After 13 months he regretfully tells me that my remodification was denied because my lender First Horizon Home Loan have been refusing to negotiate a new affortable loan and will no longer negotiate. When asked how did this happen he replied your lender First Horizon is the worst his ever worked with and they are very cold and they do not care about people. He said First Horizon somehow managed to remove their name off the Government HUD List. Which no longer requires First Horizon to work with trouble home owners. He also said that there are 400 other First Horizon clients in the same situation as myself. He said I will have to see my attorney for other possible option. On the following week I was scheduled to see attorney Marilyn who expressed her regrets and there is only two(2) options. First, walk away and foreclose and secondly, short sale. However, should we decide to go ahead with the Chapter 13 I will have to make an appointment with Matt Foster to sign-off a release of my remodification and Matt will worked a new monthly payment for the Chapter 13 only. After three(3) weeks we finally get scheduled to see Matt Foster. He worked out our new monthly Chapter 13 payment to be $1006.00 per month on a five(5) year program. We told him we changed our minds because we feel we were misinformed and it took them 13 months to include 13 payments that my remodification was denied. We were also told that the trustee fees of $15,000.00 will be collected with or without filling Chapter 13.  Is this legal or what? How can these attorneys just because they know the law better than I just to ripped me off.  On top of our troublesome economy attorneys like this are being allowed to ripped off descent and abiding working citizens of Nevada who just seeked for help to save our homes. I wish and pray to god that attorneys Haines & Krieger are found accountable and are required to pay back all the monies they ripped off from people of Nevada.

We agreed to his terms and sent all the necessary paperwork. Over the next 3 months $1167.00 was taken out of our checking account. We were asked for extra paperwork each month. I called and talked to Pierre several times and he said it was being handled by someone else and they would get in touch with me. Over a period of 5 months I talked to 10 different people. In May we received a foreclosure notice. I immediately called the company and was told it would be taken care of that our house would not be sold. Two weeks later we received a sale date of July 26th. Once again I called and was told I would have to talk to Kamili. She never called so I called her. No one returned our calls.  I talked to BOA and they said that on June 4th they talked to Michelle from there but that what it no paperwork had been sent in for a modification. Finally they last week before the sale date I called Pierre and was told he no longer worked there but he would see that it was taken care of.

I pulled all of the info together a 3rd time and sent it in along with a letter stating that I was not happy that they were not doing there job and that it was taking to long to get this process completed.  Insisted that they stay on top of things or refund my Guaranteed $1,800. The next day I got a blanket email stating that they we broke and filing for bankruptcy protection.  To this day I have still not seen anywhere that they actually filed for bankruptcy and did find out that they are not at the address listed anymore. I suspect that they are moving to a new location under a new name and start ripping more people off again.I am now working directly with BOA and we are about half way through the process in just 1 month. I suggest to everyone to do the same.  It takes a little time to put all the info together that they need to process your claim and then only a few weeks to determine if you will qualify.  If you do then they put you on a modified program to see if that works out for you.Do Not Pay Someone else, Do it Yourself and Save!!!",Lawyers,0

										Over a year ago I started receiving phone calls on my cell from a guy 
who is OBVIOUSLY foreign (he can barely speak English). This guy was 
calling a friend of mine, then began calling my parents as well. The 
phone calls stopped for about 6 months; now, here we go again! But this 
time, I am not only receiving the calls from this guy, but a woman too! 
There are several reasons I think these phone calls are not legit: 
1) The callers barely speak English, yet they say their names are Mary, 
John, Frank, Jenny, etc. 
2) Although the callers use different names, they sound like the same 
person to me
3) When the calls began, the guy was stating my SSN on my voice mail. He
 was saying something to the effect of, "". . . we have your your SSN as:
 xxx-xx-xxxx. We need you to confirm.""
4) HE says he is calling from ""the back office of USA Finance"", SHE says she is calling from a law firm, yet it sounds as if they
 are calling from the middle of Time's Square or, on several occasions, I
 can hear their car door dinging in the background.
5) My friend whom they were contacting actually called them back to see 
what it was all about. He also thought this was some type of scam. He 
told the guy, ""I'm sorry, but if you want any information from me you 
are going to have to have someone who speaks English call me back. I 
can't understand a thing you are saying to me."" The guy became 
irritated, hung-up on him & never called him back. 
6) These calls are constant! They will call 3-5 times back-to-back and 
the calls range anywhere from 8am - midnight.
7) Their phone number is inconsistent. It will be 1 # the first 2 times 
they call, then change. Sometimes it's an unlisted/restricted #. ",Lawyers,0

Bush did it right, not only did he make money off the oil prices that went sky rocket, but he gave AIG, the insurance company, and wallstreet $700,000,000,000 to get out of debt.  Which he should have given everyone in america about $22,000 so they could get out of debt, and let wallstreet collapse. I was looking for a business to settle my debts, not go bankrupt, I wanted to pay them as much as I could, not just say screw-you, thanks for the money like wallstreet did.  I was told by consumer debt that I would have to pay them $350.00 for a lawyer, John Leaberry, to start a bank account for me so I could build up money in my account and they could make my creditors offers that I could save money.  Well these people never had in their ads that I would be paying these people 25% of what I saved.  I was told that after my first offer to Chase credit card was reportly was settled,  Consumer debt said they would be sending me a check for $681.00 and that I was suppost to call a 'Ken' at a number, I would have thought that he worked for Chase but I was really wrong.  I talked to one of his co-workers and told them my account# and routeing# and 3 check#'s, and they were going to be taken out of my account starting in Jan 2010, first it would be $681.00 and then $218 in February, and again in March, all together I would get out of our Chase account paying just $1117. We didn't owe them much, I think that we might have owed them about alittle over 2,000., but as January went by, then Febrary came and it was almost time to take the second payment out of our account, there was no money comming out of our account, then when March came and went I cancelled the 3 check numbers I gave them, that cost another $31 to my bank.  I received emails that Chase had someone trying to get into our online account and they closed it and we had to call them to see what happened.  I called Elizabeth, my worker for the counsel, and she acted shocked, I wonder what she was so shocked about getting caught?  Then she called me again and said they had an offer for another card of mine, they wanted their fee before it was paid though, I told her that was enough.  They were going to settle for $692 and they wanted almost $509, but they said they would settle for $350, when I got to asking what all the fees were.  She started telling me that each payment of $350 they took $49 out before it went into my account, she said that was for taking care of the collections agencies calls, I don't know how they were called because I got most of the calls, and the paper work.  Well someone didn't do their job because some of the companies that called me after I told them to go to hell, say that they were  never contacted by anyone.  Then their fee, which was news to me, was a wopping 25% of what they saved me, but as Elizabeth told me that they were giving me a break, they named the fee that I paid, they didn't figure it up the way they did everyone else.  As soon as I got away from these people it didn't take them long to tell every credit card company that I was on my own.    This ConsumerDebt left all of these credit card companies up in the air until I quit their business.  I was told by a few of the card companies that they were never notified of what happened to me.  As of April non of the checks that I told this co-worker of Ken ever came through my account.  I wonder what they did.  I know I got taken for the 4  months of the $49.00 and the $222.00 they said was their fee, and the first $350.00 that they said it was unreturnable, was never told that either.  That adds up to almost a thousand dollars I got took.

Attorney Frank Deslauriers,"  Attorney Frank Deslauriers  214 West Pleasant Avenue 
Covington, Tennessee United States of America ",,321.631.0506,"Attorney Frank Deslauriers  Avoid At all Cost Covington, Tennessee"," I want to alert and file a complaint against Covington, Tennessee lawyer Frank Deslauriers. I hired Deslauriers to handle a case for me. I was heistant to hire him in the first place because several friends of mine had warned me that it was not beneath him to do things that were borderline to downright unethical. To begin with, I found him rather rude with his own paralegal which turned me off. Despite my better instinct I did hire him because, though his prices were high, he was cheaper than the other attorney I had met with. I told him the particulars of the case and what my desired outcome with be. He nodded his head and I hired him.Months later I had not received a response of any kind so I started calling. His paralegal was extremely rude and twice started yelling at me. I would like to remind these legalized liars that when a client hires you, you work for them not the other way around.It took forever to get a response from Deslauriers and was appalled when we spoke. First, he had to be reminded of the particulars of the case. I had given him my information in great detail and he had promised me he would research the case. Finally after I could tell he had no clue about my case I asked for a meeting with him. He got very rude and said ""If you don't like how I am handling your case, you can get another attorney."" I responded ""maybe that's what I will do, can I get my money back?"" To my disbelief he said , ""No,the money has already been used and is therefore nonrefundable."" Now wait just a second. He admitted he hadn't worked on my case much, didn't no the particulars, yet thousands of dollars are gone. Say what! I was upset and demanded a meeting with him. He finally agreed to a meeting early in the morning.I arrived at his office and was not even allowed to go into his actual office. He came outside in the waiting area and sat down. His tone was less than friendly with me. I argued back with him and asked him if it was necessary for me to report him to the Board of Professional Responsibility. His tone quickly changed.In fact, it changed a lot. He made a few comments which I will keep to myself but were very inappropriate. I ended up leaving and dropping him as an attorney by never paying him another dime and no motion was ever filed by him (I am trying to come up with the money to find another attorney over a year later since he basically bankrupted me).The comments he made toward me are what bothers me the most. Since that time I have heard and learned several things which are of concern to me. Apparently and I am not trying to slander him, but this needs to be said, he had an extramaritial affair. In fact, I know of the person he had it with and that isn't speculation I am told, but a proven fact.I have always heard of other allegations that extramaritial affairs are common practice for this man including one currently going on. I cannot prove if these additional accusations are true or not, but I know for a fact at least one was proven. I also know for a fact he said some things about me that were inappropriate but in Tipton County, it is the good old boys system. He is basically untouchable but there are reasons for that which will remain unnamed.Why do I share this with you? I am deeply concerned as a woman and I am concerned for anyone woman or man that this man has no scruples apparently. I realize people make mistakes but you have someone who tries to destroy other people and wants to criticize how they live or if it is some kind of divorce or custody dispute has the audacity to try and accuse people of having affairs, etc. Practice what you preach sir.I will conclude with also saying that a friend of mine recently went to court and he was the opposing attorney. I sat in the courtroom amazed that I once had hired this man. The lies he told simply floored me. I once heard that a guy got so sick of his lies many years ago that he told his attorney if Deslauriers didn't shut up, he won't punch him out. Apparently Deslauriers in all his cockiness kept on lying and got a knuckle sandwich. There is some justice in this world. ",Lawyers,0

Everything seemed normal but I got a call from my lawyer, Stephen Johnson, paralegal who name is Nicholas Gleichman that I needed to come in right away as it was urgent. When I got to the office, Nicholas came right out and seemed very friendly. He asked that I come with him back to the conference area to review some papers.When we got to the conference room he was asking me how I was doing and then he asked me if I was seeing anyone. I asked if that was pertinent to the case and he says ""it would be pertinent to me."" I was flattered and taken back at the same time. I told him that while that was flattering that I wasn't interested at the moment. I have to say I found this uncomfortable to say the least. He seemed a little upset with me rejecting his advances. I thought about bringing it up to Stephen but decided that I could just grin and bear it as the divorce paperwork was almost done.A week or so after the divorce was final, I got a knock at my door and it was Nicholas. He had my copy of the divorce and said he thought he would drop it off personally and that it was on his way home in Takoma Park. I stepped outside because I did not want him coming inside and he just reached out and hugged me. He asked if I wanted to go out and celebrate. Needless to say I was shocked. I told him that I had plans that evening and was just getting ready to leave to meet some friends. Out of concern I told him maybe we could some other time and that seemed to appease him.The next day I called Nicholas at work and I told him that I appreciated him bringing the papers by but that I was interested in dating and that his employer would probably be concerned with him dating a client. I have seen him around town a couple of times and am hoping it is just a coincidence. I have even been thinking about moving out of town.Any ladies going to this firm need to be very careful when dealing with Nicholas.  ",Lawyers,0

Covington, Tennessee United States of America ",,330-670-7319,"Attorney Frank Deslauriers  Dishonesty Deslauriers Covington, Tennessee"," I really hate doing this but there is an attorney in Tipton County that must be reported. I am doing this not for myself but because this guy is a longtime attorney in Tipton County, many people make the mistake of using this guy. I am referring to attorney Frank Deslauriers of Covington. Here is my own experience. I went through a divorce with my exwife. While on the stand, Frank Deslauriers told the judge many things that were flat out lies. When I provided PROOF and showed the judge not only was he not reprimanded whatsoever, he continued to lie. Let me get this straight, a client can be charged with perjury if they blatantly lie but attorneys can say whatever. This guy has a reputation as probably the biggest liar in Tipton County.He told not only lies about me, but our two children and trashed my entire family, yet when I offered a rebuttal he began a character assault of epic proportions. In particular he was harsh on my oldest son who did get in some trouble a year or two ago at school UNDER HIS MOTHER'S SUPERVISION. Somehow he managed to blame me despite the fact my son and daughter were both living with their mother. I am particularly appalled because Frank Deslauriers often serves as a judge for juvenile court so he was familiar with my child who is not a bad kid. Talk about a conflict of interest.He lied about several things in court including some things said in two previous mediations. Even with some documentation he continued his string of lies with no reprimand. As he continued to lie, I made eye contact with my exwife who smiled from ear to ear. She knew what was going on.This man has no scruples whatsoever. After court, I was talking to my attorney and a friend of mine (Female) walked past Deslauriers who was standing outside the court room in the hall. Deslauriers made a deragatory comment toward her and she came back at him. He commented ""good thing you are a woman."" I don't know what exactly that meant but it came across as a threat in my view. However, these ambulance chasers apparently have a right to say what they want particularly this guy, who has a reputation as not being afraid to break any law necessary to win a case.I will put it this way. My sister is friends with his secretary (I am sure he doesn't know that but the fact my sister knows about Deslauriers is one of the reasons I didn't and would never use him myself. She knows way too much) and the secretary complained she didn't know what she was going to be able to do for Christmas (This was in December) because she hadn't been paid in weeks because ""his clients aren't paying"" Yet he went on a vacation himself for several weeks.If you go against him in court, warning! The truth does not matter. He is going to lie, cheat, set you up, you name it and because he is one of the ""good old boys"" he can get away with it. I felt sorry for my attorney who is a fairly young female. She just shook her head and mumbled under her breath ""wonder if I will be afforded the same opportunity to lie through my teeth.""

 Did not perform per agreement. Would not refund the amount of fees paid that were not used. Cocoa, Florida"," I paid Michael J. Kelley a $2500 retainer for him to represent me in my case. Within a week of obtaining his services, it became evident that he was not an aggressive attorney but more of an attorney that would just ""push"" me thorugh the system and not fight for me. Also, during the brief time that I had Mr. Kelley's representation, I had come to find out that Mr. Kelley was not as well versed in Fl. Law pertaining to my case as he led me to believe and was not aware of certain laws, rules, regulations that would help me in the long run. I confirmed this through conversations with other law professionals. Once I decided that I would require different legal representation, I contacted Mr. Kelley and requested a detailed billing for the work that he had perfomed on my case and a refund on the amount not earned. Mr. Kelley refused to give me the the refund on the amount not earned but he did send me a detailed billing statement (after two requests). Once I received the statement I realized that Mr. Kelley had only worked 6 hrs. (per his statement) and collected $2500 for his services. As Mr. Kelley charges up to $200 an hr. for his services (for what, I don't know), so I agree that I owe him $1200 but if he was a true professional he would provide me with the $1300 of my retainer that he did not earn. If you are thinking of hiring Michael J. Kelley, ask him a lot of detailed questions and go see other Attorneys. Ask them the same questions. I will bet that the other Attorneys will tell you one thing and Michael will tell you another as his knowledge of Florida Law does not appear to be up to par with his collegues. Also read any paperwork that he asks you to sign very carefully and ask very detailed questions on that as well, such as...""if you are so confident in your abilities why would you state that the retainer is non-refundable""?

I called dealerspecialties figuring it is some sort of clerical accounting error , they said they would check it out, I also reminded them of our incident 1 year ago for the damages to the vehicle.  They remebered and we came to an amicable deal to SETTLE  for 1,000.00 and we would call it even. I requested a hold harmless letter agreement by email from Dealerspecialties describing the agreement, and they emailed it to me.I said that before I send the payment I would need 1 from their hired attorneys as well. Then I called MARINO,MAYERS, & JARRACH spoke with Joseph Marino informing him of the deal me and his client arranged, He did not sound to happy and said he would get back to me ,that he would have to confirm with his clients.He never called me back I sent him an email to remind him I was awaiting his call back and release letter so I can send the 1,000.00 to dealerspecialties.He kept ignoring my emails and did not return my phone calls, He UNDERHANDEDLY against the wishes and the deal his CLIENTS made with me proceeded to take it to SPECIAL CIVIL COURT behind my back and place a judgement on me,so he can strongarm me into paying the full unjustified amount of $3,753.20 plus create outrages attorneys fees for himself and so he can get a big commision from the $3,753.20 which its around 30%! He was able to do this deceptively because they lead me to believe we had come to an amicable settlement and so I ignored the court date, he won by default cause I did not show up! He really tricked me by telling me its okay he was gonna check the propoesd agreement with his clients instead he mislead me!!! Had I  gone to court I'm positive the outcome would have been in my favor.I really think lawyers  are supposed to do things in a professional manner and conduct themselves with ethical behavior.  This attorney acts more like repo- man or street swindlers with no ethics, dont care who they hurt in the processs as long as they get their fees regardless what agreements are worked out or what their clients wishes are!I am in the process of complaining to the ethics commitee in passaic county mr. Robert l. Stober,to hopefully get some diciplanary action against this firm .I truely believe collection attorneys like this can hurt innocent hard working people with these unethical tactics,especialy small business owners just trying to survive in this rough economy.

I hired a sticker company to do for sale labels on my cars, Dealer Specialties, and they printed them wrong & not what we ordered and wrong information , as they were taking pictures of the vehicles they damaged and ran over my motorcycle with my rangerover!The dealerspecialties owner apoligized and paid for the motorcycle damage only, however the range rover was not fixed so he said he would re-do all the stickers and waive the charges to offset the range rover damage, I agreed and did not make a police report.However it left a bad taste in my mouth and decided not to use them any longer. 1year later they hired this law firm MARINO,MAYERS,& JARRACH, LLC to collect $3,753.20 from me.I called dealerspecialties figuring it is some sort of clerical accounting error , they said they would check it out, I also reminded them of our incident 1 year ago for the damages to the vehicle. They remebered and we came to an amicable deal to SETTLE  for 1,000.00 and we would call it even. I requested a hold harmless letter agreement by email from Dealerspecialties describing the agreement, and they emailed it to me.I said that before I send the payment I would need 1 from their hired attorneys as well. Then I called MARINO,MAYERS, & JARRACH spoke with Joseph Marino informing him of the deal me and his client arranged, He did not sound to happy and said he would get back to me ,that he would have to confirm with his clients.He never called me back I sent him an email to remind him I was awaiting his call back and release letter so I can send the 1,000.00 to dealerspecialties.He kept ignoring my emails and did not return my phone calls,He UNDERHANDEDLY against the wishes and the deal his CLIENTS made with me proceeded to take it to SPECIAL CIVIL COURT behind my back and place a judgement on me,so he can strongarm me into paying the full unjustified amount of $3,753.20 plus create outrages attorneys fees for himself and so he can get a big commision from the $3,753.20 which its around 30%!He was able to do this deceptively because they lead me to believe we had come to an amicable settlement and so I ignored the court date, he won by default cause I did not show up! He really tricked me by telling me its okay he was gonna check the propoesd agreement with his clients instead he mislead me!!! Had I  gone to court I'm positive the outcome would have been in my favor.I really think lawyers  are supposed to do things in a professional manner and conduct themselves with ethical behavior. This attorney acts more like repo- man or street swindlers with no ethics, dont care who they hurt in the processs as long as they get their fees regardless what agreements are worked out or what their clients wishes are!I am in the process of complaining to the ethics commitee in passaic county mr. Robert l. Stober,to hopefully get some diciplanary action against this firm .I truely believe collection attorneys like this can hurt innocent hard working people with these unethical tactics,especialy small business owners just trying to survive in this rough economy.

I was a single mother at the time, on top of being a disabled veteran - I had barely enough money to keep food on the table. I brought this whole stressful ordeal to his attention, as we were barely a month from settling with my husband. I told him that I had no money to give him till the divorce was final. The guy said ok. I thought he understood my plight. Boy was I surprised. Barely One Month shy of my divorce being settled, what does this guy do? Proceeds out of the wild blue sky serving me with paperwork stating that he could no longer serve as my attorney! He basically quit because he wasnt supposedly being paid like he wanted. I ended up having my husbands lawyer settling the deal instead. This whole sneaky situation irked me so bad! Then on top of everything, Mr Koor insisted on being paid for phone/filing time he had not earned; he wanted me to pay for His personal time spent in filing His paperwork in order to quit as my legal representative! It became a nightmare with this guy! In the end, I contacted another legal source, who said I was getting an extremely raw deal. I was then directed to contact the American Bar Association, which I did end up doing. I wrote to them in depth about Mr Koor; what he had done to me, and was trying to do. I had to make a formal complaint with the Bar before Koor let up on me and finally left me alone. It goes without saying that I do not want this to happen to another person!

I asked a simple question, ""If the court grants the motion to withdraw, can I (client) appeal the decision?"" Steve Lindamood, ""I charge $2,500 to review the case"" and when I confirmed an appeal could be taken before he took my money, and barked ""oh that's outrageous, of course you can't appeal that issue"" and hung on me.

" Alan Stamm, Arbitrator, American Arbitration Association ","  Alan Stamm, Arbitrator, American Arbitration Association  1950 Pelham Ave #1 
Los Angeles, California United States of America ",,405-720-0466,"Alan Stamm, Arbitrator, American Arbitration Association  ""AAA"" Los Angeles, California","
										This is my opinion concerning Alan Stamm, Arbitrator for the American Arbitration Association. A recent case concerning Alan Stamm can only invoke thoughts of judicial lunacy and a desire to be cherished by corporate America while refusing to be honorable and complying with California. Alan Stamm demonstrated his inability to remain impartial when, weeks after filing his disclosure in arbitration, he supplemented his arbitration which allowed recusal. When a party recused Alan Stamm, Alan Stamm attempted to allow his thoughts to infect the remaining of the arbitration proceedings by trying to make additional orders or otherwise influence the next arbitrator. Clearly, by making a concentrated effort to influence the next arbitrator is improper and demonstrates his need to keep his name circulating with corporate clients by making demeaning towards a consumer for simply invoking his right to recuse Alan Stamm. Arbitration bias is a well known fact. Companies opt for arbitration due in part many of the arbitrators are former corporate attorneys and rely on references and keeping there name in circulation within the corporate community. Some arbitrator's may be driven by the desire to retain corporate client who include the name of the arbitration company they are employed by, by providing bias decisions. In fact, one of the largest arbitration companies, National Arbitration Forum (NAF), had such a long history of being anti-consumer, the attorney general sued them and NAF is now barred from administering consumer arbitration. See, http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/chicago-law/2009/07/the-reputation-of-consumer-arbitration-took-another-hit-as-one-of-the-biggest-companies-that-specialized-in-resolving-small.htmlSimply put, Alan Stamm represents the pinnacle of being bias. Although he graduated from Harvard per the state bar website, it is likely a typo and he went to Howard and lived on Harvard street (No offense to Howard, but it's definitely not ranked like Harvard) since Alan Stamm appears to not know how to comply with the law or appear unbias. P.S. I know it should be Mr. Stamm after initially stating Alan Stamm first, however it by repeating his full name will force this post and other posts to appear with more frequency in WWW searches.The above comments are within the scope of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that citizens may continue speaking, printing, or broadcasting statements about topics of public concern and are cannot be subject to prior restraints.

										I retained this firm in May of 2009 to try to modify the interest rate on my mortgage. I had attempted this process on my own before as I know you can modify your mortgage without retaining a firm but, the only thing my lender would do is put the past due amounts on the end of my mortgage still leaving me to pay the full amount monthly. This had become difficult as my husband's hours at work have become reduced and he has had a difficult time finding another job. I had recieved a flyer from the Mortgage Relief Law Center and decided, after some research, to contact them. Initially I spoke with Van Vanmeter ( vanvanmeter@tmrlc.com ) and afterwards he had a ""Mr. Mitchell"" (to this day, I really have no idea completely who he is) to go over what services they would offer me. I was told that they would attempt to contact my lender and negotiate with them but, if that did not work, thye would get my original loan paperwork to determine if there were any vioilations. After this, we decided to retain the firm, signed a contract and worked out with Van to have the deductions of $500 made from our account until the entire amount of $2,995 had been paid. I was advised that once half of the retainer was paid, they would start working with my lender. Months went by and after many email correspondences with Van then Debbie Myler ( debbiemyler@tmrlc.com ), Rexanna Borden ( rborden@lawgrouppc.com ), Lavet Smith ( lsmith@lawgrouppc.com ), Fawn Sisson ( fsisson@lawgrouppc.com ) and Roland Hairston ( rolandhairston@mortgagemodlegal.com ) I had attempted to contact Lonn Feurer who I had spoken with a few times over the phone, who is in the Nevada location. He finally got back to me when I advised, after dozens of emails, that I was not satisfied with what, if any work had been done and wanted to stop the remaining 2 deductions from coming out of my account. This was in early August. He called and advised me that they were ""negotiating"" with my lender and ""it takes time"" and there should be a resolution within 60 days. At this point, I continued to wait even though my lender was still contacting me both at home and work and I was still trying to make payments to them. I had also began attemtpting wth my lender, in June, to modify my mortgage as well as in doing this would avoid them from constantly contacting me both at home and at work but also, should The Mortgage Relief Law Center be unsuccessful, I would have another option so that I do not lose my home. 60 days came and went without any phone calls from the firm but, I was in contact with Fawn during this time and advised her in late September that my lender had offered me again, to put the past due on the end of my loan if I made 3 months worth of payments on time. If I declined this offer, they would start foreclosure proceedings as of the beginning of October. I desperatly attempted to again contact Lonn at this point but, after numorous attempts of leaving voicemails with no response, Fawn put me in contact with Roland. I spoke with him October 7th again, advising him of this situation and after a heated conversation he advised me that they were close to a result with my lender and within 30 days my claim should be resolved. About 2 weeks after speaking with him, I was advised by ""Jackie"" that I needed to again give authorization to my lender to speak with them. I was puzzled as I signed this authorization back in May and was shown that as of July, this was faxed over to my lender. Again, I emailed this authorization to the firm and furthermore spoke with my lender directly who had advised me that to this point, nothing other than vefirification that they had recieved the 3rd  party authorization had been done. No negotiations, no request for my paperwork, nothing. This is now going on 6 months with no result, no offer from my lender, nothing. I waited and needless to say, November 7th, which was 30 days after my conversation with Roland came and went with no phone calls, no response from either Roland or Lonn. I attempted again to contact Roland and was advised by him now ""Brenda"" had my file and he would be sure to have her call me back that day. No phone call, I waited and tried to phone her over the next 2 weeks. Got a hold of her finally and again, requested to know what was going on as by the end of November, I would have to sign a modification with my lender meaning that their firm could do nothing more for me. She advised me she has only worked with the firm for 2 weeks and the only thing she had done is contact the lender to again find out if the 3rd party authorization had been received. At this point, I broke down, told her everything that had happened and at this point, almost 6 months later, it is pointless to attempt to negotiate with my lender. I was out of time. I advised her to note my account and at this point, November 13th, I faxed over a letter to Lonn regarding this issue as well as over 100 pages of email correspondence I had had with his firm in Nevada as well as those in Arizona. I requsted him to review the documents and contact me regarding my refund as clearly nothing has been done by them other than me being directed to person to person, clearly being ignored and more than likely assuming I would just give up and lose this money. I continued to both attempt to call him as well as send him faxes daily for 4 more days without a response. I was advised by Roland that if I wanted a refund, I would have to contact who I made payment to. Obviously, I didn't pay a specific person, the amounts were deducted by their firm out of my account for services they never rendered. I have filed a report with the BBB in Arizona as well as contacted the morgage fraud division in Nevada and filed a complaint with them as well. 									",Lawyers,0
Law Offices of J Michael Kelly,"  Law Offices of J Michael Kelly  429 Santa Monica Boulevard  Suite 120 
Santa Monica, California United States of America ",,407-648-4535,"Law Offices of J Michael Kelly  Billing Specialists Supreme, Lawyers--Not So Much! Santa Monica, California","      The law offices of J Michael Kelly were in my employ--though you'd have thought it was the other way round--for roughly five months. In the end, after being promised all sorts of action, I wound up exactly where I started--well, not exactly. No one could waste five months, receive bills of more than $16,000, and be anywhere but worse off than before. What follows is a brief description of my time with the Kelly firm.      During my five months with the Kelly firm I had exactly two meetings with attorneys, and both of them occurred only after I wrote the company asking what was going on. The first meeting, which occurred a week or so after I hired him, was with Michael Kelly. During the meeting, Mr. Kelly spent an hour ourlining an ""Action Plan."" Item #1 on the plan was to appoint Matthew Rich as my day-to-day attorney. The number of times I was contacted by or otherwise had any sort of communications from Mr. Rich during the entire five months--ZERO. Other items on the ""Action Plan"" list: depose my wife, retain a private investigator to confirm her whereabouts and living conditions (she had long ago moved out of state), research spousal abandonment consequences (my wife abandoned the household), change the title of residence--i.e., remove ""joint tenancy, with rights of suvivorship"" from title, conduct a vocational evaluation of my wife (no one ever asked me about my wife's educational or work experience--she had a university degree and had worked several jobs), etc. The number of so-called ""action"" items listed here that were done--ZERO.     Other things that had to be done before the Mandatory Settlement Conference and Trial: have my pension, IRA, and 457 Deferred Compensation Plan--my primary sources of income--evaluated. Were these things done? No. Apparently Kelly(or some other attorney from his office--?) intended to walk into the MSC and Trial without any idea of what kind of numbers we were dealing with.     Finally, several months and several letters to Mr. Kelly into the case, and a little more than two weeks before a Mandatory Settlement Conference, I sent an e-mail to Mr. Rich asking what on earth was going on. Without responding, Mr. Rich apparently forwarded my e-mail to another attorney, Mitchell Sperling. A few days later, now nearly four months after hiring the firm, Mr. Sperling called to set up an appointment.        The meeting with Mr. Sperling lasted about an hour. During the meeting Mr. Sperling took several phone calls, including one from his wife, spending several minutes on the phone. Finally off the phone, Mr. Sperling said he and his wife were also seeking a divorce. He then went on for several minutes about women, mostly about how expensive they are both during and after marriage.      When I was finally able to slip in a comment, I told Mr. Sperling that I needed to sell the condo (community property) in which I lived and move to the Midwest. Mr. Sperling then spent most of the rest of the meeting talking about his experiences in the Midwest. At most, five-ten minutes of the hour long meeting was spent discussing the case--and most of that time involved me telling Mr. Sperling and his assistant, who also attended the meeting, that certain documents--a deed, for example--could be found in the case file. Disturbing, to say the least, given that over the previous four months I had been charged thousands of dollars for scanning documents and reviewing files--but then, as the bill for the meeting stated, to Mr. Sperling and his assistant, Mr. Jonas, it was a ""new"" case. Ridiculous, really--four months and thousands of dollars in bills, and I was dealing with and an attorney who considered my case a ""new"" case! Even more ridiculous, however, is that I never heard from Mr. Sperling again. Mr. Jonas did call a couple of times asking me to review a draft of the Mandatory Settlement Conference Brief. I did, after which Mr. Jonas proceeded, without explanation, to ignor several of my comments. I also filled out and Income and Expense Delcaration that Mr. Jonas was supposed to type up and send off. That was the last I saw of that. As far as I can tell, it was never sent. There is no trace of it in the case file.       Two days before the Mandatory Settlement Conference, having heard not a another word from anyone, I sent an e-mail to Mr. Sperling asking what was going on and what his strategy for the MSC was. As indicated above, I received no response.     Late that Friday afternoon, with the MSC on Monday morning, I received a call from another person I'd never heard of, Mike Rodriguez. He said my wife's MSC brief was just coming off the FAX machine, was twenty some pages long, and that there was no way to digest and be able to respond to the many accusations contained therein by Monday morning. The MSC and Trial, he said, would have to be continued. It was clear from what Mr. Rodriguez said that everyone was surprised by my wife's MSC brief, and not just because it arrived days after it was supposed to.      My first thoughts at that point: had they deposed my wife (with lots of input from me), hired the PI, conducted the vocational evaluation (and maybe a psychological one too), asked my wife to fill in the holes in her discovery documents, talked to me (or my son) about the case, including any thoughts we might have as to my wife's state of mind and what her concerns were likely to be--i.e., had they done the job, done the things they said they were going to do...well, there would have been few surprises and no need for a continuance. But no...five months and thousands of dollars later, and it's back to square one. I'm still trying to figure out what all the bills were for--things that were talked about a lot in in-house staff meetings or discussions, but never done? Scanning documents and reviewing files that no one I ever talked to seemed to know anything about? Preparing an ""Action Plan"" that wasn't followed?     My second thoughts: five more months of opportunities to bill for things hard to contest, but more than likely never done.     A few last comments. About the only form of communication I received from the Kelly firm came in the form of bills. That's also how I got what little information I managed to get about what the Kelly people were doing--or not doing. No one sent me copies of documents or court dates or anything else, unless I asked--sometimes several times. I always had to keep and eye on the court case summaries on the internet to find out what was going on. I found out the MSC date and the trial date from the case summary on the interne, not from anyone in the Kelly office. They treat case documents as if they do not belong to the client, which they do. Providing them to the client should be automatic. There should be copy and labor costs, yes, but the client should not have to pay for phone calls asking (sometimes to the point of arguing) to be provided with documents or for visits to the office (as if a meeting is involved) to pick them up.      When I terminated the Kelly firm almost a month ago and picked up my case file, the file contained very little that it didn't contain when I delivered it to them five months before. That's because they also keep a computer file--and also, of course, because they did little over the five months to generate documents. They did not return the computer file with the case file. I had to ask for the computer file a couple of times. I was told it was a ""reasonable request,"" as if asking for a complete  file pertaining to my own case could be otherwise. I finally picked up the CD yesterday. There isn't much on it, either.All in all, the Kelly experience was one that I wouldn't wish on anyone.  ",Lawyers,0

										    What happened:     Attorney Hopewell represented me in an     accident case from 2005       which was a     23 car pile up on I-16     between Dublin and Macon Georgia.      I went to       doctor for TBI (Traumatic     Brain Injury ) after the accident I started forgetting     things       and mixing up or skipping words in      sentences and comprehension.                  There was an offer from the     adjuster for $90K while I was still in treatment, that offer       was     rejected.  After treatment was completed Attorney Hopewell     agreed to mediation       at mediation     she told me to accept $60K a     $30K loss from the case.  Attorney     Hopewell promised       *(a verbal      contract) for     enticement     that I     would get $14k      in my     hand       if I signed the mediation agreement     and I did    .

The     opposing attorney      claim they were going to discredit     the     seriousness of my          pain an    d       suffering     a    nd      threaten that I would be seen as a     lier     because of my prior     criminal     record     in court    .                   Attorney Genet Hopewell is        unethical,       she       lied to me      to get me to sign an       agreement knowing     that she was not going to stick by her word, then she     decided     that       she was not going to give me     the $14K     promised>  She is  currently with holding       payments to my providers and      reimbursements due to me for medial expenses and        refuse to pay my doctor bills according to     my wishes and directive.                She      given     me less than $    3K     from my entire case the only persons she has paid is       the funding     company where I borrowed money from to live off and herself.  Then she            told me I can sue her     from now to kingdom     come     to get the rest    .     of the $14k     promised        This attorney and her      associate said on tape (I have the     copy) that they       sue over 20 people for me, they did not and the     paperwork from the court does not     show that.  I wrote and asked       her about the money she never     responded.                 I want the world to know ...      Do not hire this attorney...                                                                             GENET HOPEWELL

" Harmon Law Offices, P.C. ","  Harmon Law Offices, P.C.  www.hlopayoff.com 
Newton, Massachusetts United States of America ",,410-823-2222,"Harmon Law Offices, P.C. Harmon Law, HLO Unfair and Deceptive, Foreclosure law, Newton, Massachusetts, HLO, Mark Harmon, Andrew Harmon, Christopher Sheehan Newton, Massachusetts"," Harmon Law Offices, P.C. is a foreclosure law firm located
in Newton and Needham,
 Massachusetts. The office handles
foreclosures in MA, RI and NH for numerous mortgage giants like Wells Fargo,
Bank of America, HSBC, etc.   I am a former employee of this firm and this post is
intended to shed some light on what goes on at this firm. I feel that this post
will help the general public whereas foreclosure is a very stressful and
complex process.    As a former employee, I got to see the everyday operation of
this firm and the thousands of files that this office handles. For starters,
your personal information is not secure. In a file, there is your personal
information such as your name, address, telephone number, social security
number and other documentation such as communications that were sent to and
from the client and the mortgagor and pleadings. (Court Docs)   During the day, files come from the file room to the desks
of legal assistants, paralegals and attorneys. Did I mention that the file room
is not secure. It is locked and you need a key pass to open the door, but
anyone can break in at anytime buy smashing the glass pain above the handle. As
I was saying, the files come in the hands of various employees. Many times,
files sit on desks or stacked on the floor and will sit there until the file
clerk comes and gets them to put them back or they will sit on the floor or
desk until the next morning. Meaning, your information could be stolen if there
was a potential break in at this office. Harmon should preserved personal
information by locking all files down at night securing them in case of a
burglary. Newton, MA
is not a safe area. In fact, my vehicle was broken into right outside the
office back in March.   Harmon is notorious for charging legal fees not earned. All
of the files in the office are imputed on a system called Landmark. It is a
program specifically created for Harmon. This program allows all of the files
to be worked on a network connected through the office assessable by all
employees. In other words, they take your file and put all the info in the
program and create all documents by this program. When an employee works on the
file, he or she puts a ""note"" in landmark. This note is applied to
the legal bill. An employee will put a time on how long they worked on a
particular task. In other words, an employee can put any amount they want, even
time not earned. Employees are required to put notes in for any task they
complete, for any email or other communication received or made, etc. The notes
add up and the notes the legal services rendered. From my experience in the
office, a lot of that time is exaggerated. If you haven't read this article
already, I suggest that you do. Please <a
href=""http://www.boston.com/realestate/news/articles/2007/01/18/hidden_legal_fees_push_some_into_foreclosure/"">
Click Here </a> Harmon's business practices have not changed.   Harmon employs individuals with little or no legal
experience at very low salaries. I, of course, have years of experience and was
an asset to Harmon, but many legal assistants and new attorneys have no idea
what they are doing and many, many mistakes are made. Have you ever called
Harmon and couldn't get a straight answer? That's because the people working on
your file don't have an answer for you because they don't know anything. There
is a lot of cat and mouse at Harmon. Many times they will tell you that you
need to call your mortgage company, and when you call the mortgage company they
tell you to contact the Harmon who is handling your file.  Therefore, below you will find the direct
numbers to the President, Mark P. Harmon, Vice President, Andrew S. Harmon and
Attorney Director, Fran Nolan. Call them and voice your opinion and frustration

demands, improper publications, etc.   I left Harmon Law Offices because of the way that I was

He asked me if I would be his friend and if he could call me his friend.  He said his name was Ryan.  I asked him what the name of his company was and he wouldn't tell me.  He kept asking me why I needed to know.  He then said he would help clear this up if I would be his friend...creepy.  He asked me how old I was... I told him this was a business relationship and that he needed to keep it that way.  He kept pushing and pushing...asking me weird information. When I wouldn't play he then said that he would talk to his manager - Mike Red - about me and would call me back.  I live in a small town and everyone knows everyone...so I went to see the local sheriff.  The local deputy called the number and identified himself as an officer.  The man on the phone started yelling at the deputy, threatened him with arrest (yea, right) and cursed at him.  So we called the County Attorney.  She called the number as well.  I haven't heard back from these people.This is a SCAM.  I don't owe anyone money... and the county attorney assures me that people don't get arrested for $300 of bad debt.  The scary thing is HOW DID THEY GET MY PERSONAL INFORMATION???

CENTRAL iSLIP, New York United States of America ",,416-299-8181,"Norton Law Group Kyle Norton  ADVISED ME TO NOT PAY MY MORGAGE AND CAUSED ME TO GO TO FORECLOSURE CENTRAL iSLIP, New York"," My husband and I went to this lawyer as we were thinking about filing bankruptcy. My husband was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in November and was undergoing chemo making it very difficult to work. We could manage the mortgage and monthly bills on my salary but since he is self employed, if he doesn't work he brings home no money so paying off the credit cards became very difficult and we went to this attorney for advice and help. His recommendation was to first file for a home modification. Our mortgage payment was very high and due to the economy, our mortgage was upside down. We owed more than the home was worth. Seemed like a good idea since he was saying how the mortgage companies were encouraged by Obama to save homes and do modifications. He told us not to pay our mortgage and to save our money since my husband future was so unclear. He told us the modification would take 3 months and once that was complete we could then file bankruptcy. He asked for $3000.00 which we paid in full and supplied him all the paperwork he requested just for the modification and an additional 3000.00 for the bankruptcy. Four months later our home is in foreclosure, no closer to a modification, he never returns ANY calls, faxes or letters. I go to his office and he's not there. Our credit is ruined. Then someone from his office calls to say we received a forbearance of 3 months from the bank with a balloon payment of 23,000.00 at the end. They then tell me since they got me the forbearance they are through with my case - BUT if I want to go further I can pay an additional $5000.00. Kyle Norton took my money and said he would do a modification that would reduce my payments at least a 1000.00 a month getting me a 2 or 3 % rate instead of the 5.9 I was now paying.  I was not a day late on my mortgage or bills till I went to them. They are the ones that put me in foreclosure when they advised me not to pay my mortgage and then think they did me a FAVOR by getting me out of foreclosure when they are the ones that put me INTO foreclosure to begin with. They take advantage of people when they are in desperate need of help, promise you the world and a solution when they do absolutely nothing for you but make things worse !! A law degree does not entitle you to take advantage of venerable people simply to make money. At this point we will probably be loosing our home, we have no credit and no money since in April I lost my job and we are living on unemployment and will have no where to go.

I'm not going to spend much time writing a review about ed castro as he has already wasted my time and resources to an enormous extent. All i can say is please, do your due diligence when hiring a divorce attorney. Mr. Edward Castro has a nice web site, is a very pleasing person to speak to although he appears to be ill, and makes you seem like he actually cares. False. I've seen other people write reviews on the internet about their terrible experiences with Edward Castro, and shortly thereafter Iris Mckay and Ed Castro would write a canned rebuttal talking about how wonderful they are so im sure I will probably get the same here. Unfortunately, my story is very similar to the other clients that had their lives ruined by this so called family law specialist. I hire Ed Castro, San Diego divorce attorney to protect my interests. Instead he protected his own. Racking up fees so slowly and so methodically that it was impossible to turn back at some point. Looking back now i understand i should have been more cautious and more focused, but I was going through a tough divorce and unfortunately I was taken advantage of by Edward Castro of the Iris Mckay Law Group. Please think twice, ten times, 100 times before hiring them. There are decent honest attorneys out there.

I called back and he promised to get my modification. On June 15th he offered me a forbearance plan that saved me a measly $50.00 on my mortgage payment. I also requested a refund at that time. I have requested my refund about 10 times now and no responses. A few days ago I called his offices and was advised that Nancy handles refunds and I faxed her my request and emailed it to her,still no response. I wish I had not contacted him in the first place, he is a scam and very unprofessional. Please stay away from his loan modification services.

Peabody, Massachusetts U.S.A. ",,469-223-0990,Cambece Law Firm - JA Cambece Law Firm Took payments and transferred acct- they have no record of payments Peabody Massachusetts,"
										I set up payment arrangements with this office. I explained I was out of work which was why I got into this predicament in the first place. The original balance on the card was $500. After interest, late fees, etc.. it was 857. We settled on monthly installments with interest and late fees waived. The agreement was for $50.00 per month. 
I made 3 payments. Someone called from the office with an immediate settlement offer. The offer was for more than the original amount of the debt. 
When I questioned it, I was transferred to a supervisor. The supevisor explained that I was being charged interest on a monthly basis. The interest rate was 15%. I explained to him that there is a law in the state of CT capping interest at either 6 or 8 percent (can't remember which, it was a few months ago). He came back with something to the effect of law firms being exempt from this interest. He was rude and abusive and when I told him that I didn't have the money for a settlement, he wanted to conference call with my bank to see if I had it.
I hung up on him and left a voice mail for Mr. D'Errico. The woman I was working with beofer this man (Jennifer) called me back and said Mr. D'Errico asked her to call me. She offered a settlement again and I asked her to put it in writing and send it to me. She told me that she had to run it by the firm manager and would get it in the mail.
Two months later- no letter. Tried calling the number she called me from, it has been disconnected. 
I just got a phone call from another agency Astra. The account has been sent to them. The amount due is 857. They have no record of any payments made to Cambece. I am waiting for them to email me a settlement agreement as I write this. 
After I hung up with them, I called Cambece's main 800 number. There is no record of a Jennifer being there. There is no record of me in the system. The receptionist asked what my monthly payments were and I told her $50 she told me that any accounts with payments under $200 a month are not guaranteed to be settled and can be sent out at any time. I was given 800-478-5541 to call Collect  America to see what happened to my account. After being on hold for 15 minutes I hung up.
What a mess. Not sure where my $150 went.

										I have been a member of Prepaid Legal Services for 18 months, and also signed up my children.  Having 20 yrs of legal experience I thought this plan would be able to provide assistance in areas I did not have knowledge.  Now 18 months later, a small issue re landlord tenant rights with a very small amount of money ($1000.00, as well as the deposit of $1000.00) in dispute - but significant in violating all the laws of CA re entering the apt, lost keys and uninhabitable premises -came to focus.  I contacted PPL for a full explanation of my benefits - clearly representation at a trial was one of the benefits.  After faxing the summons to the firm, I was told that the FIRM decides if they will represent it or  - they send you to the Title V provision - which says they will send you a referral and you can get a 25% discount.  And the same law firm indicated in the early conversations that the landlord was in violation of the CA laws!  Referral services are free - all over the internet!  And this decision was made with only a short conversation and the faxed document (the summons which is a form)
I am trying to locate any person who has had this type of encounter with PrePaid and trying to let others know that when Prepaid Legal was needed, their provider firm decided just to refer the matter.  And as stipulated in their information - just when you needed them - you only have 5 days to respond in CA to a complaint!

										I was pulled over for a DUI. I tried to do as much due diligence to find a competent DUI lawyer. After much discussion and research, I ""thought"" I found an experienced DUI lawyer  that could help me. I met Mark a couple days after my arrest. Mark quickly tried to soothe any concerns saying he's been successful pointing out glaring issues with the breathalyzer and that my case had enough holes to defend. Desperate for help (probably my fault), I trusted Mark to defend my case. I paid $3600 in 6 installments. 
His firm did routine paper work prior to my court date, and Mark Weingart had sent some novice lawyer to represent me for my arraignment. After a few months, I went to court to get the case dismissed as I was told I had a strong case. The novice lawyer attempted to get all offenses removed, but the judge denied all the motions. I find out several other motions were never tried by the novice attorney. Prior to figuring out what to do, the novice lawyer said I had no case and said that I should plead guilty. I asked how could have case gone from a clear winner to no chance at all. She said she had no idea. I asked if she talked to Mark Weingart, and the novice lawyer said she didn't discuss the case with Weingart. I ended pleading guilty to get the least offense to avoid a trial and potentially a greater punishment. I called Mark Weingart and asked why he misrepresented my case and why he wasn't upfront in the first place. He said that he thought we had a shot. I asked him why he didn't help on my case. He said that his lawyers are experienced enough to handle cases. In my case, that hardly wasn't the case. I find out after I plead guilty, my novice lawyer was leaving his firm. Weingart made promises that he should have never made in order to get $$$. There are many lawyers like this, unfortunately. Weingart is simply one of the many in this cess pool of lawyers (ie. Philips and Associates). 
For a guy that his name on his law firm, he doesn't hire talented people. Weingart is a scammer that only will tell a defendant what he/she wants to hear. He just wants your money. Once you pay, he will disappear. He even tried to charge an additional $1K for trial. But, after much arguing, he relented and reversed the trial fee after I threatened to call the better business bureau. I would recommend anyone who has considered the Weingart Firm to run and find a more trustworthy lawyer. Weingart might look like a nice guy, but he's a fox in sheep clothes. Avoid this scammer and find someone who really cares about you.

										Two days ago I get a letter in the mail stating that I owe T-Mobile for the amount of $109 (US). This is absurd since I have not had a T-Mobile account since early 2006. I have paid T-Mobile twice now, as I am disabled and was tired of the harassment, the stress triggers flare ups. I searched the name of the law office and found many claims on here that summed up my situation: They are filing for money that isn't owed to their client.
I contacted them via e-mail on their website, and have yet to get a response, stating this matter was taken care of twice, and that any further contact to collect this debt will result in my filing harassment charges against them. I also asked that any and all paperwork of from their client, T-Mobile, about this issue be mailed to me for verification. If this is a legitimate claim from them, I intend to pursue harassment and fraud charges. This is the second ""debt collection"" group they sent me to, and the first took my money and never creditted me until a representative from T-Mobile contacted them, and they admitted to said person I had paid.
The thing that bothers is that, while I haven't had their service in nearly 3 years at this point (January making it that amount of time), they also had my new address, which is not listed or documented anywhere to avoid these kinds of issues. I also am disabled, and had an issue with my bills due to the trailer trash kids next door taking the payments from my mail box, and the money order companies refusing to pay, citing I'm trying to fraudulently extort money from them, even though these money orders were never cashed and gone past expiration. I feel this ""law group"" had found out that I am currently in debt, and felt they should create a false charge and try to extort money out of me this way, hoping I cave in an effort to regain a positive credit score.
I will make further attempts to contact this company, and if I can't, will take any and all measures to have these charges dismissed.

You told me that you could extend this time frame for me for a fee of $350 which was paid in cash and a receipt was given by you.

To date, you have not returned my phone calls nor have you sent me any letters regarding the status of what you have done for me.

He was then faxed the receipt of the certified mail with a note informing him that I would have to contact the Fee Dispute Committee if I did not hear from him. 
The Local law Board Fee Disputes committee was then notified due to Mr. Ingram not responding to my letters. On Feb. 23rd, I received a letter from Charles Klitsch from the Fee Dispute Committee informing me that my complaint was forwarded to Mr. Ingram. On April 11th, I received another letter from Mr. Klitsch informing me that Mr. Ingram has not agreed to submit to binding arbitration. 
I was given 2 options. They are as follows: 1. An Advisory hearing can be set up but the hearing will not be binding on the parties. 2. I can withdraw the petition and sue the attorney in court. I called Mr. Klitsch on April 14th.(215)238-6326. Mr. Klitsch informed me that Mr. Ingram has not responded to any of his letter either. I am very disturbed that Mr. Ingram has never responed to any of my phone calls or letters which makes me feel that nothing was done! Now I cannot do anything with this case for the Statue of Limitation, I believe was never extended. I have been seriously injured emotionally and physically due to the assault and I am on disability because of this. I feel I am entitled to a full refund!

WILENS & BAKER (COMPANY AND INDIVIDUALS),"  WILENS & BAKER (COMPANY AND INDIVIDUALS)  450 7TH AVENUE 
NEW YORK, NEW YORK U.S.A. ",,503-557-2073,WILENS & BAKER: WATCH OUT!!! immigration lawyers Rip-off  *REBUTTAL,"
										I turn to your services to report the company Wilens & Baker, immigration lawyers. They get a lot of business and the majority of people are the Spanish population. I am a French-African citizen and am married to an American citizen. I'd like to report the fact that they over charge people for the services they provide. You have to do everything on your own and in the mean time they are unable to tell you anything or what they will tell you is something you already know. 
They are EXTREMELY RUDE to people and address to ""us"" as if we were retarded. They abused the fact that we are foreigners. When you get there for the first visit they tell you that if you are married they can file for you etc. 
If you go ahead they make you sign some agreement saying that you have a plan of payment of $100 per month. Watch out because soon, when you go there and want to know about how your case is going, they want you to pay and they tell you you have to pay the total before they can make your case move further etc. 
You feel trapped because you want things to move so you pay and they still don't have anything to tell you. I personally made two friends over there, one parallegal and one lawyer and they both left the company in total dislike and total disagreement of their ways. 
They are ripping off people so much that they could afford to buy a whole new floor where they have their offices now compare to the smaller space they had in the same building at 450 7th Avenue, corner of 34th Street in New York City. 
I have my case with them since beginning of 1998 and I have studied their behavior and be a victim of their rudness over and over again. Yesterday, I needed a simple certified copy of my marriage license, which they can't apparently find the original, and I had to get into an argument with one of the founder Mr. WILENS who told me he had no time to go through my file to come back tomorrow, after I told him I had an appointment that same day and needed that copy. He even have the nerves to tell me: ""we are busy and people do call and make appointments"" that's when I hit the roof. 
You call over and over again none of them are taking your call. You leave messages after messages and none of them return your phone calls. Or if by chance one of them take your call they tell you to call back that they are busy and they hung up on you. That was the other founder Mr. BAKER's attitude towards my husband last week when he called to find out where was my situation standing now. Mr. WILENS told me: ""aah get out of here!"". 
I told him loud and clear that he will hear from me. He did not seem to take me seriously because they are so full of themselves that they think that nothing can touch them! Well, we'll see about that! 
I am a well educated young woman from an important family in my country and I think that no matter what is your background, every one has the right to be treated with respect even when you are a foreigner and especially if you are being paid to provide a service! 
A lot of people heard me and some of them came to me and asked me what happened and they complained to me about the same things. They ask for your money and you don't see any results. I've been married for four years and I am still waiting for my Greencard!!! And I have spend about $2,500 or more for nothing!!!

										I was audited by the IRS and have had an ongoing problem since
1997,I saw there commercial advertised late one night. I was desperate I needed help. so, I called them to represent me.
First of all I am a single parent who was actually working part time at the time. They told me that it would cost me $900 to represent me. 
I scraped the bottom of the barrel in desperation to come up with the money. I finally paid them. However , nothing was ever resolved with the problem. I contacted them several times in which four times I never received an answer period. When I did here from them I spoke with a young lady who said they would not give me a refund that they submitted an offer and compromise for me and that was all they was supposed to do. 
First of all the IRS was tryng to get over $10,000 dollars
from me. If I had $900 to give anybody it would have been the IRS.They finally sent me a two page letter yeterday (1/28/02)Telling me that they didn't owe me anything> I am still where I started owing the IRS now I owe them with interest. I don't think it's fair that they can just take my HARD earned money like that. All I wanted was for them to do as there slogans says ""we'll settle your debt for pennies on the dollar""    
Please help me obtain some kind of results and stop them from doing this too some one else.

										When Joe Kaestner was working with Pitney and Jones, I feel he lied to me and cost me thousands of dollars. I never really found out the truth, but I probably should have pursued it. I recently heard that he got in trouble with the State Bar for lying to clients, and it was even his second disciplinary action in a very short period of time. 
I did some checking and learned that in fact he had told some of his clients that he had paid the money in time to appeal a case, when he actually hadn't. 
I probably should have complained but I didn't and the statute of limitations are probably over. If anyone knows what the statute of limitations is for complaining about an attorney please let me know. I got the impression that I should have gotten a second opinion if I didn't trust him, but who has the money for that? And the way I got screwed by him, he should have paid ME!
If you are considering paying for this guy's services, don't! He's the worst I've ever had.

I have written to you before about attorney Christopher Link. Since my last letter he has taken me to court, and received another $1500, besides the $3700 I had already paid him. He lied to me by telling me it would not be than $1500 as long as we did not start taking each other to court, which we never did. Not only myself, but also I have contacted numerous other people who he has sued and has judgments or liens on. Below is the information I found on your web site. I have underlined the pertinent information, which specifically applies to my complaint. 
ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS
Divorce does not have to be expensive. The more complex your affairs and the more contested the issues, the more the dissolution will cost. At an initial meeting, your attorney should be able to provide an estimate of the total cost of a dissolution based on the information you provide. To a great degree the cost will depend on how contested the matter becomes.
Fees for Divorce Cases: Divorce or dissolution of marriage cases merit special discussion because legal fees for this type of work may include one or a combination of all the fee arrangements already mentioned (with the exception of the contingent fee). In a dissolution action where the husband and wife already agree on all matterssuch as support, property and custodya lawyer can set a fixed fee, provided that the matter remains uncontested until completion of the case. Since legal fees are partly determined by services rendered, it is not usually possible to determine in advance the total fee for a case that may have contested issues. In such instances, lawyers may advise the client of his minimum fee as the least it would cost and, additionally, of the hourly charges for time that might be expended beyond the minimum time given in the lawyer's original estimate. Certain complications often arise in family law cases such as divorce. For instance, the court may order one spouse to pay all or a part of the fees and costs of the other spouse. In addition, the court can order a spouse to pay fees to his or her own attorney should a fee dispute arise.

										I received an email from a Barrester Fred Goziechi,Solicitor, in Lacos Nigeria, stating that my late husband had a brother that was killed in a car accident in Nigeria. His wife and three children were also killed. My late husband did not have a brother.
Mr. Goziechi stated that he has been trying to locate us for two years. He stated that the Estate of the deceased amounted to Nine Million dollars, and that if he filed an affidavit in my name that he would take 55%, and I would get 40%, the other 5% would go to my Government for expenses and taxes.
After several emails back and forth Mr. Goziechi finally asked me to send him Five Thousand dollars to cover the cost of this filing.  He also wanted my home phone number, fax number, all my Banking information, my occupation, age, birthday.  This man even went so far as to email me a copy of the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death. Which looked foney to me. 
I had a feeling right from the start that this was an Internet Scam.  I did not give him any of the information he wanted, in fact I told him, I felt he was trying to scam me out of money. This was an insult to him and he got very defensive.
I told him to pay the 5 thousand dollar fee to file the affidavit, and when I had my 45% of the 9 Million dollars in my possession, only then would I pay him his money.
I have not received his reply as of yet.
I am sure Mr. Goziechi has tried this scam on other people, and for an Attorney, his spelling has little to be desired. He doesnt even use a letter head with his firm name on it.
If you need any more information from me, please contact me, as this man has to be stopped before some poor person sends him money.

Attn:President/Ceo.
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL
RE: TRANSFER OF US$21.5 MILLION (TWENTY ONE MILLION,
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS ONLY).
I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction which is
of mutual benefit.
I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporatio(NNPC). Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in NNPC by my Committee. This contract was over invoiced to the tune of US$21.5M. U.S. Dollars. This was done deliberately. The
over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project. We now want to transfer this money which is in a suspense Account with NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you to provide for us.
SHARE: -
For assisting us in this deal, you will be entitled to 30% of the money,60% will be for me and my partners while 10% has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any  expenses that maybe incurred by us during the course of this transfer, both locally and international expenses.
I would require your company's name,address,telephone cell phone and fax numbers and also, your banking details where the funds will be remitted to i.e bank name, account number, routing number, banker phone and fax number.
The above information would be used to make formal applications as a matter of procedure for the release of the money. It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of this nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies. More often
than not, big trading companies or firms of unrelated
fields win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized firms for execution of such contracts.
We have strong reliable connections and contacts at the Central Bank of Nigeria, as well as the Federal Ministry of Finance and we have no doubt that all the money will be released and transferred if we get the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. Therefore,when the business is successfully concluded we shall through
our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned Government Ministries for 100% security.
We are ordinary civil servants and we will not want to miss this once in a lifetime opportunity to get rich. We want this money to be transferred to your nominated bank for us, before the present Democratic Government start Auditing all Federal Government owned Parastatals.
Please contact me immediately through my fax number whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not,it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. But where you are interested, send the required documents aforementioned herein through my above fax number, as time is of the essence in this business. I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.
Yours faithfully,
Mr. Sly Oliver.

The kind that takes yr retainer check fee and then pretends you don't exist.  
My brother became a client in February 2002.  He meets with Michael's legal asst. Monnie in June to assess the situation and determine which forms will be filed. 
When I called to see if the right family law forms had been filed for my brother, Monnie tells me that they were filed the ""wrong way"" and the courts were not happy with it.  (sounds like BS to me)
So they needed to re-file the forms.  I also called to confirm whether or not Michael would represent my brother in court at a hearing.  Monnie said, ""Yes"" probably to make me happy and get off the phone.  
Then Aug 19 comes around and when my brother calls to check and see if Michael would be representing him, Monnie seems to know nothing about it.  
People, my brother, with limited English speaking abilities and a limited education has a court case today to defend himself against fraudulent child support charges and although he as retained a lawyer, has to represent himself.  
Not fair to be forced to pay $20,000 in child support that he does not owe and then to forced represent himself in a time when he needs a lawyer the most.

My lawyer sent me some papers showing her complaint and the court date. But by the time I received the papers from my lawyer, the court date had passed. 
When I confronted him about this, he said I didn't have to be there. One month later, I received a subpoena stating that a restraining order was in effect. When I confronted him about this, he said if I wanted him to fight harder for me, I would have to pay him more money.

he did not state the amount attributable to the service rendered before the filling of the petition,and he did not state the amount attributable to the service rendered or to be rendered after the filing of the petition.

he alleged dismissel of slime dogs charlie carr and his wife carol carr was the only way to prevent foreclosure on my home.

the dirty dog bruce fett alleged in a letter dated 6/11/02 that he would no longer counsel in my behalf in the chapter 13 case,in total disregard of court rule 02: an attorney may not withdraw as consel except by leave of court.                                                                                       
this SOB bruce fett and all the lawyers named in this chapter 13 bankruptcy case are unfit to be members of the court,and in the name of justice be disbared.
this dirty SOB james jay stoffel (beberman stoffel & beberman ) attorney for slime dog charlie carr and wife carol carr,in a letter dated 8/3/99 and in concert with bruce fett alleged his scum ball clients charlie carr and wife carol carr would deny confirmation of my chapter 13 if they were named in a civil law suit.this threat is an act of fraud.    
charlie carr and wife carol carr should be compelled to make resitution to debtor for unjust enrichment and charged punitive damages.

Cleveland, Ohio U.S.A. ",,516-364-6006,Margaret Wong and Associates Ripped off helpless Air Force member and wife! Cleveland Ohio *EDitor's Comment,"
										Margaret Wong and associates began by telling us that they could help us file for a K-3 visa even though I informed them that our current petition for an IR-1 was  already under investigation. 
They assured me they could help my wife and I so we wouldn't have to be separated again. Even though the $2,500 fee seemed exhorbitant, we agreed because we had been saving our money for a year to hire a lawyer. 
After they began taking payment for services they hadn't even rendered, I learned from the embassy and another immigration attorney that they were lying and advised to get my money back. This was before they had taken any action on my behalf. 
I asked for an immediate refund and explained the situation to them. Since they had not done any work on my case I didn't see a problem. However, as soon as I mentioned that I wanted a refund they stopped answering my e-mails and I can't seem to get through on the phone either. 
Being a low ranking Air Force member serving in South Korea I make very little money. Wong & Assoc. took advantage of our desparation and stole our money! Now, as I am scheduled to return to the United States and must send my wife back to the Philippines, we don't have enough money to pay for our many expenses. 
Do not do any business with these people and please spread the word. I am here defending the many freedoms that all Americans enjoy, including the right to defend ourselves against vicious parasites like Wong & Associates!

										I recently got a letter in the mail from the Law Offices of Mitchell N. Kay, on behalf of Fingerhut. This letter had my name misspelled and an old address.   I had not lived there for almost 4 years now. The letter stated that I owed Fingerhut $30.98.
First of all I cant remember ever ordering anything from Fingerhut in any way shape or form.  Secondly Im currently 15 years old, so for me to have ordered something from them, I would have had to have been 11 years old or younger.  
I find a few things fishy about this letter.  First it had an old address on it and name is misspelled.  Second I would have had to have been 11 years old or younger.  Third Im a minor, so how could I have opened an account.  Forth, it is threatening me with my credit report be damaged.  Well a minor doesnt have a credit report; they dont start until your 18.  Fifth, the crap about notify them within 30 days to get the info on the order etc.  That is a very sad attempt, if I was to notify there offices in writing about the debt then they would have a correct name and current address (I think not).  
I havent called there offices yet, I plan to tomorrow, from either a pay phone or using *67 on the phone.  Anyone with information please help.  Does anyone no the statute of limitation on debts under 50?

Roni Lynn Deutch - Tax Law Office,"  Roni Lynn Deutch - Tax Law Office  4893 Auburn Blvd 
Sacramento, California U.S.A. ",,516-364-6006,Roni Lynn Deutch-Tax Law Office-SETTLETAX.COM Mislead thousands of people Sacramento California,"
										We are a group of ex emloyees of Roni Lynn Deutch-
Roni Lynn Deutch claims to settle back tax liabilities for ""Pennies on the dollar"" utilizing the I.R.S. program Offer in Compromise. 
Roni Lynn Deutch advertises nationally on television urging desperate taxpayers to call for a free no obligation consultation.  When the scared taxpayer calls, they reach a call center where their name, phone number and amount owed to the I.R.S. is recorded. Then the ""Leads"" are filtered through and placed on a 3x5 card and passed out to hungry sales representatives affectionately known as ""Tax Directors"" AKA. SALESPEOPLE!  
These salespeople are under constant pressure from Roni Deutchs' little brother Russell Deutch to hit their individual sales goals. The pressure is so heavy that we have actually seen salespeople fudge the numbers of the callers to ""qualify the potential client"" then use proven sales techniques to have them pay sometimes as much as $15,000.00 to take the case.  Typically the fee is between $1900.00 and $4300.00 to hire the firm to protect them from the I.R.S. 
The sales people paint a picture for the potential clients, telling them the typical time frame to settle the tax debt is from ten to twelve months, giving the clients a ray of hope. The new clients are not told that the law firm has so many active clients (well over 4,000) that it could be seven or eight months before they even compile the Offer in compromise. Meanwhile, the clients are literally struggling to make payments to the law firm ranging from $250.00 to $1,000.00 for six to ten months. 
The average enrollment in the Law firm is 450 new clients each month. In our years of working there we have not seen a fraction of these clients receiving the help that was implied. Remember, attorneys structure sentences that imply one thing to the average person and something completely different in legal terminology and the salespeople are taught to use this verbiage with clients to imply a guarantee.
We know of several other people who will be adding information to this site. Many of our co-workers have been terminated for looking into the practices of the Law firm and questioning why we were taking new clients when we could not even provide the service to the existing clients.
Roni Lynn Deutch is taking the hard earned money hand over fist from people who are desperate for help, and really only delivering help to a very small portion of her clients.
Here are some examples:
A client was getting his wages garnished. He had been faithfully paying the firm $475.00 monthly to cover his legal fees for seven months, the law firm never even attempted to get his garnishment lifted (he was lost in the shuffle). The man could not make his last payment on time (eight months later and before the garnishment was even lifted) and the law firm fired him for breaching the law firm's so called "" FEE AGREEMENT"". 
The legal staff regularly loses files, misses I.R.S. deadlines, mails the wrong documents to clients, disclosing confidential information. The list goes on.......thousands of mislead people.
Roni Deutch owns at least nine homes throughout the country, drives a $100,000.00 BMW and a $100,000.00 Porsche. Travels and plays constantly and is rarely in the office. She has approximately 100 people running her show. Believe me, it is a show. She runs the epitome of a processing plant. Clients accuse us all the time of being a sweatshop. People need to know this before they pay a woman to save them when she is literally taking their money. They have several thousand unhappy clients that will gladly tell their story.
All employess are forced to sign a clause that I would not discuss the practice of the Law firm or they can sue me for damages caused to the law firm. 
The contact person who runs the show for Roni Deutch is:
Greg Flahive Ask him what percentages of clients actually get the service they hired Roni Deutch to do for them.
I urge you to call in as a potential client and go through the process; you will be amazed at how their system works.
You can call 1-800-TAX-LADY or WWW.Settletax.com
Thank you.

										I met with Christopher Olson in August of 2002 to discuss a landlord/tenant eviction dispute.  It was an emergency situation where my landlord was retaliating against me by evicting me.  
I explained the entire situation to Christopher Olson, including the FACT that I was never served with any type of court papers.  Chris had me sign a fee agreement for $1000 retainer but failed to mention to me that he did not believe that I was NEVER served court papers.
In fact, his exact words in the email he sent to me shortly after were ""...I spent nearly two hours on legal research alone later that night in an attempt to get you out of the predicament you got yourself into by ignoring the court
documents...""
My check for the $1000 retainer was returned to them in the meantime.  I was taken to small claims court and they received a default judgement against me.  I'll pay the money, and in fact, I have paid a little bit already, however, I have always maintained that I am doing so under extreme duress.  He should NEVER have made me sign that fee agreement if he did not believe what I was telling him.  He should not have hidden that from me - he should have been up front and honest about it.  If he had, I would NEVER have signed that agreement.  My situation was dire, but his unfair billing practices have only put me in a position where I must pay the bill.
I've also asked for a copy of the original bill, and I have not received it.  The first copy they sent to me was taken from my car when it was broken into and my briefcase was stolen in September.  I will gladly provide a copy of the police report to substantiate this if necessary.  What I do know is that he also billed me for a consultation that he NEVER told me I would have to pay for.  Not one time during our initial conversation did he tell me that I had to pay for it.  He sat there, asked questions, took notes, kept me there for well over an hour and a half, and then proceeded to bill me for it.
I also plan on reporting this to the bar association.  I'm sure I am stuck paying the judgement, but again, I will be doing so under duress.

										Attorney Allen Cox took insurance money he was not entitled to, cashed it, and put it in his account. He then produced a written ficticious summary of services he was charging.Here is the picture of that scum sucking lawyer!
This attorney traded insurance information to falsely obtain medical records from doctors during a recent accident. This was proved when Dr. Eric J. Halsell of Cleburne, Texas tried to cash insurance checks without our signatures. 
He clearly broke the rules and the laws. Knowing this we went to the State Bar of Texas. After repeated attempts to contact Allen Cox we were not informed he moved his office until a year and a half later. 
Before the hearing the State Bar lawyers sat with the defendant and his attorney and assured him, ""Nothing would be done to him."" Our case was to be heard at 11:00AM. Instead we waited until 6:00PM before our case was heard. 
Coincidently the panel of attorney's that were to hear our case was switched over to a new panel. The State Bar of Texas simply dismissed Allen Cox from all these charges. We were not given an oppurtunity to speak or show our evidence. 
Currently Allen Cox has a lein on both my daughter's cases. He never went to court. On his website he advertises this:
""The firm charges a 30% percent contingency fee on any personal injury case should the matter be settled prior to filing a lawsuit. If the client is under 18 years of age, the contingency fee is 25% should the matter be settled prior to filing suit.""
He is charging 40% not the 25%. He dragged his feet until my girls turned 18. Now after all he has stolen from us he has his hand out wanting more for a case he never even went to court on. He turned down so many offers we were not made aware of. He took insurance money we were not made aware of.
I think he should be stopped even if he is palsy walsy with the State Bar of Texas!

										My father died on July 31st, 2001. I am the heir and oldest daughter to the estate of Sam Di Francesca. My younger sister who is an abuser and left my dad alone to die while grabbing all the money hired estate attorneys (even though www.maricopa.gov has informal probate papers for an executor to use which are free with instructions and legal advise.) A game was played out to hang on to the estate and refuse the heirs to see any of the paperwork then threatened me and my youngest sister to sign documents ""Or else!! 
They followed through with these threats through the use of the courts. The Commissioner Bayhem Lesseyong did nothing and allowed them to perpetrate a federal offense of mail and phone fraud and then continue hearings. It is nearly two years now and they took my inheritance from $120,000.00 which was still a lie, to $14,000.00 and they want me to pay attorney fees since I dared bring the commissioner the personal representative's threat letters. 
Every thing threatened has been done and graced by this commissioner and court. The presiding judge Campbell write my youngest sister and I back after asking him to investigate including the commissioner continually claiming loss of all my filings (which I have proof and signatures and seals and dates) then they assigned a pro tem who is a personal injury attorney to hear the final case and make a decision on the rest of the fate of my inheritance. He did not inform me of this change or ask my approval. He did not listen to me just like the commissioner and these abusers are getting away with all of this. No one will help me with this case to stop this abuse and every time they hear the estate attorney's names they say no way or they want $3,500 retainers. It is just a $300,000 estate of a simple man and the attorneys are taking $60,000 and the PR another $28,000.00 on top of stealing a $40,000 insurance policy and rare coins in which the pro tem in 10 minutes said she could have them even knowing we proved she took them and their were many more then what she is saying.
I actually wrote to probate judge Mundell and told her and all of them in cc letters my sister and I knew they were going to steal it all so go and let them call it as it is and have a phone conference to get this ended after 2 years. They wouldn't even answer any of this so they had another hearing which the attorneys showed (they live in AZ and the PR in Michigan) but they allowed this so he could make $2,000.00 that day instead of $150.00 per hour on the phone. They have all threatened lied and cheated me out of my inheritance. They raped me financially with full intention. I wrote the court administrator on the files issues and he also never read it and passed it to the court administrative clerk the same one that told me a year back ""Heirs have no rights"". She too blew me off. 
Just to note: The Arizona State Bar refuses as their choice and backed up by the American Bar not to allow citizens to know there bar ID number anymore. They also refuse to record any hearing in their courts there. What are they hiding?

										My aunt had died and left a trust funds to be divided amongst the named heirs, of which I, my sister, my mother, and other relatives from pittsfield (worst thieves in the world) of ours were named.
My cousin, Harry and his wife Sherry, from san jose california, decided to sue the thieves who were named executives of the estate (manipulators more likely). They got my sister, my mother (who is on a pension and who had a stroke) involved in their shenanigans by promising us that they had seen the trust and we were to receive rather large amounts of money from said trust. We found out later, all they wanted was for someone to help pay their legal expenses. Since my aunt died in Pittsfield, Mass., they hired a lawyer named Michael Hashim of Hashim & Spinola to legally fight the battle. 
Mr. hashim named me as a plaintiff in the case even though I said that I had an agreement with my cousins and that one agreement was enough! He explained to me that the more names named on the document, the better the case would be. He never contaced us as to how the case was progressing. 
This went on for many months. His office sent a paper for me to sign agreeing to his fee of 75.00 an hour so that he could ""represent"" me. I never signed nor sent in the paper. Now, all his office is doing is sending me bills of 2000.00. And his office is billing me finance charges on the bill. On 1/31/04 he sent me a bill of 2124.72 with a  finance charge of 21.02. Now I never agreed to be represented by him nor did i sign the paper saying i agreed to his fees. When I questioned him about this, he shouted at me: ""If you want to screw me out of my fee, then screw you!"" Then he sent another bill with another finance charge attached to it. 
Is this legal to charge finance charges on a lawyer's bill, and to even send me one considering that I never signed his document?. I also sent him a letter telling him that I never signed his paper. He ignored it and never replied. Then he told me to ""go screw myself"" when I did phone him!

The lien remained on my account during the investigation, claiming they could not remove it.  I notarized and mailed them statements that I did not use this card, nor had I ever received it.  I sent all of my personal information, copy of non-driver's i.d., social security card, etc.
All I received from them was a copy of a credit card application with my signature.  I told them it was possible that I filled it out, but I had never received a card.  They said there was nothing further they could do, and the only way to remove the lien was to begin making payments.  Well, I did.
After the first two payments or so, I was advised by colleagues to investigate further, and that I had the right to obtain copies of purchases and receipts.
I called Upton back, and explained that I wanted to stop making payments and wanted this situation to be further investigated.  They said they did not have to provide me with any  information, and I had to pay them, OR ELSE.  They further threatened to put yet another lien on my bank account (which I had to close because of them), and this all came from someone claiming to be a supervisor.
I have written to Providian, requesting assistance and they said it was out of their hands.  I further sent a written letter to Upton, claiming my right to copies of proof of purchases.  They continued to harrass and threaten me to make payment, ""or else"".
I have not yet heard from them (it's been a month), and I'm sure they are in the process of attempting to re-freeze any assets they could of mine.  I don't know what else to do.

When we got the bill we were charged a percentage of the value of the property. We had never heard of such a thing.
We were charged $20,000.00 and this was reduced to $10,000.00 when we freaked out.
We checked with other lawyers what the bill should have been and it would have been within normal limits to be between $2500.00 and $3,000.00 for this service. If you are selling or buying think again about Lawerence in Brampton.

										Mrs.  Seitel is Attorney  who is making money by telling his client to lie to run a case.  He is the worst lawyer that I have never heard or seen in my life.  Every single lawyer is a lier, by defending his/her client himself, but Mr Seitel would even pay people to lie for his client to won a case which is not fear.  
Mr. Seitel needs to be investigated and his papers are not being serve by the low inforcement.  He hires people from the street and sent to people's house.  Be very careful anyone who is doing business with him.  I know that they will catch him one day.  Mr. Seitel is putting people's life in danger. I know 2 case that he perjury himself and his clients which is not good.  I do not want to tell because I do not want my boyfriend to go to jail. He told me that he hit his ex because he was upset with her and told Mr. seitel told him to get someone who is not scare and pay somemoney to take the stand for him which he did.  He paid a woman to lie pretanding like she was the withness.  He told me that (she was not there, but thank god everybody believe me) said the defendant and the case is still going on because of his lies and his client. 
I do not like the way the law goes because the same thing may happen to me and pay someone and then I may become a looser. I was not going to tell, but I think everyone deserve justice. The reason why, I am reporting that is for people to be very careful with Mr.  Seitel and the law in Florida.

										Upon moving into the home of my husband when we married in Sept 1999 while putting clothes in the closet I ran across, very close up graphic teen pornography and notes on Chrysler financial note paper.  
I said nothing at first,liking sex thought ""oh good he is not the goodie two shoes he puts on in puplic"".  I did finally mention it casually, like ""I heard you could get porn on the internet! Have you ever seen naked pitcures?  He denied. 
Time passed out great love and sex was getting worse.  He had ok'ed me to leave my job and benifits so we could travel.  Within 6 months his sex got awful and rushed, violence and cuting me down began as did severe control.  I was heart broken.
His spending was out of control and he demandid I get a job. This story can be long I will try to condence it.
We were in love and enjoyed many of the same hobbies, but I was lonely and getting my self esteen ripped apart often.
He planned well in advance to ruien my life and was socking money away.  I tried to prepare myself with getting into Real Estate. weeks later the bomb dropped I had taken my lap top into work for them to set up on the network...............it was full of porn.  AI went home and looked in one place and found a stack an inch or more thick all from the computer, splattered with wet spots.
No one believes me a srink I saw from the Crysler network said I ws dilusional of his porn, i even showed him the photos and computer scans.  This man is sick, he has left me with nothing, no home (a 600,000 home on the lake I spotted as a good deal) a 2000 Viper, boat, still has his job which he steels from all the time.  
He also had  a family member help beat me up badly on the arms, back and head. then let me go and blocked me from the house.  I was terrified, and hid in the car.  he then called the police a second time and said ""hurry up she is trying to run us over!""
I was badly hurt and also have a muscle condition Fibromyalgia, I could barely walk for the police, I begged for medical treatment, they promiced but never delivered me to the hospital.  
I fell as they were pulling me faster than I could walk (this I told them) dangeling buy the cuffs in front of my body my wrists were hurt very bad and excessive forse was used.  
I pleeded to them I had been the victom, they said shut up, and that was many times. I begged for tissue at the house they refused, over and hour still asking for tissue and suffering from severe sinus problems I had to release it to the floor and wall as well as my clothes.  
I was treated brutally and I was not a flight problem as I could barely walk.  I have medical records to cover all of this.  They caused me to fall and I bumped and officer with the inside of my ankle as I had a slight bruse there the next day.  I was set up by my husband and Dan Dowd for pure money motivation.  
My life is ruiened, I have lost everything.  My mother has been stuck with my care, I am disabled, but have no disability.  My husband is the senior manager for the dodge dealers advertisers asociation, so with a big title and a nack for hiding his addictions he is winning.  I have lost almost $100,000.00 to lawyers, now have a guardian.  
I have been treated unfairly because the Judge able Judge Hallmark doesn't like me and thinks my husband is the poor abused husband.  What has happened to me is beyond normal, one lawyer took me for $35-400,000 and did not even write up orders that were ok'ed in court (on tape)  the next lied too and changed his whole tone after deposition of my husband who is a pathological lier, and a negotiater for a living.  
I still have none of my posetions.  I will get no settlement, 4 lawyers have their hand out.  I feel the system sucks, I feel dead inside.  no matter what I do it is a waste.

I scrambled over the weekend but was abused so badly Friday eve and saturday I had to have my brother come to help me.  
He got started right away monday am (husband) and his lawyer beat mine in filing by 45 minutes.  This made me look bad.  The restraining order was never done I had no idea it was so easy I could have done it myself yet he (lawyer) never told me.  Friday when my husband was going crazy I hid in my car and called lawyer, he said go to the bank and get the rest of the money you didn't get.  I did.  This I got in trouble for as well.  money had to be returned, he took mine too (my 1/2)  he then continued to give bad advice and use my money that was in trust without asking nor sending a bill.
He caused me to loose a lot.  He lied over and over.  The jugde seemed to dislike me, and as time went on even as I got another lawyer she treated me like a criminal and my abusive husband like apoor man that needed to go on with his life.  She was un fair and continued this way untill things were out of control and my confidance was zero.  I lost everything my job my health my home and much more because of a lousey system.

										After contacting the Law Offices of Roni Deutch and them stating that we must give them 1770.00 to get the prccess started, they did not hesitate. They wanted to do a check over the phone because I QUALIFIED for this and it will be no problem to settle with the IRS with my situation. 
Obviously I did not have the money myself so my fiancee paid it with her checking account. At first you would hear from them all the time then only when you contact them to find out what is going on.
You never talk to the same person twice and the person you do talk to puts you on hold forever so they can review your case for a minute (how UNPROFESSIONAL). The only time they would call you is to tell you that you forgot to include something on the papers that you already filled out and had to overnight to them but you remember carefully filling them out and not forgeting anything. But they insist that you forgot something and you must mail it overnight again so that this does not delay the process anymore.
So six months go by and you call them to see what is going on and you are left on hold for 15-20 minutes then leave a message and have someone who has never heard of you or your case calls you back to discuss it.
So then you hear that they are trying to settle for 896.00 instead of the 10,000.00 that you owe and you ask them are you sure and they tell that this is no problem they can get it for this so you just wait and see but you think to yourself how crazy would the IRS be.
So you get a letter from the IRS not the law office almost 1 year later stating that you have been denied and when you call the law office they tell you sorry but we cannot do anything else to help you. You ask them what to do now and they tell you, you have to file for an appeal and have to do it all your self they are done. 
So you ask them what did the money that you sent go for because you could of submitted a stupid amount to the IRS and been turned down all by yourself, so why did you need their help?? They tell you how they have invested all this time into your case that is where the money went. But when I asked  the girl on the phone what they could do now or why did I pay them the money I could have been paying the IRS, the phone line becomes silent and then she asks if there is anything else that she can assist you with and then tells you well have a good day sir,and hangs up the phone. Here I am now broke again.

Our first meeting was slightly uncomfortable because he kept staring at me and asking me a lot of questions about my personal life (not my finances), and telling me how exquiste I was to look at.  
I shrugged this meeting off thinking that because I am an exotic dancer it was expected.  Between my first and second meeting with attorney Fett, he called me several times asking me how I was doing and suggested that we get together for a drink so he could get to know me better in order to help me with my case.  I declined both times telling him I was not interested and that I am in a relationship. It wasn't until my second meeting that I finally realized that he was a weirdo who is also married! 
He wasn't interested in filing my chapter 13 case!  After this I fired him without my case every being filed. I am warning all women that he is a predator that solicites his business while looking for us!  HE SHOULD BE DISBARED! I am filing a formal complaint with the bar association.

										Dan Watkins called regarding a stop payment check that I had placed on three checks. When he originally called me he threatened to turn me into the District Attorneys office immediately if I did not pay the checks. I explained to him the reason for the stop payment and informed him that I would make a payment arrangement with him regarding these checks that totalled close to $1600.00. At the time of his call I was out of state, in Ohio, visiting a brother who has terminal cancer. I returned his call from my cell phone. 
At that time after his attempt to turn me into the District Attorney he then demanded my attorneys name, which I informed him that I needed to speak to my attorney first to explain the situation to him and that I would have my attorney call him. I explained to Dan Watkins that I was out of town with my brother who was sick and when I returned to California on 10/14/03 I would call him to set up a payment plan. 
He insisted in order that my account not be turned over to the district attorneys office in SF that he would have to have $500.00, which I gave him from my checking account debit card. When I returned to California on 10/14/03 there was a debit in my account made for 1095.00 to Spinelli and Company. This was an unauthorized and illegal transaction that I did not approve or authorize. I immedicately called his office and the following occurred. 
1) He turned on a recording device and told me he was taping my phone conversation without asking my permission which is illegal. 
2) He refused to give me Mr. Spinelli's Bar Association Number to file a complaint with the NY BAR Association. He wanted me to settle for just returning the money to my account which I refused. 
3) He transferred me to his supervisor named Peter Stalmo who again refused my request for Mr. Spinelli's BAR # in NY, and stated ""what is your problem your getting your money back I informed him that this was not satisfactory to me. He also stated that he was going to tape the call. I then informed him that it was against federal law to phone individuals without their consent. He continued to refuse to allow me to talk to Mr. Spinelli or give me his BAR#, and hung up on me. 
4) I called back again and the secreatary again put me through to Dan Watkins who then threatened that if I called him again he would file a harassment compliant against me. (It's perfectly ok for them to call at all hours of the day and night but I can't get legal public information)
I want to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and the NY BAR association on this company. I still have not been given Mr. Spinelli's # to practice law in the state of NY.
I would appreciate any and all help that you would assist me with. 
Thank you,

I even have the email and address of the finance company. After talking to the finance company, via email, I really thought it was real. The steel company that the cousin worked for was also real. Amazing what your dreams can make you believe.  These are few of the email I received from him and the finance company.

Dorothy,
We have confirmed your documents with the issuance authority and applied for the Approval of Fund Transfer from the Fund Transfer Monitory Department (FTMD), a federal government of Nigeria parastatal that 
monitors every fund transfer in and out of the country. 
We were unable to obtain the Approval of Fund Transfer consequent that the FTMD requested for a Terrorist/Drug Clearance Certificate and 2 years Tax Payment Confirmation Receipt of the Deposit Account. No tax has 
been paid for that past years the deceased died.
Thus, be advised to send us copy of your Terrorist/Drug Clearance Certificate and also contact your attorney to go the Board of Inland Revenue for the 2 years tax clearance. Hopefully you can send us the documents 
by fax today thus, I shall credit your designated bank account and fax to you the fund transfer confirmation slip before we close office 
today.

Los Angeles, California U.S.A. ",,601-762-17346,"JinWon Sua, City Furniture Outlet, Owner Posing As Immigration Lawyer JinWon Sua Aka Chris J Sua con artist posing as lawyer rips client off $46500 for E-2 application files and requests for I-20 filing forms ripoff scam Los Angeles California","
										1) 8/8/03 - Went into a law office (will not mention name for privacy reasons) where the American lawyer told the person in question JinWon Sua to talk to me. At that meeting the Korean-american lawyer(he posed as being a lawyer) persuade me to go into an E-2 investor immigration visa although I had gone in to discuss about a working visa.
2) 8/9/03- Called me on my cell stating that he would help me get an E-2 investor visa. Although the investment capital should be anywhere from 100000 to 150000, he stated that he would make it look on p[aper as if I had loaned him $180000 and that I needed to just show proof that I had at least $50000 in my American bank. Told me to have $50000 ready in the bank and ask the bank to make a statement stating how much I had.
2)8/18/03- Stated that $5000 was needed to extend my I-20 student visa gave him a check that he did not want me to fill in the"" payable to"" line Wanted cash but I gave him a check
3) 8/19/03- Meeting where he wanted me to give him evidence that I had $10000 in a Korean account under my name and $50000 in the American bank. At the last minute, he told me that I needed to show to the INS that I was investing actual physical money and gave me 30 minutes to go to the bank and get $40000. I told him I only could come up with $35000 and he said he would use the $5000 to add it so that it would look as if it was $40000. When I came back stating that the bank needed more time to make a certified c heck made out to JinWon Sua, he followed me to the bank, bullied the teller stating that he was my lawyer and that if we did not file the paperfomr on that day, I would not be eligible for an E-2 visa and that I would be left illegal. Gave him $35000. In exchange, he gave me a propmissory note with a check paid to me of $40000. It was dated 9/15/03 stating that in two weeks' time the INS would be able to give me the visa and he would just give me back the money invested. I was to pay him separate E-2 application fees of $7500 thereafter.
4)9/8/03- called me urgently stating that $6500 was to be put onto an account of Patty Kang because he had paid for my E-2 expediting fee of $1500, translation cost of $300 and I-20 processing fees of $4700. 
5)10/13/03- After numerous requests as to the evidence of E-2 application files and requests for I-20 filing forms, the con artist Jin Won Sua finally admitted that he had never filed anything on my behalf and that he had in fact used $46500 for his personal use.
6)before getting to know that he was not a lawyer, I checked with the California bar association and they told me he was not licensed here. In previous conversations, he had stated that he was licensed in the state of Washington so I contacted them and they also said no one by the name of Jinwon Sua is licensed with them.
I finally got to talk on the 12th of November with the previous American lawyer that I had originally gone in to see. He was not working there anymore and had moved out. It turns out that the american lawyer had hired JinWon Sua as his office manager but realized that he had been taking in clients pretending to be a lawyer on the side and that he already had a case exactly like mine and was suing the guy on fraud charges.
I realized today, the 12th of November that my attempt at contacting bar associations was meaningless because my belief now is that he is a con artist pretending to be a lawyer. 
He has returned $9900 of the $46500 he owes me and after several attempts at telling him that he should tell me what he is going to do, he said he would repay the rest by the end of  next week.
It is my belief that this con artist posing as a lawyer knows a lot about immigration law and that he will keep on using other law offices and keep on posing as a lawyer victimizing anyone he meets. 
He seems to only choose people that he thinks will pay him well such as was my case since when I said there were other people I could introduce him to when he was trying to persuade me to buy a dental office with him, that he was not interested in older people.
He is a very dangerous person. Lying is second nature and preys on the fear and worries of people who have immigration needs.
He states he graduated law school in the state of washington, that he was licensed in the state of washington, that he lives with his mom, that his dad owns a big magazine company called ""Donga"" but that his parents are divorced.  He stated that because immigration lawy is federal, he is allowed to practice anywhere.

Roni Lynn Deutch,"  Roni Lynn Deutch  4366 Auburn Blvd 
Sacramento, California U.S.A. ",,601-948-4444,Roni Lynn Deutch The REAL Truth to be told Right now! Sacramento California,"
										This report is to FINALLY put to bed the issues of The Law Offices of Roni Lynn Deutch. 
Roni herself first of all does NOT represent clients in any way shape or form, so the inner workings of the office are not entirely her own fault. If you consider using ones name and getting PISSED OFF and going on tirades at reports like these, then it's your fault and you (Roni) are guilty.
If you were this great company that only has the best interest of the public at heart, and you TRULY are this great woman that people ""love"" to work for. then why does it bother you what anyone has to say about you? Hmmmmm.. let me see. Could it be that people are RIGHT ABOUT YOU? I would say yes.
 Now as for Greg;
greg Flahive is truly a ""Yes"" man without a thought in his head as to what happens to the clients he is in charge of when you are off galavanting across the world to experience the things that making 3 million dollars a month can bring. 
Let's look for a minute at what Greg has represented about Roni and her company. I will copy and paste from his very own words to show the world the very fact of his uncaring attitude for clients, and his constant finger pointing at someone else. 
Greg stated that....""We have successfully negotiated approximately 12,000 Offers in Compromise on behalf of taxpayers."" Great job guys, but, Roni claims to have been in business since 1991, that equates to 12 years. I know for a fact that the law firm brings on approximately 450 new clients per month, which is 5,400 ""New"" clients per year. Now you do the math, 5,400 clients per year times 12 years!!!!! That comes to a whopping 64,800 clients in the history of your company. Riddle me this Batman, what happened to the other 52,800 clients you have ""taken"" in. They are not all on Installment Agreements. 
Well.
Pretty horrific huh? some people are scared to go up aginst a law firm so you will NEVER hear the full extent of what you are doing to people.
The second thing Greg stated was..."" Our representatives are carefully trained and therefore have a very clear idea about the financial profile that will likely result in a successful OIC."" And...."" Additionally, Kenneth insinuates that we promised him that his case would be settled with the IRS. We never made any such promises, nor could we. As a tax law firm we are aware that there are different variables which may change the outcome of a taxpayer's case.""
Second riddle, if you do such a great job training your ""representatives"" then why are you passing blame when you screw up? The ""Tax Directors(sales people)"" are under constant threat from Roni, of losing their jobs, and faced with the choice of screwing some 1 to 6 more clients, or losing your job, every time the sales person will screw the client, EACH AND EVERY TIME. If you do not perform, then Roni will angrily and suddenly fire you. She will not even show up to do the ""dirty"" work herself. It falls on Greg, and another person like Russell, or Steve.... and even they are too cowardly to tell you the truth, they call it a ""Business"" decision as to not bring light to their ""inside"" practices.
Next is the ""processing time"" for an Offer in Compromise.
When someone PAYS YOU to represent them, you should be much quicker in handling their documents and feelings. You do neither. There are so many overworked, scared, and stressed out people in your firm that it's a wonder any clients get settlements..... and a very small number of them do get wonderful settlements.
It does not take 7 or 18 months to submit an Offer in Compromise! You Greg on the few occasions have chosen to refute someones claim and have talked about a timeline that it took for them to get documents to you.. what about the time YOU took to respond? On the ""Thomas guy you took 7 months for a ""Partial"" wage garnish release?!?!?!?! And for ""Jan"" you took 17 months and wondered why she cancelled????
 A wage garnish order takes minutes to release if the taxpayer is in compliance, and 17 months is painfully long for a ""Doubt as to Collectability"" offer. Having a law degree(LLM) does not make you more versed than another type of professional in handling a clients offer. Your office trained me, but I have grown so much more without you than I could have ever done with you.
Greg, the word ""Assure"" is in Russells' pitch (I have a copy) and everyone on the sales floor uses that word, including ""Rude"" Steve (monitor him and see if you have a business decision for him), and Russell Deutch himself(the two sales trainers, or senior Tax Directors), so stop lying on this web site.. ""Additionally, Jan claims that we assured her that her case would be settled with the IRS. We never made any such assurance, nor could we.""
The sad thing is that as crazy as the firms practices about time is, they have their ""Bully"" section that threatens people if their payments are NOT on time!!! You are slow but want payments on time????
Scott will call and harass, bully, threaten, and use any underhanded methods to collect payments for these scared clients to meet a goal that Roni has even set for him.. and if Scott fails to perform..... she is even angrier at him than the sales floor. Basically Roni Lynn Deutch is a temper waiting to happen for any reason except being accountable and decent for the well being of her clients, employees, and even family.
Everything she portrays belies the fierce competitor that wants to win at all costs, and is like the Queen of Hearts(off with their head) when she comes in second place.
Roni has the system in place, but fails to utilize it in a productive manner. I am expecting a letter any time now from her attorney Jim Banks and have all my I's dotted and my T's crossed.  
I have told the truth and if Greg or any other member of the firm wants to be HONEST, then try to prove me wrong. I believe that if you were on the wrong end of the famous ""Business Decision"" you would have more facts to offer than I could ever come up with.
One last thing..... I was happily in the dark when I first got to the firm and thought we were the greatest company on Earth, but after a few of Roni's moments of disrespect, not being present, and her ""I could care less about you"" attitude, I started to question what I was doing. I did keep my client numbers high, yet I found out what I had been a party to after leaving the company.
To all those I might have injured while under the spell of Roni Lynn Deutch....... I do sincerely appologise.

I seriously question their practices, eventhough they they claim that they exhausted all the avenues to find me.  If I was so hard to find, why did the dismissal letter get to me?  I believe the ripped me off.

Jackson, Mississippi U.S.A. ",,602-258-8900,Timothy D. Record Attorney At Law Yet Another Attorney Ripoff Jackson Mississippi,"
										After researching the internet for legal assistance with a DUI I felt was unwarranted, I found this site.  I filled out the questionnaire and spoke with Victor Carmody, who owns/runs the law firm.  He said he felt my case could be won, or he wouldn't even be talking to me on the phone.  After discussing fees, I settled on the only one I could handle, which was $3,500 for Mr. Timothy Record.  I lost the case.  
He was horrible in court.  I felt like I was his first case, because he acted incompetent and a lot of his defense didn't have anything to do with me or my case.  I never received the first phone call from Mr. Record prior to my court appearance, despite several attempts and several promises from his paralegal that he would call me.  I reported him to the Mississippi Bar, who has found (of course) that he did nothing to warrant my complaint.  Birds of a feather.  
In any case, I am still paying this man the balance of the $3,500 for nothing.  All he could say to me after the case was that I could appeal and I remember him rattling off fee amounts.  He did nothing to help me, even though he contracted with me to do so.  It all comes down to his word against mine, but if I can help anyone else who might be seeking assistance from this firm for a DUI, think very carefully before contracting with them, as I believe they are just a money-making racket.  
I learned a lot of lessons from this experience, but at least my conscious is clear and I can sleep at night knowing that I didn't screw someone out of $3,500 and tell a bunch of lies to cover my butt!

										Do not buy, rent, board horse with this guy, Eric Neitzke. He is a so so attorney in Daytona Beach and pretends to raise horses.  Trouble is he has total idiots working for him and if they or he makes a mistake, he has no responsibility for his actions.  
He brought over some miniatures to his sisters ranch where I board my 4 horses.  They were infected with STRANGLES which is a very deadly disease.  His sister who runs a clean and great ranch found out they were infected and immediately sent them packing.  Poor girl had to quarenteen the ranch and she was hurt financailly because she couldn't bring anymore horses.  
I had to call the vet and all my bills exceeded $400.  Thank God I am on regular shots because the horses that did get the Strangles were in pretty rough shape.  My horses were ill for a few days and I had to spend countless hours to watch them.  They are my family and this pinhead Neitzke thinks nothing of his mistake.  
I think I am also going to petition the Governor of Florida to start Regulating this horse business.  Mary Jane Henderson, Circut Judge in New Smyrna Beach is fed up with ranch owners like this, she told me in a recent case.  This Neitzke, hasnt even helped his own sister and attributes this as bringing a sick kid to day car.  Trouble is, the horses can die and an entire block of region of a city can be affected.  I am glad her neighbors didnt hear.

										An attorney from Cambece Law Firm contacted my mother, gave a false name and false business name, and told her it was important that she relay their phone number to me as they were investigating criminal bank fraud charges being filed against me. My mother brought me the note in a panic. 
When I called the number the first time, I used caller id block to prevent them from getting my phone number and when they answered I chickened out and hung up. They called right back and left a voice message on my machine questioning why I had called and hung up when they were anxious to speak to me and had been expecting my call. I waited a few minutes and then called back. They explained they were trying to contact me regarding a debt that is over 2 years old to Discover credit card in the amount of $4,766.81. 
I told them I was currently unemployed and unable to enter into a payment arrangement and that I disputed the 'late fees' and 'over the limit fees' that had been piling up for over 2 years because Discover had closed the account 22 months prior. They offered one option of payment, a post-dated electronic check transaction. When I refused, they advised me that I had better get an attorney and explain to my new husband that the 'for worse' part of the marriage vows meant he would have to pay for debts incurred prior to our marriage that were outstanding, but mine, and that it was possible for them to put a lien on his bank account since I was a 2nd party to the account and even though we keep seperate credit and bills. 
They also stated they had a copy of my credit report and that I appeared to be paying on my other bills and they weren't sure why, if my new husband was paying those bills, why he couldn't also pay this one. I filed an FTC complaint and will be filing a Bar complaint in his state of business.

										I had an understanding with my workers comp attorneys to guard my retirement funds during a workers comp case with my employer, needless to say they had there own desires and needs, they had to make my company happy, they had to make the opposing lawyers happy, they had to have the state working on there side to be able to slide through this process also, BBB, the governor also made it very clear that he wasn't out to drive business away from Ohio he would not step in, my congressman also never replied to any mailings from me, the attorney general said it wasn't anything that she could do to help, Oh yes I called everyone I could think of. 
The attorneys would keep telling me that they where working for me, they where having there people checking on things for me, upon the conclusion I lost my retirement funds of 430,000 for a settlement of 60,000, I lost a elbow, shoulder injuries, hips, legs were messed up. head injuries that didn't help in understanding the case in full, that's why I got a lawyer to help, 
I tried to find help after the case had to be stopped do to so much stress, but other attornies told me the cards where stacked against me do to the buddy system here in Columbus Ohio, the Columbus Bar would not go against a laywer or firm paying there dues, the time limits also hit me, searching to find a lawyer takes months sometimes and they want one to two years to make a case, so that didn't work very well, if the WC lawyer would have allowed my retirement funds to be brought up in court hearings it would have saved those funds but they where afraid it would cost them there interest in the case. 
something else I later found out is that they have picnics and group gathering for these workers comp people, lawyers, doctors, attorneys, familys of these people they all get togather and discuss how they are going to handle the cases so everyone looks good in the outcome,

West Chester, Pennsylvania U.S.A. ",,602-485-5800,Glenn Grogan Esq. Collected large sum of money in exchange for legal help and skipped town ripoff West Chester Pennsylvania,"
										Glenn Grogan sent a letter to our home after my brother had some problems with the Law. We decided to hire him to represent my brother in court.
He demanded to be paid in cash as soon as possible.  We sent him a check for a portion of the fee.  He was sent another check for another portion.  He claimed he never recieved the check.  Therefore he wanted money wired directly into his account.  We did as he wished.  Then he came to our house to pick up the last of the money he demanded up front. 
He has never called nor sent any letters to our home as any decent Lawyer would do.  He has also missed the last two court hearings he was paid to represent my brother in.  We were informed that he was no longer practicing law and has skipped town with our money and without a word.
As I look back on our story he seemed no good from the beginning but who can tell.  A lawyer is supposed to help you right?  Someone you can trust.  I hope he never has a chance to do this to anyone ever again.

Bloomfield, New Jersey U.S.A. ",,602-506-,"JBC And Associates Attorney At Law is a fraud, dont believe them, dont send any money to them, ask for proof.  It's a huge fraud! Bloomfield, New Jersey","
										Today, January 12, 2004 I received a phone call from JBC and Associates stating that I owed for a bounced check in the amount of $89.65 with an account with Bank of America back in 1993.
I have never had an account with Bank of America as I stated to him and he told me, ""Well, it wasnt called that back then"".  He stated that I had until the 23rd of January to pay or there would be a warrant out for my arrest.  
This really had me scared and upset because he had all this information on me and I dont understand how he got it.  I didnt even have an account with anyone in 1993 as I was reminded by my husband.
It's a good thing my husband was very suspicious of this, how Mr. Thomas Mitchell had no information for the questions that I had about the check.  He told me that I could wetern union the money, I asked him how, he put me on hold.  I asked him who would I mail the payment to, and he stated that I could mail it to the address on the letter head of the letter that was sent to me two days ago.
Mr. Mitchell couldn't answer questions about who the check was written to or anything, all he had was an amount.  I tried calling back and I couldn't get through on the direct number he gave which is different from the main number.  I left a message requesting a copy of the ""bounced check"".  
So now, all I can do is wait.  How are people allowed to get away with this kind of thing, how do they get your private information like that?  Something has to change!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Phoenix, Arizona U.S.A. ",,602-953-5355,Phillip's And Associates Lied to me withheld my options from me belittled me took my money Phoenix Arizona,"
										I filed bankruptcy in May of 2003 with the help of Phillip's and Associates (bankruptcy discharged in July 2003 - initially hired them in November 2002).  During my initial consultation I indicated that I did not want to include my vehicle in my bankruptcy.  I told them I wanted to keep my car and to have it help me rebuild my credit.  Again, before signing my final paperwork for the courts, I asked if there was anything I need to do in regards to my auto loan to make sure I got to keep my car and get credit for my payments.  I was told to simply continue making payments on time.  
Now, six months after my bankruptcy has been discharged I am told that I am making ""voluntary"" payments on my car, and that in order to get credit on my credit for making the payments, I would have needed to sign a re-affirmation paper.  My auto lender told me they sent a re-affirmation form to my attorney, Phillip's and Associates.  Phillip's and Associates attorney Bob Bugler told me that their law firm does not allow their clients to re-affirm any of their debt in case ""something happens"", and I would default on my loan.  This was never explained to me.  I was told if I just needed to continue making my payments.  
The only reason I found out about this is because I began to inquire about purchasing a home.  I went to a mortgage broker.  He was the one who informed me that my car payments were not being reported to the credit agencies.  My credit scores are just shy of what I need them to be in order to purchase a home with one of his lenders.  He informed me that if my payments on my vehicle were appearing that my credit score would be right where I need it to be to purchase a home.
I called Phillip's and Associates to see what could be done to help me.  They said they couldn't do anything.  Not only did they not want to help me, they laughed at me and belittled me.  I asked them why they had lied to me, why wasn't I told about all of my options.  Mr. Bugler informed me, at that point, that they do not allow any of their clients to re-affirm debt because it is not in their best interest.  I told him that it was in my best interest, because I would have had the opportunity to immediately start repairing my credit.  Instead, here I am, six months later with no credit for the effort I have made to rebuild my credit.
Mr. Bugler made a joke, and told me he ""wasn't going to co-sign for me to get a house"".  I know I have made mistakes with my credit.  I know that I got myself in too deep, however I feel that I don't need to be ridiculed by someone who I paid to help me.  I feel like I was deceived because they didn't want to  take the extra step to do what I wanted.  I didn't file bankruptcy because I didn't want to pay my bills.  I filed bankruptcy because I was in over my head, and I needed a fresh start.  
I wonder how many other clients of Phillip's and Associates feel the same way.  I know that I can't be alone.  I feel that other people need to be aware that Phillip's and Associates isn't honest, and that I was just a number to them...with dollar signs!  My real needs and wants were ignored.  I paid them to do a job, and they failed to help me in an area that was very important to me.

										Had payment arrangement with local hospital that I became disabled at. They are building a new hospital and they need the money so they called in all outstanding accounts with total disregard of financial payment agreements. 
We weren't receiving our mail due to mail box vandalism. As soon as I sent the required paperwork to companies per the USPS and the FTC, we started get late notices once in awhile. 
David N. Hull, Attorney for Centron Services, Inc/Equity Process Management- stated that he had sent several letters to us- none received. We were served while I was sleeping (disabled) and the server told my husband to get into my purse and pull out my identification. He did it. 
We contacted an attorney the next day- he sent letters and made phone calls to the attorney (credit service) and the guy never answered his calls. We were making arrangements to pay the bill off with our bank. 
The next thing we knew, we were in default. Didn't receive this until 16 days after the first service date was over. They had actually sent it out 1 week, at least, before the judgement was filed. 
A week later, my husband's boss tells him that they garnished his wages- again no notification through the credit company. All of the notices, etc were sent out earlier than they were supposed to be. We did not deny owing this money but were trying to make payment arrangements and the company just ignored us. 
We are currently filing a complaint against the attorney, the Clerk of Court (as she readily admitted working for him all the time) of our County, and the Credit Service. They have not allowed us the time, required by law to respond. Everything was done before we had a chance and our attorney was totally ignored.

Bloomfield, New Jersey U.S.A. ",,614-4106271,JBC Legal Group wanting me to pay for a  bounced check that was written in 1999.  Will not give me any proof of claim. Bloomfield New Jersey,"
										I was contacted by JBC Legal Group on Monday February 9, 2004.  The lady I spoke with asked if I wanted to take care of the matter.  I asked her what matter she was referring to.  She said it was about a check I had written in 1999 for a vocational guide. I told her I had no idea what she was talking about, and that I would like some kind of proof.  
She indicated that I would have to call the bank that I banked with back then.  I informed her that I don't remember what bank that was.  She then gave me the phone number to NCO (the company that had sent the claim to JBC Legal Group).  I called them emidiatley and spoke with a man who didn't speak much english. The man at first tried all he could for me to tell him my social security number. (I did not give them that information)  I gave him my maiden name, my ""case number"" and my phone number.  
He then pulled up the information and said that I had written a check in 1999 for a vocational guide in the amount of $47.95.  I asked him for some kind of proof and he replied by saying that JBC Legal Group has all that information, and if I wanted anything I would have to call JBC Legal Group for copies.  He also indicated that they destroy the checks after so long, they do not keep any kind of record on hand.  When I asked to speak with his supervisor, he put me on hold and came back to the phone after a few minutes and told me that his supervisor indicated that I needed to call JBC Legal Group for any more information.  
They are not handling my case any more.  So I called JBC Legal Group back and was speaking with Derick Grant.  Derick asked if I was going to settle this matter out of court.  I told him I wanted some kind of proof that this was in deed my fault.  He indicated that the only information that NCO has provided them with was my name, address, phone number and a $ amount.  Nothing else.  He could not provide a bank name, routing number, or even an check number.  
I told him that I needed some kind of proof.  He then replied by saying that my case was in the process of going into litigations. (I have never received any kind of document from JBC Legal Group before, only a phone call)  He said that if I took care of the matter today, that he would be nice enough to knock of 20% of the dollar amount that I owe.  The amount that I would owe after the 20% was $176.80.  
I told him that I would get back to him.  In the mean time I called NCO back to tell them that JBC Legal Group had no documentation.  Well I spoke with a lady who spoke broken english.  She also tried getting me to give my social security number.  I gave her my ""case number"".  When I gave her my case number, she asked me if my name was Roxanne Graber?  I told her no, that was not my name.  She then said that they did not have my name in the computer system.  
But after a while she found my name.  I told her my story about how I wanted some kind of proof. She then told me to call JBC Legal Group that they do not have anything.  I asked to speak with the supervisor, and she replied by saying that her supervisor was on the phone.  I told her that I would hold.  When she put me on hold, she hung up on me instead.  I have not contacted them again.  Instead I went to the computer and looked up JBC Legal Group and found out that I was not the only one having this same problem with them.

										My aunt, Ms. Jackson, died in 1998, leaving what was at the time an $80,000 investment in Bacci Nominee Trust as an inheritance.
Despite numerous attempts to contact Bacci Nominee Trust, and the Trustee, Michael Newell, they refused to accept Certified Mail, did not respond to phone calls nor did they acknowledge transfer of the investment to the heir, G. Schmidt, Ms. Jackson's brother.
At one point, a Power of Attorney was created, and the gentleman, an employee of the Government of Puerto Rico, was received by ""a visibly nervous Michael Newell,"" but despite assurances that communication would be forthcoming, nothing happened.
Six years have passed and neither the money nor an update of the investment has been made. A legal suit against the Trust, apparently created by the law firm of Bacxci and Bacci, was discarded under legal advice of ""if the money is still there, most of it would be spent on the legal fees alone."" Mr. Schmidt, a 21-year Air Force veteran, lives in Puerto Rico and cannot travel to San Francisco.

										The claim we received from JBC Legal Group is in regard to a bounced check that happened in 1999.  In 2000, my wife and I received a statement from Ames Department Store about the check.  We went in and gave them a money order for the full amount.
My wife called JBC Legal Group to ask some questions and the lady would not cooperate at all.  My wife asked to speak to a supervisor and, conveniently, the supervisor was not available.  My wife asked to speak to the lady who's name was on the contact line of the letter and, again, she was not available.
I called JBC Legal Group today and received no help.  I asked the lady, Vanessa (last name witheld), to send me documentation.  I wanted her to send me a copy of the bounced check.  She said they couldn't.  Ames would not give them a copy of the check.  I asked her why.  Vanessa said they could only get a copy when they actually had to go to court.  I asked for a number for Ames Head Quarters (because there is no longer an Ames in Columbus, IN.  After checking, there are no Ames at all anywhere anymore).  She would not give me contact information for Ames.
Finally, I asked for a supervisor.  Vanessa would not hook me up.  She started calling me a ""bad check writer"" and said that bad people write bad checks.  I should just deal with the consequences for writing a bad check.  I told her that I was on to JBC's scam and since she would not supply me with information that she just proved to me that they had nothing on me.  Again, she raised her voice and called me a bad check writer and would not let me talk again.  I finally told her to go ahead and press charges.  I called her bluff.
I got off the phone and faxed a copy of the money order receipt to JBC Legal Group and also a note saying I expect an apology.  I called JBC again to check and see if they got the fax.  They said they cannot tell me until Monday at the earliest.  Again, no cooperation.  After all, I'm just a ""bad check writer.""

										Last week I received a letter from JBC Legal Group, dated March 5, 2004. It stated I owed them $107.83 for a check that (they say) bounced. The date the check was written was 6/11/99 for $72.83. The bank I had in 1999 was bought out in 2001. I called the current branch, but they do not keep records for 5 years. 
The statute of limitations, according to JBC, is 6 years in Maryland. I told the man who answered the phone, I had never received anything for anyone regarding 5this matter. He said they just purchased the debts from Ames. This store went bankrupt in 2000 or 2001. No other collection agency or my bank has sent notification of this. I also told him this was not on my credit report and he needed to prove to me that I dishonered the check and that I never made goodon it. He got a serious attitude and said ""well consider yourself lucky this was never reported, but how do you know it's not on you credit?"" I told him I just purchased a new car in 1/2004, and I can guarentee it's not there. 
He then threatned legal action against me. He told me that someone my age (24) did not want this on my permant record. I told him to go ahead and file charges, I would have my attorney contact him. He studdered a little, and then hung up.

BLOOMFIELD, New Jersey U.S.A. ",,619-702-0800,"JBC Legal Group ripoff, SCAM ARTISTS!! LIARS BLOOMFIELD, New Jersey","
										I received a letter over a month ago for a check that I STOPPED payment on over 2 years ago. According to JBC however, it was an NSF. It turns out that the bank paid the check to the in ERROR and I faxed a copy of my statement to JBC showing them that it had been paid. A little over a month later I received another letter from them stating that I now owe 5 times the amount of the original check!!When I called to speak to ""LORI BROWN"" I was told that she was in court. 
The guy insisted that he could help me. He spoke in circles for 5 straight minutes saying that I had to pay the total amount but that after I pay it I should then sue the company that I wrote the check to because it seemed to him that I had been defrauded and I should go after them for the fees I was incurring with JBC. I consider myself to be rather savy in consumer issues but this guy almost had me going. 
I actually offered to pay the original amount of the check just to close this case and he said he could not take less than 75% of the total bill. Finally I told him that I would have my husband call him later. I then contacted the check verification company who JBC claimed to represent and I was told that I was in good standing with them and they were not sure what was goin on. Thats when I decided that I would check this company out on the net. 
What a SCAM indeed! I should have figured it out by their lack of professionalism, the grammar of the letter, the stupid phrases like ""Oh yeah and the sky is red, right?"" or ""Just hang it up."" 
What a pathetic way to make a living, from the uneducated operators all the way up to whomever claims to be the lawyer. I contacted the FBI, and this is going to a WHITE COLLAR CRIME UNIT. DON'T give these people money...You don't owe it!!!

Dear  Cummings,
I am Barrister Williams Zigima, a solicitor at law. I was the personal attorney to Mr. Pitt Cummings, a national of your country, who worked with Chevron Producing Company in Nigeria. On the 21st of April 2002, my client, his wife  and their only daughter were involved in a car accident along lagos-Ibadan  express road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives.
After his internment, I made several inquiries to your embassy here to locate any of my client's extended family members but all proved abortive.Thus,after these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last name over the Internet to locate any member of his family hence I contacted you. 
I  contacted you  so as to assist me  in repatriating the fund valued at  US$13 million Left behind by my late client with a EcoBank of Nigeria Plc before it gets Confiscated or declared  unserviceable by the  EcoBank of Nigeria Plc. The said  EcoBank of Nigeria Plc has issued me a notice to provide  the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next fourteen  official working days. 
For the fact that I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2 years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased, since you have the same last name with my client, so that this deposited fund could be transferred to you. 
Consequently, on receipt of your positive response, I shall then present you to the EcoBank of Nigeria Plc as the next of kin and we shall then discuss the sharing ratio. Moreover, all that I require from you is your honest cooperation to enable us see this  transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate  arrangement that will protect you and I  from any breach of the law.
Best regards,

										The Wall Street Journal had an article today (4/8/04) slamming personal-injury law firms like Childress & Charpentier Attorneys at Law who have incredibly aggressive and possibly even deceptive Internet marketing campaigns to try to sign up and represent victims of Mesothelioma asbestos.
Among other things, the article says that ""the firm snapped up expired Web addresses... and populated them with words related to mesothelioma. These sites then redirected to the firm's home page""
Other attorneys and lawyers are also part of a growing feeding frenzy of ""Mesothelioma attorneys"" marketing to get Mesothelioma asbestos patients to sign up with their law firms. The Journal indicates that it is even more aggressive than automobile and car accident lawyer and investment fraud marketing tactics.
If you also think this is rather unseemly, if you come across any law firms that are doing this, be sure to check out what they are doing and then you may wish to contact them directly with your disapproval of such aggressive methods to try to sign up Mesothelioma victims.

At one point he started telling my husband that I do not want to see him out of jail claiming we had something going on, which was a big lie, causing conflicts between my husband and i; that was very disrespectful. We are not allowed to call his office any more because he does not want to talk or answer any questions regarding the appeal, or what ever he claim he filed on the case. this happened a couple of months ago, he still hasn't called us yet. my husband will probably do most of his time in jail because we have no more money to put out. i was treated very, very unfair. i got riped- off

Nationwide U.S.A. ",,631-472-1933,JBC Legal Dishonored Check Scam! Bloomfield Nationwide,"
										Yesterday I received a letter in the mail from JBC Legal Group regarding a dishonored check dating back to November 30, 1993. The dishonored check was written to Macy's for $205.07. There was no information provided regarding the Check Number, the Bank Account, or the Bank on which this check was written. I found this to be highly suspect. I have recently bought a house and this check did not appear on any of the credit reports that were run, which it should have if it was a legitimate bounced check.
First thing this morning I called JBC Legal to get more information and clear this matter up. When I reached them, I spoke with a gentleman; he looked up my account and confirmed the information in the letter. I told him that I suspected that this was a fraudulent check and asked if I could obtain a copy of the check. He said I could not and that I would receive a copy of the check after I had paid the amount due. I told him there was no way I was paying for something with so little information, especially when I felt there may be check fraud involved. He told me that my driver's license number was written on the back of the check. I have my driver's license printed on all my checks, so of course they have my driver's license number. 
I then asked again for a copy of the check, I told him I needed that to prove that I did not write the check and I needed it to go to the police. He told me it was too late to contact the police regarding this matter, that I should have contacted them when it happened. I then explained that IF I had know about it 11 years ago I would have, but since this is the first I have heard of it, I would have to take action now. 
I mentioned that I had opened several bank accounts over the last 11 years and had never heard about this matter then and that banks generally do not let people with bounced checks open new accounts. He had nothing to say to this. I asked what I had to do to obtain a copy of the check. He said I had to pay the amount and then they would send me the check. I said I would not pay $200 without first seeing the check. He then told me I could be charged with a Federal Crime for bouncing a check and if an investigation was open, there is a very good chance I would be paying heavy fines and all the lawyer fees. 
I then asked to speak with the attorney listed on the letter, Jack Boyajian, he said he was in court. I asked when I could speak to him, and I was told he really is not in the office, he is always in court. I mentioned to him that I felt this was some kind of scam and that I really needed to see a copy of the check before I could do anything. He then told me to call the Better Business Bureau (BBB). So I hung up the phone and called the BBB.
I immediately contact the Better Business Bureau in New Jersey where I learned JBC had an unfavorable rating and that they had numerous unresolved cases. I asked what these cases were regarding, but they can not give out that information.
I then contact the bank I used 11 years ago to find out if they could produce a copy of this dishonored check. They do not have a record of the check or my account with them because it has been so long. 
I then went to the Internet and found numerous postings similar to mine. I am very sure that this is some kind of scam and plan on taking action.

San Carlos, CaliforniaU.S.A.STOP! ..before you think about using the Better Business Bureau (BBB)... CLICK HERE to see how other consumers were victimized by the BBB's false or misleading information. Don't be fooled! It has been reported, when there are thousands of complaints and other investigations underway by authorities, the BBB has no choice but to finally give an UNsatisfactory rating to a BBB member business that is paying the BBB big membership fees every year. When a business is reported that is NOT a BBB member, BBB files WILL more likely show an UNsatisfactory rating, then reportedly shake down that company to become a member of the BBB. One positive thing about the BBB is, either way, if a business has an unsatisfactory rating with the BBB, you can be sure, the business is bad. But what about all those BBB member businesses that had complaints filed against them? Consumers never get to hear about them. What about the BBB advertising to the public? Is this a false and misleading perception they are giving about consumer confidence when dealing with a business? Click here to understand more of what consumers and business alike are saying about the BBB. You decide. ..Remember. The BBB membership is not earned, it's paid for! ",Lawyers,0

I called the 800 number on the letter the morning after I received the letter only to be barraged with insults, accusations and incredible rudeness.  The first rep said, ""You wrote a bad check now what are you going to do about it?""  The shock still hasn't worn off.  After a few minutes of arguing back and forth another rep got on the phone.  When I asked his name he said Mr. King.  I asked for a first name which he indicated was Robert.  He was just as accusatory and indicated that I had two choices ~ pay the outstanding debt of $4.13 and fees for a total of $134.13 or deal with the outcome.  Rather threatening if you ask me.  
I asked for backup documentation and he refused saying it wasn't pertinent for me to have it.  I asked if this was a joke because this just couldn't be real. He told me that he has all my previous addresses so they have a 'lengthy file' on me.  I guess I was supposed to be intimidated.  He told me that ""Decent human beings pay their bills.  I guess that you don't like looking at yourself in the mirror.""  What's that all about?   
He said I had to dispute the claim via letter addressed blankly to their New Jersey address.  He refused to give me any further information on how to resolve this situation other than to pay up....Rude, threatening in demeanor, disrespectful, arrogant, abusive, etc.  Shall I continue?

Sacramento, California U.S.A. ",,636-240-4644,Law Office Of Roni Deutch they swindle the public in thinking they will help settle taxes but only a very small percentage are settled Sacramento California,"
										This is for anyone contemplating on hiring the services of the Law Offices of Roni Deutch.  Being former employees of the firm, we are very familiar how this law firm operates and treats clients/customers/victims.  It is our duty as citizens to inform the public of the goings on of this law firm.  
It should be known that Roni Deutch is merely a figurehead for the law firm now.  She was the architect of the firm; now she has very little to do with the law firm because she is far too busy surfing in Maui, watching Kings games with her court-side seats, watching Giants games with her ground-level seats, and hanging out with her gal pals.  For all we know, she could be on her way to Holland so she can view the tulips and dykes.  
The person who runs this law firm on a 24/7 basis is a Greg Falhive.  Through Falhive, this law firm now overcharges its clients/customers/victims, and it provides very little in the way of service for its clients/customers/victims.  Falhive is extremely obsessed with only one thing - PROFIT.  Everybody knows that the business of business is business; however, you must have ethics and standards in business.  Falhive is totally void of these qualities (the only standard Falhive knows is the gold standard).  Since Falhive has taken the reigns, profit has gone up; quality and service are now gone.  
Falhive wants to over-charge his clients/customers/victims for a seven-course meal, so he can serve them a happy meal (sans the toy).  He runs this law firm like a sausage factory, using the factors of production.  To illustrate how obsessed this man is with profit, he actually insisted that his employees work in an unhealthy work environment, regardless of the health consequences that they were later afflicted with.  This man could have easily amended the situation but didn't because of profits.  Falhive's lust for profit is equal only to that of Fred C. Dobbs. (""Badges?  We don't need no stinkin' badges!"")
Falhive has the exterior of calm.  Don't let it fool you.  Inside, this man is cunning, ruthless and vindictive.  He will say anything to damage people's character and credibility.  (He is probably the type who has a copy of The Art Of Warfare with semen stains on it.)  Through Falhive, he has turned this law firm into the Halliburton of the legal industry.  
This is just a little bit of information about Falhive and his agenda.  Now lets talk about the person who directs the sales force of this law firm (their source of income), Roni's baby brother, Little Rusty.  Little Rusty is a very pushy fellow with a Napoleonic complex and views self-conceit, greed and deception as virtues.  He supervises and facilitates the deceptive tempo of the activities of all of the tax directors/salespersons/telemarketers.  
It is Little Rusty who wrote the much-praised ""script"" that all of the tax directors/salespeople/telemarketers are forced to learn and use.  This script is full of insipid tripe and rubbish (the only useful purpose this script has is to line a bird cage with).  One example:  as the tax directors/ salespeople/telemarketers talks to a potential client/ customer/victim they use this line:  ""KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK. . . hear that, Mr. Johnson?  That is the IRS knocking on your door!  You need to hire us NOW!""  (Can you believe this *hit?!?!) 
Little Rusty encourages his tax directors/salespeople/ telemarketers to prey on the elderly, minorities, those with little education, those with little income, those with little hope, and even the mentally-challenged!  His motto is ""Find the wound and make it bleed!""  Here are some key phrases that Little Rusty has his people say to potential clients/customers/victims:
They Say This:  ""We are very good at what we do.""  That is true, they are very good at taking your moolah and putting it in Roni's coolah.  
They Say This:  ""Wouldn't it be nice to have peace of mind?""  They mean:  ""Wouldn't it be nice for us to get a piece of your income!""
They Say This:  ""Wake up and smell the coffee.""  
They mean:  ""You won't be able to afford coffee after we are through fleecing you.  You will only be able to smell it.""
They Say This:  ""Wouldn't it be nice to get a good nights sleep?"" 
They mean:  They'll be the only ones getting a good nights sleep.  ""You're never going to get a good nights sleep after you hire us and realize you squandered your money.""
They Say This:  ""RIGHT!""
They mean this:  ""WRONG!""
They Say This:  ""That's an excellent question you asked, Mr. Johnson!"" 
They mean:  ""You Big DUMMY, I've been waiting 5 minutes for you to ask me this question so I can slam-dunk you with this response.""
They Say This:  ""State Law prohibits us from giving a guarantee.""
They mean:  ""State law covers our butt, and if you want any kind of refund, forget about it!""
As you can see, Little Rusty will say anything (he will even call you ""Friend"" after just talking to you for 3 minutes) to get a sale.  His quest for money is so high that he even lowers his standards as to who would be his assistant.  His assistant, Lecherous Steve, is a great salesperson as far as the numbers look; however, character-wise, if a snake was in a skirt it wouldn't be safe with him around.  (He is very anal-retentive, always wigged-out and misogynist, to boot.)
If you were to become a client/customer/victim of this law firm, you will inevitably come into contact with the obnoxious lout Scott Jewcium; this man has the manners of a troll, the compassion of a Nazi, and the behaviour of the Tasmanian Devil on crank.  He has turned abuse into an art form (he is so good at it that he and the law firm are/were in litigation from a previous customer/client/victim that he abused so bad that the person had a breakdown.  
It is true that this law firm has settled people's tax debt for as little as $20, but what they don't want you to hear is the other side of the coin.  For every $20 settlement that they get for their clients/customers/victims there are scores upon scores of clients/customers/victims who get no resolution whatsoever.  What is even more descipable is people who owe the IRS $16,000 hire the law firm, pay $3,500 in attorney fees, and settle for $14,000.  (Doesn't take Einstein to figure out the math.)  When this happens, Little Rusty yells ""Great Sales Job!"" (He really cares for his clients/customers/victims!)
To summarize, if you still think it is to your advantage to become a client/customer/victim and that you will put your money and fate on this conveyor belt of ""hurry up and wait"", ""we will get back to you"", regret (as many have), and possible settlement (a very small minority actually settle), just remember this legal axiom that you will never hear from this law firm, ""caveat emptor"" (""let the buyer beware"").  
And one little postscript:  it is common knowlege that Roni Deutch pays Little Rusty, Scott and other family members and certain employees very large amounts of unreported cash.  It has been rumored that these very large amounts of unreported cash paid to family and certain employees far exceed the legal limit established by the IRS.  If true, wouldn't that be of great interest to the IRS?

										I received a letter stating I had bad checks from 2001. No such thing!  I contacted them and they refused me any information they had and said they would see me in court.  
Thank you to the Identity Theft/Fraud Research Group!  They informed me of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  I was threatened SIX times in 2 days with court by JBC.  My lawyer is loving this!  Of course I reported them to the Federal Trade Commission as well as the Consumer Affairs of New Jersey. 
By the way, it is not legal for them to threaten you with court unless they have given you thirty days to prove them wrong.  They cannot scream or use profanity either! I believe each one is worth a $5,000.00 fine.

										On March 29, 2004 I received a letter from JBC about a dishonored check that I supposedly wrote more then 7 years ago to Best Buy written on an account at a bank I have never done business with. The letter demanded $211.83 or they were going to file suit in 30 days. I did my own research and discovered that JBC is nothing more than a Bad Debt collector and uses scare tactics to get persons to pay up.  
I never paid the money and a month later they claim I owe $711.83.  JBC was trying to collect attorney's fees before a civil judgment which is clearly in violation of Wisconsin law.  
It is now two months later and they still have not filed suit but I have submitted their threatening letters to the law office of Edelman and Combs.  I would suggest that anyone else in this situation do the same but make sure to read visit this website first:  http://www.edcombs.com/FSL5CS/Custom/TOCSpecial.asp

										I received a letter on 4/4 this year and nearly had a heart attack when I read it. It said I had bounced a check to WINN DIXIE and get this.... it said I wrote the check back in 1997.
I was about to cry because first of all I don't remember ever bouncing a check to WINN Dixie. I mean come on stuff happens. BUT I would remember if I had bounced a check and never picked it up. And to make my panic more intense.. I had just moved into an apartment where they had run my credit and there was nothing there. SOOOO.. I get to looking at this paper and realize that it says I wrote the check on a bank called Bank of Amer Na??? Now I am like WHAT????.... I have never had a bank account with this company.
So I get on the internet trying to see if this company is for real because then it occurs to me the ONLY for of payment listed is Credit Card??? Stranger and Stranger. 
So I find RipOffReport.com and read that HEY I am not alone... other folks too have gotten letter and this company didn't get lucky hitting the right bank account. I mean if just a faction of the number of people get these letters and they hit the right bank, chances are some poor person is gonna think they may have wrote a bad check and just didn't take care of it for some reason. What smucks!! 
Any how... I live in North Carolina and I want info from Chris on the Class Action suit. You can have copies of my letters. And I will be happy to swap info with you. Let me know how we can arrange to talk. These people are belly crawlers and need to be stopped.

										I received my first letter from this legal group on March 5, 2004 claiming that I owed 270.62 for a dishonored check made out to Ames Department Store on June 7, 1999, which is nearly 5 years ago.  I wrote to them on April 1, 2004 requesting verification of the debt since it was so long ago.  
On May 27, 2004 I received another statement from JBC Legal Group claiming that I ""obviously chosen to ignore their previous communication demanding that I make restitution on an NSF check"" and that they now ""assume that I delivered the check with the intent to defraud, and may proceed with the allowable remedies"". and that I now owe them 741.86. They clearly state in the letter that I may be subject to statutory penalties equal to two times the amount of the check, but not more than 1,000.00 per check, however, if you add 270.62 times two it is 541.24 not 741.86. 
I contacted the legal group and asked to speak to Lori Brown (the contact name listed in the letter) and was advised by some very rude man that she was not there and that he would talk with me. I advised the gentleman that I had sent a request for verification on April 1st and he became very rude and belligerent with me, when I asked why it stated that I now owed 741.86 he told me that they could charge whatever penalites they wished and that even though I had sent a request for verification that I still owed the money intil I could show otherwise. On the same day, I received another letter from them claiming that I owed 85.62 for a dishonored check to the same department store on July 30,1999.  Yet again, I sent a request for verification for this debt.  
I have attempted to contact Lori Brown on several occassions and every time I call I am advised that she is not there and that someone else is handling her calls. When I called yesterday (June 21, 2004) I asked the gentleman when Ms. Brown would be available and he again became very rude with me and stated that he was handling her calls. 
When I told him that I had again sent a request for verification of the debt his comment to me was "" Then I assume that you deny this debt and we will have to play the waiting game then"" he then proceeded to hang up on me. I have not received anything for them showing that the debt is valid.

										In the winter of 2004 I received a letter from JBC Leagel Group telling me that I wrote a bad check for $101.91 to Ames in Bridgeport CT. in november of 1999. At first I just thought this was rediculous because I have never even been to an Ames in my life and for that matter I dont even know what kind of store this place was. I just disregared the letter and forgot about it. 
Two weeks later I recived a second letter from the same company stating that in the same month I wrote another bad check this time for $347.64 to Ames again. This time however I did some research I found out that there was no Ames in Bridgeport CT. and that Ames Had been out of Business for about two years. Well this struck me funny and I decided to give JBC Leagel Group a call. 
From the begining of the conversation I felt something was not right and then  he asked me for my CT drivers license number I responded with the fact that I haven't lived in the state of CT. for a number of years now and said that if this was in fact a true claim would'nt he have that information, after all they claim I wrote a bad check and I dont know about you but usually when you write check they ask for your drivers license and write all the info. on the check. At that point we were disconnected, I felt he hung up on me. 
When I tryed to call back I could not get through. I called back a couple of days later and had the same conversation with a female and asked her to produce me a copy of the check. She could not provid me with anything. I then told her I was going to repot this company for trying to steel my money ,my identety and who knows what eles and again I was disconnected. 
About a month later they called me back and told me that they were just going to put my account in the fraud department and I told them never to call me again and I hung up the phone. I just want people to know what this company is trying to do, Just because they know your name and adress dose not mean you should give them any money or personal information!

Shawn Ramsey Attorney At Law,"  Shawn Ramsey Attorney At Law  2 E. 10th St. 
Anderson, Indiana U.S.A. ",,682-5545910,Shawn Ramsey Attorney At Law ripoff liar scams money and doesn't show up in court Anderson Indiana,"
										This guy has the audacity to respond to complaints saying it isn't him? I'm Sandy from Fort Wayne Indiana, and here is the truth about Shawn Ramsey.
While searching for an attorney, I was referred to Shawn Ramsey from an online search engine called LagalMatch. Mr. Ramsey responded, appearing to be an attorney that was on top of his game......what a game it is, to him any way. He scheduled an appointment immediately. I was impressed with his promises and paid the $750.00 attorney fee. That's the last I heard from him.
This all took place in February. He said he would have the case taken care of no later than the end of April. April came and went and several phone calls went unreturned. Since he wouldn't return calls, I scheduled an appointment for a physical visit. The day before my appointment he called stating he wouldn't be in the office and he was on top of the case any way. 
More calls unreturned. May, then June and more unreturned calls. The court date was coming soon and Mr. Ramsey's secretary said it was listed on his schedule and he would be there. He never called or showed. I talked to him a few days later, once again after threatening to pay him a visit, and he clains he tried to call me several times that morning. Funny thing is, I have caller id, call waiting, voice mail and was home when he claimed to call and wasn't even on the phone! 
When I actually did talk to him, it was on a Monday. He claimed he would contact me on Wednesday and let me know exactly what was going on. You guessed it....... Wednesday came and went with no contact from Mr. Ramsey. 
Another message left with him on Thursday saying I want my money back or I would file a grievance with the attorney general. Guess what.........he called! Imagine that. I stood firm and he said he'd go over my account and refund my money. 
Two more weeks.......no money, no call, no surprise. I filed a grievance and was not surprised to find I'm not the only one having a problem with Mr. Ramsey. So, I decided to do a little research on this so called attorney on the internet. I found this web-site and a few other complaints. If Mr. Ramsey dares to challenge these allegations, just as he did the other complaint on this site, decide for yourself...... 
A good place to look would be an article in The Post @ Mail. It's a newspaper from Columbia City claiming Mr. Ramsey failed to show up for court there too and a public defender had to take over the case. Are they making up stories too Mr. Ramsey?
I know I will never see my money but I have the satisfaction of sharing this information and I will not stop until Mr. Ramsey is disbarred from ever practicing again in my state!

Washington, District of Columbia U.S.A. ",,6826679629/ 8174290459/,"Arent Fox Law Firm schools corrupt attorneys and plays politics with judicial process. Lawyers tout FTC governmental connections to clients; Pepsico (fake Harrier offer) and Citigroup among the corruption Democrat Partner forced out by Republican cronies Employee Whistleblower Washington, DC","
										I am a former employee of Arent Fox Law Firm. I am so disgusted with what I have seen at this highly corrupt firm that I have decided to speak out. One of their favorite sayings is, ""Controversy Sells."" Well, let's see how they fare when the controversy is about them and not stories they have developed and planted with media connections.
First of all, and ironically, the summer interns were given the task of researching and lambasting the makers of the drug OxyContin, Perdue Pharma LLC. One of the interns got caught selling the drug by the local cops and one of the Firm's Associates was given the task of getting the cops and the DA to ""lose interest in the case."" This is one example of the firms total disregard for our system of jurisprudence. All this effort was because the intern was supplying several of the Associates and even a couple of the Partners. 
Politics plays a major role in the aggressiveness with which they pursue a case. The Firm is totally unsupportive of anyone who is affiliated with the Democratic party. A partner who decided to run for public office as a Democrat was forced out of the Firm.
Commercial bankruptcy specialists are like a pack of angry wolves and the most aggressive crooked bunch of lawyers. There are attorneys who have conspired to perpetrate frauds on the court, prepping clients so well that they actually rehearse their answers with them. I am well aware of the forging of documents. Selected office staff is shown how to transfer signatures to documents and given special treatment for their total loyalty. Little do they know that the ""extra tasks"" they are ""asked"" to perform are documented so they can use it against them if they decide to turn on the Firm.
Compared to all this, the circumstantial evidence of violations of the ethical code and aiding a health care provider hide funds stolen from Medicare seems pretty tame. In the former case, the corruption of the Federal Trade Commission is fairly significant in and of itself, and that should not be disparaged. This firm supports the current administration's policy of raping regulatory budgets of the Securty Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission because it makes it easy to get away with stuff.
In a well-known case, Arent Fox represented a health care provider who received Medicare funds from Citicorp and its subsidiaries.  In this case, Associates essentially bribed the judge in exhange for a favorable decision in the matter of the appeal.
May the god of justice look down favorably on us all and ensure that this Firm is brought to the judgement bar for their sins against us all.

										The Laws Offices of Paul Stassinos gives lawyers, attorneys a really bad name! I was continuously harrassed by this office. I did indeed owe a debt, but was laid off my job and made contact with the debitor, however the law offices of Paul Stassions came along and promised the debitor the world. 
My paycheck was being garnished by the Law offices of Paul Stassinos and they still harrased me by calling  on my job everyday threating me for payment. It even got to the point that they would call and then hang up! Can you believe that? Unreal!! 
I finally decided to check my credit report myself and guess what, I had two more small outstanding debits which the Paul Stassinos office was handling. When I say small I mean small. 
One of the debit's was from when my daughter was in elementary school in 1995 and the debit was for only $23.00 (I found out that the Law Offices of Paul Stassinos recevied a $100.00 on top for each debit of what they were being paid by the debitors)and the other small debit was for $4.00. What a joke!!! Anyway, I pull up my credit report from all three reporting agencies and contacted the companies that stated that I owed the monies on my credit report for the outstanding debit being handled by Paul Stassino Law office were for $123.00 and $104.00 respectively, I sent both outstanding debit via money orders to their office by Ups signature required. 
Do you know that they send it back the money orders and stated that I owe more money than what was reported on my credit report? I became a tad upset by this. I send the money orders back to them and sent to them a legal notice under the provisions of the federal law, the Fair Debit Collection Practices Act to stop all the harrassment. It stoped for a minute. The debits are still on my credit report as not having been paid. Anyone who gets a notice or a judgement notice from this company- PLEASE BEWARE!!!! Know the law or hire an attorney, because they will harrass you till no end!!

										Rip-Off Report has determined that the foregoing postings were sent from the same computer by someone providing false identification and contact information.  Further, that same computer was also used to post other disparaging reports about three other law firms in the Phoenix, Arizona area, all at approximately the same time.
The fact that the author of this report and rebuttal misrepresented his or her association with Levenbaum & Cohen and filed multiple reports against various law firms under fictitious names leads to the conclusion that the author had some other motive for disparaging the reputations of these law firms.Accordingly, you should not rely on this report in deciding whether to do business with Levenbaum & Cohen.  Instead, you should consider that Levenbaum & Cohen has been in business for 25 years, has a Martindale Hubbell rating of AV (the best rating) and has no complaints against it with the bar association or any other organization.

I am reporting Levenbaum and Cohen to other consumers to save you the heartbreak and decption this lawfirm has caused me.  They took my case promising me that they do not take cases they cannot win and they were sure they could win mine.
I have now gone through my entire savings and am about to lose my house, my job, my car and everything I own.  This firm has gotten rich, as the legal fees mount, I have gotten no where.  My case has not been filed and every time I call to find the status I am put on hold and then told that no one is available to take my call.
After giving them $45,000 in fees, I have not heard from them except for form letters in almost four months.  If I could afford another attorney I would sue them.  HELP!

None of my calls ever got returned, there was never any preparation for my case, they just showed up in court and every time asked me questions like it was the first time they heard the answers. I kept being told there are more expenses that must be covered all at my expense, of course.
After falsely assuring me of the outcome of my case, and me believing they could win my case the result was not even close to what he promised.

Williamsport, Pennsylvania U.S.A. ",,702-880-5554,Jeff Yates Ripoff unethical law practice crimes against humanity Williamsport Pennsylvania,"
										After posting a resume on monster.com my husband received a phone call from Carey boiler works that was interested in interviewing my husband.
My Husband decided to go ahead and meet with Dick Carey and see what all he had to offer.
Basically we were told a bunch of lies. One of which we would have to provide our own truck, but we would receive a vehicle allowance. (Man o man did I get screwed on that). However this move occurred and we rented an apartment from Dick Carey and my husband made the move leaving me behind in Florida until after the birth of our twin boy's. 4 weeks later we were all in Pennsylvania.
On Aug 17, 2004 my husband and I lost the oldest of our 6-week-old twins. Deciding to fly him home we made arrangements to have him buried in the family cemetery. So armed with a company credit card thanks to Dick, We drove to Florida for the funeral.
While devastating in itself Jeff Yates called my husband just 2 hours after the funeral and fired my husband (from his job of 6 weeks) for his client. (Based on the advice of financial advisors...ya right.)
So here we are stranded in Florida with $15.00 to our name, no formula, diapers, clothes etc etc to speak of, and we get told by Yates to never contact Dick Carey again, that our personal belongings in our apartment had been packed up and we would be notified of the date we could fly in and pick up the uhaul trailer holding our personal belongings. 
My husband fly's to Pennsylvania and is met by Jeff Yates at the airport with the keys to our truck and one uhaul attached to it.
After arriving back in Florida and seeing all the broken items and the way they supposedly packed our stuff I got extremely mad and decided to sue them both.
The conclusion is we settled with Dick Carey of Carey Boiler Works (who did pay his settlement, and we won a judgment against Jeff Yates. (Who hasn't paid a dime to this day.)
I share my personal experience so that others may be wary of the illegal practices and immoral ethics of this particular attorney.

										I am a 40 year old single mother, of one, 11 yr old wonderful son.  I was divorced in 1994, in Columbus, Georgia & recieved custody of my son who was 10 months old at the time.
When I left my ex, we moved back to Auburn, Al, to reside with my mom.  My ex took me to court, in Columbus Georgia because my son & I use to live there. Since my ex was from there & currently residing in Columbus, since he was filing for divorce that's the city & state with the Jurisdiction.  FOREVER & always
My ex took me back to court about 16 months later & filed in Auburn, Al. (dumb me) Not knowing any better went & hired an attorney, for $7,500 I still have the cancelled check.  My ex's lawyer stated in court, 'that since my son & I had resided in Lee county for over a year, that she had the ""divorce & custody"" case MOVED relocated to Lee County Alabam.  Ofcourse, I still maintained custody, but He received joint custody.
My ex & THAT attorney Theresa Dean, have taken me to court FIVE times since, in Lee county Alabama. 
I was a registered Nurse & Certified Surgical Tech. for many years.  and unfortunately became addicted to Lortab.  But never let it enterferr with my sons up bringing.  My son was VERY HAPPY and a wonderful wonderful young individual.  He maintained an A B honor roll, with the exception of one quarter each year he'd drop to a 'C' & then we'd pull it back up.  He was voted Most Popular Kid in the Class one year, the next year he received Most Popular kid in the School.  Even though I worked, Part-time I was always Homeroom Mom always involve with the school & activities & on a first name basis, with his teachers, the principal & vice principal.
My son was involved with Baseball & was (is) a FANTASTIC ball player, recieving Sportman ship, # 1 player etc.  My son & I have always had a very close and wonderful relationship.  One parent said my son & I were 'Buddies'.
In June I started recieving help for my substance abuse, my ex husband filed for custody & we went to court on YEP 9/11/03, & my ex was granted custody.  Again, he took me to court in Lee County Alabama.  However, my son & I had been residing in Panama City, Fl, since 1999, we were BOTH a resident of Florida.  
After, being released in January 2004, I've been seeking back custody every since.  My son ABSOLUTELY HATES his dad, they have NEVER had any kind of relationship & Virtually can't stand each other.  My son has threatened on MANY occassions that he was going to kill his dad.  My ex does nat take any kind of care of him & has literally tortured my son Mentally & Emotionally.  My son's report card from the 5th grade consisted of over 5 F's, a couple of C's and the rest were D's.  He was suspended twice in one week and MANY more things.
In May of this year my ex tried to run over my with his truck in which my son was a passenger. The first time I did nothing the second time I filed a report in Columbus Georgia. My sons passenger door was still open while he was squealing past me.  In Georgia is was charge with Aggravated Assault, two weeks later he tried to back up over me again in Auburn, Alabama.  Lee County charged him with 'Reckless Endangerment'.
This ordeal is SO  unbelievable & long I'll just cut through the chase.
The DA's office in Georgia told me that I needed to go back to my first originall attorney in Georgia.  And expressed that I needed to do it NOW.  Under the circumstances I was embarresed (due to my addiction) and my then attorney was now a State Senator of Georgia.  Also I felt that I trusted my attorney, in Lee County, that I'd had since 1999 & trusted the justice system here in Lee County.  It was AWFULL my worst nightmare possible.
My son spoke with the Judge, Robert Harper & told him he feared his dad & was depressed & un happy living with him & He Begged the Judge please don't make him go back.  My ex's attorney, Theresa Dean, told my son if ""he told anyone he wanted to live with his mom, the Judge, Robert Harper, said he was going to put his mom, me in jail.""  They scared the HELL out of my child.  My son spoke with DHR, about the fears he had at his dads'.  His dad had put him on drugs for Sczophrenia (sp), which my son is NOT.  He has been diagnoised with with Mild ADHD problems, but would probably grow out of.  The medicine that my ex put him on was Resperdol, NEVER has this drug been used on anyone under 15 yr old.  And was not recommended for anyone under 25 yrs old.
My son told DHR, the Auburn Police Dept. and the Judge that his dad constantly would drink and drive, take him the concerts, (band parties) on school nites coming in at the wee hours of the morning.  But no one listened!  They just sent him back and took my visitation away from me.  I thought I was going to DIE.  This just didn't make since..  Crooked Crooked Crooked.
I found out that my divorce HAD NEVER been moved from Georgia to Alabama, at any time AND the Family Court in Columbus told me it could never be moved to any other state or county at any time anyway.
Yes, I went to my first attorney I hired in 1993, Seth Harp, now Georgia State Senator.  He was furious!  The judge in Columbus, Georgia signed an INSTANTOR, giving me instant custody mad as well you know.....  When the Sherriffs' Dept. went to pick up my son my ex RAN.  About an hour later, my attorney got a call from the Judge in Lee County, mad as a hornet.  Cussing him out telling him that he was going to put me in jail for Fraud.  Meaning going to the original state.  My attorney HIT the roof & told Judge Robert Harper to shut up & that he was the one who had broken the law, not his client.
Lord do I have a MESS do I need media coverage I'D BEGG for it.  Georgia claimed jurisdiction on this case & we go back to court Sept. 1 to review my visitation in the Lee County courts, who have no jurisdiction.  What's going to happen I don't know.  the judge in Georgia told me, my ex and his attorney that actually my ex didn't have legal custody of my son.  I've been to court so many times I can't count, money spent is up to over $20,000. 
I had to hire another attorney to go into court on Sept. 1, in Lee County, only paid her $500.00.  She's very nice and my attorney in Columbus has been in contact with her daily.  Ofcourse the judge in Lee county will find out Sept. 1 that Lee County has never had jurisdiction (at anytime)still doesn't have jurisdiction and when my ex was granted custody, my son was a resident of Florida.
What I have found out is, the four attorneys involved and the Judge have always known from the begining that Alabama has NEVER HAD jurisdiction on this case.  They have ALWAYS KNOWN what they were doing & I was the stupid one.
My mom of 73 yrs of age, is now filing for welfare, after working over 50 years.  She retired from Prudential after 25 years as the first female manager.  Took a few years off & went to work in Real Estate.  After 20 yrs there she retired she owns her own house & it was paid for.  Now with all these attorney fees  my mom & I are flat broke.  My car is 8 years old & paid for, with no heat / defrost, the power windows will not go up or down the motors' are broke.  $150 each to fix.  And it has over 145,000 miles on it.  I just hope it will hold up for another year.
Can anyone help

Mitzi Sears, was my moms' attorney, (we found out she never needed an attorney
The gaurdian at Lietum, lord only knows why
Theresa Dean, my ex's attorney the one who threatned my son & has lied to judges and taken me to court over 5 times when Lee County had no jurisdiction.

										In March 2004, I received a letter from JBC Legal Group stating they were collecting a bad check debt dated in 1995 for about $150, then a second letter came 30 days later for triple the amount.  I had no idea what check they were referring to, but I checked the statutes in my state. I knew legally they could not collect on a debt that was almost 9 years old when the SOL had expired.  I wrote them a cease and desist letter, and stated should they try to pursue the matter in court I would use the expired statute of limitations defense to have the case dismissed.
Six months later I recieve another letter.  This time it states they will reduce the amount I owe to half, and they will assist me in updating my credit report in regards to this debt.  I am not sure if it is on my credit, but I am going to check it.
I called and told them they were violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by contacting me because I sent a cease and desist letter.  Three times they hung up on me.  They were extremely rude and said this debt is not going away.  They said there were no statutes to prevent them contacting me at anytime.  
I should have known it was a scam when the collectors were extremely defensive and hung up on me.  I decided to do some research on the internet, and I found this website.
Now, I am not sure how they found out my current address.  It's been 9 years, and I have moved quite a few times because my husbands occupation demands it. They probaly obtained my current information illegally by checking my credit report.  All they need is a name and a social, which I am sure they got easily from obtaining old checks.
This company obviously violates the law for their convenience.

										Richard DeJana was untruthful to Judge Ted O. Lympus by concealing the fact that the boundary line which he disputed was established by survey and record in 1957.
Judge Ted O. Lympus ""establishes"" boundary line for Richard DeJana on March 10, 2000. in order to avoid an easement.
Richard DeJana refuses to participate in any sort of pretrial procedure, since he has colluded with Judge Ted O. Lympus.
After four years of ""litigation"" Richard DeJana extorts $5,000 USD out of State Farm Insurance in exchange for 800 square feet of land.
After cashing the check from State Farm Insurance, Richard DeJana decides that the defendants will receive a ""fee interest"" instead of clear title to the tiny sliver of land already paid for.
Defendants file disciplinary action against Richard DeJana, which causes all lawyers involved in this scheme to suddenly cooperate.

										October 22, 2000 I was the front seat passenger in a car accident.  Two friends of mine and I were heading down a street and were coming up to the corner of another street, I looked up and saw that there was a white vehicle with an elderly gentleman and his wife in the left lane (This was a 4 lane road with a left turn lane).  The elderly man was not in the oncoming Left turn lane and did not have a turn signal on, I looked down for a second and then back up and the man had turned left in front of the car I was in.  My friend who was driving tried to avoid their passenger side door (Due to the elderly woman being in it) and turned her wheel slightly.  We were driving about 45 MPH when we hit their car.  I was the only one with a seat belt on, the driver and the backseat passenger were both unbelted.  The backseat passenger had hit my head rest with his face.  Many passersby saw the accident and called 911.  I had no license or a car at the time of the accident.  I went to the hospital on a stretcher by ambulance due to being 2 months pregnant and not being able to breathe.  It was deduced that I had probably had hairline fractures on my ribcage that could not be seen by x-ray and my pregnancy seemed to be fine.  I was released with pain killers later that night and told to lie down and rest.  I was off work for a couple weeks.  The week after the accident I had an ultrasound appointment to see if everything was fine.  The Radiologist could not find the baby's heartbeat and so my doctor had another ultrasound scheduled the following week.  I also attended that appointment and again they found no heartbeat and determined that I had had a miscarriage and my body was unaware of it.  By Saturday of that week I had a DNC and that was the end of that.  It was a very painful time and I do not like having the reminder of it.
Geico Direct was my friend's insurance company.  The police had wrote the elderly gentleman a ticket for not using a turn signal, failure to yield for oncoming traffic and reckless driving (I believe).  I do know that the accident was caused by him according to me and all the witnesses that were there or saw the accident.  Geico Direct was courteous and paid all the claims as fast as possible.  However, one slipped past them, a paperwork screw-up.  
Fast forward about three years.  The insurance company thought the male backseat passenger was the driver (Also my roommate).  When in fact a female friend of mine was the driver and the person that was insured by Geico Direct.  It took a while for the screw-up to get fixed as I did not know that the bill for $50.00 hadn't been paid to the ambulance company.  It wasn't until a company called NCO Financial Systems Inc. began sending me collections notices that I realized it hadn't been paid.  Late 2003 I started getting bills from the company called NCO Financial Systems Inc. for the ambulence bill after I was able to get them to tell me what it was for.  I called Geico Direct and NCO Financial Systems on several occasions to get the situation cleared up.  NCO Financial Systems did not want to give the information to the insurance company that the insurance company needed to pay the claim.  NCO Financial Systems wanted information that the insurance company could not give them.  After playing phone tag between the two companies for a while, faxing them info (Because NCO Financial did not want to deal directly with the insurance company at that time and were absolutely rude every time I called, I was finally able to get them to send me paperwork to send to the insurance company (NCO claimed that they didn't have a fax machine), I had thought once again the claim was paid.  Then a company called JBC Legal Group, P.C. began sending me collections notices.  On numerous occasions I called them and Geico, sometimes up to three times in a day I had dealt with them.  JBC Legal Group, P.C. had very rude people answering the phone, sometimes yelling at me when I tried to explain what the problem was.  
By July 15, 2004 I had found out from Geico Direct that they had issued a check on 3/2/04 to NCO Financial Systems Inc. for $50.00, by 3/10/04 NCO Financial had endorsed the check, and by 3/12/04 the claim was paid according to Geico Direct.  I was able to get a check number and such when JBC Legal Group made the claim that ""The insurance company lied to you.  The claim was not paid.""  (Those were the person's exact words). That was after I gave the check number to the representative on the phone, after many more phone calls between Geico and JBC Legal Group, I was able to get Geico Direct to send me 2 copies of the endorsed check that NCO Financial Systems Inc. had received.  On September 25, 2004 I was told by JBC Legal Group that all I needed to do was fax them the copy of the check when I received it.  
On October 4, 2004 I had my father (Who has access to a fax machine) fax the copy of the check to the number JBC Legal Group gave to me for their fax with the proper Attn: to the supervisor and the proper account number upon the cover sheet for the fax.  On October 25, 2004 I was informed by my step mother that JBC Legal Group had called their house (I have not lived with my Dad since before 1999 and when the claim was filed for the accident I had the same phone number I have now.  I have no idea how they got my Dad's number to contact me).  I called JBC Legal Group back to find out what they wanted (Once again assuming that it was finally taken care of).  When I called the first woman I spoke to was rude, telling me that I hadn't paid the claim, when I told her that it was, she started to raise her voice and told me that no it hadn't because they never received a letter from NCO Financial.  I asserted myself finally after being cut off by the woman numerous times and told her that I had sent a fax to one of their people and if they were losing paperwork or NCO was losing paperwork that they had a huge problem.  She transferred me to the supervisor (The gentleman I put the fax Attention to).  I was told by him that he never received the fax, that it Was not forwarded to him and that I needed to refax the information to them.  
So on October 25, 2004 I had my father re-fax JBC Legal Group the copy of the endorsed check.  I tried to call them before closing to make sure it was received and was told I had to call back in the morning.  On October 26th 2004 I contacted NCO Financial and was told to fax them the copy of the endorsed check (Apparently they do have a fax machine).  On October 26th 2004 I also called JBC four times and was told they hadn't gotten the fax and the supervisor I was dealing with was not at his desk.  I am STILL trying to contact the guy after recieving a letter today (October 28, 2004) that is dated October 26, 2004 saying that I had made payment arrangements (I disputed this from day one of this ordeal because the insurance company was responsible for the bill) promised on 10/15/04 and that I failed to ""honor"" that obligation.  This is after MONTHS of telling them that the amount had been paid to the company they are servicing the account for!
I don't know for sure if this breaks any laws let alone what I should do about it.  I am to the point where I was thinking of  getting a lawyer, this situation being brought up repeatedly always stresses me out.  It is a constant reminder of what I lost at the time, I just want it over with.  It would also be nice if they weren't threatening to screw with my credit.  I want an apology letter from these Jerks!  I need advice or help or something!  Should I be getting a lawyer, send them a previously settled debt letter from http://www.debt-n-credit-letters.com/previously-settled-debt-letter.htm or just send them a scanned picture of my butt?  :)

Ellicott City, Maryland U.S.A. ",,720-422-6502,"Lisa Lyons Ward, Laura Pitts Williams ripoff attorney, lawyer, paralegal Ellicott City Maryland","
										In addition to the anonymous comment from Utah, Ms. Laura Pitts Williams, the Paralegal, who recruited clients for Lisa Lyons Ward, is also facing charges that are similarly situated to those of Ms. Ward.  Hence, both were arrested and jailed in Muscogee County (Ms. Ward on November 5 and Ms. Williams on November 8).  It seems as though these arrests are evidentiary.  
It's sad, although it is a common practice for Ms. Williams to refer to Ms. Ward as her friend knowing that she befriended Ms. Ward by telling lies and twisting the truth about clients she had recruited, and by overusing the phrase I to describe what she has done to help instead of hurt so many people.  Needless to say, those friends that were most true and honest to her have been deceived and hurt by her.  People were deceived by 
Ms. Williams as she led them to believe that the BLACKS IN GOVENMENT organization was filing a class action lawsuit, while at the same time she knew that a chapter of Blacks in Government did not exist in Phenix City, AL/Columbus, GA.  Yet, she took money from so-called members who paid dues, held fund raisers, etc.  How could it be that she was both the President and Treasurer of this so-call, non-existing chapter?  WHERE IS THE MONEY, Ms. Williams?  Was this part of the scam? 
As Ms. Ward's Paralegal, Ms.Williams told many that she was paid $75.00 per hour.  Now, the question is.how far is Ms. Williams willing to go for Ms. Ward?  Will she go to jail for her?  Is she willing to continue to lie for her to try and keep her out of jail?  Will she bend and twist the truth this time?  Will the recruitment stop?  Will she continue to be paid?  There is a money trail, however, money paid to Ms. Ward/Williams for which no services were rendered.  
There is a money trail.  To one client there is a loss of $12,000; to another $5.000, to another $13,000, and to at least 21or more additional good people in this area alone, there is a loss of $1500.00 each in retainer fees.  THESE ARE FACTS.  Let's not mention the airline tickets purchased for Ms. Ward in which she failed to appear at said hearings; tickets that she later used for her own personal use and convenience.     
Ms. Laura Pitts Williams stated that she will not disassociate herself from Ms. Ward. She really can't.  She stated that she received calls for Ms. Ward and relayed messages to clients.  Why?  Is it because of a $500 payment to her from the top of each retainer fee? Or, was it the additional amenities of a computer, fax machine, or combination of it all.
I guess on that note, it would be very difficult to disassociate from Ms. Ward; maybe they will have side by side jail cells.

										Cambece Law Firm has been calling my parents for the last 2 months (nearly every day).  They are looking for me in an attempt to collect a debt to the tune of $4,812.  I haven't lived with my parents in 4 years and am very easy to find in the phone book, however they keep on calling.  
I have called them directly where I have given my contact information to two different people.  The very first time I called I was answered with a ""Yeah, what's up?""  Not that this has anything to do with the crux of the problem, but it just indicates the type of people employed by this SUPPOSED law firm.  After speaking to this man, I was then transfered to some type of supervisor who was not only rude, but also compeletely ignorant of the law.
She ranted and raved at me about how I owe this debt and I must pay it in its entirety or they will sue me and take me to court.  I told her that it was impossible for me to get this type of money.  Her rebuttal to that was that I need to ask my family for the money.  What a joke!  I told her that under no circumstances would I ask my family for money that THEY do not owe.  This was followed up by a deluge of complete lies.  She told me that if I did not pay this money immediately, I would lose my job, I would never (as in NEVER) be able to purchase a home, get a car, or be allowed to enroll in college.  The rediculousness of her assertations nearly caused me to laugh because I know this information is not true.  I again told her that it was impossible for me to pay this money in a lump sum and tried to offer to make monthly payments.  This still was not satisfactory.  She told me that she would recommend to her company that they take me to court.  Frankly, I could care less because you can't ""flog a dead horse.""  Before I hung up with this woman I specifically asked if she and her cronies would cease their consistant harrasment of my parents and was told that since they have my contact information now, they would not receive any more calls.
Guess what, they lied!  Since my conversation with these supposed professionals my family has continued to receive calls daily.  I am at my wits end!  I wish I could take THEM to court.  My parents are contacting the Better Business Bureau and the FCC.

										Re:  Sully Station Community Association, Account Number 1952834.00
We have received a number of threatening letters from agents of Rees, Broome & Diaz, for payment of association dues we do not owe. Recently we have been advised that a lien has been placed on our property for failure to pay these attorneys $1,012 in principle, and fees not owed.  
This is the most horrible of home owner abuses by Associations -the collection of legal fees in the thousands of dollars.  Legal fees that dwarf the size of the original dispute. 
Background:
On February 11, 2002, Rory K. Nugent, acting as the agent for Rees, Broome, and Diaz sent us a letter saying that we owned $ 198.47 in principal, no interest and $ 701.00, in fees for a total outstanding amount of $ 899.47, for a home owners fee that we had paid. 
In addition, Nugent reported that he sent notice of collection to major credit bureaus and threatens to use any information that he receives from us against us in further actions.  
On February 27, 2002, we received a bill from Armstrong Management Services Inc. for $164.62 in general assessment fees, $20.00 in late fees, $58.15 in legal fees, and $23.85 in town home assessments for a total of $266.62, to the Sully Station Community Association. 
My wife called Armstrong and spoke with a Mrs. North. They agreed that this debt would be paid in two payments: one for $135.00 and another for $131.62. Copies of payment checks are available. 
In addition we arranged for Armstrong to take further fees electronically from our banking account. And that is how we have paid Association monthly fees since that time.  
On July 30, 2002, we again received a threatening letter from Nugent. This time asking for $30 in principal and $707.00 in fees, for a total of $737.00 and he said that your firm continues to report this as a credit action to major credit bureaus.  
On   March 26, 2003, Rees, Broome & Diaz, again attempted to extort funds from us.  This time we received a letter from Terri Thompson, of your firm. This time she wanted $50 in principal and $870.50 in fees for a total amount of $920.50. Again she reports that your firm is reporting this as a credit action. 
And in October 29, 2003, we again received threatening letters from Rees, Broome and Diaz asking for $110 in principle, and $902. in fees for a total of $1,012, and as mentioned, we recently determined that a lien has been placed on our property.   
Of course we received the same threats in 2004. 
However, we do not owe Rees, Broome and Diaz, Armstrong Management Services or the Sully Station Communication Association anything. All issues concerning back payments and a method for future payments were resolved in February and March of 2002.  
It is my believe that this judgment, falls within the most horrible of home owner abuses by Associations  - the collection of legal fees in the thousands of dollars.  Legal fees that dwarf the size of the original dispute.  My research suggests, that the average HOA foreclosure involves less than $1,000 in dispute. The average legal fees awarded exceed $1,000, which is the situation we find ourselves in. 
Further, cases are frequently reported in the media in which a few hundred dollars in late dues turns into thousands of dollars of legal fees and results in the loss of a home. Where these situations exist, they often result from the undemocratic actions of the Association, and their general manager.
Further, we have not had a positive experience with Fred J. Pinciaro, the Association's General Manager, and I suspect that this current problem is directly associated with his failure to properly track association payments, follow through on actions submitted to Armstrong Management Services, and clear issue in a timely manner with Rees, Broome, and Diaz. 
However,if Pinciaro, does track these situations to avoid HOA abuses, I suspect that he did not do so in our case. Our history with Pinciaro goes back a few years, when we complained about the operations of an unsanctioned business in our neighborhood and further complained when he ordered the butchering of a pine tree in the area adjoining our yard, which we believe is actually on our property.
At this moment, I am greatly concerned, not only about the lien, but about what appears to be a horrendous abuse of homeowners by the Association. 
Year after year I have asked the Rees, Broome, Diaz, the Sully Station Association and the Management Assocation to resolve this issue, but it is continually ignored.  
All we ask is that the HOA send us a letter reporting that the fees had been paid years ago, and report the same to the Credit Bureau and Rees, Broome, Diaz, and the Management Association. 
  But, of course there is no incentive to resolve an issue, when home owner associations can freely conspire with attorneys to extort money from home owners.

										I needed some kind of lawyer representation for my medical disability from military service. I contacted the prepaid lawyer Inc. and the rep responded quite quickly (I can see why...$$$) and she began to explain how the whole scam works. You pay a $35/mo + 10 for initial startup for access to lawyer services. It was explained that the service was exclusive to members who'd have complete access to legal attorneys and their services. So after I and my wife were told about how easy and great this was, we joined thinking we'd have a legal leg to stand on in times of need. WRONG!
She gave my the phone number to my lawyer and asked me to talk to him. I did. But what I received was a disrespectful attorney who rather than try to get something going, tried to dissuade me from continuing my probable lawsuit. WTF!?! anyhow, I hung up and sometime later, my wife finds prepaid legal Inc. splattered all over ripoffreport.com! imagine my suprise upon hearing hearing what I just went through in those posts.
So I called their national 1-800 number and the rep told me that they had already sent my  bank the deduction request and that I had to fill out a cacellation form to quit my service..what horsesh*t! I verified my name and address already over the phone! So she also stated legally they had 15-60 days to return my refund! well I got a great idea for them! go shove their business in their a**!
DO NOT deal with them, my wife and I have now stated that before we buy anything or service from ANY company, while on the phone, we will check immediately online here to see if they suck etc... BEWARE!

										Before Cambece Law firm I had never encountered a collection agency.  I had lived alone for two years and had never lived with my brother so it was quite a shock when he told me that a collection agency had called HIM and said that I owed a massive amount (2,000 dollars)of money and that if I didn't pay up they would take me to court.  I hadn't a clue what it was for.  For awhile, I figured it was a scam and let it go, but then a woman from the Cambece law firm called my brother up and left a message that said,
""You fools.  You think you can get a way with not paying well Melissa you're in for it now.  We'll see you in court.""
I was scared, shocked and angry.  So, first I called them and asked politely; ""what are these charges for and from.""  I had NEVER done business with them so I knew it had to be something else.  A man told me, ""Melissa don't call here unless you're going to pay.  We're not playing your game.  You had plenty of time to dispute the charges.""
I asked him if I could see something I signed to figure out what this confusion was about.  I didn't want to go to court.  He then told me that I had 30 days my time was up and to either pay up or shut up!!  Then he hung up on me.  
That's when I started investigating the company.  Thank God for BUD HIBBS!!!!  He saved me.  He is an angel, there isn't a doubt in my mind.  I researched the 'law firm' and saw that they had done this to plenty of other people.  I took Hibbs advice and sent them a cease communications letter and after a little while they finally left me alone.
They now have other collection agencies calling me who have bought the debt but as soon as I tell them that I'm sending a cease communication letter, they leave me alone.
My credit report is in peril, because of this nonsense that I'm still not sure what its for because each collection agency is writing negatives, but come January I'm taking my credit report disputing every one of them and having them PERMENENTLY removed!!!
I can't thank Bud Hibbs enough.  I was anxious, and fearful and didn't know anything about the law and without taking money or charging a fee he helped me more than I could ever say.  He emailed me back and offers all this information free of charge!

Bloomfield, New Jersey U.S.A. ",,765-644-6663,"JBC Legal Group, JBC & Associates, Outsource Recovery Management ripoff illegal collections fraud fabricated debts deceptive practices attorneys and lawyers Bloomfield New Jersey","
										Now... this hopefully will help a lot of people regarding this crooked corporation collectively known as JBC LEGAL GROUP.  Granted, the ""legal division"" of this ""firm"" does have several licensed attorneys in it.  This is where their professionalism ends.
JBC & Associates placed on my credit report two ""debts"" in the amounts of $112.00 and $136.00.  These go back to May 2004 collectively.  After doing research on my own accord, and prior to contacting this company, I found they are in the business of collecting on dishonored checks.  This is where many flags set off for me as I did not have a checking account for three years prior to this time.  When I called them, I got JBC Legal Group - - not the independent arm of JBC & Associates, which if you check their telephone number using a reverse search, you get that it is Outsource Recovery Management.
Upon the call with them, I found they have two outstanding checks from ... get this .. 1997.  Tehy told me the checks totalled approximately $986.86.  I have been a certified paralegal for the past six years, and know full-well they can no longer collect nor report on these checks, and told them so.  I also politely asked for the information which I was seeking, being these two checks in the amounts of $112.00 and $136.00.  They said they show no information on these checks, and that all of their information isnt in their computers yet.  (Now, if the agency is able to have enough information to know that it is past the 30 day period allowed by law under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), found at ____________________________, to report it to the credit bureaus, then they must also know the debt, when it was due, etc.; which they cannot provide for me.
Now I am getting furious because they are giving me the runaround, and they transfer me to a supervisor.  Shetells me that this is a true debt and they have only the information they gave me and that they dont report information to the credit bureaus; that their client may but they dont themselves.  I explained it is showing under their name, and she said I must be mistaken because they don't do it.  (Hmmm... then what is it doing there?!?!?!?!  And I think I can read four short words like JBC & Assoc., Bloomfield, NJ if I can sit down and read avidly US Supreme Court opinions!)
So now I am suing them in the US District Court, utilizing every last right I have under all Federal Laws, waiving any right by State since I will get further with Federal Law.  Additioanlly, since they use interstate mail, they are not only breaking the Federal Consumer Credit Protection laws, but they are also commiting mail fraud.... a much much more serious offense.  As a result, I am also forwarding a courtesy copy of the lawsuit to the Postal Inspector General for his own records and informations o he is aware of what it is this company is doing to the general public.
Dont put up with their tactics or be intimidated.  If statutes of limitations have passed, they cant doa  thing ... also don't let your rights as a consumer be compromised.  It is companies like this that make things so hard in such times as we are in!

										I had a Fingerhut account years ago that I failed to pay at the time. Then about two years ago I paid off my balance and everything was okay. 
A few weeks ago I get a letter from the Law Offices of Mitchell N. Kay stating that I owe $374.54 to Fingerhut and that if I dispute this debt I am to write them within 30 days of the date of the letter. So I typed out a letter asking them to mail me proof that I still owe this debt. I told them that if they can produce proof of the debt for me, I will make the necessary arrangements to pay off the money I owe. But if they cannot find proof of this debt, to please remove my account from their files ASAP. 
I just recieved their reply. They agreed to close my account info from their files. So I guess they could not find proof of my debt. 
I just want to warn others, if you recieve a letter from Law Offices of Mitchell N. Kay about a Fingerhut debt you know you paid off or never even had, exercise your legal rights and request proof of your debt in writing to them within 30 days. That is very important! If you fail to do that then you might be putting yourself in a very bad position later on legally. So make it easier on yourself and take 10 minutes out of your day to request proof. Make photocopies of all corrospondance between you and the law office as well. I personally have made a few photocopies of the first letter they mailed me, the request letter I mailed them, and the final letter they sent to me recently.

RINGGOLD, GeorgiaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish you file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has  been  more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you  properly at the 800 # , and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/comptroller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										In November of 1998 I contacted Edo Burstyn regarding a summary dissolution of a 2 year marriage. My ex was a French National, and though I am an American I am living in Australia. Edo seemed to be the best choice after speaking with him on the phone.
After mailing him a postal money order for over $600.00AUS I received all the paperwork required as did my wife in France. I have to date 13 emails form Edo at different email addresses (edo@themall.net, edo@burstyn.com, edob@pacbell.net) stating that he would be in court and that everything would be taken care of.
He NEVER once filed any papers with the courts. He continued to change address, email and phone numbers. I spoke with him several times on the phone and all he suggested was that I fly to LA to speak to him face to face if I didn't believe him.
I called the Better Business Bureau to complain and gave them everything they asked for. All they could do was send him some letters and if he didn't reply they had no authority to do anything. I called the District Attorney in LA as well as a Judge. This was just more of a waste of time that I believe he was well aware of in that no one was willing to do anything about this crook!
I don't know how a person like this can continue to get away with this sort of behaviour and I am happy that there are other people that feel the same way I do. Someone please get this guy!!

CLICK HERE to see how other consumers were victimized by the BBB's false or misleading information. Don't be fooled! It has been reported, when there are thousands of complaints and other investigations underway by authorities, the BBB has no choice but to finally give an UNsatisfactory rating to a BBB member business that is paying the BBB big membership fees every year. When a business is reported that is NOT a BBB member, BBB files WILL more likely show an UNsatisfactory rating, then reportedly shake down that company to become a member of the BBB. One positive thing about the BBB is, either way, if a business has an unsatisfactory rating with the BBB, you can be sure, the business is bad. But what about all those BBB member businesses that had complaints filed against them? Consumers never get to hear about them. What about the BBB advertising to the public?

										Like most of you, I happened across this firm while reading a case against the Postal Service. I should have taken a clue from the case I read, but I contacted them anyway. Some years earlier, I had been fired from the Postal Service and without benefit of counsel, won my own EEO case and got reinstated. I was awarded attorney fees and court costs and was scheduled for a compensatory damages hearing.All I needed these men for was to prosecute the compensatory damages case, at the time. Later, because they proved to be so ineffective, I was denied the benefits of my 6 years of back-seniority, the use of my almost 8 months of sick leave, and was, ultimately fired again. The ONLY thing that saved me was MY OWN, PERSONAL efforts at getting a disability retirement.Mr. Snider and Mr. Fischer both spoke with me at length (recruited might be a better word..) since they knew I had a large back-pay award on the way. First check, after taxes, was just over $100,000.00. the second was an interest check for $58,000.00. Both KNEW I had this on the way and went to great lengths to assure me that, even they they would not and could not insure I would win compensatory damages of any kind, that I WOULD, WITHOUT ANY DOUBT, GET ALL MY ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS, based on the award, in hand.Days later, I got the $100,000.00 check and Mr. Fischer promptly told me I owed him $35,000.00 as a ""retainer"". I wired this money as instructed. I was then made to spend hours and hours on the phone with Mr. Fischer, who put me on hold regularly to visit with people in the office and still billed me for the time. I went along for the most part with the questions, but found myself continuously having to instruct Mr. Fischer in the law. I also got the distinct impression that he was doing all he could to run up a bill in the short time we had until the hearing was scheduled.Many, many days of this sort of thing transpired, including questioning my psychologist, who would form the centerpiece of my claim for damages.To shorten this part of the story I will simply say that my attorney was supposed to be in control of this case and yet he failed and refused to have my ""expert witness"" provide discovery documents. This resulted in my main witness being sanctioned and her testimony sticken. Everything collapsed from there. Further, he attempted on the day of the hearing to serve documents supported the marital discord I had experienced at the hands of the Postal Service, on the day of the trial.He was about 30 minutes late for the hearing. We had to recess for 2 hours for him to return to his room for documents. He was late for the after lunch portion. He missed several deadlines during discovery and during the appellate phase.After paying them $35,000.00 and paying my expert witness about $10,000.00 only to have her testimony striken, I was handed my hat by this Judge who's level of dislike for me was only rivaled by his disdain for the unprofessional manner and conduct of my attorney (Mr. Fischer).When the ""award"" came, and the attorney fees and costs were not reimbursed, I threw good money after bad and listened, again, while being lied to by both these men. Again, they assured me I would recover the fees and costs and this time, they went on to say that disallowing the psychologist was judicial misconduct which would certainly be reversed on appeal.Again, out of desperation, and having already thrown tens of thousands of dollars down this black hole of a case, I listend to, and again bought, their bullshit lies.BY this time, September of 2003, the Postal Service was feeling good enough about kicking these chumps to the curb that they tried again to fire me, for something that happened 3 years earlier (not allowed, but that didn't matter). Alone (and I mean COMPLETELY WITHOUT HELP FROM THESE LAWYERS) I won my own retirement, first from OPM, then from Social Security. Meanwhile, the Postal Service got another EEO from me for forcing me into retirement.Guess what? These two say another chance to take money from me and they took $20,000.00 this time, knowing that they would be facing the Postal Service and the APWU. They assured me they would prosecute the matter to the extent possible. Of course, after they spent over half of what I had given them this time, the decided that I (you got it..I..the guy on disability retirement for PTSD and chronic depression) had to file MY OWN CASE in Federal Court. Even while they failed and refused to represent me as agreed, and while Mr. Fischer refused to even make a telephone call to the Union guy we needed to talk to, he scheduled depositions for half a dozen people at the Post Office, who could not possibly help my case. In fact, all this did was spend more of my money on nothing. They further absolutely refused to sue the APWU in order to get a subpoena to depose witnesses and produce documents, without which, winning would be impossible.They failed me, again, at a critical time and this time, I had no choice but to fire them. Of course, no witnesses, no case. Screwed again by Morris Fischer. Mr. Snider acts like he was not involved, but, the way I see it, this is his firm, too.I waited until now to file this report because I wanted to give them the fullest possible benefit of any doubt. Now there is no doubt.. Hence..NO BENEFIT.Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from the EEOC and these imcompetent, lying #@%@$#@ers.I have reminded these men that their word has to mean something, even if their talents fall short. I mean, even LAWYERS have to tell the truth sometimes.I was fully prepared to not prevail on compensatory damages. I was not, however, prepared for the complete ass-f***ing I got from these men who pretend to know the law, did not even PRETEND to try in my cases, and purport to represent others for a living who are victims of discrimination.Possibly, your experience will not be as bad as mine, but then pigs might fly out of my ass tomorrow. You never know. I went through a lot of Hell (7 years worth) to earn my own back pay award. I would not have turned any of it over to these men for less than their fullest assurances that I would at least get back my attorney fees and costs, in line with an award I had already gotten without their help.I spent way more than this, but I want $60,000.00 of this shit back. I ought to charge them points for holding my month for over 18 months, but I won't.Right now, I just want my money back from these liars .God help you if you do not bring a separate attorney with you to sign any sort of contract with them.Do yourself a favor, call the local Bar Association and find someone who just got their number. SOMEONE WANTS your business enough to NOT LIE to you and work like it matters to them.God knows, their WORD is not worth a damn.Thomas

On 11/22/2004 the collection attorney garnished my bank account at Bank of America. There was never a judgment against me in COWETA SUPERIOR COURT. However, this slick attorney went to FULTON STATE COURT in Atlanta and got a Summons of Garnishment and served it to Bank of America which immediately froze my account. The very next morning I was at my branch office in Newnan demanding that they release the garnishment of my SS disability check because it was exempt from garishment. My branch office called the legal processing department at Bank of America in College Park and they refused saying that they had a court order for the garnishment.  
I wrote a letter to the Macey, Wilensky (collection attorney) demanding that they dismiss the garnishment
immediately because they never got a judgment against me, I also hand delivered a copy to Coweta Superior Court and Fulton State Court and faxed a copy to Bank of America's legal processing department. Bank of America called Coweta Superior Court and found that the case was stilling pending and no judgment had been issued against me, within the next 3 days the garnishment had been dismissed.
Bank of America refused to refund the $75 bank processing fee and $66 in overdraft fees after I contacted them 3 times. I finally ask GA Legal Services to assist me with Bank of America and they wrote a letter explaining that my SS disability check is exempt from garnishment so they must refund $141 to my check account or I would sue to get that money back. The bank put that money back into my account.  
My garishment is now dismissed and Bank of America finally repaid me for the garnishment fee & overdraft fees. But I am not finished with that collection attorney or Bank of America, I plan to sue both of them for what they put me through.

										I, unlike many others on this message board, I DID have a credit accont with the now defunct Fingerhut.  I was laid off from my job of 18 years and went back to college, thus not paying my account as desired.  I had informed them that I was returning to college so that I could land a good paying job and begin paying my bills.  Long story short, they ""sold"" my account to Jefferson Capital, LLC and from there the story gets worse.  I received some mail from my bank yesterday stating that Jefferson Capital LLC now was a judgement against me and has issued a restraining order for my bank account.  First, I thought that in the credit world, one must be personally served in order for a judgement to be sound.  Second, if they hold my bank account ( which really irks the hell out of me since I just started working ), how is this legal?  It's not as though I am raking in the dough with my job - I just started.  I realize that I did not pay according to what Fingerhut would've liked, but most people don't plan on being laid off either.  In addition, my last bill that I have from them states the balance in the vicinity of $1100.  The judgement, which my bank sent me a copy of, indicates that they are holding me responsible for $2358.99.  Where did THAT come from?  Anyone who knows how to get this lawfirm to remove this ""hold"" on my bank accounts - please let me know.

										This so called officer of the Court stole child support monies which he was supposed to him to give to his client. He then attempted to cover this up by filing a false affidavit with the Support Enforcement Division and the Court making claim I never paid child support for nearly 2 years. After an investigation by the Child Support Division, they determined the affidavit he filed and signed was a fraudlent. I have a letter from them stating as such.
During this time while he was stealing child support money, he coericed my then wife into signing an illegal fraudlent open- ended mortgage over to him, because he apperantly never gave her the support monies he was supposed too. While lieing to Judge after Judge that such a mortgage exisited, he secretly subverted the Judge's Order and cashed in on the mortgage for over $150,000, signing the closing statements himself. Bringing a collection of fees of over $270,000, including the stolen child support monies as per his own affidavit. 
In a self serving effort to conceal his fraud, France kept filing hideous and disgusting motions to the Courts saying I was ""harmful to my children"". That it was I forcing them out of the home, however ultimatly he was the one who had motive and made profit from this. 
What a thief and scumbag......one other victim I came in contact with wrote me and said ""Todd, please keep me informed. I hope he gets what he deserves. He is a miserable son of a bitch and he will never stop doing what he does because he is so consumed by his anger and hate. He's sick and needs to be disbarred before he hurts more people.

Tax Defenders,"  Tax Defenders  5100 N. Ravenswood 
Chicago, Illinois U.S.A. ",,800-241-1510,The Tax Defenders ripoff Chicago Illinois,"
										I received a mailing from Tax Defenders after a lein was processed due to some back tax issues.  These tax problems were from a previous marriage, and my  spouse was deceased.  I am assuming they subscribe somehow to receive notice of all leins  placed by the IRS in Illinois.
After a lengthy phone conversation with one of their representatives or analyst as she was called by their firm, checking out the attorney's credentials, the accountant's credentials, and the Better Business Bureau, we decided to retain their services.  There was nothing contradictory anywhere about this firm.  Also, they faxed me a copy of their guarantee.
Their bottom line guarantee was your money back if not satisfied.  However, the also promised  to investigate and research your tax problem.  They compiled all the tax information and then would make a suggestion as to the best way to handle the situation.  The initial fee was $500.00.  The fee was the initial payment due upon them taking your case.  This would contract them to investigate your particular case, stop any collection activity (leins, levies) that may be in place and prevent any from taking place until such a time a payment arrangement could take place.  They also filed for Power of Attorney for your tax issues.  
Not only did I recieve this guarantee on paper, but multiple times during my initial conversation with their analyst, I was told I need their services in order to protect my income.  I hade filed for social security disability and was due for those check to start.  I had been injured and had been unable to work for nearly two years. I had been working with the IRS until I retained the Tax Defenders in February.  There had not been any collection activity on the taxes, they were placed in a ""do not collect"" status until such a time a resolution could be reached.  
However, each time I called the IRS I spoke with a different representative which made it difficult, to say the least, as far as continuity, and each time I had to start from the beginning.  It was all so confusing. I was remarried and my present husband's tax refunds were being held and applied to my back tax bill.  I did not have a clear understanding of what and how much was owed and it seemed hopeless trying to get that information.  When calling the IRS, they only wanted to discuss how I could pay for it and when.  Once again, explaining this to the analyst, she said another reason you need our services.  We have one to one contact with someone at the IRS.  Our attorney will negotiate a resolution to your problem for you.  
Before we do anything, we will contact you, discuss our recommendations, and when you okay it,we will proceed with a resolution plan.  So, the intial $500. was paid, and they were to file POA for taxes, any and all collection activity and threats would be halted, all contact and correspondence was to go through the tax defenders, they would develop a resolution plan, and I was to sit back and let them handle it.  
They would be contacting me again in a month or so.  Their analyst reinforced the fact that I no longer needed to worry about this matter again....they would handle it all and be sure that I was protected from any legal or collection repercussions.  
Over the next several months, until about September, I had little contact from them, although I did email or call on several occassions to get an update on the case. Most of those communication attempts were ignored, except I believe once I was called and told they had not reached a decision as to the best plan for me, and it often took time, so to sit tight and they would be getting in contact with me as soon as they had put that plan together. As time went by it became more and more difficult to reach ""my analyst"" or the attorney handling my case.
I did forget to add, that the initial agreement was when they once reached a resolution plan, which most likely she believed would be an ""offer and compromise"", there would be an additional fee of $1200. plus whatever amount was agreed upon to the IRS.  I inquired about the ability to pay that monthly as most likely we would be unable to come up with the entire amount all at one time.  She said that would not be a problem and we would also be able to do the same with the IRS.
Okay, so now it is early October, and I received a letter from the IRS which was an intent to levy my social security disability checks.  I called the Tax Defenders, and not unlike the past couple of months of unanswered emails and phone calls, it was nearly impossible to reach someone working on my case.  After multiple attempts, and many promises of having the analyst return my call, I finally received a call from their  (The Tax Defender's) financial person.  She at that time was wanting to make arrangements to pay the $1700. for the offer and compromise  they had determined would be the best resolution plan.  I explained to her that I was waiting for a call from the analyst, and had been for several days, and did not know anything for sure about the ""offer and compromise"" or its terms, therefore I was not paying anything until I spoke with the analyst or the attorney about what exactly was going on.  I also told her my concerns about failed responses and promises to return calls, and the letter I had received from the IRS regarding their intent to levy my income.  
She continued to avoid putting me in contact with anyone and continued to try to make the financial arrangements.  It was not until I became unreasonable and rather irritated to say the least that miracuously, she was able to put me in touch with the analyst.  She half heartedly apologized that I did not know about the resolution plan and said it had been ready for some time and she had no idea why no one had contacted me.  I told her about my many attempts at emails and phone calls, and even faxes to get someone to call me over the summer and fall and she again apologized.  
I explained that that in itself was making me feel very insecure about them and also she had told me that the fee would be $1200 and I had that in writing.  She said, well if that is what I told you, then we will honor that.  I then told her about the letter from the IRS and she reassured me numerous times that it was a computer generated letter and she is sure it went out in error.  However, she would have the paralegal check on it, but for me not to worry, that it would not happen, as they have my POA for taxes and they as promised, had me protected.  I also explained her financial person was wanting a lump sum payment and she had told me monthly payments would be allowed.  The analyst once again, said that a monthly payment schedule could be arranged.  I asked that she contact me with the findings of the income levy and then to put me back with her financial department.  She attempted that and told me she was busy and unable to take my call, but she would return my call.  
Needless to say, I never heard from anyone again, but the first of December came and sure enough, my social security check had been levied two hundred and twelve dollars.  I was beside myself and once again started attempts to contact the Tax Defenders.  After numerous attempts to contact either the analyst or the attorney, while sending intermittant emails, I finally was told by a secretary that I needed to make an appointment with my attorney. She told me that was the only person I should be talking with and set up a ""telephone appointment"" for the following morning at 7:30 am.  Once again, no call and I continued to call every couple of hours until noon, each time being told he was being delayed, but I was next on his list to call and he would be calling.  At 5:30pm I received a call from their financial person once again.  I was irrate to say the least and told her I was not agreeing to pay another cent until I spoke with someone.  I explained the situation with the income levy, the failure of the attorney to keep our appointment, and I wanted some answers as to why the levy had occured and an explanation for the inability to speak with someone to discuss my case.  Of course neither the attorney or the analyst was available at that time to speak with me.  This time, she said I could make payments, but nothing would be done with my case until it was paid in full and therefore they would not stop the levy.  I ranted about the levy and how it was never to have taken place per their guarantee from day one and it was the fact that the IRS had not received any response or contact over the past 8 months that it happened to begin with.  
I explained that I was concerned about what if anything other than a look into our taxes had been done since the beginning and I would be a complete idiot, although I was feeling pretty foolish for falling for it all now, but I would have to be totally stupid to agree to pay them one dime at this time.  I was still willing or actually wanting an explanation and she continued to refuse to put me in contact with the attorney.  I told her I was furious that he blew me off that morning and she did not even attempt to apologize for that, but kept referring back to the need to pay.  After it was obvious I was not giving in until I had spoken with someone, which by this time I had already decided I was done with them, she put me on hold and then came back to tell me she had spoken to my attorney, and he said it sounded as if I wasn't happy and perhaps I would like a refund.  I told her you bet I do!!!!  
Now, they did promptly refund my money.  However, that is not compensation for the deterioration of my situation over the 10 months they were handling things.  I did file a complaint with the BBB and the attorney general, but of course because they refunded my initial payment as promised in their guarantee, the case was pretty much cut and dry. Their guarnatee promised alot of things beside the refund of initial payment, but no way to collect on promised not kept. I of course cannot afford to litigate this, and more than likely it would be a case of he said she said.  
The attorney's response to the attorney general was sent to me and it basically said I was a very difficult person to work with and the reason the levy was allowed to happen, was that it was obvious I had no intentions of paying.  While his response was not chronologically correct, nor were the events that led up to my refusal to pay discussed, he felt they had done all that they had promised and it was my failure that things evolved as they did.  It still amazes me, the solicited my business through their mailing, something I had not even entertained until I received that.  I had never thought about having someone intervene for me, but was frustrated by my inability to get clear cut answers when calling the IRS
You know, I have taken things back in my own hands, and have had to start the entire process of many calls to the IRS to try and dig through these past tax issues.  I not only did not have the ability to pay them in a lump sum, but I was not certain I owed them or at least the amount.  Very exacerbated, I spoke with an IRS rep, told him the entire story, and he was willing to spend the time looking things up and going back in my records and was able to explain exactly what was owed and a total.  An amiable agreement was reached to repay those taxes and I still wonder what the issue was with the Tax Defenders.
I just feel it is very important to warn the public.  
I was confused and overwhelmed by the lack of continuity and being told something different every time I called the IRS.  In a moment of weakness that post card arrived promising and guaranteeing they could resolve everything for me.  I fell for it and the consequences were not pleasant.  I feel they prey on people in trouble, scared, confused, and challenged as far as understanding the entire tax issues and processes.  I was at their mercy and they took advantage of it and then turned it around to look like it was me that was unreasonable and a dead beat not wanting to pay.  After all, I owed money to the IRS, so I guess that made me irresponsible for my debts.  I am telling you folks, it is quite the contrary.  It was out of my desire to resolve things, that I got caught up in this scam.

										I hired a Pre-Paid Legal firm to handle a bankruptcy for me. They told the their fee for this action was 600 to 800.00 so since I beling to the service I might get better service here. I hired them and suddenly the retainer becomes $944.00 total after I had sent them a check for $105.00 to look at my information. Well the other lawyer didnt raise his price buy once again, Oh, well.
We came to a point where I got a lump sum of money that had to be spent down or lose it so we put the action on hold. Months later we started again but suddenly I'm getting monthly bills. Well, admittadly, I was stupid and paid them till I got one for the Court Fees that I already paid. So obvious as the rip off is at this point, I go back and realise that I have paid an additional $500.00 to them and they are asking for another $250.00; this is paying twice... crooks. Mind you this is at a 25% discount (ha, ha).
The good news is that a Bankruptcy action is virtually a commodity these days and in m y city you can get one all day for 800.00 to 1,000.00. By my calculatons, that means I should be paying 600 to 800.00 for this. Hmmmm.
I demanded a refund of the $688.00 overpayment from both Pre-Paid Legal and the Law Firm. I mentioned that either their advertising is plain and simply a lie or the lawyer is overcharging and I think that's fraud and since that bill was mailed to me, it's mail fraud. Just a little encouragement to refund my money.
Also, a friend is in jail this same week and asked me to  call the Pre-Paid Lawyers for him. The law firm siad he will have to call himself and they wont accept a collet call and wont even start defending him till he pays them their retainer. Needles to say since he couldnt reach into his Jail House Issue overalls and pull out his wallet stuffed with thousand dollar bills, he's still in jail and hjoping on the skills of a public defender.
So dont believe them when they say Pre-Paid Legal protects you and provides legal representation to the middle class. What they really are is like your gynicologist raping you and Pre-Paid is the conduit to the doctors office.
I'm now disabled, unable to work and cant afford to get my bankruptcy since these lawyers stole my money.

Had me do all the talking-never asked me any questions or supply the very important information to the case to the panel review board--could tell he was out of his element--requested the money owed me back and I was denied -- plus he had the nerve to bill me for more money.  
Stated if we had to go to court again he would need more money $1000-1500 to prepare the case. I told him this should have already been done--I feel like a sugar client I paid for his lunches and dinners out for the next Month.

										I hired Mr. Politzer to represent us at a Zoning Appeals hearing for a 6ft. Fence Variance. He wanted $1000.00 upfront which we paid.  Mr. Politzer never gave the Appeals Board very important information regarding our case.
He question the defendant only 3 times, when the board told him that wasn't what they were looking for.  He sat down.( I told him several times before the hearing they are looking for the test of uniquness (Cromwell Law).which the fence didn't meet. we are still waiting on a final decision in June. I supplied him with everything he needed the survey, pictures and signatures opposing the Fence, which is also on our property. He never questioned me nor did he give the signatures to the board. 
When I questioned him-he stated that wasn't relevant to the case- I told him it was very relevant and what wasn't relevant was his questions to the defendant. He also stated that if this went to court that I would have to give him 1500.00 to prepare the case--which I responded this should have already been done for this hearing, that tells you how money hungry this lawyer is and how he must think ppl. are stupid-I learned the first time with him there won't be a second.  
I requested some of my money back only to have him bill me for more.  He didn't do anything but take my money.,
I'm also writing to the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland-that's how angry I am--I want justice!!!!!! so they can investigate this. Just because someone is a lawyer doesn't give them the right to RIP-OFF ppl.

Chrysler stated that gas milage was not a warranty item and the stated gas milage on the window sticker means nothing, kind of a surprise to me. Said car did get good gas milage until the fuel sending unit was replaced after that it was down hill, first 16 mpg then by the time I went to court it was getting 14.10 mpg. First time I heard the window sticker gas milage meant nothing. Seemed to me that the problem with this car definatly affected the value. Carfax had 5 reports on this vehicle. They had told me to sell it, and that the problems would not show up on a carfax. Well I stopped payment and had to retain another lawyer for bankruptcy protection from Chrysler finacial.

Peabody, Massachusetts U.S.A. ",,800-2411510,"JA Cambece Law Offices CACV Of Colorado RIPOFF!threatens, uses scare tactics, humiliates you!  Tell them to CEASE calls! Peabody Massachusetts","
										Hello! I am so suprised, but relieved to find so many other people who have received a call from the JA Cambece Law Office.
I received a call from them not long ago.  I had an account that hasn't been paid in several years.  The previous company, (a bank), sold this account to Cambece Law Offices.  It first went to CACV of Colorado.  They then sold it to (under their 'franchise') J.A. Cambece Law Offices, PC. I had managed to escape from their phone calls for the past three years.
Now, in the past, I received letters from them, and at first I was concerned, but knew I could not pay the bill.  I realized they were a debt collector, and after sparse letters over this three year period, some very nice with payment plans, one a long time ago threatening to send to my state for a court order.  I had ignored these letters.
But, I GOT A PHONE CALL.  Funny thing is, my phone number is unlisted.  I answered my phone, not recognizing the number on my caller ID.  I thought it was a job prospect.  They asked for my name, and I said 'that's me'.  Then the person proceded to tell me about my delinquent bill of over $4000.00!  (the bill was actually $2000, but Cambece tacked on interest and late charges).  I hung up on him.  He kept calling back, left a nice message saying we were disconnected, it was his fault.  (DUH).
I told my fiance about it, and he freaked out.  The person had mentioned something about them suing me.  So, with pressure and fear, I called the number back to see how they would answer the phone.  I dont' even remember how they answered the phone, because a few seconds later the phone rang and it was them calling me back.
I was really scared then. Not only did they find my phone number (don't have any idea how), but they also knew it was my PRIVATE number calling them back.
The person I talked to was not very aggressive, I told him I was losing my job in two weeks, (which is the honest truth... totally honest, even told him to call my work and ask them).  He said that was not necessary, and in my situation he would ask his supervisor if there was something he could do to help me out.  Apparently, this guy was clueless on how to be so ruthless, and decided to have a 'pro' do the dirty work for him.
A man, didn't get his name, got on the phone.  He spoke rapidly and of poor English.  Half of the time I did not understand what he was saying.  All along, my fiance coaching me in the background on what to say.  He basically said that this would ruin my credit for a very long time (duh), and that I needed to pay them immediately. I told him I wouldn't have a job and couldn't pay him.  He said he could cut the bill in half if I paid today or in a few days.  I told him there was still absolutely no way I could pay it.
He proceded to tell me the original client would pursue legal action against me, and SUE me. He made sure he said SUE to me many times.  I asked if I could make partial payments.  He said NO!  He said he didn't want to hurt my integrity, but this had to be resolved now before they pursue SUING me.  It wasn't in stone, but they would most likely do it if I didn't give them an answer after a few days.
He then told me to ask my family for money.  I told him no way in hell would I ask them for money, I was an adult, and I don't borrow money from my family.
He stated ""Are you telling me that if you went to jail, and your bail was X amount of dollars, your parents wouldn't bail you out? Again, I told him HELL NO!
I said if I went to jail, it would be my own damn fault, and my own damn money getting me out, or I'd stay in!!!
Why I reasoned with him, is beyond me. I then told him I would contact my attorney. That stirred him up.  I didn't mention filing bankruptcy.  I just said 'attorney'. 
He told me that that would be stupid, my attorney wouldn't handle it or know what to do, the amount was so little they would dismiss it in court and that they would tack on even more fees to my already inflated balance (court cost, attorney fees, etc..) The phone call had no resolve. 
I have no money to give these people, and I am not about to ask anyone for it. He did read over my credit report.  Tried to make me feel bad about that and asked me why my other accounts were in good standing. He did somehow have my unpublished phone number. He did threaten to sue me and in turn I would have my wages garnished.
I was scared... oh, very scared.  Couldn't think of anything else.  Thankfully there is the internet, and so many people out there who know what I am going through.  
You must check out this website to get more information on JA Cambece Law Offices: (link deleted, see below)
Read the entire site, no matter how long it takes, just do it.  
I don't know what will happen, if they can actually 'sue' or not.
I am going to ask them for a copy of all of my loan information and statements, also send them a 'cease contact' form, so they will leave me alone.
It is in your best interest to search JA Cambece Law Offices, CACV of Colorado LLC, Collect America, etc... 
Bud Hibb's website will include all of this information.
Make yourself informed.  Don't let these people harass you, and don't let it ruin your life.
For some reason, they're on a roll, which is funny, I saw exerpts from a lawsuit filed against them from several people for not following the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).--thought their website says they do.
EVERYONE, STICK TOGETHER, AND SHARE YOUR CALLS OR STORIES OR INFORMATION!  PLEASE!  WE NEED TO FIND OUT MORE! 
I DONT WANT TO BE BULLIED AND SCARED, AND FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO FILE CHAPTER 7 TO GET THESE PEOPLE OFF OF MY BACK! THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER WAY, THERE JUST HAS TO!
They bought your ""WROTE OFF"" account for pennies on the dollar, only to turn around and RAPE you!  I am sorry that seems so horrid to say, but if you deal with these people, you know exactly what I mean. They cruelly instill fear into your life.
Who wants to think when they have an income, that this law office will garnish your wages for years and years... when you have a family, or just yourself to take care of? Stick together!  Let's expose them for what they are!
As Bud Hibb's says on his site, they are BOTTEM-FEEDERS... Scaring the crap out of you so you pay this bill and make them rich. Check into their earnings... they are truly doing quite well for themselves too!

After she intimidated me (telling me since i had no assets they'd freeze my checking account) into giving her my account info and setting up (post dated check) payments.  i immediately checked them out online (at Mr. Hibbs site), stopped payment on the checks and sent them a ""cease communications"" letter; every once in a while they will call me, but mostly it seems to be to bug me over the $20.00 charge they got for the check they claimed bounced (the one i stopped payment on) I always tell them i sent them a letter not to call me and then hang up.  I have told them too, that I will contact my attorney (who is legit).

										I retained Roni Lynn Deutch's law office last june to take care of an 11000 dollar debt I owe to the government. I make 1000.00 per month and am in no way able to take care of this bill. I have paid Deutchs office 325.00 per month and have been very hard pressed to take care of my other bills, but because they told me this bill would be resolved, I trusted them and finally paid all but 135.00 of the 3500.00 they were asking for.
When all was said and done, the IRS turned down my offer because Deutch told the IRS that I made 2000.00 instead of 1000.00. They told me they made a mistake and would file the paperwork again, this time for free because they made the mistake. I have paperwork and everything proving they would do so. Now Scott Jucium tried to bully me into paying the last 135.00 or he said my case would be closed. I told him I would pay him on Friday, but that wasn't good enough. He told me he would be closing the case immediately if I didn't give him the go ahead to take money from my account. I didn't tell him that I closed my previous checking account and opened a new one because I really didn't want them to rip me off for any more money.
I would have, however, gave him the ok to take the money out had he not bullied me. I am appauled that this office thinks they can get by with this. Had I known, I would have just forked over the money to the IRS. The liar Scott told me that his office helped me by keeping the IRS from garnishing my wages, but that doesn't fly, because the IRS would have eccepted 275.00 per month had I just started paying them. He's a liar and I want to make sure Roni Lynn Deutch is shut down...

										I received a letter from Boyajian Law Offices stating I owed money to a utility company (Allegheny Power) from an I address I lived at 9 years ago.  I thought it was odd since I had never been contacted by any other party regarding this until now.. 9 years later. 
The first thing I did was look up the law firm name on the internet since I work in a law firm myself and found tons of reports on these people and their office being a scam however, somehow, they are still able to report you to a credit agency for a false debt if you do not pay them.  Someone please tell me how they are still able to operate and do this to people !
This has been investigated since 2003 and no one has been able to shut them down.  I called Allegheny Power and they have never heard of Boyajian, and told me I was in good standing with them, and that I owed them nothing.  When calling Boyajian Lw Offices, I asked to speak to an attorney and the man (if you'd like to call him that) that answered the phone laughed at me and told me it was like calling the White House and asking to speak to the President.  I said No, it isn't.  If I want to speak to someone higher than you, I should be able to. 
I then asked for their local telephone number, he said they did not have one.  Only a 1-800 number.  Big sign there.  All law offices will have a local telephone number.  I then asked if he could give me the name of any attorney that worked there besides Mr. Jack Boyajian, he would not.  I then asked if he could give me the licensed bar number of Mr. Boyajian sice every attorney must be licensed in their state to practice law... he got very irritated, told me he had other phone calls to take and if there was something he could help me with, to call him back, and hung up on me. 
I waited a few minutes, called back, the same man answered the phone and identified himself as someone different.  When I asked for a telephone number for one of their several other offices they had listed on their letterhead, he told me to find a phone book and use it and hung up on me.  Very professional ""legal office"" they have going on there.  (Hint of sarcasm there.) 
I do not understand how these people can continue to stay in business.  If you get a letter like this, ask for proof in writing of your debt. Legally, they have to give this to you, but I can guarantee you probably won't get it.  Then call whomever they say you owe the debt to and talk to their legal department and report this so they know someone is using their name in their scam.  Call the Boyajian offices and ask if you can have their local phone number.  I bet you wo't get one. Or ask for one of their other offices phone number, or the state bar number for Mr. Boyajian.  I'm sure ""Mr. Rude"" who answered the phone will get just as irritated with you as he did me and I was as polite and kind as I could be the entire time just wanting to see if he would give me any information.  Don't pay these scammmers a dime.
Report it to your state Attorney General's Office Division of Consumer Protection, the Better Business Bureau, and anyone else you can get to listen.

										I wish I would have found this website before I forked out $1950.00 to this law firm.
I am a single mother to a little boy, and was working two jobs. I got in pretty deep with IRS, because I thought I was eligble for the earned income credit and wasn't.
I saw the commercial for Roni Lynn Deutch saying they could help reduce IRS taxes. So I called, and spoke to Anne Browne. She took all my information down, and said I was eligble for a one time offer and compromise with the IRS. She said this law firm could get my IRS taxes down from $4000.00 to 325.00. Sounds too good to be true It usually is!
So I retained them, and did everything they asked me to do. Sent in every document on time. I ended up getting a raise about 3 months into my case. So I let them know. Three weeks later I recieved a letter saying I was no longer eligable for the offer in compromise, and they couldn't really do much for me. 
So I sent in a letter asking for a refund. Knowing they would charge me something, and I agree that I did use some of there services so maybe half of what I paid would be fair.
I recieved a letter today saying I was not eligable for a refund. They broke down thinds they charged me for. They charged me $105.00 for every letter they sent to me. Which 75% of the letters they sent to me didn't even pertain to my case.
$105.00 for one which had to do with information onIF I was filling bakruptcy. Which I am not and have no plans on doing. Another $105.00 for one has to do me having a tax lien which I don't. Another $105.00 for letter stating I need to let them know of any financial changes. Which I was aware of this at the time I reatined there services. So why am I being billed. The list goes on and on. 
So pretty much I was ripped off, and I hope people are smart enough to check out this company before they get ripped off. All I have to say to them is KARMA. So whe bad things happen to these THEIVES who probally don't get much sleep at night. YOU KNOW WHY!!!!

										Mr. Simms is known to create situation that could otherwise be equitible, by advising clients to file disengineous complaints and restraining orders. Causing grevious harm to the family's. And forcing third party communication only so as to run up his expenses. 
He is well know for this as when I attempted to hire a lawyer their retainer prices went up to 3 times the norm when they found out it was Mr. Simms, stating he is disingenous and some called him a flat out ripoff who will try to take all estate monies a family might have, and cause many unnecessary expenses.

										i was most definitely railroaded by this attorney.in 2000 i hired him to take care of my divorce precedings. at first i was satisfied with his work. we went to family court, i was granted alimony and a 1985 camaro. i was declared disabled in 1999 due to bipolar/manic depression along with physical problems. 
from 2000- 2002 i really took ill , dr discovers i have a brain tumor and i have to have surgery. in the meantime i wasn't well enough to get my husband into court for fianlizing. i had designated my mother Power of Attorney just in case something went wrong  with my sugery. she's in charge of my money and most of important decisions. i had loaned my husband the car may 10th 2002 right after getting home from the hospital. he claimed he needed it be-cause his truck needed repairs. 
well gettin back to health, it took me quite some time.i had filed for divorce on physical cruelty,and i also had adultry and habitual drunkeness.in the mean-
time before i could get the proceedings started to get things finalized, my husband countersued based on one year separation. well for some reason my attorney just seemed to let the importance of the outcome (which was going to sum up the last 12 years of my life) not be that much of a concern for him.
prior to my marriage in 1994 i had been raising my son and trying to hold down 3 jobs just to make ends meet. 4 1/2 years pass and i just knew i would be entitled to something.
i owned the house for 6 years before i married the last time. well during all this time and waiting i would call and leave messages for clyde to call, i hadn't a clue as to where any of this was going.
the issue: equitable division of the property. i never got any of my calls returned, i left messages with his secretary, on the answering machine still NOTHING.
the first monday in november of 2004 was my divorce hearing. i was not once notified by mail, phone call or anything untill the night before which was on a sunday.
clyde even tried to argue with me that i had been. nope. i never got replies from anyone. after talking with him i knew then i was doomed. i had no time to get in contact with my witnesses.
my mom had power of attorney and was key witness to the issues about the house. (it was she that help me purchase the house in 1988)
monday morn we are in a room, round table and chairs. steve and his attorney in the other. clyde didn't do anything but go back and forth between us telling me to decrease my alimony in half or the judge that was there and in such a good mood probably was stop it completely.
hello! clyde undoubtly was thinking more in steve's behalf than mine and i'm on disabilty. ok later on (which was last week) I was really bent out of shape  all because i had been chasing clyde down , calling him, time again and again no return calls, finally catching him at the courthouse, i sent word into the solicitors office, ""hey this is the last straw"" i had already gotten passed the aggravation i was getting mad.
the man didn't care to hear me out, steve paid him off, he got something out of this break up, and didn't mind a bit about bragging about it. well when he came out we talked very briefly, told me i was lucky i got alimony and i asked him to meet me at his office when he left the courthouse and he agreed to. well that was another lie.
he never showed up. i start trying to reach him by phone, no results, i ride by his office no show. well come the following thursday i went to his office told his stand-by secretary i wanted to see him , she replies he's with a client,( which must have been another unimportant client cause clyde walked out the front door, didn't even look my way, and went outside to talk with another person about purchasing his ruck.
i really got mad then, too mad to sit there and wait any longer to talk with this jerk so i told the recept. i would definitely be back the next morning and i was. he tried to tell me i agreed to let steve keep the car that he had borrowed, WRONG i have been trying for two years to get it back.
well steve was ordered in the divorce hearing to have the house and land appraised and he had to be served for contempt for not doing so. well clyde proceeded to tell me he was at the residence when the appraiser was there, but i was never notified so i could be there. clyde made all my decisions, but the decisions were lies and all in favor of steve.
i know that a piece of land does not depreciate. in 1997 the land appr. at 16000.000 now it goes for 10000.00. according to the house (mind you befor i left it happened to be a beautiful home. it supposively depreciated 30,000.00. well considering steve tore the inside out, tore out a wall took down cabinets which were stained , ended up being painted white with a brush that looks like something a two year old would do. i took some pictures of the inside of the house to the office with me and told clyde that the outside of the house was the house i left , but the inside had been demolished and all that was done so there wouldn't be any equity. i made him compare the pictures to the pictures in the appraisal. but according to clyde i had lost my mind! 
i told him i needed back the alimony i started out getting and my car. clyde wants $850.00 to do this . hahaha. the house and land ended up appraising at $40,000.00  but there was no equity and there was no such thing of steve buying my half out. my home was fully furnished way before i ever knew steve existed. all i got was my mom's exercising bicycle, some old record albums, and one wall hanging that was mom's also.
i think this case should be reopened and done over. i told clyde due to my bipolar disorder and all the health problems that i am not qualified to make drastic decisions about anything of importance on my own. clyde actual-ly thought i wanted to pull one over on the courts but its the truth. 
he said he had experienced a couple of cases like what i had just informed him of and kinda laughed it off like it was a joke of some kind. this so-called attorney costed me (with the help of my parents cause i just couldn't pay it all) i actually thought when i first talked with clyde that he was going to fight for me, he knew i would not be able to work, i want my car returned cause it was awrded to me but because clyde says itsa a piece of junk leave it be.
i told him it was in good condition when steve came and borrowed it and i didn't care if he had to push it back to me 
i still wanted it back. so..the home i worked for ,and the home my only son grew up in and was there until he graduated high school, is no longer my concern. well, clyde is history for me too.
he lied, he made me believe this was going to happen in my favor and all when the only thing he did for me was talk me out of everything and into nothing. the only reason clyde pushed steve back into court was because once again steve was in contempt for not paying clydes fees from nov. this is what really takes the cake, i have to go by the house to locate steve , call clydes investigator on his mobile and tell him that steve is at home, come on and serve him.
i'm upset over the outcome, steve was the abuser, he let me know he didn't want a sickiln for a wife, he couldn't get passed anything but just what he wanted. i am trying really hard to keep myself together. i have to take high dollar medications for this bipolar and other problems, can't function half the time, and i have an attorney that swears  he done a good job for me, and tries really hard to convince me i am soooo lucky to be getting alimony.
i think its a crying shame that he'll bust his butt to get a murderer out of jail on bond, but he doesn't give a hoot about a woman who lived in an abusive relationship, with only one option and that was to leave before the man killed me, clyde made the decision for my alimony to be reduced by half(which was $200 a month,(one prescription costs 235.00 alone and that only one out of five more i have to have evry month.
i would not advise any woman to want clyde to represent them, he's crooked. he loves to help out the murderers, and could care less about an abused woman with child or not. i will not stand good to his word. says one thing and does the entire opposite of what he said he was going to do.
i need some advise on what i can do (if anything) i'm thinking seriously about reporting my car stolen and have steve and his live in arrested.
may 10th 2002 until now has been a long time but i just recently found out where my car is at.

										I retained Paul Chan of said law firm to handle an appeal.  He said my former attorney was arrogant and encouraged me to file a complaint against him with the CA bar association.  He said there were cases identical to mine that had been successfully appealed and he thought my appeal would prevail.  He said after I paid a set amount I'd pay no further - his firm would assume all court costs.  In spite of that he later asked me for more money as he ""didn't expect certain costs to be so high.""  
I called him for status and he did not respond until I called him repeatedly.  He didn't give me a copy of the appeal he filed until six months after the fact.  It was atrocious, and had a significant error that damaged my case.  
I asked him to correct it as soon as I saw it and he said via email (I still have) that he would.  He didn't tell me my appeal was denied until I asked him weeks after the fact.  He told me he had not corrected the mistake because he didn't think it was important, despite promising earlier he would.  
The reasoning the court gave for denying the appeal used the mistake as justification.  Moreover, Paul told me I should be glad because ""I didn't owe the State of CA a nickel"".  He thought he had gotten all fees dismissed - good enough for him.  He forget about some fees that I had documented and discussed with him. 
 The State wrote him that they'd file a lien against my house unless I arranged a schedule to pay by a date.  I wrote him asap asking him to please try to dispense with the fees if he could but to tell the state I'd make monthy payments.  
When I heard nothing from him or the State after the due date I asked him via fax for status.  He did not reply and I found that the State had indeed placed liens against my house some time after the ""due"" date. Paul had again done nothing.

Boy sounds legitimate. However I'm in Pennsylvania, and the statute of limitations in this state is 4 years. I asked if she was a lawyer, she said no she was a ""litigation specialist"" What?? So the lawyer who heads this place, is he licenced to practice in PA? She says yes!!
I told her I looked on the internet and they don't have a very good track record, don't expect to get any payments from us, and they'd be getting a letter shortly.

I have been to the emergency room there many years ago, perhaps that is what they are trying to collect on.
I plan on contacting the hospital as well as the state attorney to find out the statute of limitations on any medical bills.  
Should I contact Boyajian at all?  I suppose asking for validation of the bill would be good.  Do I ask for a copy of something with my signature on it?  Would I be better of ignoring them all together until I know more?

										After having an IRS debt of $27,000. We contacted Mrs Deutch because and IRS worker said we should get an attorney to settle our debt and would probably get a reduction through offer and compremise. So on there advice we contacted Mrs Deutch who imeadiatly said we would quialify no problem.
So we sent them $3000.00 Dollars. The only time they contacted us was for more paper work which I sent them double because they couldn't seem to keep up with it.They wasted over a year causing our debt to climb and then dumpt us like wasted garbage. Then I contacted IRS on my own, They said that we should not have been accepted by Mrs Deutch because our income level was to high for offer and compremise so we got a penalty reduction, on my own without Mrs deutch I might add.
The IRS lady said Mrs deutch should have known as much as she has done, and there was no excuse for her doing this to us other than just ripping us off which she did royally. They claimed our income had went up since filing with them but it was where we had to borrow money to live on because IRS had garnished my wifes wages instead of filing a rebuttual to IRS Mrs Deutch agreed with them even after we showed proof of the loans and used it as an excuse to drop us.

										Let me begin by saying that Boyajian Law Office and NCO Financial/NCO Marlin/Marlin Integrated Capitol are affiliated.
It all began when I received a letter in the mail in June of 2005 from Boyajian Law Offices.  
The letter stated that it was written to give me notice of ""the outstanding indebtedness to Verizon relating to telecommunication services provided on the above-referenced billing number.""  It also stated that ""All inquiries regarding this acount should be addressed to our office and not to the telecommunication company, as they may have no readily available information based on the sale of this account.""  
It then went on to tell me how they have repeatedly tried to contact me and I have ""failed, refused, or neglected to make necessary payments and, as a result, are in serious default of $341.60""  They also advised me that certain cred reporting bureaus may have been notified of this outstanding obligation.
I contacted the law office and spoke to some man, don't remember his name.  I informed him that the bill in question had been paid in full back in 2001 and that I could give him a copy of the check if he would like.  He said okay that's fine thanks for clearing this up blah blah blah.  I made a point to ask if it had been put on my credit and was assured that no it wasn't.  I sent it and have heard nothing else out of them.  
Since then I've gotten married, honeymooned, and come home to enjoy newlywed life.  I ran across the letter again today and due to paranoia checked my credit report.  Sure enough dated 07/2005 are bad marks on my credit reported by NCO Financial on one of them and NCO Marlin on the other two.  All pertaining to a 2002 (note the bill was paid in 2001) Verizon phone bill for $342.00.  
I began by calling the stupid NCO place and was told to call another number three times.  I was informed I had a debt there because they had my name.  The final number I called left me on hold and disconnected me about ten minutes later.
I then turned around and called the law office and asked if they were affiliated with NCO whatever they call themselves and was told ""Yes.""  I said, ""Thanks, that's all I needed to know,"" and hung up.
What do I do now?!?!

Our insurance is included in our loan, but yet we keep getting letters from our insurance requesting payment, even the insurance company said, homecomings should be paying this, it should not be coming out of our pockets, but we have not seen a reimbursement from Homecomings.
We bought this house last year on an 80/20 loan, and the payment had already increased almost 200 dollars at the beginning of this year, we are trying our best to keep the house, we have 5 kids that don't need to be uprooted again, and would love it if we can work with someone. 
My husband has just started working again, and we are trying everyday just to keep food on the table. We just want to keep our house, due to the looks of our credit now because of the house and extra payment on our loans, there is no way in hell we will even be able to refinance.

They NEVER stopped a wage garnishment for my ex-wife as promised.  Then, came back and told me that I looked less likely to get an OIC because of my current working status.  
I formally requested a complete refund of the $7000 I paid for services NOT rendered and was presented (45 days later) with a so-called itemized list of time that was spent on my case which added up, of course, to well over the $7000 I paid.
I feel that I was totally ripped off by this company and that they misrepresented their success rates, my chance of success and the length of time it would take to complete the process.

In June 2005 I called Mr. Bakers office and left a message with a Kelly Joe who was the woman whom delt the medical forms and such, I asked her to let Mr. Baker know to just pay the bill. With this said I assumed the bill would be paid and my case would be closed.
In Sept. 2005 I looked up my credit report and there was thet bill with ICS that should have been paid in June 2005. So I called ICS and asked if my bill had ever been paid. And the gentleman said no and they had no record of me ever having an attorney. So I called Mr. Baker he of course wasn;t in to speak to but I did speak to Kelly Joe she said my case was closed.
So now I am stuck with this bill on my credit when in all actuallity it shouldv'e been dealt with months ago.

Islandia, New York U.S.A. ",,800-313-5179,Rubin & Rothman ripoff Islandia New York,"
										I have a daughter who was 15 at the time who, placed into a hospital for a physiological evaluation in May of 2003. She was originally brought to another hospital by Police ambulance because she was endangering herself and others. As part of this treatment the hospital transferred her to South Oaks Hospital for an evaluation. At the time of admission I was gainfully employed and insured. Due to the amount of time the hospital and issues required me to be away from work for meetings I was fired while my daughter was hospitalized.
I ended up on unemployment for 9 months, then 3 months with no income before finding a job. Immediately following my beginning to work, at a salary 40% less than before I received a notice from Rubin & Rothman, on behalf of South Oaks Hospital attempting to collect a debt of approximately $5,000 for treatment of my daughter. I finally agreed to send $50.00 a month and then up the payments to $100.00 after I got back on my feet.  
When this agreement was reached I was under the impression all was okay. Just days after the payment agreement was reached on the phone my wife and I both received a letter to sign which stated that the $50.00 payment would be effective for 6 months and then we would have to re-negotiate payments. Upon my raising objections over the language of the letter I was told that this was a formality and that they were only permitted to agree to 6 months payments at a time. We signed and returned the forms.
Well 6 months passed and then I was contacted about higher payments. I was still financially strapped and within a couple of months started to make $100.00 payments.  Over the past month we have been threatened with garnishment, to the amount of over $900.00 a month. We were mislead at the beginning of all of this and now once again.  
We received a letter about 6 weeks ago, allegedly a subpoena asking for all kinds of financial information. But the letter clearly stated that if we called them we could forego the answering of all the questions on this form. We did contact them well within the two weeks. In the meantime they still had sent the same form to both of our employers and were getting the same type of information from them. After we sent our pay information they have now decided that we must pay over $900.00 a month or garnishment proceedings will commence and even more will be taken from our paychecks, great negotiations. 
They have yet to inquire about our other obligations and actually told us as well as my boss that they don't care, they want their money and will get it by whatever means they can. Even after being told that this payment would force us to file bankruptcy, again their comment was we don't care. I was told by my boss that he was told by Ms Johnson on the phone that as of last week they have gone to the Marshall to begin garnishment proceedings against us. 
If anyone has any suggestions on how to handle these people please respond. I do not want to go the bankruptcy route but the first set of short paychecks will leave me little choice because I refuse to take the kind of harassment from other creditors because of my absolute inability to make payments because of this $900.00 a month garnishment they are trying to enforce.
Most of our dealings have been with a Ms. Johnson of the Rubin & Rothman office and all I can say is I sure hope it's true that whatever goes around comes around, whether in this life or after is fine with me it just won't be soon enough

										After reading another Rip-Off report concerning  Seidberg Law Offices,  I had to respond and add my complaint. In 1997, we had filed bankruptcy in another state. Once we moved to Arizona we felt we could catch up with our finances so we did a voluntary discharge of our bankruptcy. We had started making phone calls to the companies on the bankruptcy to make payment arrangements with them. However, before we could get in contact with Franklin Capital Corporation about our truck, they came a few days before Christmas in 1998 and repossessed  the truck. We received no paperwork, no letters from anyone concerning the back payments and the possibility of it being repossessed, so we thought that was the end of the issue. In September 2004 we received a letter from Seidberg Law Offices in Phoenix stating we owed  $10,821.21 for the vehicle that was repossessed in 1998 and they were representing Franklin Capital. Seidberg wanted all of our financial records so they could determine how much they wanted us to pay each month until the full amount was paid. They stated that if we didn't come to an arrangement, they would garnish my wages until the amount was paid. During this time frame we were in the process of buying a new home and to have the wages garnished would hurt this opportunity. It is now September 2005 and the amount Seidberg wants is now $18,023.78, plus $500.00 a month for 48 months. We had already put over $7000.00 dollars in payments for the vehicle before they repossessed it and we have already paid Seidberg $3000.00 dollars with the payments and IF we continue to pay Seidberg the $500.00 a month for the next 48 months, our total payments to Seidberg for a vehicle we don't even own anymore will be over $42,000.00. Does this sound like something is very wrong with Franklin Capital and Seidberg Law Offices?? I think so. If anyone else is willing to take action against Seidberg Law Offices, please respond to this Rip Off report.

										Kim Bennett called me to collect on a charged off account. I informed her I had filed bankruptcy and gave her my case number. She proceeded to tell me that she could still talk to me even though I had an automatic stay to keep creditors from calling. My husband is a joint account holder and did not file so she said because I am the wife she can still call me.
She was kind at first being sympathetic to our situation and said she could cut me a good settlement. I said we could make payments and she said they dont take payments on a settlement (which we settled 2 other accounts that way with other ""law"" firms). It had to be a lump sum and to charge it on another card, I laughed and told her my accounts were closed. Thats just ridiculous! Then she told me to borrow the money from a family member and pay them back. Right, if I had that kind of money to borrow I wouldn't have filed bankruptcy. 
Then she said if we didn't let her know by noon the next day (which is today) that she would inform her client to procede and that she knew wehad real estate and could take our property and other assets and they had their ""ways to get their money"". I told her OHio law protects your property, and there is no way a court would garnish my husbands wages as he is going to be unemployed anyway and will be self employed after that. Also, she wanted to call him at work!! I told her no. No court is going to take a house away from a family with small children over an unsecured credit card. It just doesn't happen. 
My assets are protected in bankruptcy anyway. I am going to have my husband send a cease communication letter and I am going to document every single thing. Since I didn't have an attorney represent me in bankrupcty, (no need this is not a community property state and most everyting is in my husbands name), she tried to use scare tactics and upset me. She did make me cry and she said it was not her intent to upset me but to inform me that they will get theirs. I told her my husband is considering bankruptcy too and she said it didn't matter because they will still get paid by credit insurance. I don't get that, if that is the case why bother going after people???
Luckily I am a very educated and informed person and I know alot of legal things. It helps to have 2 attornys in my family although they are in another state. I hope a class action law suit is started I would love to go after them! There should be more accountability in these debt collectors who prey on struggling middle class america who are barely getting by in this economy.

										This company mailed a bill statement under my daughter's name stating that she owe's them money($164.00). They stated in their letter that the original creditor sent her bill statement thousand times but never responded to it. The real thing is that she never gotten any bill from anybody. 
I called this law office and ask them where this bill came from, they ask the file number, and appeared that it was on my 7 year old daughter and the representative told me if she could speak with her because she was the one who owe's them money and not me. He was surprised when I said she is my daughter and she is only 7 years old and then we talk. 
H etold me that the bill was from her hospitalization way back February 2002 when she went to E.R., the hospital does exist and I took my daughter there several times when we still live in L.A. I got suspicious so I ask him what was the name of the previous creditor that they are telling me about because I know that we never recieved any of the statement that they are claiming. Then he hanged up on me.
I called again and talked with somebody else, this time I asked him to send me a copy of the denial of the insurance that my daughter had at that time. He said that they dont have that so I told them that I could get a clear cut copy of the denial of services IF that insurance company really denied her because when they deny services they will send you reason why they denied services. 
Again man hanged up on me. I called again the 3rd time, I told them that I will not pay for it but I will file a dispute, the man I spoke at this time told me that if I file a disput it will go on a litigation and I need to go down there and waste my mone, afterwards he said that if we could just settle the amount? 
He said that instead of paying 164.00 I will just pay 82.00 but I will have to pay it now through credit card and threat me that they will mess up my credit.He told me that I have 24 hours to pay it.I said no if I would pay for if, they need to send me a bill statement then I asked him again, If this bill was from E.R. the hospital should put the bill under my name because my daughter is a minor and leggaly it shouldn't be under her name. Then he hanged up again so I called again and told them that I am not paying anything because I know that we don't owe them money, and if the proper way of doing it is to file a dispute, then I will.
In addition to that these people didn't know what kind of insurance my child had,I spoke with the insurance company  and her insurance doesn't deny any services if children was accepted in any emergency room and I took my daughter on that same hospital several times and never get any bill statement.
This company is extremely fraud, I don't know how they got our information, our new addres, and other information to get into us but what they are doing is illegal. We need to be aware of people like this. But if we will think of if, how do they get access in our records whether its form the hospitals, electric bill or wherever all I know it that this IS A CLEAR CUT SCAM and it should be stop!!

										This letter is a complaint about the collection firm Cambece Law Firm, I spoke with Mr. Sanger, J. Voci, & Mr. Greaves. Mr. Sanger was my first contact who spoke to me about the situation of collection on behalf of his client Chase. At this point I did not have any knowledge of the accounts balance and I requested to call him back in 24 hrs to locate my records & files so that I may take care of this matter. While negotiating the call back time Mr. Sanger then handed the phone to his supervisor J. Voci. Mr. Voci from the very beginning of our conversation was rude, impatient, condescending and completely unprofessional. I continued to explain that since I could not find any record of this particular account among my current files that I would need time to assess and determine what steps I could take to pay this debt in a timely fashion.
Mr. Voci continued to belittle me, and attempt to intimidate me using the threat of the next lawful step if I did not wish to take care of the matter at that exact moment. Again I continued to express very clearly that I was willing to resolve this issue with just a little more understanding. At this point the phone was then quickly handed to another supervisor and before I knew it yet another man was raising his voice at me and degrading me. He refused to speak calmly with me about finding the solution to resolving this matter. He wantedthe money right then and now and he said that even my promise of a few hundred dollars to start was not good enough.
I continued to express that I would like to request more time to first locate any records of the account he was speaking of (I keep excellent records of all accounts open or closed which is why I was confused that it was not filed with my current files). Second I wanted more time to assess our current finances to be able to resolve this account.
Mr. Greaves then told me to call back in an hour and I better be able to come up with a way to pay the full amount, I again repeated that I want to resolve this issue but there is no way I can pay that amount. Mr. Greaves then told me to call beck and quickly hung up on me. I immediately called Mr. Sanger back and explained again that I wanted to resolve the issue, all I would ask is for some civility while handling the issue and I expressed that I have never been treated with such rudeness.
These so called attorneys tried to bully me and threaten me. They treated with such disrespect it isamazing that they are even allowed to operate as a so called business.

The Arizona Republic
Oct. 5, 2005 04:54 PM 
Gina Niedzwiecki is out $87,000, money she paid in retainers to a man she thought was a divorce lawyer. He wasn't.
And Maricopa County prosecutors say she isn't the only one who forked over money to Gary Jay Karpin,54, whom they say posed as a divorce lawyer, even though he wasn't licensed to practice in Arizona.
Prosecutors say they already have identified 115 victims, and they suspect there could be as many as 200 more.
Karpin, a disbarred Vermont attorney who moved to Arizona in 1993, was indicted in July on numerous counts of theft and fraudulent schemes. Wednesday, the Maricopa County Attorney's Office publicly appealed for other victims to come forward.
Prosecutors say Karpin advertised as a divorce mediator and either claimed or implied that he was a licensed attorney. Known financial losses to victims exceed $500,000. 
Karpin would file victims' court papers as ""pro per,"" meaning the victims were actually representing themselves, officials said. Some documents were never filed; others were not properly prepared.
As a result, some victims have found out they weren't divorced at all or didn't have custody of their children like they thought they did, said Barnett Lotstein, a special assistant county attorney.
""
Karpin has been operating in Maricopa County since at least 1996, calling his practice various names, including Divorce with Dignity Divorce Associates, Relationships with Dignity, G.J Karpin and Associates Divorce with Dignity and A Dignified Divorce. 
Victims are asked to call the Maricopa County Attorney's Office at (602) 372-7777

Phony attorney arrested on counts of fraud and theft
06:14 PM Mountain Standard Time on Wednesday, October 5, 2005 
By Suzanne Bissett / 3TV reporter 
The Maricopa County Attorney's Office says 115 people have been scammed out of money, totaling more than $500,000, by a man who is pretending to be an attorney. 
Gary Karpin had been disbarred from the state of Vermont and while in Arizona, had been practicing everything from bankruptcy to divorce and custody cases in a North Scottsdale office. 
Investigators say Karpin incorrectly filed court documents and sometimes never filed at all. 
It's alleged that when the incorrect documents were returned to his office, he never told his clients and, in some cases, demanded more money. 
Some clients who hired Karpin to settle their divorce found out later that they were still married. 
Karpin was arrested in July and now faces at least 16 felony counts of fraud and theft. 
Investigators expect there will more victims to come forward.

										I lost my mother in August 2004 after I took care of her for a year while she was sick. After she died I had some questions about her estate some months later. I hired an attorney by the name of Arch B. Boyd III on Dec 29th 2004 and paid him $1000.00 to pay for an accounting. He quoted me $100.00 for ten hours of work.  Then on June 3rd 2005 I went to Arch Boyd because of problems with my mother's estate I recieved a letter that the bank was going to foreclose on my house that was left to me in my mother's will on July 12th 2005. I went and talked to Arch Boyd about this matter and he said that he would need $5000.00 to represent me on the house. However he said that he understood my situation and that I could pay him in payments. I paid him $1000.00 on June 3rd and another $500.00 two weeks later. 
I have never recieved an accounting on my mother's estate to this date and my house was foreclosed on July 12th 2005. Arch Boyd never did anything on these matters that I hired him on. I had a meeting with him after my house was foreclosed on about a refund and I told him that I needed the money so that I could find me somewhere else to live. He told me that he would send me a letter breaking everything that he supposedly did down and then would let me know how much he would give back to me. I never recieved a letter from Mr. Boyd so I sent him a letter(enclosed) and then I called Mr. Boyd the following Monday and asked him if I could pick up my money and all he said was that he would send me a response to my letter. I then had to find an attorney to represent me in the eviction proceedings  and that attorney helped to keep me in the house awhile longer THANK GOD and he found some information about some of my other legal issues that Mr. Boyd never provided. 
During this time I checked the Tennessee Board of Professional Responsibility web site and found that Mr. Boyd has had Three disiplinary actions against him in the past. One such action was a public sensorship in april of 2005. The charges were failure to communicate with client, neglect of legal duty, and failure to refund any money after being terminated by a client. All I want is my $2500.00 back. If your office can help I would really appreciate it.

										A few months ago I resolved a debt with JA Cambece Law Office. I initially spoke with a woman by the name of Kim Bennett, who at that moment was cordial. After I explained to her that I did not have the money to resolve the debt. The threats and promises of further action began.
I initially was outraged, but reluctantly gave in to a payment arrangement. She expressed I would initially pay over half by the end of the month and then I could pay the rest in two installments. We struggled back and forth with the initial amount to be paid and in the end she won.
The company and their tactics for dealing with customers are outrageous. The threats that were being made regarding further action if the debt was not resolved was unbelievable. I have never felt so belittled in my entire life.
Since the initial bulk payment was not coming from me, but rather I was using my federal grant I was at the time frame of my school to cut the check. Cambece was not sympathetic to the money in the account when it was supposed to be, even though Kim Bennett told me that if something were to happen prior to the payment to contact her and additional arrangements could be made.
Well of course that was a big joke. I was directed to the manager (cannot remember his name), who was even more rude than her and expressed to me that it was not his problem that the money was not there and I should figure something out.
Long story short I have paid my balance in full and have yet to receive the promised documents by Cambece with regard to my original creditor. When I talked with Kim Bennett today regarding the documents she said it takes 30-45 days to have the documents sent to me. This response was different from her response 38 days ago, which was three weeks. Because I got upset and wanted to know who the documents would be coming from she advised me that is none of my business.
Then her manager called me back and told me not to bother his office staff anymore. I asked him for the contact information and he told me that wasn't any of my business. How can it not be? It's my account and my documents?
Be careful when dealing with this company. Don't ever close the deal on the first phone call always consult with a lawyer prior to making any arrangements with this law office. By the time Cambece gets your account a great deal of time has passed, what is a few more days. They may not like to wait and may threaten you, but you won't regret taking that extra time to find out what your rights are.

Primericas Prepaid Legal is a total ripoff. Basically you pay $300 per year for the privilege of talking to an attorney for around 10 minutes, who then refers you to a ""local"" attorney, who then deducts 25% off his hourly rate. I recently consulted them over a civil action I am considering taking, after about 10 minutes the ""Attorney"" (though it could have been a para-legal for the advice given was not particularly useful)referred me to a local attorney who said he would only charge me $225 per hour. I decided to call a couple of Attorneys in the Yellow pages, both said on the strength of my case they would take it on contingency, meaning free and they are paid on the judgement if we prevail. Now why am I paying $300 per year to Primerica when the yellow pages are free. Do yourselves a favor consumers don't get taken in by the slick Primerica marketing, this is a total con and as with most Primerica products check around as their rates are way above other companies.

										I am an ex-employee of Boyajian Law Offices. I feel so bad at the tactics that are use to collect monies owed from innocent victims. Jack Boyajian is NOT a lawyer as you all know! He is getting rich off of people who dont know how the system works. Their are only 3 legal lawyers that work on cases that most of the time never go to court and the lawyers will never answer their phones for you. Instead they have collectors that pose as lawyers to get payments for bills in most cases have been paid already. 
They basically prey on individuals who are more then likely elderly,disabled, or in alot of cases deceased. The office can not even be considered a law office,but a collection agency that holds the name ""Law Offices"" to intimidate people they collect money from.Once they collect money they never answer the phone again for you because they have already received their monies that will go towards their commission. 
The supervisors will never answer either so all of you who call and ask for them its a waste because they are to busy making sure the collectors are on the phone collecting all their money in 3minutes or less! While the collectors may seem nasty on the phone its not always them, its a stressful job and like with any job they have to collect or risk loosing a job. They have a quota to meet and if they don't it's unemployment to them. And just like with the you victims,if they loose the job their a victim too, because Boyajian's office supervisor lies on the phone to Unemployment so they cant get that either,so they do what they have to do. It's a loose, loose situation at Boyajian.
Boyajian Law Offices use to be JBC Legal Group, but changed their name because JBC was associated with too much illegal activity. But its the same owner,just being scandalous under another name. If anyone has any questions ask and I will be happy to answer. I was only there for such a short period and know so much. For all interested Jack Boyajian's extension is 201. And please if you know anyone who doesnt have a computer and cannot access the internet let them know about all the Trifling activity going on at Boyajian Law Offices and dont let them risk being a victim too.

										This law firm is in the business of collecting debts. While there is nothing wrong with that, they seem to have followed the method of debt collecting that we've all come to associate with the ""Mafia""... threats, harrassment, intimidation, insults and generally unethical, unprofessional & disreputable conduct. My experience with this firm has to be the worst of my life. I particularly emphasize my communication with Brett Riley of this firm. He made threats to me that were designed only to scare me. I found out there was no way I would be going to jail over a debt, but he made me believe I would be incarcerated and lose everything, even custody of my twin sons, if I didn't pay this small debt, along with thousands of dollars in interest, penalties and fees. I had to hire another attorney to make Mr. Riley back down. 
When I explained I couldn't make the outrageous monthly payments he demanded, and would be forced to declare bankruptcy, he threatened to call my ex-husband and tell him I was financially irresponsible. Mr. Riley stated that he hoped my ex-husband would then sue for custody of my children and I would lose them. Mr. Riley stated that people like me need to be taught a lesson and he would see to it that even if I declared bankruptcy, he would see that I ""paid in one way or another."" This firm's tactics are despicable!

										If you are thinking about using this attorney, think again. I have paid her $5k and she has done nothing. She is lazy, rude and incompetent, she refuses to work past noon and still does not have a legal assistant and her secratary only works until noon. She won't return your calls and I am a nice client! 
I continually beg her to work for me and she continues to tell me that she won't work with me, and she will... By looking up her state bar I.D. for Texas I realized that she has only been practicing for a little over 5 years but she is beyond horrible! I have been court ordered to send paper work during my divorce and after 2 trips to her office to provide the necessary documentation and doing all the work for her, I realized after five months she still has not! 
I believe that she has emotional problems, she seems to be very unstable. Traci is the worst family law attorney and I understand attorney's are very busy, my time is valuable as well. I am a Realtor and a new single mother. However, I may lose custody of my child because she won't get herself together. It has been nearly six months and she still will not work for me. 
She says there is a black box on her phone so the month straight I called her she couldn't retrieve my messages. E-maail me at (email deleted - see below) if you have any more questions. This is just the tip of the iceburg and I don't want anyone to have to go through what I have, it's unfair.

										This happened to my mother.  The harassing phone calls started about 4 months ago non-stop, demanding money owed to them for unpaid medical bills.  They would argue with her and often times even hang up and then call her back a couple of days later.  She asked questions such as date, what they were billing her for, etc, only to be yelled at and hung up on.  They requested personal information such as social security number, company where she worked and bank account in order to pay off her debt right away.  
My mother never gave this information and always asked why they collection agency here in California wasn't contacting her, why was it out of state.  The bills starting arriving about 5 months ago.  My mother ignored the first few, but then felt so intimated by them that she actually sent in two payments by money order for twenty-five dollars.  They kept demanding higher payments of $100.  
When she spoke with them, she explained that she was unemployed and couldn't pay $100, so the guy on the phone said that $25 was okay.  When my mother spoke to me and explained everything in detail, bells went off in my head and I decided to do a web search on the company, only to find all these stories VERY similar to my mothers.  
What's the next step?  What is to be done in order to stop them from harassing my mother?

The reps who spoke with my mother told her she did have the 2000 dollars they were demanding because she owned a home, and if she didn't set up a payment plan they would start the process of putting a lien on the house. It was indicated that she would continue to get these harrasing calls until the balance of the 2000$ was paid in full. And as promised she gets several harrasing calls starting after 8 in the morning until after 9 at night demanding money.

William Hagens was immediately told to stop calling my mother for any reason and he out right refused and said that he would keep calling my mom unless i gave him a good # for myself!
Frederick J. Hanna & Associates has ignored more than 15 verbal requests, 8 faxed requests and 1 certified letter requesting a cease of communications.

										My husband and I did not know what we were getting into when we hired the law firm of Roni Lynn Duetch, we had a tax problem, and the (tax specialist) we spoke to was very enthusiastic, and said that they could handle our problem within 6 months. We paid $2500.00 for legal services, and we never received any legal services whatsoever. When we called, we were on hold for an eternity, then the smart mouth person talking on the other end of the phone said that we could not speak to an attorney, but one would return our calls, and that never happened. We filled out all the paperwork that was sent to us, along with a letter telling us not to contact the IRS ourselves, to let them handle it. We  were constantly  receiving threatening letters from the IRS, but when we would call the law office, we were told to fax a copy of the letter to them, and they would take care of it.
This went on for over a year, then the IRS sent a letter threatening to garnish my husbands wages, and we called the law office again, and once again we were told to fax the letter to them, and one of their attorney's would take care of it.
Needless to say, they did not take care of it, and my husband's wages were garnished, leaving us with no money for rent or groceries. We constantly called the law firm, but we were never allowed to speak with an attorney, which is what we paid for in the first place.
This is not what a law firm is all about. The people who work there are rude, when they talk to you, each one of them tell you the same story, like they are reading from a script just like a telemarketer. This is a sweatshop in California, not a reputable law firm, and I intend to do whatever it takes to put a stop to this type of deceptive practice. I will not stop until I receive all my money back, since there was no work performed by an attorney I do not owe them any money. I am also reporting this law firm to every agency available to the public in California, so please, if you have had a similar experience, do not quit until this is stopped. There is a lot of power in numbers.

										JACKSONVILLE, FLA---Public records reveal an attorney admitted in correspondence to The Florida Bar that clients were overcharged by the Florida law firm FARAH, FARAH & ABBOTT, P.A. a/k/a The Law Offices of Eddie Farah.  
Attorney Jeffrey R. Hill says the firm employed him in 2004 when he discovered it was regularly overcharging its personal injury clients. Hill says, ""The firm was frequently 'padding' costs charged to clients by $300 or more per case and had been doing so for several years. 
Hill reported his concerns over the firm's illicit overcharging practices in September 2004 by letter to Donald M. Spangler, Esq., Chief Branch Discipline Counsel for The Florida Bar. To Hill's surprise, a full year went by with no contact from any representatives of The Florida Bar to investigate his allegations of wide scale fraud and misappropriation of clients' funds. 
Hill followed up with the Florida Bar in September and October 2005. By email dated Oct. 27, Spangler succinctly responded, ""The file to which you refer was closed. The grievance committee considered the matter after investigation and an audit by the bar staff auditor, and found there was no probable cause to pursue disciplinary proceedings. They did elect to send a letter of advice to the firm.""
Questioning the thoroughness the grievance committee's investigation as well as the audit by the Bar Staff Auditor. Hill followed up with Spangler requesting a copy of The Florida Bar's complete file.   By email dated October 28, Spangler responded, ""Your request will be treated as a public records request and you will be informed by the appropriate individual regarding the cost of the documents you are requesting.""  
On 12/7/05, Hill finally received a response from the Bar to his public records request but says the records produced are obviously incomplete. With the exception of nine pages, the records produced were limited to documents Hill says he personally sent to The Florida Bar.  Most noticeably absent from the records are the Grievance Committee's file and the results from the audit of FARAH, FARAH & ABBOTT, P.A.'s trust account that Hill says the records show was scheduled for 3/2/05. 
Attorney John A. Weiss, Esq. of Tallahassee represented the firm's principals, attorneys and brothers Eddie and Chuck Farah,  before The Florida Bar.   Hill says it appears a Bar audit took place since Weiss stated in a 9/22/05 letter to the Bar, ""As an aside, I would advise you that the firm has refunded in excess of $120,000.00..., including both principal and interest, to those clients who were inadvertantly overcharged for costs. Approximately $10,000.00 remains undisbursed because the firm, and the private investigator it subsequently hired, could not find the individuals.""
Weiss' letter and examples of the firm's overcharging practices are available on Hill's personal web page called  ""Hill's Peek"" at (link deleted - see below)
Hill observes, ""That certainly sounds like quite a bit of money to be 'inadvertantly overcharged'.  It would take overcharging 400 clients by $300 each to reach $120,000.00.""  Hill says he will continue to follow up on his request to obtain the remainder of The Florida Bar's file pursuant to the Public Records Act, Chapter 119 of the Florida Statutes.

										According to a 12/1/05 article in The Florida Bar News a first look at an ""extensive review of the Florida Bar's disciplinary process"" will be on the agenda for the Bar's Board of Governors when it meets December 16 at Amelia Island. 
Florida attorney Jeffrey R. Hill was employed by FARAH, FARAH & ABBOTT, P.A. a/k/a The Law Offices of Eddie Farah in 2004 when he discovered it was regularly overcharging its personal injury clients. According to Hill, ""The firm was frequently 'padding' costs charged to clients by $300 or more per case and had been doing so for several years. Clients were required clients to sign settlement statements certifying they agreed with the falsified figures before any portion of their settlement proceeds would be paid to them. The firm's contingency fee contracts, accounting records and settlement statements clearly document its overcharging practices."" 
Hill reported his concerns over the firm's illicit overcharging practices in September 2004 by letter to Mr. Donald M. Spangler, Esq., Chief Branch Discipline Counsel for The Florida Bar. Hill's letter included supporting documentation from ten cases in which the firm grossly overcharged clients and pointed out, The documentation is being provided in only ten (10) cases, but the practice of overcharging clients for costs in this manner is widespread at the firm. There are likely hundreds and perhaps thousands of files in which the firm has overcharged clients for costs in this manner without their knowledge."" 
To Hill's surprise, a full year went by with no contact from any representatives of The Florida Bar to investigate his allegations of wide scale fraud and misappropriation of clients' funds by The Law Offices of Eddie Farah. 
Hill followed up with The Florida Bar in September and October 2005. By email dated 10/27/05, Mr. Spangler succinctly responded, ""The file to which you refer was closed. The grievance committee considered the matter after investigation and an audit by the Bar Staff Auditor, and found there was no probable cause to pursue disciplinary proceedings. They did elect to send a letter of advice to the firm.""
According to The Florida Bar's web site, ""The Florida Bar has an important role in the regulation of lawyer misconduct. A complaint of unprofessional conduct against a Florida Bar member is a serious matter. The processing and investigation of inquiries and complaints are a basic responsibility of the Bar as mandated by the Florida Supreme Court. The Bar seeks to protect the public from unethical lawyers."" (Emphasis supplied).
Hill finds it difficult to fathom how The Florida Bar's grievance committee could reach an informed decision concerning probable cause to pursue disciplinary proceedings without ever even contacting him as the person reporting the misconduct. Despite the egregiousness of the reported misconduct, Hill received no inquiries whatsoever from The Florida Bar by letter, telephone or email. 
Hill followed up with Spangler requesting a copy of The Florida Bar's file. By email dated 10/28/05, Spangler responded, Your request will be treated as a public records request and you will be informed by the appropriate individual regarding the cost of the documents you are requesting. As of 12/5/05 Hill has neither received the requested documents nor been contacted by The Florida Bar regarding the cost of producing them. Hill is continuing to follow up on his efforts to obtain the records, which should be readily available pursuant to the Public Records Act, Chapter 119 of the Florida Statutes. 
Florida Bar President-elect and Board of Governors member Henry Matson Coxe III chairs the Special Commission on Lawyer Regulation conducting an ""extensive review"" of the Bar's disciplinary process. Coincidentally, Coxe's law office is just a half mile down the street from the Law Offices of Eddie Farah in Jacksonville. By email to Coxe on 12/5/05, Hill requested that the manner in which his complaint of misconduct was handled be included in the Board of Governor's ""extensive review"" of The Florida Bar's disciplinary process at the upcoming December 16 meeting. 
Hill is following up with The Florida Bar on an outstanding request for a copy of its complete file concerning this matter. Those documents should be readily available pursuant to the Public Records Act, Chapter 119 of the Florida Statutes. On 12/7/05, Hill received a response to his public records request but the records are obviously incomplete. With the exception of nine pages, the records produced were limited to documents he personally sent to The Florida Bar. Most noticeably absent from the records are the Grievance Committee's file and the results from the audit of FARAH, FARAH & ABBOTT, P.A.'s trust account that was apparently scheduled for 3/2/05. It appears the audit took place since the Farahs' attorney, John A. Weiss, Esq., states in a 9/22/05 letter to The Florida Bar,
""As an aside, I would advise you that the firm has refunded in excess of $120,000.00 ..., including both principal and interest, to those clients who were inadvertantly overcharged for costs. Approximately $10,000.00 remains undisbursed because the firm, and the private investigator it subsequently hired, could not find the individuals.""
Weiss letter and examples of the firm's overcharging practices are available on Hill's personal web page called ""Hill's Peek"" which can be easily found through the Google and Yahoo search engines.
Hill observes, ""That certainly sounds like quite a bit of money to be 'inadvertantly overcharged'. It would take overcharging 400 clients by $300 each to reach $120,000.00."" Hill says he will continue to follow up on his public records request to obtain the remainder of The Florida Bar's file.

										Upon retaining Atty. Kressler in April of 2003, I was told he would help me with my credit card debt.  Bankruptcy was on hold pending a potential divorce settlement.  I notified Atty. Kressler of settlement, and asked him to proceed with negotiating a settlement of my debts.  I received a formal complaint from one attorney which Atty. Kressler failed to answer and subsequently, my property was liened.  He continually failed to respond to my calls, and in the past 2 years, my debt has doubled since I first retained him.  He gave me false information as to the lien, telling me it was on the property I was renting, when, in fact, it was on the property I actually owned.  Horribly rude and unprofessional.  I don't even know what to do next.  Now I receive a COPY of a letter he finally sent to one of the collection attorneys which states he is no longer representing me.  News to me!!  I guess he plans to keep my $$ and run.

										What can I say? This company screwed me royally. Beware! Do not pay them anything. Question everything. Went for home equity and boyajian was on credit. never heard of it. Had to pay off all debt on my credit to get this home loan. Almsot paid boyajian but looked into it further. Ruined my credit and for how long I have no idea. Was wondering why I was always having to take high interest rates. People check your credit on regular basis!
anyway, called Boyajian, said I owed for an acct with fleet on a  credit card.um, never had credit card w/ fleet. asked for more info and they told me never mind just pay bill! Could not tell me year, last charge on card, nothing! Told them I was coming after them. Checked my credit reports, all three, boyajian was removed. So I called my home lender to send me the 3500.00 that was escrowed to go to boyajian and told them it didnt belong to boyajian and send it to me. Home lender called boyajian again and they said I still owe!!!!!!! It is like one big viscious circle of bs. Boyajian took off my credit obviously for a reason, cause they had been caught.Still telling home lender I owe them. 7 months later home lender still will not give me 3500.00 due me b/c they think it belongs to boyajian. I am also filing rip-off report on home lender ditech. They are just as bad.
I need at least 20 people in PA that are having the same problem with boyajian to contact me about class action suit. Contact me through the rebuttal key or the editor of this site.

										I Paid in full to have her file a bankrupcy for my fiance. I explaned that she needed to speak to me as i am joint owner on the car, the house and the second mortgage. Robert has a 3rd grade comprehension level and does not understand business matters.  So she does not listen to me all she is doing is looking at the green cash in my hands.  She grabs the money like a hungry theif and does not pay the court so the bankrupcy goes into a lapse state i come and yell at her for it and she refuses to continue to speak to me. Day of bankrupcy she does not show up for court. 
All of our info goes to a flunky who does not know what he or she is doing. All of our info goes to the trustie now she has to clean up the mess and is doing a terrible job of it. She has not had us sign for reaffirmation of the house, the second mortg is pending major errors, which she will not correct because she does not care. There is still a car out there pending re afirmation. No creditors showed up for the creditors meeting, which should mean ""YA SOOZE YA LOOSE"" but she was snoozing the day of the bankrupcy, so why should she care. She is now afraid she will loose her house because i report her to the barr assoc but she does not care if we loose our house....Not to mention the fact that she sends her brother in to my bus. to threaten my life...he is too small to worry about it...

										I got a phone call from a Mr. Crawley at 7 o'clock p.m. telling me I owe $13,089.41 on a credit card back in 1997.
Then I talked to a Miss. Wagner and she told me that I could pay a one time settlement of 7,870.77 or I could do 10 percent down and pay $654.37 per month for 18 months. And that they only accept money grams,western union,master card or a check by phone.
When they call my house the caller id shows a 716-999-0350 number but when I try to call that number it tells me it can't be completed as dialed. 
So I called Mr. Crawley back and told him that I wanted him to send me proof of my signature and documents to prove that this was me. And I asked him what credit card this was and he told me that it was Chevy Chase Bank and he couldn't tell me if it was a loan or a credit card.
I called chevy chase bank and told them what was going on they had know record of me at all for loans or credit cards. I even called chase manhatten to make sure it wasn't them.
I know I didn't have a credit card or loan  because I filed bankrupcy and to this day I can't get one on my own.
Can someone please tell me what to do.

										I am sick of the constant unsolicited recorded telephone calls coming at all hours of the day or night (from 7 am to midnight) from Boyajian Law Offices. These calls are pre-recorded and always say the same thing:  ""This call is regarding a personal business matter"" ... ""please call Boyajian Law Offices at 1-800-793-2350.""  The recording also gives a reference number - probably so whoever answers the phone when I call can access all my personal information and details of my ""case"". 
I have received countless of these recorded calls over the last few months, sometimes more than one in a single day -- never mind that my number has always been unlisted and has been registered on the Federal Do-Not-Call List since its inception over two years ago.
I have never responded, nor will I ever respond, because I know this is just some kind of scam. 
Instead, I reported this blatent violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (and Do-Not-Call List) to the Federal Communications Commission complaints division, but all I got was a letter thanking me for my report. A month later, I am still receiving the same unsolicited calls from Boyajian Law Offices; clearly the FCC has done jack s**t about my complaint or this rip-off law office, and probably isn't going to any time soon, if ever.
Has anyone else out there been receiving these harassing phone calls from Boyajian Law Offices?  If so, have you had any success in stopping them?

										I agree with the previous writer who expressed this law firm is a big waste of money! I'm sure the firm would claim customer dissatisfaction is the result of a disgruntle few who have an en-ability to provide honest information. 
Nothing could be farther from the truth! I have been dealing with this firm for four years! I had to continually resubmit info because of the time lapses between the IRS and the firm. 
The firm always blames the IRS. Your case is never judged on your current situation. So much time lapses that they request updated information over and over again. 
A vicious circle. You pay the law firm upfront anywhere from $1500 to 2,000. You pay in small increments of $250.
I was charged $500 when I moved within my own city. Their accounting people are rude and demanding when they want your money.
You gather all the paper work. You never talk to an attorney. All they do is pass on your information to the IRS. They do not advise you on anything.
This last four years have been hell! My situation started with a pre-mature withdrawal from my own retirement money when my company down-sized and I lost my job. 
I could not repay the funds before huge penalties and interest.$7,000 with constant accruing penalties and interest. I hired the firm in desperation to get the penalties stopped and reduce the amount.
All of this was a waste of money. I should have just payed the IRS for the rest of my life! Now my offer is rejected after four years because they waited nine months to make a decision on my last wave of current information. The IRS assumed I had the money to pay it by now.
Now I have  to pay four years of penalties that were on hold because of this case!  It will probably be $10,000 or more now. Plus I am out the $1500 I payed this rip-off firm.
It makes me wonder if they are not working with the IRS to rip you off.
I am a honest hard-working person barely making ends meet. It seems if you have a job and your not homeless, there is nothing this place can do for you. 
Wealthy people have loop-holes. The very low income have assitance. But, The ""average joe"" in the middle of the road is played for a fool! We foot the bill! This has ruined a large portion of my life. I will NEVER forget this as long as I live.

She even ask me if i can borrow from my family . I think that was a little ways out of bounds but talkin to her i was fighting a losing battle so we ended the call as her sayin that we will call back again. 
I tried asking for some information as to can you send me a billing statement showing that amount and in so if i agree to settle the account can you send me paperwork stating that you agree to the settlement with a signature and i'll sign it also and return it back to you and then we can set up a payment plan after tryin to compromicse the conversation still wind up with anger on her part, in other words she was in disagreement from the start, and now i'm constantly recieving phone calls at my job which i don't know how they got this military phone number, i ask the law office to stop callin me and contact me by mail,i still don't know how they got any of my phone numbers, but in doing so i tried calling them requesting information so that i can settle and pay off this account, at this time i am not getting no response i even gave them my military P.O. Box address in the month of October, still i'm gettin the same response a voice machine automated response. 
So at this point i'm tired of dealing with this law office due to the fact i am not getting no where and this account is still on my credit report.

										Thomas C ""Doc"" Miller is by far the worst lawyer in Colorado. He will sound good to you if you are in trouble but once you give him money your troubles have just begun with this guy.
He charged me $13,000 usd to take my case back in July 2005 and it is now Feb. 2006 He has done nothing in th 8 months that he has been employed by me.
I had a meeting with him in the middle of January and asked him if he knew what the charges against me were and his response was ""I don't know""
I asked him for a copy of all information that he found out regarding my case and an itemised account of what he did to charge me $13,000 usd (esentially 62 hours worth of work @ $200 us per hour) and he refused to give me either.
He hired an investigator who was his friend from the 60's and I asked to see his reports and my lawyer told me to get them myself, but while trying to do the job I paid this lawyer for I was told by the investigator that I wasn't he client and he only answers to my lawyer.
Does anyone see the problem here, I most certainly do. I have reported this guy to The State Supreme Court which files grievences against lawyers.
I highly recommend not using this guy for anything at all, especially court cases that involve your freedom or for that matter any other court cases.

										10 Truths about PPL
http//www.ppltruth.com
Truth 1. You will never get paid your residuals. All residuals go to your debit balance not to you.
It is theoretically possible that after you die your residuals will pay down your debit balance and your family may get them but your chances are slim to none. You will find this out after about a year in the business
when you don't receive your residuals. Also if you do not have your associate agreement and estate set
up properly the company keeps them; they do not automatically go to your spouse.
Truth 2. The company retention is 50% or less the first year. The weekly briefing is where they typically overstate this number at 70 or 80 percent to mislead you.
If you do some research they have to disclose it because they are a publicly traded company. Persistency
is a made up number by PPL. They like to quote it because they can manipulate it with the pre-cancels etc.
Truth 3. Chargebacks will kill you. Chargebacks will kill off over 97-99% of the associates that enter your business. They never talk about chargebacks until you find out when you don't get paid on business. Downline chargebacks lead to ruin. 
Truth 4. There are more X-Ring Earners and X-Platinums then there are current Ring Earners and Platinums.
This is because after they hit this level chargebacks eat up there income cutting their incomes by typically half. It is rare that they survive this. 
Truth 5. All the biggies have a special deal. 
They can't survive number 4. That's right. Darnell Self, Brian Carruthers, Kevin Rhea, Dave Savula, etc etc etc. all have special deals. 
Truth 6. Corporate does not care about you. The wishy washy ""this is your business"" quote is a lie. Corporate 
will hold your commissions any time they please without apology. This is cold hard business, not a big family as is portrayed.
Truth 7. The company may put you on as earned and cut your commissions at anytime for any reason.
In the associate agreement you signed you give them this right. For example they have just killed off over 220 associates without warning 
based on a formula they refuse to disclose. They claim it is poor persistency but many of the victims have good persistency. This is a scheme to fudge the bottom line. The company will lose millions long term based on this short term rip off of associate's income. UPDATE - The number is now over 600 and climbing. The stock has lost 9 points since this decision.
Truth 8. The stockholders are more important then you. 
See number 7. 
Truth 9. The attorneys are more important then you. 
Complaints about the attorneys rarely go anywhere. Prepaid Legal will threaten your associate agreement if you complain too much about the attorneys or lack of service.
Truth 10.  The corporate staff is more important then you. Even if the corporate staff makes mistakes to your detriment the company supports them. Corporate treats the associates like the lowest form of life. No Trust. No Consideration. Nothing. The above truths are absolutely real. If you are currently a PPL supporter that will change. Over time the above 10 truths
 will become clear and you will be shaken from the PPL illusion. These truths will devastate and ultimately destroy your business. I have seen many hurt and even destroyed by this company. It's all smoke and mirrors. But there is hope. More truths are being revealed then ever before. Find a way out of this evil empire. Get rid of the shackles of the Prepaid Legal slavery. Become free again. You will feel great!

Canoga Park, California U.S.A. ",,800-793-2354,Star Communications Ripoff They took everything I had in my account Canoga Park California,"
										I recieved a phone call at my home at about 6 p.m. on 1/26/06 in the evening and this man , in which I knew was not from this country explained to me how very simple it would be to recieve $500.00 in vouchers to be used at my local stores. I told him I thought it was crazy for him to think that I would believe that a company would just ""give away"" merchandise. He reassured me that it was no gimmick, that they market merchandise for theses comanys and the companys in return create these ""vouchures"" for thier consumers. This salesman which by the way gave me his name as Bradley Jones and his badgs I.D. which was 1223, said that it would only cost me $4.95 and I asked the salesman three times, is that all it is going to cost? and he confirmed his statement by having me speak to his Supervisor in which his name was Chris Trains. He reiterated everything his salesman said, plus assured me that once I recieved my package in the mail I could cancel immediately and there would be no charges. He said that as soon as I got off the phone with him I could call back the customer service number and also cancell. At that point I was convinced that this was lagitiment, because I had thier names, badge numbers, customer service number and the next person i would speak to would be a customer service representative that would give me a tracking number for my ""gift shopping spree vochures"". Once I gave the account information and the check number they patched me over to the customer rep. She had me listen to several questions and answer yes or no. I answered no to all questions, which pertained to three different vacations at $129.00 per. trip the recording also reiterated that if I chose not to accept the trips I had to cancel within 10 days of recieving the packet. Because I had said no to all questions, a lady came back on the phone and gave me the customer service number and my tracking number which was 02422160. and the call was than abruptly stopped. on 1/31/06 I recieved an insufficient funds notice in the mail. It stated that $129.90 was withdrawn from my account and I was charged a fee of $23.00 as well for bank fee. When I asked who this was that took from my account, it showed that it was Fantasy Vacations. The check number used was nothing I had in my check book! I immediately knew who had pulled the money from my account. It was Star Communications. I called thier customer service number and spoke to a customer rep. When I explained the situation and that I was not and staed I was not interested in any vacation promotions she said I agreed through the video tapeing setion of the phone call. I argued I didnt' and that they must keep those tapes on file in case of situations as this and I wanted to hear the tape. She than put me on hold for 20 minutes and her ""supervisor"" came on saying that they would reimburse the money within 4-6 weeks. On 2/1/06 I recieved another insufficient funds notice in the mail. This one was an attempt by Starr Communications to not try and get the $4.95 check once but twice and the odd this is the check number a gave them was 640 and they were trying to cash 2 checks for $4.95 with two different checks, #'s 277448 and 282157!!! I than returned another call to them asking them what the hell they were trying to pull and that I wanted a total refund including bounce check fees, because there were two more for $23.00 apiece for each attempt at trying to cash the other checks. This customer service reps. name was John and his badge ID number was 11043. On 2/6/06 I made another call because it was just a coincidence that where I work, I am a Program manager for an MR group home and Star Communications called, not knowing it was me, tried to pitch this same sales to me. I will tell you I let that sales person know just what I thought of thier scamming company and if they realized they even called a home of a resident that is able to take care of him self. The salesman put me on the line to speak to his supervisor. The supervisor in turn tried to do the same pitch, I started telling him how I felt and that I wanted a phone number to someone with more authority than him and he hung up on me. I immediately called back to speak to a represnetative. I was smart thsi time and taped the conversation. They reiterated on the tape that my full refund had gone out as of 2/1/06 and that it would take 4-6 weeks. Today it is 3/3/06 which will make it 4 weeks without seeing a check back and on 2/22/06 had just recieved the so called packet of been so longing to see...It is nothing that I couldn't have done my self on my own computer!!! So anyone seeing this do not fall for what I have fallen for. I was not so lucky to close my account before ny life was turned upside down!!!!.......Sicerley, Mike from Maine

Scottsdale, Arizona U.S.A. ",,800-793-2354,Maasen & Associates Firm dropped my case before going to trial and kept all my money Scottsdale Arizona,"
										I hired Scott Maasen of Maasen & Assoc. to represent me in a DUI case. He charged me a flat rate of $4,200.00 which he said was for the entire length of the case.  
There were no hourly charges and I called a friend who knew about things like this before I paid them and while they were in the room.  I made very sure I knew what the charges were and what they were for.  It was my first time ever seeking the advice of an attorney, I never needed one for anything before as I'd had nothing more than one speeding ticket in 40+ years of driving. I paid via my credit card and Scott told me not to worry and if I was worried about anything, to call any time.  A month or so later, I rec'd a voice mail from his associate informing me that he would be representing me.  I called him back and he was very rude and spoke to me as if he believed I was guilty and a total scumbag.  I told him I wasn't feeling comfortable and suggested we meet in person, that maybe that would make me feel more confident.  He did not think we needed to.  I called Maasen and Associates the next day after seeking advice of friends and explained to the office manager that I wanted to speak to Scott Maasen and why.  He wasn't in but she promised to give him the message.  
All this was done very politely.  The next I hear from the firm was just before New Year's when Scott called and said he was dropping my case.  I told him that was not my intention but he said if his associate could not make me happy, neither could he.  I asked him not to do that to me as my court day was in the next couple weeks but he simply told me that my paperwork and refund would be in the mail.  The paperwork and refund never came. I hired another attorney and told him of my experience with Maasen and he said that was wrong and that he should have refunded the entire amount as all he'd done was push the court date out some. He told me to write a letter to Maasen asking for my refund and I did.  I made several calls as well but only got the receptionist. 
Again, I was never anything but polite. Why blame the receptionist?  Finally, a couple months later, I received a letter from the firm and an itemized accounting.  They charged for every phone call, voice mail, copied piece of paper, for my new attorney to pick up my paperwork, for every message I left them... the total came to MORE than what I'd paid!  And they did nothing. We never got to a trial, they never represented me, they never interviewed the cops or my witness and I had hired them at a Flat rate!  Since then, I've spoken to several other attorney who all say this was a ripoff but none want the stigma of going up against another attorney.  I reported them to the State Bar Assoc. but I'm told this may take a long time.  Now I'm out nearly $10,000.00 that I cannot afford.  How could anyone do this kind of thing?  When I reported it to the State Bar, the woman who called to verify my information said that she was seeing more and more of this kind of thing, especially associated with DUIs.  I hope this will help someone else avoid a ripoff attorney and I hope Mr. Maasen gets his just rewards for his behavior.

										I agree with the previous writer who expressed this law firm is a big waste of money! I'm sure the firm would claim customer dissatisfaction is the result of a disgruntle few who have an en-ability to provide honest information. 
Nothing could be farther from the truth! I have been dealing with this firm for four years! I had to continually resubmit info because of the time lapses between the IRS and the firm. 
The firm always blames the IRS. Your case is never judged on your current situation. So much time lapses that they request updated information over and over again. 
A vicious circle. You pay the law firm upfront anywhere from $1500 to 2,000. You pay in small increments of $250.
I was charged $500 when I moved within my own city. Their accounting people are rude and demanding when they want your money.
You gather all the paper work. You never talk to an attorney. All they do is pass on your information to the IRS. They do not advise you on anything.
This last four years have been hell! My situation started with a pre-mature withdrawal from my own retirement money when my company down-sized and I lost my job. 
I could not repay the funds before huge penalties and interest.$7,000 with constant accruing penalties and interest. I hired the firm in desperation to get the penalties stopped and reduce the amount.
All of this was a waste of money. I should have just payed the IRS for the rest of my life! Now my offer is rejected after four years because they waited nine months to make a decision on my last wave of current information. The IRS assumed I had the money to pay it by now.
Now I have  to pay four years of penalties that were on hold because of this case!  It will probably be $10,000 or more now. Plus I am out the $1500 I payed this rip-off firm.
It makes me wonder if they are not working with the IRS to rip you off.
I am a honest hard-working person barely making ends meet. It seems if you have a job and your not homeless, there is nothing this place can do for you. 
Wealthy people have loop-holes. The very low income have assitance. But, The ""average joe"" in the middle of the road is played for a fool! We foot the bill! This has ruined a large portion of my life. I will NEVER forget this as long as I live.

She was forceful, pushy and developed an un professional attitude towards me as i tried to ask her question such, as how did you obtain this phone number, i don't have any monies of that amount at this time.. She even ask me if i can borrow from my family . I think that was a little ways out of bounds but talkin to her i was fighting a losing battle so we ended the call as her sayin that we will call back again. 
I tried asking for some information as to can you send me a billing statement showing that amount and in so if i agree to settle the account can you send me paperwork stating that you agree to the settlement with a signature and i'll sign it also and return it back to you and then we can set up a payment plan after tryin to compromicse the conversation still wind up with anger on her part, in other words she was in disagreement from the start, and now i'm constantly recieving phone calls at my job which i don't know how they got this military phone number, i ask the law office to stop callin me and contact me by mail,i still don't know how they got any of my phone numbers, but in doing so i tried calling them requesting information so that i can settle and pay off this account, at this time i am not getting no response i even gave them my military P.O. Box address in the month of October, still i'm gettin the same response a voice machine automated response. 
So at this point i'm tired of dealing with this law office due to the fact i am not getting no where and this account is still on my credit report. So this is why i myself would like to file a complaint against P. Scott Lowery Law Office. After reading several articles about this law office i can see i'm not the only one dealing with this Law office.

										Thomas C ""Doc"" Miller is by far the worst lawyer in Colorado. He will sound good to you if you are in trouble but once you give him money your troubles have just begun with this guy.
He charged me $13,000 usd to take my case back in July 2005 and it is now Feb. 2006 He has done nothing in th 8 months that he has been employed by me.
I had a meeting with him in the middle of January and asked him if he knew what the charges against me were and his response was ""I don't know""
I asked him for a copy of all information that he found out regarding my case and an itemised account of what he did to charge me $13,000 usd (esentially 62 hours worth of work @ $200 us per hour) and he refused to give me either.
He hired an investigator who was his friend from the 60's and I asked to see his reports and my lawyer told me to get them myself, but while trying to do the job I paid this lawyer for I was told by the investigator that I wasn't he client and he only answers to my lawyer.
Does anyone see the problem here, I most certainly do. I have reported this guy to The State Supreme Court which files grievences against lawyers.
I highly recommend not using this guy for anything at all, especially court cases that involve your freedom or for that matter any other court cases.

										10 Truths about PPL
http//www.ppltruth.com
Truth 1. You will never get paid your residuals. All residuals go to your debit balance not to you.
It is theoretically possible that after you die your residuals will pay down your debit balance and your family may get them but your chances are slim to none. You will find this out after about a year in the business
when you don't receive your residuals. Also if you do not have your associate agreement and estate set
up properly the company keeps them; they do not automatically go to your spouse.
Truth 2. The company retention is 50% or less the first year. The weekly briefing is where they typically overstate this number at 70 or 80 percent to mislead you.
If you do some research they have to disclose it because they are a publicly traded company. Persistency
is a made up number by PPL. They like to quote it because they can manipulate it with the pre-cancels etc.
Truth 3. Chargebacks will kill you. Chargebacks will kill off over 97-99% of the associates that enter your business. They never talk about chargebacks until you find out when you don't get paid on business. Downline chargebacks lead to ruin. 
Truth 4. There are more X-Ring Earners and X-Platinums then there are current Ring Earners and Platinums.
This is because after they hit this level chargebacks eat up there income cutting their incomes by typically half. It is rare that they survive this. 
Truth 5. All the biggies have a special deal. 
They can't survive number 4. That's right. Darnell Self, Brian Carruthers, Kevin Rhea, Dave Savula, etc etc etc. all have special deals. 
Truth 6. Corporate does not care about you. The wishy washy ""this is your business"" quote is a lie. Corporate 
will hold your commissions any time they please without apology. This is cold hard business, not a big family as is portrayed.
Truth 7. The company may put you on as earned and cut your commissions at anytime for any reason.
In the associate agreement you signed you give them this right. For example they have just killed off over 220 associates without warning 
based on a formula they refuse to disclose. They claim it is poor persistency but many of the victims have good persistency. This is a scheme to fudge the bottom line. The company will lose millions long term based on this short term rip off of associate's income. UPDATE - The number is now over 600 and climbing. The stock has lost 9 points since this decision.
Truth 8. The stockholders are more important then you. 
See number 7. 
Truth 9. The attorneys are more important then you. 
Complaints about the attorneys rarely go anywhere. Prepaid Legal will threaten your associate agreement if you complain too much about the attorneys or lack of service.
Truth 10.  The corporate staff is more important then you. Even if the corporate staff makes mistakes to your detriment the company supports them. Corporate treats the associates like the lowest form of life. No Trust. No Consideration. Nothing. The above truths are absolutely real. If you are currently a PPL supporter that will change.

Canoga Park, California U.S.A. ",,800-853-4000,Star Communications Ripoff They took everything I had in my account Canoga Park California,"
										I recieved a phone call at my home at about 6 p.m. on 1/26/06 in the evening and this man , in which I knew was not from this country explained to me how very simple it would be to recieve $500.00 in vouchers to be used at my local stores. I told him I thought it was crazy for him to think that I would believe that a company would just ""give away"" merchandise. He reassured me that it was no gimmick, that they market merchandise for theses comanys and the companys in return create these ""vouchures"" for thier consumers. This salesman which by the way gave me his name as Bradley Jones and his badgs I.D. which was 1223, said that it would only cost me $4.95 and I asked the salesman three times, is that all it is going to cost? and he confirmed his statement by having me speak to his Supervisor in which his name was Chris Trains. He reiterated everything his salesman said, plus assured me that once I recieved my package in the mail I could cancel immediately and there would be no charges. He said that as soon as I got off the phone with him I could call back the customer service number and also cancell. At that point I was convinced that this was lagitiment, because I had thier names, badge numbers, customer service number and the next person i would speak to would be a customer service representative that would give me a tracking number for my ""gift shopping spree vochures"". Once I gave the account information and the check number they patched me over to the customer rep. She had me listen to several questions and answer yes or no. I answered no to all questions, which pertained to three different vacations at $129.00 per. trip the recording also reiterated that if I chose not to accept the trips I had to cancel within 10 days of recieving the packet. Because I had said no to all questions, a lady came back on the phone and gave me the customer service number and my tracking number which was 02422160. and the call was than abruptly stopped. on 1/31/06 I recieved an insufficient funds notice in the mail. It stated that $129.90 was withdrawn from my account and I was charged a fee of $23.00 as well for bank fee. When I asked who this was that took from my account, it showed that it was Fantasy Vacations. The check number used was nothing I had in my check book! I immediately knew who had pulled the money from my account. It was Star Communications. I called thier customer service number and spoke to a customer rep. When I explained the situation and that I was not and staed I was not interested in any vacation promotions she said I agreed through the video tapeing setion of the phone call. I argued I didnt' and that they must keep those tapes on file in case of situations as this and I wanted to hear the tape. She than put me on hold for 20 minutes and her ""supervisor"" came on saying that they would reimburse the money within 4-6 weeks. On 2/1/06 I recieved another insufficient funds notice in the mail. This one was an attempt by Starr Communications to not try and get the $4.95 check once but twice and the odd this is the check number a gave them was 640 and they were trying to cash 2 checks for $4.95 with two different checks, #'s 277448 and 282157!!! I than returned another call to them asking them what the hell they were trying to pull and that I wanted a total refund including bounce check fees, because there were two more for $23.00 apiece for each attempt at trying to cash the other checks. This customer service reps. name was John and his badge ID number was 11043. On 2/6/06 I made another call because it was just a coincidence that where I work, I am a Program manager for an MR group home and Star Communications called, not knowing it was me, tried to pitch this same sales to me. I will tell you I let that sales person know just what I thought of thier scamming company and if they realized they even called a home of a resident that is able to take care of him self. The salesman put me on the line to speak to his supervisor. The supervisor in turn tried to do the same pitch, I started telling him how I felt and that I wanted a phone number to someone with more authority than him and he hung up on me. I immediately called back to speak to a represnetative. I was smart thsi time and taped the conversation. They reiterated on the tape that my full refund had gone out as of 2/1/06 and that it would take 4-6 weeks. Today it is 3/3/06 which will make it 4 weeks without seeing a check back and on 2/22/06 had just recieved the so called packet of been so longing to see...It is nothing that I couldn't have done my self on my own computer!!! So anyone seeing this do not fall for what I have fallen for. I was not so lucky to close my account before ny life was turned upside down!!!!.......Sicerley, Mike from Maine

Maasen & Associates,"  Maasen & Associates  14500 Northsite Boulevard, Suite 216 
Scottsdale, Arizona U.S.A. ",,800-867-3955,Maasen & Associates Firm dropped my case before going to trial and kept all my money Scottsdale Arizona,"
										I hired Scott Maasen of Maasen & Assoc. to represent me in a DUI case. He charged me a flat rate of $4,200.00 which he said was for the entire length of the case.  
There were no hourly charges and I called a friend who knew about things like this before I paid them and while they were in the room.  I made very sure I knew what the charges were and what they were for.  It was my first time ever seeking the advice of an attorney, I never needed one for anything before as I'd had nothing more than one speeding ticket in 40+ years of driving. I paid via my credit card and Scott told me not to worry and if I was worried about anything, to call any time.  A month or so later, I rec'd a voice mail from his associate informing me that he would be representing me.  I called him back and he was very rude and spoke to me as if he believed I was guilty and a total scumbag.  I told him I wasn't feeling comfortable and suggested we meet in person, that maybe that would make me feel more confident.  He did not think we needed to.  I called Maasen and Associates the next day after seeking advice of friends and explained to the office manager that I wanted to speak to Scott Maasen and why.  He wasn't in but she promised to give him the message.  
All this was done very politely.  The next I hear from the firm was just before New Year's when Scott called and said he was dropping my case.  I told him that was not my intention but he said if his associate could not make me happy, neither could he.  I asked him not to do that to me as my court day was in the next couple weeks but he simply told me that my paperwork and refund would be in the mail.  The paperwork and refund never came. I hired another attorney and told him of my experience with Maasen and he said that was wrong and that he should have refunded the entire amount as all he'd done was push the court date out some. He told me to write a letter to Maasen asking for my refund and I did.  I made several calls as well but only got the receptionist. 
Again, I was never anything but polite. Why blame the receptionist?  Finally, a couple months later, I received a letter from the firm and an itemized accounting.  They charged for every phone call, voice mail, copied piece of paper, for my new attorney to pick up my paperwork, for every message I left them... the total came to MORE than what I'd paid!  And they did nothing. We never got to a trial, they never represented me, they never interviewed the cops or my witness and I had hired them at a Flat rate!  Since then, I've spoken to several other attorney who all say this was a ripoff but none want the stigma of going up against another attorney.  I reported them to the State Bar Assoc. but I'm told this may take a long time.  Now I'm out nearly $10,000.00 that I cannot afford.  How could anyone do this kind of thing?  When I reported it to the State Bar, the woman who called to verify my information said that she was seeing more and more of this kind of thing, especially associated with DUIs.  I hope this will help someone else avoid a ripoff attorney and I hope Mr. Maasen gets his just rewards for his behavior.

										Told me that there services were wonderful and I had an attorney at any time for anything.  After I joined and explained my problem to them I was given a number of a lawfirm to call for my problem.  The attorney was rude and the treatment was terrible.  They made me feel stupid in a demeaning way. I was pretty much told that I was SOL in my issue and to get over it. Knowing something about the law I knew I was running out of time with my issue so I contacted another attorney of my choice. Well it seems that I needed to file a Motion in order to protect myself within a reasonable amount of time or I would be SOL.  
I complained to PrePaid with as it seems no avail... I found out the person that is selling this sham is and independent contractor or Vice President of Marketing, whatever he called himself.  Its a shame that companies such as prepaid take advantage of people who are in need of legal aid made to think  that this is a good membership.  For some of us lawyer fees and charges are so high that there is just no possible way, so we end up getting screwed.  Shame on prepaid legal for doing business in this manner. I was told that they will continue to charge your credit card even after you cancel membership.

										This guy is exactly why you hear warnings about doing business with an attorney. He specializes in landlord - tenant law and used his legal knowledge to take financial advantage of me. 
I leased my upscale townhouse to him and had problems from day one. He consistently paid his rent late and brought a unauthorized dog into the property. 
He refused to pay the last two months rent on his lease. He knew exactly how long the legal process would take to remove him. I had to go to court and get an eviction order to get him out of my property. Afterwards, it took a constable to finally force him out!
My once perfectly restored townhouse was totally trashed! My expensive, two year old carpet is soaked with dog urine and will have to be replaced. The once lush landscaping was totally neglected and is now just dirt. 
The real kicker is that this guy is currently running for public office in Dallas County. He is asking our voters to elect him as a county judge! Just goes to show that you never really know about a candidates character.

Johnson City, Tennessee U.S.A. ",,800-989-6590,"H. Wayne Graves Attorney ripoff, possibly blew my case, stole $500.00 and disappeared Johnson City Tennessee","
										I was injured while lifting at work in August of 2005. (In September 2005 my company sent me to a doctor they had ""in their pocket"" at Well At Work in Findlay OHIO, a Dr. Habib, who looked at but did not touch the hernia, after leading me to believe she was really going to help me, to ""write down everything i could remember"" on the 10 page report, then only gave me 5 pages of the report when i asked for copies... her diagnosis was, after asking me every quesion in the book, to tell me that i am 40 years old, that everyone falls apart when they turn 40 years old, i have a hernia because i am 40 years old. The company won't let me get a second opinion at a work comp doctor because they say they have a doctor's report that says my injury is not work related. that is another issue, however. 
now, back to the lawyer...) 
In Nov 2005 i was home, and my nephew's neighbor Cora told me about an attorney that she knew, H. Wayne Graves from Johnson City, TN (she actually goes to AA meetings with him)and gave me his number. She said he was very good at workman comp. The number she gave me was 423-929-7338, which is the number on his card. His cell phone number is listed as 423-747-3200. I tried for a week to contact him. When he finally called me back, my caller ID on my cell phone confirmed that he had called me from the number ending in 7338. My phone records also reflect that as well. Thus began the nightmare.
He began to tell me what i should do, and to fax to him my report of the injury. But before i could get his fax number, he ""had to go"" and i could not contact him again until mid-February when i was home again. All i could do was leave messages on his business and cell phones. Once he learned i was home again, then he finally returned my call. We arranged a time to meet at his home on Mistletoe Ct in Johnson City, TN, on Feb 23rd 2006, but he made sure I also understood he only had 45 minutes to talk to him. His office is in his basement. 
He is a heavy smoker and i coughed like crazy while in his office, so we moved outside. I presented my case, he presented me with a contract, he asked for $500.00 to retain his services, and that was the last time i heard from him except for March 04th 2006 when he finally returned my call to tell me that he hadn't done anything yet. He said he wanted the information i was supposed to send him by email, I said I had sent him several emails beginning on Feb 23rd, ending on March 02nd. He hadn't seen them yet, and said he would get his girlfriend to pull them for him.
That was our last contact.
He knows I am on the road and the only feasible way of contacting me is through phone or email. He has failed to do either.
On March 10 and 11 i called him several times to get a status report, but he was unreachable. On March 17 and 18 i called him several more times to get a status report but he was unreachable. On the 18th i left a message on his phone that he was fired for breach of contract and failure to perform. I also sent an email to that effect to him. I told him to call me to make arrangements to return my $500 and sent emails with that same request. My emails were cc'd to a number of people, including the District Attorney, so they are aware of what he is doing. After he failed to respond, I gave him 4 email notices and 2 phone messages that i would be sending someone who would be duly authorized by me to retrieve my money. Those 2 people arrived at his house/office on April 08, 2006 and though he was home, he failed to answer his door. I sent him an email, then left a phone message, both saying that he left me no choice but to seek the revocation of his law license if that is all the better he can treat me. 
He called me 5 times in the next 15 minutes, but i did not answer the phone. He had his chance for leniency. I sent him a ""Cease and Desist"" email, ordering him to stop calling me. I received 5 more calls from him over the next 3 hours while i was on the phone with my new attorney, who is positive that Wayne will lose his law license over this.   
On April 10th, 2006 at 3:10 pm eastern daylight time i received a call from Wayne's girlfriend, calling my cell phone to harrass me, blocking the number (it was the number ending in 7338) and i asked the individual to identify herself 3 times before i hung up on her. A coworker heard my end of the converation, and called her boyfriend who is in upper level security who told me how to find out what the blocked number was. (It's been a long time since I was in law enforcement, before the advent of the PC)
I received 3 more calls from the number ending in 
7338 during the day, unblocked these times, as i was trying to make calls to the clerk of court about filing misdemeanor phone harrassment charges against both Wayne and his girlfriend. I also called the Distict Attorney's office again (I had talked to them last week about Wayne) and filled them in again today.
A neighbor of Wayne's whom I know can verify that there has been a lot of wierdness and domestic disputes at his house over the years, made the statement, ""how many lawyers do you know who operate out of their house?""
Looking for an attorney? Can I recommend to you someone?
Retaliation? He better not even think of it. You don't steal $500 from me, and get away with it.

										I was involved in a car accident in July of 2005. I was rear-ended by an employee for Highlights electrical. My car was damaged and therefore had to be repaired in an auto shop, which Highlights insurance, Unitrin Business Insurance, said they would cover. I got my car fixed, which cost $1800 and of course did not have to pay since it was covered by the insurance company. About a month later, I received a chech from Unitrin for $577. I had no clue what this check was for since I had not yet reached a settlement for the accident; Therefore, I did not cash the check since I did not know what it is for. On April 26, 2006, nine months after the incident, I was contacted by the Wilber Law firm. They claimed that they were representing Unitrin Business Insurance who they said mistakenly sent me the $500 check that they were supposed to send to the company who fixed my car. They said that since I had the check, it is my responsibility to pay the $577 even though I did not cash it. I asked the attorney to explain to me why this was and he refused to give me a straight answer. He continued to claim that I was a dishonest person, even though I never cashed the check. He threatened that if I do not pay $577, I will be sued for the amount. There is no way that I owe the $577, it is the responsibility of Unitrin to send this amount to the company that fixed my car. Unitrin made a mistake by sending the check to the wrong person, and now they expect me to pay the amount that they are responsible for. They are trying to rip me off so that they don't have to pay the amount that they are responsible for.

										I contacted the law firm to get help with my tax problems. I contacted the ""800"" number and spoke to an individual. I was told by the person on the other line about the services. 
I was told that the law ofice was going to file a offer in compromise and if that offer was not accepted they were going to file a second and last offer for the same price. 
I agreed to make payments for a year and right after I made the last payment, I was given notice that the law office was dropping me as a client and that my paperwork didn't get to them on time. 
While I was paying my monthly payments I had to change address and I was charged $500 extra for moving from one place to another with in the same town. 
I ended up paying a total of $4,400 and my tax problem was not solved. I have been trying to get my money back for the last year and they only refunded me $695 total.
They claim that only one offer was going to be filed but the person who I made the deal by phone (Steve Polito or Pulido) told me that I was going to get a second offert filed if the first one was not accepted by the IRS. The conversation was recorded by them or so I was told.
This bunch of ""legal thiefs"" make their money by taking advantage of unfortunate people like me and others that end up in the IRS claw for one reason or another.
I feel the law firm deceived me by offering to file two offers with the IRS at the time I signed up with them and before the main contact was signed and changing them later to their advantage.
I feel powerless against this people but I know they did wrong and they are filling their pockets with poor people's money. Please I am desperate if there is a way to get them back and collect the rest of my money back with out breaking the law, i am all for it. Thank you

Phoenix Arizona","
										If you have been convicted of a dui or extreme dui in the state of Arizona DO NOT SEEK LEGAL COUNSEL!!  90% of cases that are tried before a judge result in fines and jail time and there is nothing you can do about it.  
But don't worry - the fines and jail time are not as bad as you might think.  My case included a charge of extreme dui - 0.19 blood alcohol content at time of arrest.  I received 10 days at Tent City with work/school release and about $1800 in fines for which I now pay $50/month until it's paid off.  Let me settle all of your misconceptions about jail time right now.  No, you do not have to wear pink underwear.  You are in the tents with hundreds of other dui convictees who are all pissed off for the same reason.  Any why are they pissed off?  Because they paid way too much for a lawyer who did absolutely nothing for them except show up at a couple of court dates for you.  
Trust me - 10 days at Tent City and $1800 in fines is a cake walk when you see how much lawyers, particularly Phillips Law Firm, will charge for their services.  At a minimum you are looking at $4000 for their ""exceptional"" representation.  My original case billed out at $7000 when I said no way and they dropped it to a 'low' fee of $5800.  
I am telling you this because these law firms are taking advantage of the uneducated when it comes to dui arrests.  I am disgusted with the rich getting richer and that slimy looking lawyer you see on TV who owns Phillip's.  He is not a respectable lawyer.  While he may have completed his education in an Ivy League school and taken the BAR exam, and barely passed, he is out to get your hard earned money.  
If you really want to get a lawyer look for a lower fee, around $1000 or free representation.  They will do the same job that the big ones do.  So, after all is said and done - jail time served and fines being paid off - I am still at odds on how or even if I should pay them back.  If I had only been smarter when their sales person, like a grimy car salesman, persuades you to sign a contract with them.  Don't listen to him.  Tell him to get a real job that actually encompasses a skill other than that, that is on par with cold sales calling.  
If you need any assistance, free of charge, in dealing with your case don't hesitate to email me.

										I'm looking for an ""honest"" lawyer who will take this case ""pro bono"" and take on a ""system"" of overt exploitation.  This is the city where young adults are being framed and older adults are living in fear, as well.  See:  ""Duke Lacrosse Cases"", ""Michael Peterson""case, ""Greg Lee"", etc.  The law firm of Marsh & Marsh, undoubtedly, seeks to gain the reputation of another law firm, Debnam, Narron, Wyche, Saintsing & Myers, Raleigh, NC, who was reported by Jon, Little River, NC or SC (See: Rip-off Report, submitted 6/18/05 and modified 6/19/05).  The Complainant, ""Jon"", in that report describes  that NC law firm as being the ""Toxic Waste of Attorneys"".  You can determine if Marsh & Marsh share that title or are ranked much higher in being ""Toxic Waste"", after you read what they did and are attempting to do, presently, along with their mis-counseled client(s).
Before my decease Mother died in 2002, this law firm worked diligently to defame ME by representing frivolous demands.  In a letter date Sept. 9, 2003, after my Mother passed, I received a letter from them asking me to deed over the property that I had clear title on, as evicenced by CENTEX Mortgage Company, World known conglomerate financial institution had conducted a ""Title Search"" on.  Then, in 2004 filed a complaint with only my brother's verified signature, to get the property re-deeded to my brother and sister, claiming that this was an ""Estate"" matter, when the Clerk of Court is authorized to conduct such a matter.  In that complaint they enter slanderous, deranged allegations against me and against my Mother,, in an attempt to make us look ""incompetent"" (Be sure to see:  www.NcAppellateCourts.org, Case:  ""DeVone v DeVone, Click ""Hi Res"". then, ""Record on Appeal"" (there you will see, in the ""Transcript"", page 5, you will read where I am protesting & contesting the entry of slanderous, defamatory allegations about my Mother's Health Record, supposedly conducted by the Duke Geriatrics Center, indicating that she had a ""Horrible Decease"", affecting her competency, whereas, her Death Certificate show that she died of a natural death.  I had that property in dispute (a house) constructed in the 1970's and returned to Durham to do so, leaving Greensboro, NC, with the agreement between the 2 of us that 1/2 ownership was mine while she lived and 100%, if she passed before me.  No other relative contributed to the construction of that house.  I WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF A PROBATE HEARING  TO CONTEST HER WILLTHAT COMPLETELY EXCLUDING ME, WITH MY NAME EVEN MIS-SPELLED.
     Are there any HONEST LAWYERS IN THIS COUNTRY?  I received a letter from Marsh & Marsh during the Memorial Day observance period demanding that I vacate the property by Sept. 9, 2006 causing   pain and suffering, since I am a ""disabled"" veteran of the Vietnam Era.

										Marsh & Marsh Law Firm, undoubtedly, seeks to gain and/or surpass the reputation of another law firm who was reported by ""Jon"", Little River, NC or SC (See:  Rip-Off Report submitted 6/18/05 and modified 6/19/05).  The Complainant, ""Jon"", in that report described that law firm as being the ""Toxic Waste of Attorneys"".  
I, also, had to go up against this law firm, who ""Jon"" thought could not be beaten (See:  Palisades Collections, Rip-Off Report submitted 6/24/04 and modified 5/16/05.  I beat them, as Judge Richard Channey, respected judge in the Durham Co. Court system, reinforced Judge Pattie Harrison's demand that that law firm produced ""verified"" evidence of their claims.  
The case was dismissed by the court and the law firm voluntarily dismissed.  At the same time of this law suit, Marsh & Marsh had filed a complaint to have the house that I had constructed for my Mother re-deeded to my relatives.
Marsh and Marsh still didn't get the message about what they have run into.  Before my case prevailed that day, a Duke University Physics professor who chose to represent himself (""Pro Se"") as I had done lost.  I reveal this because it is obvious that Marsh and Marsh and those that they represent don't think too much of themselves or the capabilities of their relatives, friends or associates.  
Before my deceased Mother died in 2002, Marsh and Marsh worked diligently to defame ME, by representing frivolous demands.  In 2003, I received a letter from asking me to re-deed  one half of the house that I had constructed for my Mother in the 70's, with the understanding that I would own such, entirely, when she died.  Also, I have lived in that house for over 20 years, far exceeding ""Adverse Possession Laws"" in the State, also, having paid the property taxes, thereon, for over 7 years.  
In 2004, Marsh and Marsh filed a complaint in the Durham Co. Superior Court, full of ""slanderous"", defamatory allegations, claiming to be representing their client(s), my brother & sister(now deceased), without even having the signature of my sister, thereon.  That might be ""legal"", if this were an ""Estate"" matter, however, in NC the Clerk of Superior of Court does the filing, therefor.  
It is obvious that this law firm believes that they can ""swindle"" my relatives out of MY HOUSE.  However, I do believe that as they go further and further, they expose themselves as ""flim-flam"" artists, who have most likely done the same to countless numbers of others!
Because Marsh and Marsh entered slanderous, defamatory allegations against my Mother's reputation, using what was suppose to be an authentic Duke Geriatics Clinic Medical Report, there will be no end to MY relentless quest to expose them, et al.  These defamatory allegations were attempts make my Mother appear to be ""incompetent"", as they have attempted to make me appear as being such.  Who's ""incompetent""?  
I have reported the most recent action of Marsh and Marsh to ---- a conglomerate in the real estate world, who wants to know why they were not included as co-defendants in the Marsh's law suit, since they have a vested interest in the property.  The most recent episode of incompetency by Marsh and Marsh is a letter sent to me a week before ""Memorial Day""(as I am a diabled Vietnam Era Veteran), demanding that I vacate the property, since they managed to maneuver in court and get a ""default"" against me, claiming that I had not answered their complaint, whereas, the case was in the court system for over a year, meaning that I was going into court to protect my interest and that of CENTEX, since the matter should not have been in court in the first place.
If there is an HONEST LAWYER who would like to assist, ""Pro Bono"", to rectify this matter, please contact me immediately at::  (((PERSONAL INFORMATION REDACTED)))

Greensboro, North Carolina U.S.A. ",,817-800-7751,"LVNV Funding, Weinstein Law Offices Harassment of Credit Card Bill, Passed the Statue of Limitations, Ripoff Greensboro North Carolina","
										In 2002 I stopped paying on a Providian credit card account that was opened in 1999. 
Providian would not bargain to lower the 35% intrest rate and the $100 payment was not lowering the balance.
I informed Providian in May 2002,I would have to stop paying on the account due to financial hardships.
LVNV Funding and the Law office of Weinstein of Greensboro, NC (336-272-3556) has called me daily Monday - Sunday as late as 10:00pm and even on my job telling me I must pay or they will sue me or put a judgment against me.
Donna Holt of the Law office Of Weinstein in Greensboro sent an affidavit by the sheriff department in December 2005, telling me I must send a reply by Jan 15, 2006 of my intent to pay $3,148.08.00. She said she will sue for this amount and any interest owed up until the time the account is paid in full. 
I hired a lawyer- Ben Williams from Louisburg, NC from the office of Jolly Williamson and Williamson (919-496-4154)to file a reply back to Robert M. Weinstein of Weinstein Law Office in Greensboro, NC, stating this account was past the statue of limittions and even though the account was charged off, I would send good faith money as settlement in the amount of $1000.00 if they would send back a confirmation to agree.  
Ben Williamson communicated verbally to me, the collector (LVNV) would not agree to the settlement offer and I needed to borrow, get a loan or sell something, to repay the money.
I found out Ben Williams never filed the reply to the clerk of court of Franklinton N.C. nor to LVNV on my behalf.
Ben Williamson called me at work on 5/24/06 to inform me he had held off the Debt collector attorney at Weinstein as long as he could and if I did not pay the amount owed, a Judgment would be filed against me. On May 30th, 2006 Robert M. Weinstein sent a letter to Ben Williamson to forward a judment entered against me in favor of $2,830.78 at 8% intrest, together with the court cost. Robert M. Weinstein stated, I needed to call their office 10 days from the date of the May 30th letter, to make arrangement for payments or call toll free 1-800-789-4529 in reference to file #05-CVD-1248.
I made a good faith settlement to the best of my finanical abilities even though this account is past the statue of limitations - they verbally refused this according to Williamson. I have nothing more to offer or say to them.
I am at a lost - I trusted a lawyer who in turn, took my money and did not represent me as he said he would.
Weinstein Law office /LVNV Funding, LLC (Providian Financial Corp)keep harassing me for an account that has been charged off since 2002. 
What can I do to remove this Judgment against me and to have them cease communication with me on this matter?

										I paid $4000 to Roni Lynn Deutch in 2001 when my husband was laid off of his job and I was attending college to receive my teaching credential and was told by April (one of the paralegals) that we would only have to pay $55 on a $40,000 tax debt by filing an Offer In Compromise with the IRS.  
No work was completed by Roni Lynn Deutch.  All I received were harassing phone calls by their accounting department.  I paid the retainer on time and once the retainer was paid I was constantly asked to provide more information.  Everytime I  called to see what the status of my case was I never received a return phone call. I have had to call the IRS myself to place myself and my husband as non-collectible.  
Now we are both back at work and we are no longer in the position to file an offer in compromise.  The IRS has filed a tax lien against us and will soon be trying to collect money that we shouldn't have had to pay since we were in such a bad financial position and on welfare, etc. Now we've incurred more debt which the IRS doesn't consider and our lives and credit are ruined because of this attorney.

										When I first signed on with Pre-Paid Legal, they informed me of their Identity Theft Shield program (for an additional charge, of course) which I declined to take. 
Once I got my membership package, I noticed my last name was spelled incorrectly. I called customer service who assured me the error would be corrected.
Their interesting method of ""correction"" was to open a SECOND account on me, deftly adding the Identity Theft Shield coverage to my now two(!) active memberships.
Another call to PPL's customer service center provided me with their OWN internal complaint number, as the representative informed that some of the field agents ""got a little zealous"" with the Identity Theft Shield enrollments. I was assured this would be taken care of straight away.
In the interim, I had switched my method of payment from by-the-month on one credit card, to a semi-annual payment to be charged to a different credit card. God help me, but this was simply far too much for them to handle.
The semi-annual payment switch went off without a hitch. However, this in NO WAY stopped them from continuing to collect the monthly fees (Identity Theft Shield coverage included!) from my previous credit card.
Despite a flurry of phone calls, letters and emails, this continued for over three months. I finally threw up my hands and demanded they close any and all account(s).
I have had to have my original credit card account closed because of fraudulent use and I have lodged a formal complaint with the Better Business Bureau of Oklahoma, since that is where their home office is.
Oh, and by the way, in today's mail I got my renewal billing notice from Pre-Paid Legal, complete with the caveat that this fee will be automatically deducted from my credit card should they not receive a written notice of intent to terminate the membership!

i was intimidated and afraid so i started paying the attorney. first it was 500.00 dollars to take the freeze off of my account, after that i would send what i wanted every month.  this attorney was collecting this money for a company called colorado investment capital located in hurst, texas.
colorado capital investment bought the account from providian bank, everytime i would call colorado investment capital to find out information about this account, i was told to speak to the attorney's office.  i called the attorney's office, and spoke with a person by the name of mr. barrios, he was rude, and threatening to me, so i hung up on him.
i continued to send my monthly payments.  i filed my income tax in january,2006, i called allen rosenthal's office, because i wanted to pay off the balance i owed, when i called his number a recording came on saying that his number was disconnected.
i called information to see if he had changed his number, but to no success.  i than stopped sending him payments because i did not know what happened to his office.  low and behold on april 24, 2006, i went to the atm machine to withdraw some money, to find out allen rosenthal put a freeze on both of my checking accounts, without any notice from his office in 31/2 months, no forwarding address, no summonse, no phone call.
i than went to civil court, and filed a order to show cause, that stopped allen rosenthal from accessing  my checking account, until we went to court.  after i filed the order to show cause, i started getting phone calls from mr. barrios to call him back, saying to me that we did not have to go to court, i did not return his call.
i was than sent an income execution to garnish my salary, now remember all of this happened before my appearance in civil court, but i did not respond to allen rosenthal's cronies.
i appeared in civil court on may 15, 2006, of course allen rosenthal did not appear, he send his partner ira sitzer, i quess he was suppose to intimidate me. mr. sitzer started telling the judge he should not approve my order of show cause, but the judge did.  sitzer was asking the judge for me to    give 1,200 dollars, i told the judge i could not afford it that day, because i had my rent to pay, and that would not leave me any money to pay the rest of my bills, since allen rosenthal had a freeze on my account since april 24, 2006, the judge agreeded with me.
the stipulation of settlement is for me to pay 200.00 dollars, monthly until the balance is paid in full, the judge ask me did i agree with the agreement i said that i did, the balance on the account was 2,100 dollars.  mr. sitzer did not like the terms of the agreement, but he had no choice but to accept it.  
i also filed an complaint with the american bar association against this law firm who's code of professional responsibility is reprehensible.
none of us as consumers have to tolerant the behaviour of unsrupulous, greedy lawyers,or collection agencies, we have rights, and  should be able to exercise them.

										I was in the process of putting all of my debts into a credit couseseling service.  I had one credit card through Household Bank.  This account was turned over to weltman, and they refused to work out a payment arrangement.  I even called them personally to work something out.  I was told by Mr. Lance Davis, that it was my own da__ fault for getting into money troubles.  They were going to sue me, no matter what.  I then told him that i might as well file got bancruptcy........... then he's never get his money.  I was bluffing.  I went round and round with them, trying to work something out. 
I even tried to do a half payment over the phone.  I gave them my account info to do a check by phone.  The amount they told my bank the check was for was $150.00 more then we had discussed.  Once again Lance Davis was who I was dealing with.  Well, needless to say I filed a stop payment.  This was over 1 year ago.  
I got the standard garnishment papers, called again to work something out.... they had no concern I had to take a $12,000 a year paycut due to a new contract.  I was then sent a court decision, on a court date I was NEVER served........
I contacted the court and made payments to the court, to try and avoid garnishments. 
This Mr. Davis called me daily, at home and at work.......he then started harassing my company's payroll girl. 
After 7 or 8 different letters, court papers and such I requested a payoff balance.  I wanted to pay it off and get them off my back.  I had 5 diffenet amounts, and just wanted a concrete amount of what I had to pay.
This took them 6 months to get to me. And the balance changed daily.....they were still charging my interest!!!  how can they do this???
One June 20 I finally got my letter, 6 days later, I got a court hearing/garnishment again.  They then put a hold on my checking account..... they didn't even give me time to pay them !!!  I called them and told them I'd do anything to pay it off.  I was told to Western Union them the money.  I could not do a check by phone or a credit card payment.  I had a bunced check, but it was actually a stop payment.  They had also somehow put a freeze on my checking account !!!  I managed to get the money that day and sent it via W.U.  The next day I called to tell them to take the freeze off of my account, which was suppossed to happen 45 minutes after the money was wired.  This did not happen and the money the had frozen was also taken out of my acount.  
I was told I'd have to wait 4 weeks for my refund.  I then suggested they wire the money they owed me.  Of course, this was not an option, accoring to Mr. Davis's supervisor Edward Tyre.  Go figure I jumped through hoops for them, but they still had the right to push me around.  They also said they never got my payment !  But I had the proof of payment in m hands.... I had already called to make sure they did before I questoned them.  And was told they'd check their acounting department, and once again was told they never received it.  
After waiting 3 hours for them to called me, I called them.  I let Lance Davis and Edward Tyre have it... basically told them they were liars.
I'm still waiting for the money they took out of my account and the overdraft fee my bank charged.  
I've also contacted the better business bureau and my state attorney general.  
This is also the same lawyers that garnished my waged for almost a year, back in 1992.  Then 2 years later contacted me saying I never paid them.  Well, I got angry and sent them a copy off all my pay stubs and the cancalled checks my employer wrote...... resulting in a 110 page fax.  In a way i got my revenge on that one. 
If you EVER get a letter from these a__holes BEWARE !!!  
Do they have a right to just take money from your checking acount...... the bad part was my bank wasn't even able to help me stop this !!!  This was all over a $400 debt, which cost me $700 in the end.

This lawyer saw my twice, both times, said he would do all he could do, to help save my home. Neith time, he did a thing. Never even explained to me what was happening.
In the end, he told me I was free of all my debts, then now I am going up against a foreclosure on a balloon note that was attached to my house. He never did a thing to save my home, after 5 years of paying $450.00 a month toward just my home. 
Where is this money, why could he not saved my home, why did he not tell me I was just wasting my money paying this for nothing, if he could not save it. Because I would have walked out of his office and never filed this Bankruptcy.

Palatine, Illinois U.S.A. ",,850-424-3901,Green Tree ripoff Palatine Illinois,"
										I purchased my mobile home in 2000, I was told that it was asked what payment could I afford. I explained to the sales person that I just started working so my payments needed to saty at 450.00 to 550.00 including insurance. When the sales man call the company they assured him that it would stay in that range. 
I also told them that my payments need to be on the 15th of each month. They assured me that it would be. When we discused the down payment it started at 1500.00. I then payed the down payment and left for them to finish the paperwork. When I came back the next day they wanted 500.00 more, I payed it. I was told it was because of my credit score of 500. I was ok with that, but when I went to pick up the keys they wanted 1000.00 more. 
They said the mortage was more than they had predicted. Like a fool I paid the 1000.00 as requested by the leander. Now I'm no dummy but at this time I was moving from another mobile home that I was renting. Of course I wanted a home of my own to raise my four kids. I guess this was the catch, a single mother with four kids""desperate"". 
The home was so beautiful at this point I really didn't care about the down payment. Before it was over I paid another 500.00 for set up fees that. Ilater found out that was to be included. When your not in the business you get burned by the business. I was then told to sign the contract. Yes! it was blank. I was told i had to waite until the finance officer oked the sale. The next thing I Knew was that i had purchased the at 17% interest for 30years @250.000. I have owned this home for 6 years and not one dollar has been applied to the Principal. I pay 835.00 A month. 
When I spoke with the manager they refused to speak with me. I spoke with a customer service rep. I have to admit she was the only person willing to help me. I will not deal with anyone else, burt I'm stuck in a bad situation. 
I have since got married and purchased a new block home through the VA home mortage lender. My mortage rate 6%, hope you get the picture. My husband has 33 years military and still enlisted today. We still pay the mortage, but I'm looking for a tentant. I know God will shine some light on my situation and change the way business people think. One world one God.
Thank you for giving me the operitunity to voice my problems. Don't be ashame be responsible.

										I believe Boyajian Law Offices is targeting my husband and me in a fraudulent scheme to collect a debt not ours.
We have received more and more phone calls from 1-800-919-2305 telling us This is the Boyajian Law Offices  to call 1-800-793-2350 on a personal legal matter.  They started about four months ago, and have become three times a week harassment.  I researched the name on the web, found this website listing 83 entries of this firm  trying fraudulently to collect from people not legally responsible for the debt.
After trying over and over to get someone at this firm, I finally connected during lunch AZ time.  Instead of answering my questions, the woman asked so many personal ID questions I hung up on her.  She would not tell me from what office she spoke.   As an Information Assurance professional, I am well aware of the dangers of passing Personally Identifiable Information over the phone.
My husband and I owe no debt beyond our house and vehicles.  We have stellar credit scores and NO bad reports.  We also both carry Federal Government Top Secret Clearances.  Any outstanding debt would come up on our five-year re-investigations.
However, my husband's ex-wife (1998) and daughter (21, in the Army) do run up debt.  Ex-Wife has several judgments against her in the Superior Court in Phoenix including being arrested for bad checks.  Divorce Court completely cleared my husband for any of Ex-Wife's debt.  However, WE are not responsible.

Finally after 5 weeks they sent the buisness who hit me a letter stating they needed his insurance information or they were going to sue him. I called like 25 times trying to get the status of my case. Everyone kept forwarding me to the next person, (from dallas office to arlington office back and forth).Each and everytime i had to explain who i was and tell them my whole case, accident and all, before they would figure out who i was so  they could forward me to the ""RIGHT"" dept.
I never , not once in the whole 2 months i had them recieved a phone call from them. 
After 2 months of keeping me hanging on with and aggrement ""not to discuss my case with anyone"" they did'nt get a reply from the buisness on the insurance information so they dropped  my case after a whole 8 weeks "" no insurance company to sue"" Justin said.
I asked for my files and he gave me a little sticky note with the guys phone number on it. 
After being dropped and 2 months later stilled injured and no legal advise i decided to do my own investigation, went to the police station got the accident report myself and WOW, THERE it was the buisness insurance information. Hired another attorney and they jumped right on it.  There was a problem though since it's been so long the tow company sold my totaled car at an aution and made it harder to get all the money i deserved on my car. 
So anyways to make a long story short Bailey Galyen and Gold office team do not want to do any legal work, only money hungry and wanting to make little phone calls to insurance companys and take 33% . They are lazy,unprofessional,inconsiderate,cold,and the most uncaring. Even if they read this they wont remember who i was they never remembered me from one phone call to the next.

										In the mail, I received a bill for $236.18 owed to this law firm who is handling this account for Voicestream/T-Mobile. I did have an account with Voicestream/T-Mobile over three years ago which I paid off in full through a Texas-based collection agency. 
The representative I spoke to on the telephone said that I owed the amount; I countered that it had been paid in full. He said that it had not and was on my credit report. This was patently false because I just got my credit report, coincidentally, about one month ago and there was no such item on the report. 
This is a very shady law firm who is hoping to take advantage of people who may have had some financial trouble/late bills/ in the past. I actually paused for a minute when I first got the bill and thought, ""Wait, did I pay this?"" The truth is I DID pay it and these unethical people are trying to get money from folks with little money, like myself, simply because they can. 
Don't be fooled. I plan to contact Voicestream/TMobile to get confirmation that all has been paid. Additionally, I will find those cancelled checks AND file a complaint with the Better Business Burean, the Federal Trade Commission, and contact local consumer watchdog groups both in NYC and in my new home state of California. This sort of legal chicanery is reprehensible and should be stopped and legal action should be taken against these unscrupulous individuals.
We all have busy lives, but if this happens to you; do as I am doing and make time to research into this as much as possible. These people are criminals.

										CONSUMERS BEWARE OF ATTORNEYS AND PROBATE COURT IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA. YOUR P0WER OF ATTORNEY, WILL, AND OTHER LEGAL DOCUMENTS ARE USELESS!!!!!
My father was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2000. He appointed me as durable power of attorney with total authority over his assets and health care. I was not able, however, to carry out any of his wishes in his power of attorney or Advance Directive concerning his health care with his hospice or doctor due to false allegations made by my extended family members. My father suffered unnecessarily as a result of this and none of his wishes were honored.
After my father's death, I was not ""allowed"" to carry out any of the wishes in his will by all the attorneys involved or by probate court.
His will states that I ""shall not be required to furnish any bond, nor file any inventory of property, or make any report or final settlement to any court of any proceedings hereunder.
His will also states that I ""have full power and authority to sell, transfer and convey any property, real or personal,which I may own or have control over at my death, without first obtaining permission from any court, at such time and price and upon such terms and conditions, including credit as I may determine and to do every other act and thing necessary or appropriate for the complete administration of my Estate.""
I was ""NOT ALLOWED"" to carry out ANY of these duties by the attorneys involved and was not allowed to be on the appraisals on the property, determine the price, or sell the property so that I could settle the estate. I had to file an inventory, reports, a final settlement, and many other documents my father's will said I did not have to.
My father's estate was then turned over to a ""master"" by the judge (Mark Gaines at Jefferson County courthouse)against my father's will and state law. My brother and I, who were the only heirs, were NOT alllowed in the courtroom at this time. 
None of the attorneys involved would honor my father's will nor assist me in carrying out his wishes. Several attorneys did not file documents as ordered by the judge but told me that they had.
I was not informed of court dates concerning my father's estate by my attorneys nor was I served any documents so that I could attend court and inform the judge what was going on.
I have not been able to obtain some documents filed on my father's estate from probate court.
There was also illegal distributions concering property belonging to my father's estate by one of the attorneys(Robert Townes of Gardendale, AL.
I have contacted NUMEROUS attorneys, the STATE BAR, the Attorney General, comsumer protection agencies, etc., about these unethical and illegal actions of all these attorneys and probate court but cannot find anyone to assist me in exposing this corruption and recover the money these attorneys stoled from my father's estate against his will and state law.
I am in hopes there is someone out there that has enough honesty and integrity to help me and warn others so that what happened to my father, my brother, and I will not happen to someone else.
I have NUMEROUS documents and recordings to support my case and feel extremely confident I can prove all of the above statements and many more unethical, if not illegal, actions by these attorneys and probate court.
SOMEONE PLEASE HELP!!!! IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOUR FAMILY!!!

I feel I have been robbed and treated like dirt . then it gets even better they had my Girlfriends social security  disability case  re opened as they told her that the state  cheeted her out of alot of money on the onset date of her disability .
They then explained to her that they were just going to have her onset date corrected but what they did was criminal they pushed her case through 3 lawyers and on the court date sent a young man who did not even have his NJ law licence yet to handle it this young man who knew nothing of the case had it dismised causing her to lose her only income  then insted of fileing an appiel he lost the paperwork and left the case abandoned and not untill the case was past all term dates they had to refile the case and show cause why it should be reopened witch they did 3 years later only to lose the case infront of the same judge so they would not be sued for mal practice.there is still one appiel left but its not looking very good when the lawyers that are doing the case do not want it to be one .
also they have represented me in an open car accident from 2001 I do not have any other choice but to have the lawyer Eric lentz finish the case but I feel that I,m being set up again for the last time and if so I may have to  go to the ethics board or what ever else can be done our lives are severly damaged do to the poor representation I hope all NJ lawyers are not like this

										The Law Offices of Roni Lynn Deutch failed to defend me and relieve my tax issue -- they may take your money and deceit you as well.  
Their firm never came through when I put all of my savings into their pockets.  They never negotiated as promised.  They never asked for the IRS to please consider lessening the money owed, or possibly reducing the interest amount. 
1) They lied by telling me numerous times that they had conatced the IRS and were my legal representation.  The IRS eventually placed a levy on my bank account, and has no record of the untruthful Law Offices of Roni Lynn Deutch ever submitting a communication stating that they were my legal representation, even after I paid their law firm thousands. 
2) When I refused to give them anymore money becuase I had already paid them more than my back tax was, they violated the California State Bar's Code of Ethics by calling my family, even my boss at work, looking for me and my money.  
My sister asked me: ""Why do I have tax problems?"" 
My boss asked me: ""Is everything ok with the IRS?""
Not only was my bank account levied as a clear result of Roni Deutch's inept staff, now my family and co-workers know that I have a tax problem which is a violation of my civil rights.
Being inept at tax law is one thing, violating the most basic of attorney-client privileges is another.

										This firm is a scam. Read below and see how many ways they screw you.
ALEX CHARTONE OVERBILLS AND DOES NOTHING.
SHERRI BLOUNT WASTE CLIENTS MONEY.
eTHICS ARE NOT THEIR FIRST PRIORTY WHEN IT COMES TO REPESENTING YOU
If you think you have been a victim of legal malpractice, the normal remedy is a new lawsuit for malpractice.  It is generally not malpractice simply for a lawyer to lose -- the question is usually whether the lawyer was negligent in representing you and it caused you harm.  Your first step is to try to locate a lawyer who handles such cases in your area. 
Check with local bar referral sources to find a lawyer who handles this type of claim.  Helpful links appear below. 
It is normal for clients to be concerned that the system will protect its own.  There are, however, lawyers who will sue lawyers -- just find the right one. 
Lawyers who prey on their clients will rely on every trick of their trade to avoid liability -- clients seeking to pursue a legal malpractice claim must be prepared for a grueling experience. 
Even if a lawyer says he or she cannot help you, ask them for a referral to someone who can. 
You should not delay -- even a valid claim can be lost simply because you waited too long. 
Certain types of malpractice can also be an ethics violation, so you can also contact a bar organization.  Keep in mind, however, that the bar is looking for evidence of an ethical violation, which is not necessarily the same as malpractice. 
Many examples of incompetent, unethical, or unnecessarily expensive legal services are not malpractice -- malpractice is not just a mistake. 
If you think a lawyer has done something unethical, the normal remedy is to report him or her to the state bar organization, which should have a separate committee or group that investigates and disciplines lawyers. 
Your complaint normally must be in writing and you must provide enough detail for the bar to identify the lawyer, investigate the complaint, and determine whether it might involve an ethics violation. 
As with malpractice claims, there are many situations in which lawyers make mistakes, behave badly, or charge more than you can afford that are not unethical. 
One advantage of the ethics complaint is that the bar provides the resources to investigate and prosecute the complaint -- the client still have to invest time, but not as much as a malpractice complaint normally entails. 
If your problem is legal fees, many bar organizations have some form of arbitration to resolve those disputes. 
Some of these are very good, producing reasonable results for little or no investment. 
Others have been completely co-opted by the worst offenders.  Sorry, but we don't have a list of which are which.  You need to ask around and be skeptical. 
Most arbitrations are binding even if informal.  You should consult with a lawyer or be sure you understand all the implications of arbitration. 
Although ethical rules are supposed to keep fees reasonable, most bars ignore most billing disputes because they are so numerous and establishing an unethical fee with vague rules is almost impossible, absent outright fraud or theft. 
You can also submit information through our whistleblower page, which we may use to report to bar authorities. 
These are not all the possibilities for disputes between lawyers and clients -- some may be criminal or involve other types of problems.  Contact the state bar, another lawyer, or both to discuss your option.   sorry, allowing you to give a competitors name would instigate others to just file against their competition, to only come back later to suggest their company your comments on this  policy are welcome!

										Do not let these guys represent you. My opion is based on facts. My mom let this firm repersent her for 6 years. i saw Keith c wetmore harrass young ladies and Paul Swanson could not tell you anything about internet law. He said ""you can put anything on the net and get away with it"" No matter what the content was. How stupid is he. He does not understand about slander and malcious postings. So this posting should be nothing to him. Yeah right.  Keep on overbilling and being a bad attorney. Do your famous ""phone book depo's"" so you can charge more. he pushes off all work to people under him,but charges his rate.
Keith c Wetmore hit on my 15 year old cousin. Man it was sick.One defense lawyer was convicted of possessing child pornography. Another admitted drinking hard throughout his client's murder trial. A third committed felony credit card fraud
Be wary of the ""slam dunk"" claim.
""Any lawyer who tells you you've got a slam dunk case is probably not a very good lawyer,"" Starnes says. ""I have seen very few slam dunks in my time. The law is rarely black and white. Often times, there is a disagreement, and who will win and lose is difficult to predict.""
Depending on the case, an attorney likely will have to do some research and talk to several people before making any kind of assessment. While his confidence may be reassuring, his actions on your behalf are more important.
Also, trust your gut. If you feel doubts about a lawyer's comments or competence, you may be best to cut your losses, terminate the relationship and move on.
Harassment is communicating with a person in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm, placing a person in reasonable fear of physical injury, or making a telephone call with no purpose of legitimate communication. Harassment can be either a misdemeanor or violation depending on the nature of the conduct, whether the harassment was based on discrimination, and whether the defendant has been convicted of harassment within the last ten years

Tinley Park, Illinois U.S.A. ",,866-326-3328,Legal Helpers Refused to provide me with the serviced I paid for. ripoff Tinley Park Illinois,"
										About three years ago I had my license suspended because my car insurance company refused to provide me with a letter stating I had paid them for car insurance. I had the choice to either pay over $7000 (car accident) or file bankruptcy. It took me two years to make a decision. With the help of a friend I deceided to file bankruptcy.
She told me she filed bankruptcy with Legal Helpers and she had no problems at all, which is why she referred me. I decided to give them a call and made an appoinyment.
When I went and spoke to the lawyer everything was fine and I filled out required paperwork. I was told my bankruptcy would be over within a few months and I paid them over $1200. 
I waited and waited, and waited and waited. Finally after a few months I tried getting ahold of my lawyer, which was unbelievably difficult. After about six months of not being able to find anyone who knew what was taking so long I was informed that the lawyer that was taking care of my case had quit, as well as lost all my legal documents that I left with him because he didn't want to pay five cents to use the copy machine at the office they are at (I know now not to leave any original documents with anyone).
After learning all this I pretty much had to start all over with my bankruptcy. I had to pay more money because fees had gone up since then and they refused to help me out. I was also asked to get copies of my pay stubs about 10 times. I called to complain but was told noone there is in charge and the only one I could speak to about complaints was my lawyer. How do you complain about your lawyer to your lawyer????? I asked them who provides them with a paycheck and they did not know.
My new lawyer was also very hard to get ahold of. I have been hung up on, told that I would get a return phone call (right!), told my lawyer was there to hold on for a half hour just for someone to get back on the phone and tell me he left a half hour ago, or just no answer at all. I have been refused a refund as well.
He called me one day around 5pm late in the week and told me I had to be up at his office that next week on a certain day to sign one slip of paper that was too confidential to mail to me or fax to me or have someone pick up and drop back off. I was told I had to be there that day only because he was the only one who could have me sign it and he was going on vacation. 
I had to work that day and I also was without a license, so I had to call off work, as well as the person who had to take me up there, for a paper I signed that was informing me that they file everything electronically, which a different lawyer gave me to sign. You can say I was very upset.
It has now been over a year and my bankruptcy still is not completely finished. It has been discharged and I now have my license but I may have to refile because my lawyer did not give the court everything he was supposed to give them. I am still receiving phone calls that there is more things that was forgotten that need to be done, or things I have mailed to them that somehow never got to there office. 
The person who referred me did not have any of these problems when she filed but yet I have had nothing but trouble with them. 
I strongly advise anyone trying to get legal help stay away from Legal Helpers! They are no good!

After my honemoon i though it was best for me to declare myself in Bankruptcy and start out fresh. I seaked the help of this firm (They Charged me 1,000 USD). i paid in full and requested for them to file Bankruptcy for me. There was so much missinformationg given by them about the whole process wich made the whole ordeal a nigthmare. They requested the imposible from me when it came down to documentation and requested frequent visits to their offices. there is only one lawyer in the firm ( Roberto Sanchez ) the rest are selft proclaim legal aid. 
I spent 1 year going back and forth with worthless paperwork, then they spent an other year before they decided to file my Bankruptcy. Life has a nice way of turning around and by then i had gotten a great job (with great unexprected income) and i decided not to file since i could make arrangements with my creditors. It took me yet an other year of going back and forth everytime hi cited me to go by, i never new what hi wanted, untill 6 months later i get a letter from the court for the meeting of the creditos, he had filed my bankrupcity. 
I went over and spoke to him and asked him to please rectify the cituation, his excuse was that he had to file all the pending bankrupcitys before the new law.  ( IM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CHANGES IN THE LAW BUT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT) His office looked loke a fast food restaurant at lunch time. He instructed me NOT TO SHOW to court and that hi as my legal counsil will take care of ""IT"". As instructed i dint show and the Bankruptcy was ""Discharged"" But he dint take care of it. I now have in the public records of my credit report that i have a Bankruptcy that was discharged by a judge.

Unreturned telephone calls, charges for identical legal documents, wrong information from paralegal many times, which brought on delays, so that progress was hindered,etc.If you question the billing they give you the runaround and then bill you for the time they take to run you around. Unprofessional behaviour by a family law board certified super lawyer and paralegal.
In reporting an alleged misconduct of an attorney to the North Carolina State Bar Grievance Committee it is to be understood by complainant that a privately retained attorney may also be needed to pursue private remedies. For many clients this is impossible with hourly rates of attorneys and especially for family law clients who are responsible for family support, cost of living, etc. on a limited budget.

Delray Beach, Florida U.S.A. ",,866-892-1055,F.A. Management Solutions - Attorney Hugh Brett Shafritz Ripoff Unfair& Illegal Collection Practices Credit Scam collecting debt not known to us Delray Beach Florida,"
										I don't know where to start, but it is very overwhelming when a cop shows up at your door one morning and seizes your assets if you don't pay the money, apparently claimed by F.A. Management Solutions Inc. Attorney. Hugh Brett Shafritz.
This attorney, Shafritz apparently knows the loopholes of the judicial system and somehow gets a hold of your personal records.
Two years ago, in 2004, he files a claim for over $3500 in the Small claims court against my wife. She has no clue whats going on in the meantime. I guess she was supposed to receive some kind of notification to appear in court or that there as been a claim against her, but she didn't receive any notice. Totally oblivious of this whole ordeal, 2 years later, now in 2006, the court favors Attorney. Hugh Brett Shafritz and sends a sheriff over to extort the money ($4300, including interest accrued over the years, lawyer fees and court fees). He tows my wifes car and we had no choice but to come up with that money and pay the courthouse.
At that point of time we had no clue what on earth was going on, until I tried searching over the internet for this so called F.A. Management Solutions Inc., and I read some other people's reports who have been victims of the same scam. I also came across some other cases he's involved in currently and it seems to me like he's made this his business to create false debt/ claim somehow and manage to convince the judge to favor his claim.
We don't know how to deal with this firm but someone needs to put an end to this or else these legal extorsion will continue and innocent people like us will pay the price.
I know there are other people out there, like us, who have become victims of this scammer. I plead you to come forward and take an affirmative step to put an end to this business. 
If you have been victimized by F.A. Management Solutions Inc., please email me (((ROR redacted email address for security purposes)))

										Please, what ever you do- stay away from this law firm.  
We thought we did all our homework in chosing the right law firm.  We checked the AZ Bar- no action listed.  We did a search, nothing negative came back (though we should have known by all their advertising-they had a paid ad on every search engine, every ""find an attorney website""...they must spend hundreds of thousands a year on advertising alone.  When a law firm is good, they get their business from word of mouth-they don't have to promote themselves, a hard and expensive lesson to learn!)  
At first, you'll be wooed and in awe of the office and the fact that the head of the law firm himself, Alexander Neirnstein, personally responds to your email/phone call and gives you a free phone consultation.  You'll be very impressed by how animate he is about your case and how outraged/appalled at your situation/spouse...he could win an oscar for his performance.  You won't hesitate to come down to the office for a full consultation.  
If you're like us, you'll jump through hoops to get them the retainer they want, the normal $5,000- no red flags yet...but after you sign that 15 pg contract- it's all down hill from there (actually, that should have been a red flag...why would you need to sign a 15 pg contract for a simple divorce/custody, what ever?  Because they've been down this road you're about to venture on a hundred times before and they've made sure that their interests, yes their interests-not yours, are protected iron clad.)  After you sign the contract and hand over your retainer, it won't be long before they show their true colors.  
You'll be over charged (they charge a couple hundred dollars just to file the ""notice of appearance"", the two page, preprinted form that they type your name and case number in and submit to the court to notify the judge and opposing attorney that they are representing you.  The new attorney we have now charged only $18...big difference!), your phone calls won't get returned for days/weeks, you'll try sending emails (like the firm says to do, to save you money- so your attorney can easily and quickly reply back to all your questions/requests the first time.....yeah, right!) but you won't get replies to your emails (not until the 3rd or 4th one) but you'll notice on your bill that you have been charged around $75-$150 for the attorney to ""read"" each one....even though they each say the same thing!!  
The next stage is when they start shuffling you through their firm- that's when things really get expensive and your retainer is almost diminished and yet you're not even a month into the case and you have nothing to show for it!!  
First you'll be under the impression that Alexander is taking your case, than you'll be swapped to one of the other partners...than to one of the non-partners and on and on you'll go (as you fall in importance down the food chain) and the best (actually worst) part is.....you have to pay each new attorney in the firm to review all the case info (the same info each time)-every time- your attorney in the firm changes.  And once your retainer is gone, they will send you a nasty letter telling you pay up or they will be forced to terminate the relationship.  
If you are really in a hardship, like we were,they may let you make payments (with 20% interest)....that's when they really crossed the line.  They waited until a month before the final hearing and sent us a letter stating that if we didn't give them another $5,000 they'd withdraw...deja vu?  No- extortion.  
We didn't have the money and after Alexander Niernstein wrote a couple of demeaning emails saying if we were any kind of parents we'd find the money and not to try and make him feel guilty with our ""sob story"" etc..  We brought up the fact that we had it in writing from the firm that we could make payments (which we did, each month-every month-on time) and it didn't matter.  
They followed through with their threats and withdrew leaving us high and dry with the possibility of losing our young child.  To make matters worse for us (though we can't prove it, at least not yet) they were in cohots with the opposing attorney because somehow he magically knew they were withdrawing before we did and we immediately began to get bombarded with deposition subpoenas, discovery requests, sanction requests from the court against us.....all from the opposing attorney at the same time they withdrew.  Pretty convienent.  
We're trying to file a complaint with the AZ Bar but when you don't know the law, you don't know what is illegal and what is just getting screwed over by money-hungary, unethical attorneys.
Please, please- choose any other law firm in this state but stay away from NRG!!  Don't put yourself/family through this hardship.  Whoever you choose, make sure they have nothing negative on the state bar's website, they shouldn't have to spend lots of $$$ advertising (ask around, someone will recommend a good attorney from personal experience) and ""buyer beware"" of contracts more than a couple pages long and never, ever pay additional ""office fees"" other than the standard mail/fax/long distance charge.

Woodbury, New York U.S.A. ",,877-202-9074,"Midland Funding Cohen & Slamowitz no prior notice from any court, a ""judgement"" has been issued and a surprise levy placed on the checking account Woodbury New York","
										My husband went to the bank today and deposited his week's pay from work... a few hours later he went to an ATM and discovered that he couldn't get at his money! He went down to his bank (Wachovia) and was told that a levy had been placed on his account. They gave him a peice of paper with the name ""Midland Funding"" and a phone number hand written on it.
I called the phone number and got a recording (of course, because it is Saturday we can't get help from ANYONE).
Then I googled the company name and discovered that this company has been doing A LOT of bad things to people. About an hour later, I got my mail, and found a letter from the legal department at the bank. 
They (Wachovia) said that they had been served with a legal document on 10/11/06 (today is 10/14/06) and that they had to immediately hold all funds. Wachovia also tacked on a $100 fee for this ""service"".
The bank sent along a copy of the ""legal"" paper that they had received in which Midland Funding (represented by Cohen & Slamowitz) states that a judgement had been made against my husband on July 25, 2006 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Dutchess in the amount of $1935.96 along with interest and dues. There is no court seal or Judge's name or signature on this paper. 
I tried looking this ""case"" up on the court's website and I found nothing. I also searched through e-law.com and found nothing. How can a judgement have been made in court against my husband if he was never notified of any court actions whatsoever? We don't even know who this supposed debt is even originally from! 
So now here we are, with no money, no way to pay the bills or get groceries even- and we have a baby at home that we are going to have to figure out how to get diapers & food for until my husband gets paid again. 
How can this happen? Is it legal, what they did? What can we do to get out money back? 
Luckily, I came across this website here during my search so I feel a little better just knowing that we are not the only ones getting the Royal Screwjob - I saw that some folks want to file a class action lawsuit against these bastards and I want to know, how do we get in on it? 
What should we do next? 
Just our luck to find out about this on a Saturday when everything is closed! I'd greatly appreciate any advice anyone can give me about what we should be doing on Monday. 
Not only do we want to help ourselves, but we also want to help -if we can- prevent anyone else from going through this nightmare.
Thank you, to anyone who can shed some light on this matter.

										I am submitting this posting because I found this web site while trying to get information on Workman Law Office that is taking automatic check payments from my bank account. After reading some of the posts on this site I decided to do my own. 
I was contacted last December by several high pressure people from Workman Law Office, P.A. (do not know what the P.A. means) in Jacksonville Florida about a delinquent Providian Bank Credit card I once had. The amount was around $9,000. Workman Law people were calling my work place twice a week, kept steady at it. The last call was from a guy I do not remember his name, told me that the Sheriff was ready to serve me with papers to appear in court here and I would be responsible for all added costs, etc, etc. He offered me to be able to settle it all now for $6,000 within 30 days, if not able to do that I would be responsible for the whole $9,000. 
He pressured me into agreeing that I would allow automatic deductions from my checking account, $225 each month. I agreed at that time just to get him off my back. So far I have made 11 payments to them. Last month I saw that the automatic checks are being made out to Attorney Harold E Scherr at 4237 Salisbury Road North, Suite 308, Jacksonville Florida 32216. The same address as Workman Law Office, and they have been deposited into the account of Collect America in Denver Colorado. 
After reading the posts here about that company that said they buy these accounts for pennies on the dollar and use unethical tactics I got thinking more about it. I speculate that they bought my account for way below the $6,000 they offered me at first to pay off my $9,000 debt, I realize that now, they probably got it for less than $2,000, everything above that would be a fat profit for them. 
I do not object to paying down a debit I do owe but these people used tactics that are not legal such as the threat to have a Process Server at my door step that next morning and the harassing calls to by busy work place. 
NOW money is getting tight here so I did a web search to get information to get them to allow a 3 month reprieve so I could pay the mortgage on the house I am now living in that my girlfriend has (her employer went out of business), what a surprise I got!! These people are indeed Bottom Feeders as previous posters have indicated. I intend to contact my bank and have them not honor any more automatic check withdrawals from these people until I can contact Collect America and negotiate a better settlement. Like I said before, I will pay off my debit but not at their price.

San Jose, California U.S.A. ",,877-3694529,"Michael J. MacLellan Attorney At Law Takes retainer, never files as attorney of record San Jose California","
										Hello there,
My name is Mitchell, and I am writing this complaint in hopes that I can keep someone else from going through what I went through with this attorney.
I hired Michael MacLellan to represent me in a dissolution case, where my ex-wife and her father had made many false claims about me. They also killed a business we ran together on ebay, eliminating my capability to make an income. I then went to my old neighborhood, and solicited for some handyman jobs, and worked day and night to get Michael his retainer of $5,000.00, 2,500 more than the average, but I was hoping I was getting a good attorney, and submitted the retainer to him, one check for an immediate $3,000.00, and a second to be deposited in two weeks. 
Right from the get go, I felt something was going on, when I e-mailed opposing counsel, informing them I was now represented, and received a return e-mail the next day, stating they contacted Michael MacLellan's office, and was told I had NOT retained his services. I contacted his office, and was informed by his wife, and parralegal, that this was part of Michael's strategy. 
Later that week, I met with Michael, and while I was in his office, he telephoned opposing counsel, and told them he was representing me....what strategy???? 
Michael then requested ALL of my paperwork (court documents, appointments calendered, etc.). He said his wife was the queen of organization, and that she would organize my file, and I would be notified of any and all appointments. I was in the middle of an emegency screening process, and opposing counsel had met with the mediator absent my presence, and scheduled a followup appointment, at which I missed, causing me to lose custody of my children. The reason I was offered for not being notified, was due to the fact Michael MacLellan never filed the paperwork recording as my attorney of record. I later found that this was to be recorded immediately upon signing the attorney client fee agreement. 
The second problem I had with Michael, was when I had informed him of my ex wife's illness (cancer), and he asked me why I want to hire an attorney ""why don't you just wait out the inevitable"" Honestly, I did not say anything about his comment, as I was terribly hurt over all of the nasty things my ex and her father were inflicting on me.
Michael was representing me???? for approximately 4 weeks when I began calling every other day to see what, if anything was going on in my own dissolution case, only to be told by either his wife or his secretary he was in court. After a week of daily calls, his wife had informed me that Michael was in the closing stages of a very lengthy (2 year) case, and once it was finalized in the next couple of days, he would devote his attention on my case. She went on to say, I know he has been neglecting you, due to this case, but as soon as it is finalized, you will have all of his attention, and other clients will suffer. I am not an attorney, and I know there is no way he is making money servicing one client at a time...nonsense!
The final straw, and the reason for this complaint..... I telephoned several days AFTER being told Michael would be devoting his time on my case, and spoke to his secretary, whom was suddenly very rude to me, and was told Michael was not available. I explained my concern to her on my cell, driving on 152 through the pass, and lost my signal. Now I have lost my signal with her before, as well as with Michael and his wife, but this time she told Michael I hung up on her...unless Michael made that up too.
Went I arrived at my destination, I called his office again, and was greeted by his wife, whom began to inform me that they will no longer be representing me. I told her that I could not believe they could sleep at night, with the way they neglect thier client's, then when called to the carpet, drop them, and keep thier money. They did send me a partial refund from the retainer I paid. 
Adding insult to injury, Michael was displeased over my comment, and sent an e-mail questioning my integrity and forth riteousness, big time! The reason he did this is because he was very aware of allegations made by my ex and her father, that i was violent. 
I sent Michael a reply, discussing the fact that I was not employed, and without my retainer, I could not hire another attorney. He flattly refused, telling me that was my problem. It took me about a month to regain enough money to hire another attorney, and during that time, I was steamrolled by opposing counsel. (I have copies of the e-mail communications between Michael MacLellan and myself)
I also made it clear to Michael, that I would take advantage of any avenue's available to consumers to protect my rights...he responded by threatening to sue me.
If anyone knows of any other avenues available, please contact me, and thanks for reading my complaint.

I am not legal smart in any sense and I have been reading the other two complaints with this company that is posted on this website.  Just like another person and her husband, I am broke and cannot afford to go get a lawyer.  My girlfriend is trying to help me out here but if anyone can give me advise on what to do next that would be great.  So far this is what I am doing:
-I am looking for an attorney that I can afford
-Going to the county cleak to get a copy of the court order on my case as I never received one.  
I am trying to follow the steps that was recommended for the other two cases but like I said before, I am not smart with legal issues and do need help.  If anyone can please help me that would be great.  I am a college student and already have bills up the wahzoo, I don't need anymore headaches.

										Hi,
I worked for a company who had a real nasty owner with a really sick and twisted mind who wrongfully dismissed me and had threatend me with police when she let me go even though I did nothing wrong.
I found out later that there was a lawyer who was working with several individuals from that same company who were also wrongfully dismissed.
Anyhow, I was referred to Kevin Fox by a former employee of this company.
Kevin Fox took me in and told me that based on what I was telling him, I deifnitely had a case. He asked me for $250 dollars for him to look over my case and said he would get back to me in two to three weeks.
I have never, ever heard from Kevin Fox since that visit. I have tried to get in touch with him several times VIA phone and email, but to no avail. I left him voicemails only for my calls to not be returned. I sent him emails with no responses. 
I guess since I was not working and did not have an income, he didn't see a reason to contact me. He was willing to see me though when I had my last $250 to my name.
I even asked in an email and voicemail for Kevin Fox to simply send me all of my documents, floppy disk(s), and a data CD that I left with him to look at. Of course, there was no reply.
Sincerely,
A ticked off consumer

We did everything they asked, sent650 for the search,  1200 + to trademark the name and then after a frantic phone call from Steve Bach we wired 10,000. Steve told us if we did not send the money (wire it) immediately we would be left out of the trade show. (sound familiar). We were then contacted after said trade show by 
another bogus company in Florida. Mind you no dates or phone numbers were on this letter... they just asked us to send information on our idea. 
After over a year of no responses from PTI, FLorida company or this half-baked laywer PTI set us up with ( from California), we beagn to scream REFUND!!! It was then that PTI told us they did another search and found a product just like ours. We were advised not to file Patent. What kind of garbage is this. We want our money back , plus!!! We want that company shut down for good.

Woodbury, New York U.S.A. ",,888-303-0431,Cohen And Slamowitz ripoff They strike again! Woodbury New York,"
										When a lien was placed on my bank account and I spoke to someone from Cohen and Slamowitz, I knew something was fishy, which is why I checked ripoffreport.com. I can't believe how shady these lawyers are. 
On November 21, 2006, a lien for over $7000 was placed on my account. I found this out when I was in the grocery attempting to purchase food to prepare my Thanskgiving dinner and my purchase was denied. 
After calling the bank and getting the number for Cohen and Slamowitz, I called and spoke to a lady by the name of Ms. Pierce. I was told by her that a lien was placed on my account for a Mastercard debt from 2002. 
I asked Ms. Pierce how they could just, out of nowhere, place a lien on my bank account. I had no money for transportation to work or school, no money for food, etc. She told me that this was allowed because I ignored the papers I was served. When I told her I was never served any papers, she told me that someone came to my door and served the papers to someone in my household; but I caught her in a lie. Besides the fact neither my mother nor myself were served, I have a doorman. Noone is allowed upstairs without being buzzed and having to sign in, and this was not done.
I then told Ms. Pierce that I believed this was a mistake because the only credit card I had while in college was a Visa, which I had paid back late, but in full. I asked her to please send me any information regarding this account, and was told that she did not have this information.
In turn, she told me that I had to pay this debt back and she requested my social security number and pay stubs. 
I don't know what to do about this. I read the other complaints about these lawyers and it seems like they are getting away with what they are doing. 
So far I have gone down to civil court and filed and order to show cause. I have an upcoming court date, but what should I bring? How can I prove this is not a debt that I owe and get the case dismissed?

										A couple years ago I received a notice on my apartment door stating my belongings would be auctioned off if I didn't pay the law office who is collecting a debt for a credit card company.
Knowing that I had many credit cards in the past and being afraid of my belongings being sold, I started making payments. After I moved, I started going through old credit card statements and could not find anything for the company Colavecchi represented, so I stopped making payments.
I then get a notice stating a judgment was going to be placed against me if I didn't pay. After receiving this notice I sent a dispute letter requesting validation of the debt including signed documentation. 
The law office responded by stating I should obtain an attorney. I then responded by telling them I was not refusing to pay, but I wanted to know what I was paying for and if it is actually my debt.
I also filed a complaint with the PA Attorney General's office, and nothing was resolved.
I don't know if the law office has actually placed the judgment against me yet, but I want to make sure they don't.
I know that I shouldn't have made payments, but I was afraid. Can anyone give me any info as to what my next step should be?

I have no idea if or when this paperwork will ever get filed.  
Honestly I have lost all faith that even if they were to handle this matter that it would be done properly.  Just another case of a firm with too many lawyers not paying enough attention but sure willing to cash that check you send them.  Good luck to anyone that retains this firm.

From the date I retain this crook June 13, 2004, then pass July, August, September, October, November never prepared the OSC and his office always giving me the run around then finally in early December 2004 I started panicking because I normally travel every year to Moscow to visit my Daughter as per previous court order and these pair of con artists continuing giving me the run around, to make the story short they never prepared my OSC and got some useless court order for the ex-wife not to harass me in Moscow which I was already in Moscow and ready for return to Los Angeles and J. MICHAEL KELLY never submitted to the courts until a week after I return from my 3 weeks visit to Moscow with my daughter. Please you tell me if I don't deserve my money back?  J. MICHAEL KELLY and HOWARD Kaiser like a pair of swindlers use the law practice to rip me off and so far are getting away.

Van Nuys, California U.S.A. ",,888-5356161,"WILLIAM A. ACOSTA - MARIO L. ACOSTA, a poorly educated incompetent attorney BEWARE DO NOT HIRE THESE  ATTORNEYS. ripoff Van Nuys California","
										WILLIAM A. ACOSTA a poorly educated incompetent attorney BEWARE DO NOT HIRE THESE ATTORNEYS. Son of MARIO L. ACOSTA also an accomplice in their Law office of ACOSTA and ACOSTA, DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I MADE! REPORT ANY DISPUTE TO THE LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY. The Acosta's are located at 6931 Van Nuys blvd. Suite 101, Van Nuys California 91405. WILLIAM A. ACOSTA and MARIO L. ACOSTA practice law in Los Angeles like they do in an underdeveloped country in the Caribbean. 
These ambulance chasers specialize in ripping off the Spanish community with false advertising tricking the English illiterate and naive into their way of interpreting our laws with the purpose of unethically keeping your money.
Desperate to settle my daughter's custody issue for a second time in less than 3 months in the same 2005 year and after firing the last crook attorney J. Michael Kelly, attorneys Mario L. Acosta and William A. Acosta con me of $3.500 unbelievable! I choose Mario L. Acosta because I though been a Latino and a Judge in a Spanish court program he will be honest and fair but I was completely wrong this Judge is an imposter a fake a poor educated in our law and he though his son the same dirty tricks except William A. Acosta has a personality complex with a cocky and arrogant attitude. 
When I first give William A. Acosta the $3.500 for the retainer I notice he was so surprise and shock he dint' know what to do he walk out of his office and left the money on his desk like he never had so much money in his hands.
This is what they did to me, I requested from day one to meet and retain Mario A. Acosta to represent my custody issues only because of his demeanor in the Spanish TV. And his more years practicing law, but from the first day I enter their office their personnel are train to manipulate you and direct you not to Mario A. Acosta but to the still wet behind the ears recently graduated William A. Acosta, I never wanted this incompetent handling my daughters legal matters? But they stick me with this wane be attorney and the problems begun. 
After my initial meet I never talk to any of the Acosta's on the phone always with other personnel and paralegals they were never available, they were afraid to talk on the phone it was very strange, they never return my calls, they set court appointments with asking me first, the make me go to court to find out that I did not completed Conciliation court a mandatory in California courts all attorneys knows this except this two incompetents, and they did this intentionally to charge me and charge me for a second court appearance, clever for them but it is a rip-off for me.
On the day of the final hearing I expected Mario L. Acosta to represent me in front of the judge but instead William Acosta show up, he was unprepared in a bad mood arrogant and asking me ridicules questions and upset because I ask for his father Mario Acosta, I quickly ask him to ask the judge for a continuance and we all agree and he accepted but this spoiled little brat had other get back at me plans in less than five minutes while I when to get my mobile phone to the Santa Monica court parking lot William Acosta requested to put my case off calendar, then like a coward on the run calls me to tell me what he did and refuse to meet me. 
Then I received a call from his personnel requesting another retainer of $3.500 to start all over again. When I ask for my bill I received an over inflated bill including a $12.00 per minute paralegal calls and $12.00 per fax page unbelievable! you tell me is this a rip off or what! 
The reason for posting this now and not in 2005 is because after using the system of first reporting to The State Bar of California, The Los Angeles County District Attorney, The State of California Attorney General, The Better Business Bureau, Arbitration, Dispute Mediation and Small Claims Court these crooks attorney know how to navigate these useless avenues, now it is my turn to make you aware and expose these low life immoral individuals. These crooks attorneys are so use to ripping people off and getting away that when you take them to court they actuality feel offended. I will be checking on them for years to come I have the time.
In Small Claims court the coward of William A. Acosta did not show up only his father did and Mario L. Acosta a Judge lie in front of the Small Claim court Judge that's correct this dishonest attorney and Judge lie in front of me and the court.
They owed me $3.500 and I will take them to court again, I have the time I will retain another attorney to expose these two crooks with a corrupt minds.

										I purchased a car through Household Automotive on 3/26/01 which is almost 7 years ago. I made payments on the car for 4 years. Two years ago my husband was hospitalized for an extended time and I couldn't make the car payments. The car was repossessed and sold at auction. 
Over the last three months I received a couple of phone calls from a Daniels & Norelli. They threatened to take my house, garnish my pay and had information about me from my credit report, including who holds my mortgage. They told me I had to come up with the money, to borrow it or whatever was necessary. I reported them to the Attorney General and they stopped calling. 
Then out of the blue, last night my husband and I got served papers (a ""summons"") from Daniel and Norelli that states we have 20 days to respond and they want $18,030.99. The details are incorrect, including the monthly payment I had for the car and the total owed. They also lied in the summons and said I had been served a copy of the contract, which is not true.

Charles Adlai Rich,"  Charles Adlai Rich  2911 Turtle Creedk, #300 
Dallas, Texas U.S.A. ",,888-599-6333,Charles Adlai Rich Attorney at Law Completely Unprofessional Liar Takes your Money and Runs Doesn't Return Client Phone Calls Leaves you Hanging Admitted to Drug Problems ripoff Dallas Texas,"
										Charles Adlai Rich, who DID work at 2911 Turtle Creek in Dallas - takes your money and runs!  You'll never get a dime's worth of a job done because he's a thief!  He took my $2500 retainer to start a job for me in ""Probate Law"" which he claimed to specialize in.  About a week after giving him my money, he writes me a letter stating that if I have a drug addiction, he will not be able to represent me.....I'm thinking, what in the??  So I produce 2 months of ""clean UA's"" to him at my own expense, to ease his mind.  Of course later I realized he was trying to come up with an excuse to drop my case and keep my money.  
Come to find out, 6 months down the road after I've seen that he is not professional at all, doesn't even seem to know what he's doing, doesn't return phone calls after a lengthy time of absence from speaking with me on the case, and other things, not to mention exploding his temper on the phone, an attitude not becoming of a professional attorney, & just out-and-out weird happenings - he walks out the door of his little ol' rented office with a desk and nothing else, that was rented on the third floor of a luxury highrise in Turtle Creek (to have the name & facade of class & style) without a single reason as to why or here's what you should do!  One day he's your attorney, the next day (after you've paid him a large retainer), he sends a letter stating he is no longer practicing law and has moved out of his office.  He gives no reason as to why he has abandoned me, and taken my money with no  results in my case.  He literally did nothing!  he took my money, proceeded to act more and more strange as the days went by, and he only works by his cell phone, which to me is almost the same as a fly-by-night company, cause you can easily avoid your clients phone calls - what with no secretary, no helper to answer the phone, no one to give you any answers or information.   I am talking about giving this guy $2500 to start a case that he told me would probably not cost any more, and that would likely be resolved in six months or less.  Six months after paying him, he hasn't done a single thing, not even a court date.  He only served the papers to the opposing party, and he even sent me to the county to serve the papers and told me that it's going to cost me an extra $300.  I asked him isn't that why I paid him, to do this stuff for me?  Anyway, I did deliver the papers to the clerks office in that county, but I insisted he use HIS credit card to pay, which - by the way, was only $40 !  He was going to take another $300 of my money and I'd never known the difference had I not went to the county clerks office in the flesh and found out the price on my own.  
It took Charles Rich 6 months to serve papers to the opposing party.  In all this time I couldn't get any answers or info at all from him.  He made so many mistakes on the original petition filed with the county clerk, that they couldn't even have their officers serve the papers because he had the wrong address of my lawsuit party!  They are the ones who told me what was taking so long.  when I asked Charles Rich what was taking so long for the papers to be served, he claimed that the county down there didn't know what they were doing.  He lied to me yet again.  I can actually county at least 10 lies that guy told me in the time I knew him handling my case.  It seems every time I did get hold of him on hi cell phone, he was always ""driving down the road""    -  never in his office or in court.  I don't know what this guy was up to half the time.  
He has a habit of ""blowing his stack"" at you if you ask him anything about your case.  Then when you threaten to drop him, he apologizes adherently and says he has a lot of problems, or had his kid over the weekend, or didn't get any sleep, or is getting a divorce, or his plumbing is messed up, or just didn't get any sleep again, or blah-blah-blah.  What about MY problems??  The ones I paid him to handle for me in a professional manner?  Forget THAT!  
After 9 months of absolutely nothing except having papers served to the other party and me worrying about what this guy's problem is, and worrying about trying to come up with another $2500 or $3000 to pay another attorney to work my case, worrying about the time running out on my case, just wondering what kind of a monster did I find to take my case (He came off good on day one, but that's the only day he seemed like he knew what he was doing - except for one thing, he did seem to have a hangover that morning I went to visit him originally, but I figured, hey, he's a lawyer.)  
It was all an act.  He's a dumbA**.  He later admitted the truth to me when I asked him exactly what kind of law did he practice - and he stated ""criminal"" - I realized then, this guy is F----d up!  He had told me ""Probate"" !!!  Didn't know a thing about Probate Law!
Well just about 11 months to the day of me hiring him, he sends a later stating he is no longer practicing law.  Nothing about my case!  I was in the middle of a fairly large inheritance/probate battle against a greedy, law-breaking sibling - and this is how my lawyer leaves me hanging.  No apologies about anything, no word on who to maybe go to for finishing my case, no nothing - except for a bill saying I owed him even more money!!
I don't think there's a possibility anyone else can get burned by this guy since he's not practicing law anymore, but beware just in case.  Don't even look his way.  He's a young, inexperienced, no-count, lying, cheating, drug-influenced (at his own admission) THIEF!  After trying to contact him on his cell phone when i received his letter, he just hung up on me.  But he doesn't seem to be chasing me down for the ""money I owe him"" - OMG this guy is something else.  If you should ever see his advertising anywbere, RUN!  Run as fast as you can away from this swindler.  Oh and by the way, his website was the most unprofessional thing I'd ever seen.  Lots of typos and mistakes throughout.  Like it wasn't even proofed before being put on the web for the world to see!  Doesn't surprise me.  This guy is a no-class loser.    What an expensive mistake I made.  Makes me wonder if my judge of character will ever be trustworthy again!  I'm scared to trust any lawyers now!

Marietta, Georgia U.S.A. ",,888-610-8293,Law Offices Of Gerald E. Moore & Assoc. Trying to collect a debt using fraud and threatening letters to do so Marietta Georgia,"
										Law Offices of Gerald E. Moore are trying to collect a debt that has charged off and is considered a bad debt, they have sent repeated letters that in one way or another have been very very nasty and unkind.... 
Plus they just sent Today A National Arbitration Claim to colect the Charged off debt! I have learned that I am not the only one who is being persued by this law firm that I find out is a Front, a fraud.....on many many people from ripoffreport and budhipps.com plus various other internet searches that I did today, when I became suspicious of this letter.... instead of sending a validation to me they sent me a photo copied booklet of the Cardmember Agreement.... Not exactly right business form huh!!!!
So it is clear that they are trying to scam money out of me to line their pockets, also too Gerald is only licsensed to pratice in California and Georgia, not in Michigan where I reside.... Plus in this letter or claim they (Gerald and Associates) are saying things about Arizona Laws and how they Will make me pay everything and more?? Come on I was not born today!! 
This Law Office has Many many different address all centered around Marietta, GA, now come on who moves around that much.... This letter or claim I got today lists them at Northwest Parkway, their website says that they are located at New Market Parkway?? What is this all about???
I know that they are trying to scare me into paying for this charged off debt that may have run out of statues in my home state of Michigan!! So check with your State to see if the Statues of Limitations has run out for them to collect on your owed debt!!!
Gerald E. Moore is not a very respected ""Law Office"" if it really is a Law Practice at all???
Americans Need to open their eyes and put a stop to people and businesses like Gerald E. Moore and Associates, Big people 'thinking' they can bully other people around....not gonna happen..

Bonham, TexasU.S.A. EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E. 
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent! DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get. 
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state. 
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. ",Lawyers,0

										I aquired tax debt upon my wife's kidney's failing and getting behind paying on them.  So I'm ""unlucky"" enough for my wife to call one of Roni's partners in crime while I'm out of town.  Let me tell you, they make you think that they are really helping you, because while your paying your bill, you receive mail everyday from the office.  
But I noticed that as soon as they withdrew the last payment, I stopped getting mail from them, until one day which was about one year from when we started this hellish ride with them, I received a big long letter.  Guess what it said, ""sorry but you do not qualify for a Offer in Compromise.""  Then the next piece of paper said ""Sign this paper to end them from representing me!""  
I guess it took them a year to figure that I didn't qualify.  Look we have a couple of options: 1) Let's all put in some money and get a commercial letting the world know about Roni's great multi level ripping off scheme, or 2) Pray that the next terrorist plot involves that office and Roni is in it.

I only expect people/companies to be honest and fair. When I was approached by the folks selling the Lawstar stock, I was honest and followed through with my commitments. I only want Lawstar to follow through with their commitments to me and other investors.

										Martin Pelmore is a scam artist.

So at this point we have contacted the FBI among ""other"" agencies to bring this scumbag in. He would be wise to give up now before it gets much worse for him.
  This has cost me over 600 dollars and i have no intentions of making this my last entry or inquiry on this ""Martin Pelmore"" As a veteran, a taxpayer, a father, it boggles the mind as to how some ignorant thief thinks he will be living out his days on the beach or something like that after doing what he has done to the public.

I suppose at some point you just ripoff the wrong person. A1creditrepairinc.com and FastCreditinc.com are a scam, and Mr. Martin Pelmore is behind it. After about six months of waiting, we still have not heard a word from from neither this company nor from Mr Martin (marty) Pelmore.

Tucker, Georgia U.S.A. ",,888-829-5239,"Beryl Farris Ripoff Immigration Law Failure to deliver on prepaid services, unprofessionalism and incompetence Tucker Georgia","
										Beryl and her team get paid first, promise the world, and then do nothing. No returned phone calls, no response to faxes and emails, all leading to missed deadlines for processing labor certification applications as part of trying to get a greencard. Beryl blames her clients for her incompetence, and never acknowledges valid compaints. 
Result was that after spending over $3000, there is nothing to show for it, and any work that may have been done is wasted, yet we have been contacted by Beryl ONLY to attempt to extract more money. Beryl refuses to even acknowledge and address my request for refund due to non-performance. I took my business elsewhere, and never looked back. 
It is even more reprehensible that Beryl actually has the audacity to be active in the expatriate community my fmaily belong to, in order to generate more business. Beware, beware, beware. I'm not the only one who has been ripped off here. 
Beryl Farris was engaged to assist me and my wife, Sandy, in process a greencard for US residency.  Beryl and her staff have proven to be unprofessional, unresponsive, irresponsible, and ignorant of her responsibilities.  
Our simple complaint is that for our $$$$ prepayments, Beryl should return phone calls, meet promised deadlines, and take responsibility for what she has been paid to do.  Instead, Beryl missed key deadlines, irrespective of our efforts to remain proactive to keep to process moving along. 
We have spent weeks and weeks leaving messages with no 
responses.  Whenever we finally get through, messages were never returned.  When we went to the office personally, all we got was bad news about problems and delays, caused by Beryl's inaction and were blamed by Beryl for it. Beryls' paralegal named Florence, is also culpable in this whole situation. On our last visit personal with Beryl, we  registered our dissatisfaction her performance in these areas.   
Our complaint covered Beryl and her offices lack of results, lack of communication, missed dates, broken promises, unprofessionalism, high cost (over $3300 so far) 
and poor overall service we have received.  We believe there is no reason to believe Beryl will complete what we paid for.  Beryl has since had the audacity to suggest by way of invoice that we should pay and additional $1200 to continue the work, as well as another letter suggesting $700 in further advertising.  
This would equate to a sum total investment of $5200, which is unjustifiable.  Our response to Beryl requested to refund all moneys be re-paid due to non-performance. 
An example delays caused is where we pre paid $500 for a website ad to advertize the job to meet immigration rules. Aside from the usual delays and inaction, we were then blamed for some delay in color selection, which is totally irrelevant to the 
process.  
Result is Beryl missed a key processing deadlines, and 
we have since lost years in getting greencard approval due to subsequent law changes.  We now have to endure the consequences and thousands more in alternate legal costs. 
We are good, law abiding, honest Australians who work hard, pay taxes etc. and have been betrayed by an attorney who continually tries to build busines and trust in the Australian community.
Shame on Beryl.

Long Beach, California U.S.A. ",,888-829-5239,Larry H Parker ...These are Hacks...Lawyers don't even work on your case Long Beach California,"
										I was in a car accident on March 10, 2005...a hit & run buy a ""Hertz"" rent a car. The driver and passenger hit my driver door while I was driving and proceeded to get away. I caught up to them we got out of the car and and we gor their license plate and then they took off. We waited for police to come take our report and was told that it was linked to ""Hertz rent a car. We called Hertz and told them what had happend (Hertz in Roseville/Taylor) 
They would not help us and this is because they rented to a person without getting the right info. The reason I know this is because 1 month before they needed our SS card, DL, 2 forms of CC's and they had to speak w/our Ins carier and then we could rent a car! Well, ""Hertz"" didn't file a stolen car report until ""AFTER"" we filed our report and had talked to several people in the ""Hertz"" organization...with a lot of hesitation! 
We spoke w/ a Jerry Caroprese VP if claim said ""they would NOT do anything for us...if someone had died and it had been on the air, it would be PR"" Nice...I think!
Anyways...I called Larry h Parkers office said they would take care of it....it's not almost 2yrs later after me calling them for updates, going days and sometimes months w/o a call back. Santiago was the asst to Marilyn Fernandez the negotiator and he would screen my calls. I would leave messages and would never call me back. 
I left a message one day saying I would like to speak to a supervising attorney and I got Marilyn. A few times I would call and they said they had something from the INS company...mine not Hertz because they sued my INS company and it was letters they had received in June and I'm calling in Aug and they were now going to send it only because I called! My case just ended they said....
My husband settled w.our INS company and he received more $$$ than I did and I went through Larry H Parkers office. My daughter received $300 and this was her 1st accident and we couldn't even get her in the car for over 1 month because she was soooo scared. I went to the chiropractor for over a yr and now my sciatic nerve has been disturbed, and now if i even bend over to pick up my daughter or blow dry my hair my back will go out and i can't move sometimes 2-3 days sometimes 2-3 weeks. 
Marilyn's response to that was ""wow...that's awful"" She spoke to my employer because he needed to write a letter regarding my job duties and told him ""I don't know why she couldn't go to work, it seems like she should be able to"" Lucky w/that comment I didn't get fired!
Now, I need to sign something and she is avoiding my calls because she doesn't want to give me my check. Which I need the money. No one will take my calls they are avoiding me. I called them because I thought they were going to fight for me and they lied. 
They never even filed a lawsuit against ""Hertz"" the real culprit and so now this big company gets away w/negligence and they get 40% of the $7000.00 that i got. 
I am upset and I am disappointed because the money I spent to get my car fixed and painted and the rental that i had to get for 2wks came out of my pocket. I would never ever trust them! They are trully a terrible company to work with. 
They called my chiropracter and Marilyn said ""Next time use one of our people because they can find more injuiries...the more injuiries the more money.....how about I have a back problem for the rest of my life....and if I ever have children it will cause serious stress on my back!!! But hey they got there 40%, i guess that's all that matters!

Corvallis, Oregon U.S.A. ",,888-84-justice,Jeane Smith And Assc. what a scam Corvallis Oregon,"
										I retained the services of this firm, one attorney in particular Jay Falkner, for water damages to our home caused by our neighbor who sealed up a right of way. for two years we have been defending our home because this clown Trevor Perry thought it would be fun to rid himself of his neighbors Catherine and Francis, but as it turned out we he didnt think this City boy had any fight in him.
I contacted this so called attorney and described to him our problem and he said he would take our case. We presented him with video tapes phoyographs and witness to back our story up. He gave us his word, he wouldnt have taken this case if he was going to lose, famous last words. His anyways.
We delt with flooding waters for two years  that had left our home in shambles.  We had mold comming thru our floors and carpets, our home was splitting in half and sinking, walls were cracking, our shop was seperating from the house. and the foudation was sinking and comming apart. because this guy decided to cut off drainage from our lot. stopping the water from leaving.
We had county and state officials come to our rescue and have this man open the right of way. still this guy did not want to. We had our City who thought it would be nice and asked the man to open the drain, but still nothing. This guy said that the water flowed in the other dirwection. Really, So we hire engineers to scope out the site and found this guy was wrong, the water flowed downhill from our location. 
A simple survey proved that this guy was in the wrong, with expert testamony from some very recomended engineers, state officials as well as county officials, contractors and others who testified on our behalf couldnt stop the knife going deep into my wifes back. Not from testomony from witness but for the lack of evidence that the defence had stricken from being used in court, because it brought back bad memories for his client. WHAT! You heard me, they had the judge throw out our evidence because it was to painful for the defences client to see.
Now I've heard alot of things, and after the verdict, our attorney refused to appeal, because we lacked the evedence, well if you would have refused the defences plea to drop the the videos and photos, we had him by his b**s.
If looks could kill, this attorney who I had alot of respect and admiration for, would have been dead right where he was standing.
We get our bill every month from not onlt this peice of S@%T but the defences, buy the way this so called attorney had told my wife he would have the bill reduced, because he was sure he could have won. Yeah thats why the bill hasnt gone down one dime since, and what about thiose charges that seem to go up one month and then down the next, I was asked to have these statements sent to the US Postal inspectors Office to have them review them. I guess its a crime to over charge interest thru the US Post Office.
I hope he gets his act togather, because I am not even close to being done with that clown.

Chicago, Illinois U.S.A. ",,888-854-0041,Cowelltaradash P.C. - Wes Cowell - Gordon Nelson ripoff Chicago Illinois,"
										Abused a $3,500.00 retainer fee by allowing process server to have conversations with them knowing I was no thappy with the server I chose. Making rude statements to me that if the lawyers talk about my case I am charged even if it is a simple question. Client lawyer relationship abused.
In late December I did an internet search for a divorce lawyer . I found a web site called Illinoisdivorce.com and called the number. My call was returned in a fashionable manner the same hour. I visited the office located at the address listed as I booked an appointment with Wes Cowell. Unable to get to the office on time I was on the phone with Mr Cowell and prior my arrival he suddenly had to leave and I was introduced with Gordon Nelson who claims Mr Cowell got sudden food poisioning.  It was explained to me that my case is not hard to handle and in fact, many cases like mine are easily represented in cout. I felt assured this law firm knew what they were doing . I paid $3,500.00 retainer fee. A pleading was filed in cook county courts which needed to be served by process server .
I chose to find my own to save on costs which were suppose to come off of my retainer fee. I went to http://www.servenow.com and called a process server spoke with me and called me leaving  voice mail to contact him. Upon calling he wanted to talk to me about his ""web site "" which was his rock and roll band in Atlanta. He then went on to discuss how he only charges 65 dollars for two attempts to serve and later on 
increased his fee by $10.00. He then went on to discuss that he wants to set up survellance . I did not want this . I spoke with both lawyers and expressed my dis-satisifaction with the process server and the fact that no one ever returns my calls from this law firm . I explained that I have done all of my own research and located my husband and that I would allow two more attempts to have him served and that my cost for process server would be $150.00 and then no more . It was agreed upon both in writing and via phone. A statement was amde by Wes Cowell to me that everything costs money when I call the office and that if he had to discuss my concerns about my case to Gordon Nelson he would charge me a fee even though they work together. I stopped calling the office once I learned it was costing  me money off my retainer fee. I requested no more conversations with the Atlanta process server and to PLEASE discontinue him as of Jan 16th  as it had been 10 days since and no progress was being made. Today , I received an  email letter from Wes Cowell telling me to pay the process server out of my own pocket which is yet another insult to me as a client . The process server has been verbally abusive to me saying send me money before I attemt to serve, and then telling me he will not be speaking to me and will only communicate with my lawyers. I feel that this law firm is only good for returning phone calls reguarding anything related to new clients who will come in , pay a retainer and have little or no results. My case is not local yet they told me it was not hard to do for a divorce with property yet from how the communication is more focused on tme instead of approach 
I feel financially abused. Instead my money was used to have wasted conversations with a process server who the law firl knows has been unsucessfull and harsh  using my law firm as a go between accusing me of harassing him and the law firm knew I wanted let go after two attempts to have my husband served with no sucess knowing that they were charging my retainer have allowed survellance to be set up allowing the bill to increase knowing  $150.00 was all I would pay and knowing I did not want private detective services. I have been charced for all conversations to the law firm by  process server on way too many occasions. I can feel the law firm has no intention of doing anything for me yet wishes to have my money be paid to themselves for focus on literally all unimportant things in this matter causing me to become upset,. to cry , and to refuse my wishes to stop the contact with the Atlanta process server and to approach the courts in which they have failed to do. I find them to be a disgrace to lawyers and have asked them to return what is left of my retainer and I feel that my cost should be adjusted fairly as it is now going to cost me additional fees to search for a lawyer once again . 
Furthermore, other lawyers have mentioned to me proceedures they feel should have hapened reguarding this law firms approach to the courts in which was neglected because of the focus of paying each other and a process server knowing that me as a client felt abused.

										My daughter, Shirley,  was killed, along with her husband, on July 15, 2003. She was 29 years old and left three babies. I tried to sue the city of Dallas as well as the Omega company that was doing road work for the city of Dallas. According to witnesses, there were no flagmen at the site and you could not see if on coming traffic was coming. My son-in-law, Fredrick, pulled in front of a speeding truck and was killed as well as my daughter. The city charged Fredrick with the murder of my daughter, claiming he was at fault. How can a dead man tell his side of the story. He has a charge of murder on his record. Rad Law Firm took my case as well as the rest of our family's and after a long drawn out ordeal, we settled on July 14, 2006. I was discouraged from going to court. Adam Hardison told me if I went to court that the rest of my family would have to wait on me for their money. I signed papers for a settlement of around $8,000 dollars. $6,000 from Omega, and $2,000 from Progressive Insurance. I was not given a copy of the settlement papers on July 14,2006 nor did I know to ask for one.
I was notified September 10, by ""Phil"" Bally that my settlement was now $4,749.87 and that if I didn't agree with the amount to take it up with Mr. Rad knowing I didn't have any way of proving I was owed more. I have yet to be paid. I really believe that he was afraid to sue the city of Dallas, took a payoff from the Omega company, and spent my part of the settlement. I reported the Rad Law Firm to the Attorney General but they (being lawyers themselves) said they had dismissed my complaint finding no wrong doing on their part. My only baby girl is worth $4,749.87. Does anyone believe that the Omega company or the city of Dallas even took notice of a sweet, beautiful baby girl that died wrongfully on July 15, 2003? Do you think that anybody thought of the three children that would have to be raised by family at the family's expense? All the money to be paid to the children is in a trust. Do you believe that the city of Dallas or the Omega company will not let this happen again?

										I got behind on my mortgage payment and they never wanted to work with me.  I never liked talking to them because they were always so rude.  The triler park that our home is in has lot rent that is over $400 dollars a month.  They always called my family memebrs telling them all my info.  They were always ending someone out to take pictures and telling whoever was at my house my business and warning them to have me call them.  Well hello try being a little more friendly and maybe I would.  In April 2007 I contacted my rep and he told me to get with my husband pack our things and get out.  Mind you I was going to have surgery on May 1st and anything I brought up to them on why I was behind was all not important.  He told me I had only a few days to get out.  So I took off work to pack and move frantically because I didn't want them taking all my belongings.  Now it took them 2 or three months to finally come and takeover.  I had to keep calling because the trailer park wanted to take me to court every month for non payment of rent.  Well that was all Vanderbilt I was out so I was not paying rent.  
     Well it is now October 7th and the house has a For Sale Sign in and it still sets empty.  We could have been cought up by now.  The reason we got behind on the payments is because the park started filing by the 12th of the month for eviction.  Well depending on the way we got paid we had to pay it late.  Everytime they filed we had to pay an extra $300.  There went part of our house payment right there.  When I told Vanderbilt Mortgage on what was happening they said it was all not important.     
We lived in our home for five years and everyting started to go wrong with the house within in the first two.  Like the corners of our home were splitting and when I called the house company they only fixed one corner.  You could hear the wind through them.
   I had the impression in the beginning that our mortgage was fixed too.  It always was going up.  Well that is enough on Vanderbilt Mortgage because I could go on FOREVER!!  Thanks Vanderbilt for getting me out of the park and my falling apart home.

										After calling his office, his case manager (Art Cortez) came to my house and he told me how good mr. Bernstein was, also told me about his 35 years experience and he went on and on so I believed all that and decided to hire him to defend my brother in a child molestation case (this is a long story but I'll make it short) I paid him 50K and the same thing that happened to Tammy of Victorville, I never talked to Bernstein over the phone or went to his office to discuss the case, sent other paralegals to court out of about 12 times in court he omly showed up about 4 times, even the judge asked his rep when is Bernstein going to come in. 
He took a whole year to start the trial, during that year we gave his investigator a lot of information, which I paid him $3500 dlls. (jeremy Karpel, he was the one that represented Bernstein in court) phone numbers, names,addresses, but he also didn't do anything, the times he came to court we had to chase him to the parking lot to try to give him information or to ask him what's been going on, but he would not tell me anything. I also paid $3500 for a psychological examination, which I never heard the report and the times I asked I never got an answer,and by the way it was never mentioned in court. 
During this year we never heard of any offers. Before the trial started Bernstein told us that he had witnesses and that he was ready, the truth was that all of that was just a lie, because he was not ready, we finally got an offer just before the trial which my brother refused. Well the trial only lasted 3 days and 1 1/2 day was to select the jury so the actual trial lasted a day and a half, oviously with a bad result, but a lot of things we told him he never mentioned during the trial and he didn't have any witnesses, I was very shocked by the way the trial went and the first thing that came to my mind was ""what a fu----g thief"". When Bernstein came out of court I wanted an explanation and the only words that came out of his mouth ""I don't want to hear ifs, ands and buts"" and he walked away from us, and I never heard from him again. 
Advise to people ; Never hire this guy.

										Ok,  I receive a message from a guy named Jimmy at this collection agency. I call him back and says i owe $900.00 dollars for a CC machine from a company i use to work for, apparently before they went out of business they used my info.
When i spoke to Jimmy, at first he was ok then he says i should file bankruptcy, when i tried to explain that i was just an employee there, immediately he starts screaming into the phone that he is going to sue me and says things i couldn't understand and hangs up. 
I called him back, he didn't pick up so left him a message telling him not to call back and harass me.
Ten minutes later my wife calls me, scared and frantic and says a guy named Jimmy called from MBW (he used his companies initials), he asked about me she tolled him i was at work, so he asks for my number and she refused to tell him so he tells her a phone number and asks her if it was mine, she tells him try it and find out.  Now he tells her that ""your husband owes me money and i am coming right now to your house to get it"" she replied ""don't come here if you do I will call the police"" he says ""I am coming now, i will be right there"" then he hangs up.
I called him back, now he welcomes the phone call, I yell at him and threaten him (I know  I was pissed) and he continues with the call without hanging up, he starts to name people in my family, do you know? and names my wife, my brother and my father.
I tried to call the police and they put me on hold then hung up (Cleveland Police).
After all this i get a call, supposedly from the MBW legal department stating they have me recorded threatening  him, I should add when asked who i was i did not respond and never acknowledged who was talking to even though he knew.
What do I do, any Ideas how to handle thugs.

Ada, Oklahoma U.S.A. ",,908-850-6661,PrePaid Legal Their Referral Attorneys are Scandalous. Ada Oklahoma,"
										This company is a complete fraud. I contacted this company in 2003 because I needed legal assistance regarding an employment / worker's comp issue.
I signed up for membership and began paying $26/month. They referred me to an Attorney Ronald M. Canter. This man is one of the most unprofessional & unethical individuals employed as a lawyer. Not only did he sit on my case, he referred me to a completely corrupt doctor who attempted to bribe me twice after a failed attempt to falsify my medical records as well as misdiagnose me on purpose. The Lawyer never returned correspondence unless I called to complain to Pre Paid Legal. When he had himself removed from the case because he could see that I was not a sucker for his game, I was referred to another Firm -  The Same occured like its written as a script.
Here's how they operate the scam together: The attorneys in the beginning will act as if they are gung ho about repping for you- but will shortly stop returning all correspondence knowing that you will be or will eventually get upset. When you finally call Prepaid Legal to complain or to have them call you, the referral attorney will say that you threatened them or their assistants and Pre Paid Legal will side with them and the attorney will DROP YOU AS A CLIENT. This happened to me with both attorneys and Pre Paid Legal will take the stand of not being responsible for the actions of the attorneys they have referred to you but continue to collect monthly dues from you. No Refunds on what you've paid for thus far- but they will happily refer you to another attorney so that you can have the pleasure of experiencing the same thing again. The issues you have with the attorneys must be taken up with the State Bar (which most people just wont do because it is very time consuming to put together the facts and timeline of what the attorney did and did not do.) If you're on the phone long enough with a customer service rep they'll transfer you to a person named ""Danette"" who will ramble on about the benifits of your pre paid legal membership- with a bunch of fake "" I understand your position"" comments. Hearing this is pointless because you cant get your lawyer on the phone in the first place! She will emphasize that pre-paid is ""not responsible"" for the actions of the attorney and she/ they will talk you in circles until you finally get frustrated enough to get off the phone. They dont help you at all but hurt you alot. My case is almost 5 years long and this company has played me with their games and their fake attorneys that will sabotage your case and your life.

										I sent a letter to them, this is what it said,  Also explains my situation:
My name is Angela and I have an issue with Credicure going out of business and how my account was handled.  In result of this issue, three of my credit cards were late in receiving there payments and/or returned due to insufficient funds.(Never Recieving my money.)
Needless to say I was very frustrated and tried several times to get a straight answer as to where my payments were going and what was going to be done. I felt very betrayed and let down. The whole purpose of this program was to get my credit on track and it was once again derailing!
NO one was returning my calls or e-mails! Without any further information as to what was going to be done, I cancelled my program with his offices and Credicure. I put a stop on your automated payments from my accounts and that is when I finally heard from Joy Flannery. 
I have explained to her that I want what money is due to me and I am no longer interested in your Debt Management program. Joy has explained that to further assist me I needed to send in my statements, so I had gathered all the supporting documentation that had been required of me. I sent in all statements attached to a copy of this letter. To point out some additional information, I had included my bank statement to show that I started with the program on October 17th 2005. However no proposals or payments were applied to any of my cards until December 2005. 
Total  October and November 2005:  $ 264.00   	
I am curious as to why the company had no records of my payments and when or where they were applied.  Regardless I am entitled to my money and I do expect it to be paid in full! 
 The Break down is as follows:
Sears: 
a.	First Payment made 12/01/2005   $25.00
b.	Last Payment made  07/26/2006 $25.00 
c.	Total due to me for Sears   $25.00

c.	Payment made on 07/26/2006 of $51.00 was returned (insufficient funds) 
d.	Total due to me for Chase Bank  $102.00

										I was 18 and living on my own in Detroit.  I had 3 credit cards with a $500 max sent to me by various companies.  I was learning to use them corectly until I lost my job.  I used the cards to float and survive.  They maxed out and i couldn't even pay the minium.  It's easy at that age to let things get out of control with no regard for the future.  I stoped paying and moved and got a new phone and was lost to my creditors for 5 years.  
I grew up and was ready to buy my first house.  I had to track down my own collection agency because my account had been sold and re sold.  I was in contact with all 3 collection agencies and was really trying to see how much money I would have to get to clear all of this up. 2 of the 3 agencies were helpful and polite and willing to settel my orginal debt of around $500 which had balloned into a $1,500 collection account.
To get these settlement amounts I had to give a post dated check.  I called 2 of the 3 agencies just before the date on the check to tell them to wait because my dad was in italy and he was going to lend me the money for the pay-offs.  2 of the 3 said ok wrote down this information and later got there money as agreed.  
The offices of Scott Lowery who had been rude and overbaring from the begining.  Canceled my deal and said I owed the full amount.  I tried explaining and according to their records I had payments pending with 2 other credititors and called me a liar.  Mr. Studsman (a.k.a. Captin D***head)  shouted at me and then hung up like a coward.  I explained i was trying to clean up my credit and purchase a house.  I CONTACTED THEM!!! I understand i was a deadbeat but as soon as i contacted them they were like wolves feasting on my dieing financial carcass.  Captin D***head last words to me were,""Good luck getting a house!!""  
Well a***ole I got my house and a hot wife.  At my job I have the task of collecting past due invoices.  I don't know if it's just a southern thing but you can get more bees with honey than viniger.  There is no need to be overly rude and demanding to people.  I understand they have to chase down deadbeats and they probley hear all sorts of tall tales.  Listen to people before you run off at the mouth or you might get more than an ear full of profanity.

" Eric Lentz,Esq ","  Eric Lentz,Esq  181 Parsonage Hill Rd 
Short Hills, New Jersey U.S.A. ",,916-241-4626,"Eric Lentz,Esq malpractice Short Hills New Jersey","
										Around November 2001, I met with Mr. Lentz, who at the time was with Garces and Grabler Law Firm, regarding appealing the onset date of my Social Security disability claim.  I specifically asked him if I could lose my benefits should I follow through with the appeal and his exact words were ""no, you can't lose your benefits, you're just appealing the onset date.""  Unfortunately I found out the hard way that this was not correct.
I decided to retain Mr. Lentz because of his knowledge of Lyme disease, however I was advised that my case was being handled by another attorney,  Mr. A. Suarez, however, I was still under the impression that Mr. Lentz would represent me at the hearing.  What happened with Mr. Suarez is the subject of another report and resulted in my benefits being taken away.  I asked Mr. Lentz to handle my appeal and he represented to me that he would.  I found out a year later that the appeal was never filed and in fact my entire file was missing.
Mr. Lentz failed to inform me that I could have filed to keep my benefits through the appeals process, and because of that, I have had no income during this entire time.
Mr. Lentz forwarded a certification to Social Security regarding this matter and the Appeals Court.  Mr. Lentz asserted malpractice on Mr. Suarez' behalf in this certification.  The Court overturned the Judge's decision and ordered a new hearing.  Mr. Lentz assured me that he would be prepared for this hearing and should it still be an unfavorable outcome, he would represent me throughout the entire process: until I got my benefits back, or until there was no further remedy.  Mr. Lentz assured me of this on many, many occasions. Even up to his last e-mail to me, Mr. Lentz always maintained his belief that I am truly disabled and unable to work.  
New hearings were scheduled a couple of times, and unbeknownst to me until a later date, Mr. Lentz adjourned these hearings even knowing how dire my financial situation.  I also found out that the hearing would be with the same judge and thought this was completely unfair and advised Mr. Lentz of this, however, nothing was done about it and I did later find out that I could have filed a complaint about this judge which Mr. Lentz did not advise me.
The second hearing was on November 2005.   I received the report from the judge denying my benefits in May of 2006. Mr. Lentz advised me that he believed the Judge was completely wrong in denying my benefits.  He was very angry and told me that he believed the Judge did not follow the law in this matter.  
In late July of 2006, Mr. Lentz filed what I believe was a form with Social Security advising that we were appealing this matter.  The form was filed just under the 60 day. In the following days, Mr. Lentz assured me that everything was on track and he would be following up shortly with an extensive brief appealing the matter.  Mr. Lentz advised me that he did not file the brief within the 60 days because he needed more time to do so.  As I pressured Mr. Lentz to file this brief, he then advised me that he needed the transcript of the hearing.  I'm not sure exactly when Mr. Lentz requested this transcript as, as I have said, Mr. Lentz never provided me with copies of anything regarding my case.  Mr. Lentz received this transcript I believe in February of 2007 and then told me he couldn't file the brief until he received the transcript of the first hearing.  I did not understand this as the first hearing was obviously already ruled on, thus the second hearing. I asked him if he could file the brief and request that if necessary after receipt of the transcript of the first hearing he could amend it but he did not respond to this.   I'm not sure when Mr. Lentz received the tape of the first hearing because when I questioned him on this in June, he told me that he had already received it.  In mid August 2007, Mr. Lentz informed me that the brief would be completed in five days.  It is almost November and Mr. Lentz has not yet filed the appellate brief in this matter.
Mr. Lentz is no longer communicating with me and will not answer my telephone calls or e-mails and he has stated to my friend that he is not making any money on my case, he is tired of the tone of  my e-mails, and that it is not worth it for him to represent me any longer.  Mr. Lentz did state to me time and time again that he wasn't making any money on my case.   I feel that the reason I lost my benefits in the first place is because of negligence, misrepresentation, error and malpractice (even according to Mr. Lentz).  Mr. Lentz has not adhered to the guidelines of representation set forth by Social Security.

Cleveland, Ohio U.S.A. ",,916-338-1930,"Javitch Block & Rathbone Constant harrassment, real bottom feeder outfit Cleveland Ohio","
										In 1997, I had a serious accident that left me seriously disabled for life. My only source of income since that accident is a VA disability pension of 70% Military Service Connected Disabilities and SSDI.
In 2001, I couldn't meet the payments of various credit cards and medical bills causing me to default on them. I lost all my possessions in a house fire in 1997.
That was the last time I used my Providian 5000 limit credit card. Providian would hold payments to insure I would always get ""late Fee's"" and ""over-limit charges"" regardless if I paid the date the bill came.
That balance is now 7890.00 and 5-years old.  This outfit above has the debt and is constantly bothering me to pay the balance which is in dispute. I don't owe $7800 !
I told this outfit I have no working income, and they continue to threaten me with lawsuits and other methods to get me to pay. 
I cannot pay and worry if I travel overseas for my medical treatment later this year, they will take me to court and have my bank account garnished. I only have 1 bank account where my disability checks are deposited.
I feel ashamed I served the best years of my life in uniform and once disabled treated as a second class citizen to be harrassed in the country I served.
Is there anything I can do?  Ohio has a vague SOL which is not defined.  It says Open account of 5-years, but they say it is considered a Written Agreement = 15-years.   Some websites don't know the SOL for Ohio.
Isn't this against Federal law going after those that only have disability for income.
How can I legally get rid of them, they will never go away and I'm scared to answer my phone now.

They use what they call ""intimidation"" to get a settlement.  I am filing this complaint because of the third call I received.  They just don't get it.  Just because they supposedly work for a law firm doesn't make them above the law!!!  
I have even asked them to mail me a letter with my name and number on it and am still waiting for the letter.  I understand that people who work for P. Scott Lowery have a job to do but to do it in this sort of manner is unacceptable!  People make mistakes and people learn from their mistakes and are fixing them at the same time whereas P.

So I started spending, very carefully and watched and balanced my chck book, spent little  by little the money, having only about $49 dollars left in the ccount i recieved a long awaited rebate check from my cell phone provider for $100.00. i deposited and believing that wachovia would be like anyother bank that would take into consideration any recent deposits i made a few grocery purchases, the next day, Nov. 14, 2007 at 9:00am i look on my online bank account to make sure that my check book is correctly balanced, i was negative and had three overdraft fees and counting. Wachovia held my money friday, saturday, sunday, monday, tuesday and wednesday despite that the $540 deposit was a cash deposit handed down to some girl behind a bullet proof glass. when i questioned them, they responded that on my reciept it said that funds would not be available until the 13 of november, i asked why, and they said that i made the deposit after 2:00pm and any deposits after that time would be accredited on the next business day. 
Is it me or did they just screw me over. Why would they be so inconsiderate. As of today, nov 14, 2007 I have exactly $4.79 that i have found laying around in the house, Ive been without work for 2 weeks and the only money that i had for gas and food Wachovia is using it to buy toasters and keychains to attract new customers. if anyone can help please do so, they need to be stopped.

										I was sued by Rathbone, etc for a dept that was over 11 years old.  At the time of the dept, I was out of work and had growing medical bills.
Rathbone, Javitch and Block purchased the note and claimed that they were representing the credit card company.  My wages were garnished and the amount was paid in full as per the receipt of my employer.
Now, Rathbone & company is claiming that I owe them more.  They actually want to continue the garnishment and are claiming a smaller amount was paid to them.  I have the payroll receipts to prove otherwise.  Now I have 5 days to dispute the claim and have to go to court to fight it.  
Does anyone now the legal time allowed for a credit card dept?  Has anyone else fought these people?  I'm not lying down on this one!  I was out of work for a long time and have been working full time for only 2 years now.  Money is still a little tight.  
Has anyone reported them to the disciplinary board of Ohio?

They said they would make it a priority to get back to him after he faxed it. They never called him!

Coral Springs, Florida U.S.A. ",,919-250-2142,"Hess Kennedy Company This Company is Fraudulent, They do not do what they promised Coral Springs Florida","
										In August 2006 I contacted Hess Kennedy to assist my husband and I with debt settlement.  At the time, our only other option was bankruptcy.  My account, totaling more than $8000.00 was paid in full as of March 2007.  At no time did Hess Kennedy contact any of my creditors.  In June 2007 I was served with a small claims lawsuit filed by one of my creditors.  Since that time I have had 3 judgments against me.  All three accounts were accounts that were to be setted by Hess Kennedy.  Obviously, they did nothing that they had promised to do.  By September 2007 still none of my creditors were paid or even contacted.  
Because of this I requested a refund of ALL monies paid.  Just like previous clients they told me that a portion of my money had gone to pay non-refundable attorneys fees.  However, since they did nothing I do not understand how they earned these fees.  When I spoke with Nancy, on October 24, 2007, in the cancellation department she told me that a refund check would be sent via overnight mail to me on November 16, 2007.  I called and left messages for Nancy on November 15, 16 and 19 to confirm that the refund was being sent.  I never received a call back from her.  This morning, November 20 I called again and got Nancy's voicemail.  I called the receptionist and demanded to speak with Nancy.  I finally got a hold of her and she stated that she had told me that the refund would be sent on November 23.  Being that this is the Friday after Thanksgiving, I told her that I knew her office was closed and would love to know how they proposed that a check would be mailed from an unmanned office???  She told me that there was nothing more she could tell me or do for me.  I demanded to speak to her supervisor, she told me she did not have one.  I told her I wanted to speak to an attorney or anyone else, other than her.  
I finally spoke with a guy named Chris who told me that my refund would be mailed tomorrow 11/21, via overnight mail and that I should receive it on Friday 11/23.  He then gave me a Fed Ex tracking number.  Stay tuned for updates on whether or not I actually receive this check.
By the way, after all of this, we will probably end up having to file for bankruptcy anyway.  
By the way, I am a paralegal.  I work in a prominent Maryland Personal Injury Law Firm and have previously worked for an attorney who specializes in Legal Malpractice.  If and when I receive my refund, I will be contacting him to assist me with filing grievances in Florida and Maryland and to assist me with filing a complaint for Professional Negligence against Hess Kennedy.  Even if they are not attorneys, they cannot proport to be attorneys and be free of consequences.  They will learn this lesson.  Hopefully, if enough of us come together we can put them out on the street, or at least have them barred from their practices in the U.S.
If you are trying to get your money refunded from them and would like to pick my brain, please feel free to contact me, either by responding to this post, or by direct e-mail (((Redacted))).

										In 2001, our home became infested with mold after rising water from a tropical storm.  We hired a company called Service Master in League City, Texas to remediate our home and contents.  This company took everything we owned and stored it into their own storage so it could be cleaned.  They then gutted our home and then left.  Didn't come back and didn't return our calls.  Next thing we knew, they demanded $54,000.00 in order for us to get our belongings back.  Our insurance company was also jacking us around by switching adjusters so often leaving our file a big mess.  They were not paying our claim accordingly.  Meantime, we ( a family of five ) were living in a 33 ft travel trailer in our driveway.  In 2002, we hired Robert D. Clements and Steve Ongert to represent us against both Service Master and our insurance company.  They promised that they would be able to get us three times the amount of our policy.  They claimed that they have done this for all their clients in this situation.  Fourteen months later, the attorneys are $23000.00 richer off of our insurance money and we are still living in a 33 ft travel trailer.  We also found out that they were also representing Service Master at the same time they were representing us.   For fourteen months, they claimed that they were working diligently on our case when in fact I would make calls myself to the insurance company to find that they had not heard from our attorneys.  I would talk to our insurance company and successfully get them to send a check for additional living expenses or such but because we were being represented by Clements & Ongert, they would take 33 % off of any money received even though they did nothing to earn it.  Finally, we fired these two blood sucking thieves and their so called paralegal...Paula.  Some how, they convinced us into giving them a second chance with a promise that they would focus on just our case and get results to get us back into our home.  This is now 2003.  We kept waiting to here from them and again, they would not return our phone calls.  I finally set up a meeting with our insurance company and then called the attorneys to inform them of this meeting.  Clements shows up without our file and with very little knowledge of our case.  He sat there quietly while our agent sat there and hammered and belittled me.  After the meeting was over, Clements said to us, there is nothing more I can do for you, why don't you just sell your home to ""We buy ugly home"" places.  I guess during the meeting, he came to the conclusion that the insurance company was not going to pay out anymore money and that he was plenty satisfied with the $23000.00 that he had already stolen.  He had no intentions on filing a law suit although we had repeatedly asked him to do so during the two years he represented us.  To make sure he was out of our life, I sent him a second letter releasing him from representing us.  We fired them.  He then sent us a letter stating that although he no longer represented us, he was going to ""retain interest"" in our case.  Meaning, any money that the insurance company paid us after he was fired, he would still get his 33% of the money.  Don't sound very fair doe's it.  In Oct, of 2003, our insurance company sent Clements two checks written to my husband and I totaling $5,574.91.  Clements forged our names and deposited the checks in his bank account.  When I called him about it, he lied and stated that I gave hime written permission to do so.  I DID NOT!  We wrote the Texas Bar Assoc. with the intire complaint, sent proof and documentation of everything from 2001 to 2003.  State Bar replied that they saw no negligence on Clements or Ongert and offered no appeal.  Texas State Bar is just as crooked as these attorneys.  I even sent the file of evidence to another lawyer and this attorney stated that without a doubt, we were right and they were wrong and could not believe that the Bar did nothing to them.  Since then, we have learned of many other families that were robbed and taken by these two attorneys.  I hope they find ""Ripoff Report"" and speak out too.  We only owed $70,000.00 on our old mortgage.  Now because of them taking most of all our money and causing our home to sit here for 2 1/2 years to rot, we now owe $200,000.00 on our mortgage.  They did nothing but cost us everything!  We lost our home and our contents no thanks to them.  This is where we raised our kids.  The contents that we did finally get back that was our kids things too and was so molded and ruined that we had to throw it away.  I really hope what comes around goe's around and maybe this is it.

Syracuse, New York U.S.A. ",,919-688-2374,"John S. Crisafulli, Esq. Bad lawyer, worse law guardian, thinks he is the puppet master. Syracuse New york","
										John S. Crisafulli, Esq. is a lawyer who also works as a law guardian.  The Judge appoints him to represent the children in a case.  The clients are ordered to pay him $200 an hour.  He then pressures the parents to come in for weekly counseling sessions for 2 hours at a time, for which they are billed $400.  He spends these sessions trying to act as marriage counselor (which is futile in a divorce case).  He spends most of the session speaking very slowly, pontificating on his own marriage, and glorifying himself as a husband and father (which isn't true, one son doesn't even speak to him).  Sitting through these sessions is torture.
Each parent is pressured by their attorneys to attend these sessions, each being told that ""it will look good"" before the judge, and will give them a better chance of getting custody.  The whole thing is a ruse for Crisafulli to make money.  He spends zero time with the children, no time trying to get to know them, or asking them how they feel or how they want custody and visitation worked out.  The children do not like him.  They don't feel comfortable talking to him, least of all confiding in him.
Crisafulli actually said that he decided who should get custody, not based on parenting ability, but based on who got to their counseling appointment on time.  What does this possibly have to do with it?
He thinks he is the puppet master and he must be stopped.

										Like many people in the world, I fell on bad times and took out a payday loan.  My child suddenly took very ill and i had to take off work on Family Medical Leave for a couple of months.  I called the loan people and told them my situation and they advised me that they could not hold my check for an extended amount of time.  I advised them that it would indeed bounce.
After the check bounced they called one time and i told them that i could not pay it right now.  The woman on the other end said that she would mark it as a ""refused to pay.""  Which wasn't the case.  Exactly 4 mins. later I got a phone call from their corporate office.  A man named Kevin said that he had recieved an email saying that i refused to pay my debt.  I told him that i had just hung up with the woman from the store and that wasn't what was said.  i told him the situation and of course he didn't want to hear it; he just wanted the $ right now.  After that he called non stop everyday and it was really upsetting, and even when i spoke to him, he would still call the homes of the my referrals.
I finally went back to work but only for 3 days a week (i can't work FT because of my child's illness).  Before I got my 1st check; my phone got shut off for a week.  It had been on for a month when i got a phone call from Legal Mediaton.  The gentleman who called asked about the debt and i told him I could pay it in 2 payments, this was the best I could do and i thought it was sufficient.  Then another man gets on the phone identifies himself as Attorney Richard Steele also Senior Partner.  I again told him what I was able to do and that I wanted to get this paid it had been long enough.  
Mr. Steele then told me that I had to pay it in full and it had to be paid by 5p.m. (I got this phone call @ 4:10p.m).  I asked him if this was his policy or the policy of the company i owed, he told me that it was the policy of the company I owed.  So I told him I would call him back.
I called the corporate office of the payday loan company and told them what was going on.  They said that they would have definitely accepted 2 payments, but since the attorney had the case it would be up to him now.
I called Mr. Steele back and asked again about who's policy it was and he again said the payday loan company.  Then I told him that I had called the company and that was not there policy and they said it was all on him, how ever he wanted to collect the $.  Because I had caught him in a lie; he instintly started yelling that I didn't know how serious this situation was but that i would real soon!  I again asked him if he was sure that he would not accept 2 seperate payments from me.  
Then all of sudden without warning a woman picks up the phone and asks what she could help me with and I replied I guess I was rudely transferred; she tells me to hold and transferred back to Mr.Steele who answered the phone and yelled what, what do you want!?  I told him I wasn't sure why i was transferred to the woman and he yells I didn't transfer you! I disconnected with you! Don't call back here!  I told him for an Attorney you are very rude and totally unprofessional.  And hung up on him.
Is it just me or did it seem like this man would rather try to prosecute me instead of actually collecting the debt.  And the bad thing was that this was the first phone call from Legal Mediation and then they tried to give me 50 mins. to pay them.  It was just insane!

										I entered into an greement with Hess/Kennedy Attorneys through the Consumer Credit Counseling of America to settle two delinquent accounts. The firm was to withdraw $107.00 (which included a $39.00 administrative fee) the first of each month. I was still getting collection calls so I began to call to report the calls as I was instructed to do. It took weeks before I was able to get a live body on the phone & it took another 2 weeks before I spoke with a para legal. After the first contact I waited another three months and called over and over again but never got anyone on the phone. I then contacted the Florida Bar & received a ""Inquiry /Complaint Form"" to file after speaking with a representative who assigned me ACAP Reference number. Then on April 30, 2007 I called the firm and got to speak with a para legal (supposedly) but I failed to get his name. This person was rude, obnoxious and a liar. This person told me that they instructed me to keep records of all the collection calls I've received writing down the name of the company, date and name of the inidvidual who called. He stated that's the only way Hess/Kennedy would be able to go into court and file a law suit against the collection companies; I was never told to do this. They told me in the beginning that they hadn't got to my file yet (the first six months) then they would say that they're negotiating a settlement and then I got this jerk. I asked this person were they handling my case in this manner because I was a senior citizen? he said no but I believe it may had something to do with it because he kept talking down to me until I stopped him. I'm in the process of following through with the complaint to the Florida Bar all of this became too much to deal with and I still haven't heard a word from Hess/Kennedy.

WEST PALM BEACH, Florida U.S.A. ",,949 234-6265,THE TICKET CLINIC PAID $175.00 DOLLARS TO HAVE SOME PLEAD NO CONTEST FOR ME! WEST PALM BEACH Florida,"
										I received a speeding ticket in indian river, FL a 93 in a 70. I dont have any other tickets on my record so I contacted the ticket cliinc to represent me to have the ticket reduced or dismissed. The person that answered the phone was happy enough to take my 175.00 and told me that I should receive a notice of outcome 5 days after my court date.  3 days before my courtdate I recived a call that I needed to sign a retainer agreement that stated they could not guarentee my outcome.  
Unable to go to court myself because of being out of state at the time i was forced to sign the agreement. The outcome was a letter  from the court with a cover from a legal assistant. I was found guilty with a $240.00 dollar fine.  They company apparently plead no contest.  The court gave me 30 days to pay,  but since it took them 2 weeks(not 5 days as promised) to mail me the letter I now had 11 days to pay $240 dollars 4 days before christmas.  
I then proceded to call the ticket clinic because I still dont know if points were acessed if the charges were reduced  etc.  The paralegals seem to be the only ones that you can get to talk with and are extremely rude and condescending.  I was told by three diffrent people that as per my retainer agreement my case was not guarenteed  but somone would call me back to see if they could file a motion to with hold points. 
After repeated attempts at reaching this person on the 6th phone call I was told very rudely again by legal assisants that there services were not guarenteed,  and if I wanted a file a motion to withhold points that I would have to pay another $175 dollars and that would also not be guarenteed. 
So at this point I have paid the ticket clinic 175.00 to plead no contest 240 dollars in court fines and future insurance charges when I could have just went to driving school!     The ticket clinic is a scam and can only get you off minor traffic infractions that you could probally get off yourself by doing what they do and pleading no contest.

He felt threatened so their tatics worked, I told him to let me speek to them, I understand and catch manipulaiton very well. 
Well the whole time I understood I was speeking to an attorney, well I was misunderstood I later found out he was just a middle man. We agreed to 3,000 down and 250. a month with the understanding, that if anything changed funds wouldnt be resumed if I declined to sign the agreement paper, and I also Assumed that I would be make a bill payment on my own each month to them. I really was mistaken, I found out they wanted all my account information, so I immediatley declined and turned them down. 
I tried to get the 3,000. back which the whole agreement paper work was a tatic to get their money, that either which way it would go threw. Well I told them I would make payment but only under the consideration that I would mail it in myself, they wouldnt have it. I then stated,""DONT CALL ME ANYMORE SEE YA IN COURT!"" well they continued to call five more times with more threats with this is your last time were going to court, each time I responded, I will make payments but I will not give my personal information. 
Well now 3 months later they called again, same thing. This is your last chance I need an answer immediatley, threats of garnishing wages, and leans on not only his stuff, but mine also. I contacted the better buisness bureau,  and The NM bar association I plan to counter sue for harassment, but honestly all I really want is to find who to start paying and keep it out of court. If theirs any new information on this company let me know I will continue to contact better buisness bureau and you guys should too. It will come around. They are rude, disrespectful, and a sceam. Please help us out.

										I'm in possession of a letter from LGB&S, stating that I have three outstanding citations totaling over $1000.00.  I've had one citation during the past 5 years, and have already paid it off -- all $285.00.
The letter states there's a warrant out for my arrest, that may be served on me anywhere, any time, and that my driver license might not be renewed if I don't pay. Pay what?  
A cursory check with the San Antonio Police Department doesn't show these alleged citations. I had an employment background check in April; nothing showed. I changed my driver license address with TX DPS in July, and wasn't flagged.  I changed auto insurance companies in July also; my license check there didn't produce any hits. I've gone to court twice since then on other matters, and nothing flagged there either.
So, if the SAPD, my employer, my insurance agent, my attorney and the courts can't find these alleged citations, then where are they?  And what are they?
I tried calling LGB&S today, got a run-around, and was asked for my phone number. Like I'd let them harass me that way too?  Hardly...

Lawyer's Charge Opens Window on Bill Padding
By NATHAN KOPPEL
August 30, 2006; Page B1 
The Wall Street Journal
The career of Matthew Farmer, a junior partner in the Chicago law offices of Holland & Knight LLP, was on the upswing in December 2004. He had just won a monthlong trial for Pinnacle Corp., a Midwestern home builder accused of copyright infringement, and gotten kudos from many of his partners.
But weeks later, after reviewing billing records in the Pinnacle matter, he decided to leave the 1,200-lawyer firm. Mr. Farmer, 42 years old, believed his own hours on the case had been inflated by the partner in charge of billing, 62-year-old Edward Ryan. Fearing he would violate state ethics rules if he kept quiet, Mr. Farmer blew the whistle to Holland & Knight lawyers.
The firm, which has 24 offices in the U.S. and abroad, took no action and denies Mr. Ryan or the firm did anything wrong. ""The amount billed by Holland & Knight in the litigation was reasonable and appropriate,"" says L. Kinder Cannon III, the firm's general counsel. Mr. Ryan declines to comment.
Last October, Mr. Farmer took a 7% pay cut to join Cohn Baughman & Martin, a 12-lawyer firm. He says he moved of his own accord because he was upset that Holland & Knight wasn't acting against Mr. Ryan.
While the facts of the case are still in dispute, Mr. Farmer's billing allegations offer a rare window into the tricky and emotional issue of inflated billing by law firms. It's difficult to know how widespread billing fraud is, but Stephen Gillers, an ethics professor at New York University School of Law, says ""there is a general consensus that billing fraud has increased"" as law firms seek to increase profits and attract top lawyers.
""Bill-padding is the perfect crime,"" adds William Ross, a professor at Samford University's Cumberland School of Law in Birmingham, Ala. It is seldom detected because it is almost impossible for clients to know whether ""an attorney really spent three hours doing research instead of five hours,"" he says. He says that in a billing survey he conducted in 1996, two-thirds of the attorneys (and three-fourths of the clients) reported knowledge of bill padding. Earlier this year, a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP left the firm and was suspended from practicing law due to bill fraud.
Meanwhile, Mr. Farmer is still pressing his claims against Holland & Knight. In February, he sent a letter detailing his charges to a Minnesota state court judge, Janet Poston, accompanied by internal Holland & Knight billing records. Mr. Farmer's letter led Pinnacle's insurer, Connecticut Specialty Insurance Co., to file claims against Holland in May, stating that ""Ryan and Holland & Knight inflated and falsified legal bills."" Last month, the insurer reached a confidential settlement with Holland & Knight, withdrawing the fraud claims. But Connecticut Specialty's outside counsel, Robert Haugen, believes the original motion was credible. ""I have a standard to live up to in [Minnesota] when I file pleadings,"" he says.
Mr. Farmer, who joined Holland & Knight in 2000, became involved in the Pinnacle case in the summer of 2002. A competitor had filed suit in Minneapolis federal court, claiming Pinnacle built homes that infringed on copyrighted designs and seeking more than $30 million in damages. (The jury's finding in favor of the defendant was later reversed due to an evidentiary ruling at trial; the case may be retried in the future by someone other than Mr. Farmer.)
After the trial, Mr. Farmer reviewed the firm's bills. The first invoice struck him as odd, he says. It claimed he worked 6.5 hours on Aug. 7, 2002, the day he learned of the suit. Mr. Farmer says he distinctly recalls hearing about the case late that day and spending only 15 minutes on it.
Over the next two days, Mr. Farmer says, he checked further to see if the first entry was an aberration. He finally quit probing, he says, after discovering some 60 instances of bill padding. Mr. Farmer believes that from August 2002 through September 2003, Mr. Ryan inflated his time -- and that of three other lawyers in the case -- by more than 450 hours, an overcharge that Mr. Farmer says exceeded $100,000. Mr. Farmer believes his discovery may have been the tip of the iceberg, for he says he analyzed only a ""sampling"" of the more than $3.5 million of Pinnacle bills.
In one instance, Mr. Farmer says, Mr. Ryan sent a bill to Pinnacle claiming that partner Scott Petersen had worked 89.8 hours over a 17-day period in March 2003. Mr. Farmer says internal firm records show the lawyer didn't work on the case at all during that time. Mr. Farmer also accuses Mr. Ryan of creating ""fictitious"" narratives using such phrases as ""review key documents"" and ""analyze defense strategy"" to describe work that Mr. Petersen never performed. Mr. Peterson didn't return calls seeking comment. The two other lawyers on the case declined to comment.
Mr. Farmer reported his findings in early 2005 to Colin Smith, a firm partner charged with ethics oversight, suggesting that Holland & Knight file a report with the state's attorney-ethics commission. ""Don't go there,"" he says Mr. Smith warned him. ""Why would you want to do this to Ed Ryan?"" Mr. Smith declines to comment.
Colleagues describe the tall, white-haired Mr. Ryan as a genteel litigator. ""I always found Ed to be an excellent lawyer and a gentleman of the highest character,"" says Michael Kanute, a former Holland & Knight partner. Another former partner, Julie Shelton, says she ""can't imagine that he would do anything unethical."" At Chicago office functions, another former partner recalls, Mr. Ryan liked to offer positive messages to lawyers. ""He would use the sort of catch words that were expected by headquarters, like, 'We are so glad to gather together as the Holland & Knight family.' ""
Soon after the meeting with Mr. Smith, Mr. Farmer says he had a ""very awkward"" 10-minute meeting with Mr. Ryan. He says Mr. Ryan told him that he himself had billed time internally to Pinnacle for which he hadn't charged the client and that he therefore inflated other lawyers' hours on the case to compensate for his uncharged time. In the final tally, Mr. Farmer says Mr. Ryan told him, Pinnacle's total bill reflected the actual time the firm worked on the case.
But Mr. Farmer says he found the explanation ""unpersuasive."" He says Mr. Ryan occasionally offered strategic advice and edited briefs for the case but never performed routine tasks. ""He never stepped foot in a courtroom, never drafted any legal papers, never deposed a witness,"" says Mr. Farmer, who worked full-time on the matter from the start.
""The amount billed was consistent with the value of the time worked,"" Mr. Cannon, Holland & Knight's general counsel, said in response to questions about Mr. Farmer's allegations.
Early last year, Pinnacle was acquired by home-builder Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. ""These issues occurred well before we were associated with"" Pinnacle, a Hovnanian spokesman said. ""We have no independent knowledge of the facts.""
After his meeting with Mr. Ryan, Mr. Farmer waited for an investigation into his allegations. ""I figured at some point, someone would register disbelief or disgust,"" he says. When that didn't happen, Mr. Farmer moved to the less prestigious Cohn Baughman. ""If you look at Matt's rsum, you realize this was not a lateral move,"" says William Elward, a former classmate of Mr. Farmer's at Loyola University Chicago School of Law.
Late last year, still convinced it was his ethical responsibility, Mr. Farmer reported his bill-padding claims to the Illinois Attorney Registration & Disciplinary Commission. (The commission's chief counsel, James Grogan, won't comment on the pending investigation.) Then, Mr. Farmer sent the seven-page letter and billing records to Judge Poston. ""Edward F. Ryan . . . frequently inflated far beyond the hours that the timekeeping attorneys had actually recorded,"" he wrote the judge, who was then presiding over a lawsuit brought by Connecticut Specialty against Pinnacle regarding the legal bills.
Though Mr. Farmer says he is happy in his new job, he concedes he is dazed by the turn his life has taken. Before that, ""if you told me I would be out of my firm in a handful of months, I'd never have believed it,"" he says.

$30,000 may sound like a lot but over a two year period it is not...it goes away fast...after my money was gone that is when the credit card debt started occuring b/c the bills had to be paid.
Courtney knew that my father was not coherant after the accident and my father insisted that my mother be in the room with him whenever Courtney and his partners spoke to him....however when my mom left the room to gather papers to build the case...they slipped a piece of paper for my incoherant dad to sign...they stated it was just stating that we wouldn't have to pay unless they settled....however we came to find out that it was stating that Courtney and his crooked partners were taking over 25% of the settlement.
Moving along...the day came of the settlement and they were saying settelement numbers in the 6 figures...but somehow we only ended up with $55,000....here's the breakdown....$18,000 in hospital bills....$25,000 in lawyers fees (when Courtney stated from the beginning he would not charge...because in his words ""WE'RE FAMILY...I CARE MORE ABOUT YOU GUYS THEN ME GETTING PAID FOR THIS CASE"")...which left $7000, which went to pay on (not off...just pay on) the over $52,000 credit card debit that was occured once my $30,000 drained out....so basically we were left with nothing!!!....We didn't even get an I'm sorry that things didn't work out....they didn't even won't to take the case to trail....which is what we wanted to do because we knew that the off was too low compared to ALL the pain and suffering my dad and we all endured.......but they stated that we would end up getting less if we went to trail...
Then to top it off.... all of a sudden the same doctor who wrote in a report that was presented during the settlement that my father would have long lasting effects, and that his back would never recover....somehow changed his tune and sent a letter stating that he didn't see any reason why my father couldn't work without pain.  If you could see the way his walks...and how his skin has broken out all over his body due to the stress of trying to provide for his family and knowing that he can't because EVERYDAY he is in SERIOUS pain....then you would know that NO ONE SHOULD EVER CHOOSE FUSTON PETWAY AND ESPECIALLY COURTNEY FRENCH AS THEIR LAW FIRM.....they lied to my family....they took more than their cut....(b/c they stated we wouldn't be charged) and they are heartless.

" Patrick DeCarolis, Jr ","  Patrick DeCarolis, Jr  1801 Century Park E. #26 
Los Angeles, California U.S.A. ",,954 933 5652,Patrick DeCarolis Jr For Years Mr. DeCarolis in my opinion has been using Ca Family Code 2030 to enrich himself Los Angeles California,"
										This is a copy of my declaration for an attorney fee motion heard in LA Superior Court on 11/9/08. I have deleted the names of other persons for confidentiality, but the case number is available.
I have dealt with Mr. DeCarolis since my divorce filed in 2000. He is very quick to demand attorney fees from the party with assets. Family Code 2030 in California is a way of leveling the playing field, so that the party without funds can litigate. I understand and accept this as fair. But what Mr. deCarolis does is use this code to bill outrageous amounts, which he can show on paper. His charges have risen to $575/ hr. In my opinion, his legal work, motions,etc are minimal, except on his attorney fee motions, where we have reams of billable hours listed and hours required to prepare the motion. Typically his motions always lag by a month or two, so that the next motion contains court time for the last motion. If the judge awards him money on that day say $5000 for a $15,000 bill, he merely subtracts the $5000 from the $15000 and adds $10,000 to his next motion. In the past, we have been careful to ask the judge to order that the amount he gets, is a final amount with no balance to carry forward. I  will leave it to the reader, to consider the ethics of his accounting. 
What I really object to is this: My wife tried to have me killed. He went to visit her in jail, got her a criminal attorney, went to court, so I could get full custody , helped sell her house, so she could pay her criminal attorney, then had the nerve to file for $40,000 in attorney fees. based on FC 2030. When she was arrested on the day of a depo, we cancelled, we told Mr. DeCarolis that something serious had come up. He said ""is it criminal"" surprising us. We did not tell him but later that day, the homicide detectives taped a conversation in which she said, my attorney told me to leave the house. Obviously, I cannot prove anything by this statement, but I wonder.
She was convicted of solicitation to commit murder and was given a 3 year prison sentence, which was suspended and she was placed on probation for 5 years. She was also given a restraining order to keep away from me. She then hired private investigators to keep me under surveillance for 4 months. Apparently, she had money for that. She said that Mr. DeCarolis had told her to do this, but he was not in court that day to agree or disagree. Her probation was revoked and she was sent to state prison for 18 months then placed on parole. After 5 months of parole, she decided she wanted to see our son again. I understood that she does have that right, so that when Mr. DeCarolis contacted my attorney with a reunification plan, to allow the prior custody evaluator set up a program, I agreed. After 3 visits, out of the blue came a motion for unsupervised weekend visitation and some custody.This is all after we had agreed on a plan. Then comes an attorney fee motion for another $15,000. We filed an exparte motion for an evidentiary hearing rather than an OSC on the motion. This would allow us to present live witnesses. Mr. DeCarolis, did not show up for this hearing, so the motion was granted and moved to May 2008. Between now and then, I wonder how much he can concoct in legal fees. My position is there is no need for this new motion, since we had agreed on everthing anyway. He even wanted to take my deposition to see if I could pay his attorney fees. That deposition would have cost me $2-3000, using his billing rates of $575/ hr. Am I wrong, but does this look like an attorney trying to ""make work"" when none is needed. Does he have morality? My ex-wife tries to kill me and he has the nerve of making me pay her legal fees, which are almost related to her crime. And then, years later, when we reach an inexpensive agreement on visitation, breaks it and files a motion so ridiculous, that he knows, there cannot be any settlement. Her Diagnosis is antisocial personality disorder (psychopath, Axis I, DSM-IV), she is a convicted felon on parole for trying to have me killed, and she has threatened in the past to kidnap our son and take him to Cuba. Does he really think a judge will give her unsupervised visitation? Does he care? He has 2 young children at home. Would he like it if this happened to him? But he will say he is only doing his job, his client wants this. Is there such a thing as client control? I have spoken to others who have had the same complaint about Mr. DeCarolis. In January 2004, Fox 11 ran a short news report about our case. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Q8GjbvKbs 
Rember Civil Code 3517 that states nobody should profit from there own wrongdoing.
DECLARATION 
I declare I am over 18 years of age and a resident of the State of California.  I am the Petitioner in these proceedings.  I have first-hand personal knowledge of the facts stated herein and if called as a witness I will competently testify thereto.  
I submit this Declaration in support of my response to the Order to Show Cause requesting attorneys fees set for January 9, 2008.  
1.	Once  again, I am attempting to defend myself against financial extortion by Mr. DeCarolis.  His misuse of Family Code 2030 has been brought to this courts attention in the past. 
2.	This entire Order to Show Cause for attorney's fees is just another effort by Mr. Decarolis to make work and bill outrageously.  The motion for custody is not necessary and is not ripe as Respondent just began reunification with our son and we have complied with all of the requests of Dr. YYYY
3.	I have complied with everything agreed as per Mr. Decarolis and Mr. Golds, as to a reunification plan between the respondent and me.
4.	I might remind this court, the respondent attempted to have me murdered by hiring XXXXX to find a hit man for $10,000. Mr. XXXX came to me with this information on 12/28/02.  
5.	On 12/30 /02, Mr. DeCarolis was informed that a scheduled deposition of myself was to be cancelled.  He was told that something significant had come up. He asked is it criminal?, but was given no answer.  Ironically, shortly thereafter, XXXX was ejected from her house and was told the plan was off.  
6.	However, later, at the police department, XXXX called her. The conversation was recorded by the homicide detectives and I was present.  Respondent stated That her attorney had told her to leave her house. 
7.	The conversation continued, and she was arrested that day.  I cannot prove the attorney she was referring to was Mr. DeCarolis, but I and others have our suspicions and believe that one can connect the dots. 
8.	During the next few days, Mr. DeCarolis spent many hours in the jail with Respondent.  He even procured her a criminal defense attorney.  I know this, because he put all of it in her billing and requested I pay for this billing.  
9.	Over the next few months, the only legal work provided to her was in the selling of her house.  The custody battle had been placed on hold pending the outcome of her criminal proceedings.  Meanwhile, during the same time Mr. DeCarolis billed another $40,000.  I was amazed at his chutzpah. 
10.	Right at what would have been then end of the custody battle, Respondent tried to have me killed in December 2002.  Mr. DeCarolis then had the nerve to have me pay for his involvement in her crime, visiting her in jail, getting her a criminal attorney, etc.
11.	I was given full custody.  Mr. DeCarolis did this smugly, because of Family Code 2030, a statute in California that is meant to level the legal playing field.  Or in another words, force the party with resources to pay the legal fees for the party without resources, so that both parties have access to the courtroom. 
12.	I do not believe the framers of this statute intended for it to ultimately reward someone for committing such a heinous crime. 
13.	In January, 2004, Fox 11 News ran the story about Mr. DeCaroliss attorneys fees request in light of the crimes.  Mr. DeCarolis would not allow an interview, and instead only stated his fees were fair and this was my attempt to intimidate him. 
14.	Respondent was convicted and given a three (3) year suspended state prison sentence.  She was given five (5) years probation, a restraining order, weekly psychiatric visit requirement, community service, etc.  Despite her pleas with this court and the criminal court about how she learned her lesson and paid a dear price, a year and a half later, her probation was revoked, and she was sent to State Prison for three (3) years.  
15.	She was sent to prison because she hired a private investigator to keep me under surveillance for 4 months.  If she needs money for attorneys fees, where did she get that money?
16.	Respondent served 18 months, and was released on parole in February, 2007.  The first heard from Mr. DeCarolis was in late July of 2007, asking if we would agree to Dr. YYYY, who had been the custody evaluator, to set up a reunification plan.  I agreed.  I felt such a plan necessary, since there had been no communication between the respondent and our son for 2 years.  I am not sure why it took her over five (5) months after her release to try and see her son.  
17.	It was agreed respondent would pay the expense of the reunification.  I agreed with Mr. DeCarolis that it was in the best interest of our son to have this plan with Dr. YYYY acting as monitor.  However, after three (3) visits, Mr. DeCarolis suddenly filed for an OSC demanding unmonitored visitation and joint custody after we had agreed on Dr. YYYY.  Now he has the audacity to ask for attorney fees, knowing full well his motion is frivolous.  But this is what we have learned to expect from this attorney. He is a master at manipulating the law to line his pockets.  
18.	Respondent still continually lies.  Just look at her declaration filed in the Order to Show Cause for Custody and Visitation which was continued until May.  She states that her monitored visitation in the past consisted of dropping Shane off and picking him up with no monitoring in between.  This is a bold face lie. Initially she was monitored 9 hours a day. After many months, the monitor would leave during the middle 3 hours and 45 minutes.  This can all be proved.  The point is, she signed this under penalty of perjury, however, Mr. DeCarolis's office prepared this and read it, but you see, he never signed it, so he could never be guilty of perjury, and subject to at least state bar action.  
19.	Family Code 2030 was enacted to level the playing field, in order to allow both parties access to the courts. However, one can see how he uses Family Code 2030.  In this case, he initiates an agreement, which I have followed to the letter, and then files an OSC and asks me to pay attorney fees, despite the fact I have honored our agreement.
20.	As a final example of his failure to work with us, my attorney contacted one (1) month before the Order to Show Cause hearing originally set for today in regards to requesting of an evidentiary hearing.  I feel that in light of the volumes of information in this case, it would prove far more economical to have live testimony versus numerous declarations and filings in this case.
21.	Despite two (2) letters requesting a stipulation or conference call to the court requesting such a hearing, and two voice messages, Mr. DeCarolis did not respond.  We were forced to go into court ex parte to get this continuance.  Late in the day, just before the hearing, Mr. DeCarolis sent a letter back stating he would not agree to anything and that we were simply trying to stall the proceedings.  We were asking a full month before the hearing.  We went ex parte and Mr. DeCarolis did not even bother to show up and oppose the motion.  The continuance was granted.  Forget the issue his client could probably come after him for a breach of his duty, but shouldn't he pay my legal fees for that hearing?   
22.	His behavior in the past shows there is a pattern here.  I am the victim of a solicitation to commit murder and he is harassing me, and I would like your honor to stop it once and for all.  He is not entitled to any attorney fees just because he does work.  The work needs to have a legitimate purpose.  Both parties agreed to have Dr. McCoy provide a plan.  I have abided by that plan. 
23.	Only four (4) visits have taken place.  There is no change in circumstance.  Are not his motions a bit premature?  His fees thus far were several phone calls and letters.  He was paid a $10,000 retainer by the respondent, who is working and had enough money to have me under surveillance for four (4) months.  She lives with a man, who has been generous financially. 
24.	Mr. DeCarolis has shown in the past and again now, he is willing to manipulate the court by invoking Family Code 2030, to make work so he can line his pockets. He is a marauding attorney, using Family Code 2030 as his sword. I feel your honor will see him for what he is, and not allow him to get away with this. If not, I fear, he will continue to do this.

Eugene, Oregon U.S.A. ",,954-321-8810,DANIEL N. GORDON P.C. TIME FOR A FEDERAL LAWSUIT AGAINST DANIEL N.GORDON P.C. Eugene Oregon,"
										I am responding to your report against the issues about
DANIEL N. GORDON  and his lackey Matt Alyworth what a 
name for a awful combination. First of all this attorney has no idea what life is like when your disabled and barely getting by.
This man somehow had in his possession fraudulent credit
card statement that I never applied for from Bank of America. I hear the banks are so desperate they now create these fake accounts so they can loan out 10 times the amount you have a account for say 3,000 they can write an extra 30k courtesy of you. And you never even know about it.
Ok hear is what we all need to try to accomplish however do to the fox guarding the hen house not sure much could ever be done as here in Washington the state bar has said it is fine for mr. alyworth to lie on the record and make statements that are legal impossibilites..I mean when you ask for an account to be closed and then you get notice the account has been closed that means NO MORE USING the account period..BUT mr alyworth lied and said I continued to use the account AFTER this account was closed man these criminals are certainly desperate now aren't they?
It is a legal imposibility to charge anything after the bank sends you a notice and says account closed. The bar still said he did no wrong..bull***t.
Right now there are a number of legal actions against Mr.Gordon and his crew in Oregon's fedearl court system. Look the cases up on www.justiacourts.com
or go to search and type in his name. Gordon and crew your time is coming and the writing is on the stock market walls...

										On 2/25/06 ,I sent a check for $200.00 made payable to ATSL. A saleslady assured me that because R.A. Brennan is a law office, they could best represent me in managing my debt. She called me back on several occassions to assure me , I would be debt free within 3 years and they would take excellent care of me. They figured my monthly payments  to be about 42% per month. On 4/15/06, they began debiting my bank account(direct withdrawl), for $678.00 per month. Within 2 months every company I owed began to harrass me. I must have made 100 calls to the law office to inquire. Every time I called I had to speak to some other person . Finally, after 6 months and $6800.00, a paralgal told me I should cancel and I would get everything back except the $2500.00 retainer. Being absolutly at my wits end ,I decided to cancel . After at least another 100 calls I reached Mattae Hartlov, who told me they had been auditted and she would mailing me a refund for $4280.00 by friday. That was 4/19/07 . Not only since then but, from the very start,one year earlier , I have been continually harrassed and sued by every creditor I have. They never paid a penny to any of them ,as agreed and Richard A. Brennan , Attorney at Law should be disbarred and made to pay me back the nearly $7000.00 he stole from me, plus the time, grief and anquish , I have had to endure.   Thomas

										Beginning in November of 2007, my phone rings 2-3 times per day. The first time it happened, I looked at caller ID and it read unknown name or number, I answered to no response (long pause) I hung up thinking telemarketer. That night my phone rings again, this time I let the answering machine pick it up. There was a LONG automated message saying they were a law firm collecting a debt. (What debt? Who knows)
For months now I have gotten at least one but usually 2 calls from Riddle and Assc. Some calls show a number, some do not, some calls have a different number. They leave a LONG message that completley uses up all my answering machine space. Any debt these jokers are trying to collect must be VERY VERY old or they got the wrong person. I recently had my credit run and no outstanding past due debt came up NOR did the name Riddle and Assc.
This is harrasment. I have reported them on the do not call list repeatingly. They did NOTHING! 
I know better than to acknowledge these type of debt collecting scammers but I need my phone back! We can not even answer our phone unless we recognize the caller. We miss very important calls because of this and numerous missed messages because R & A has tied up our answering machine. What, if anything, can be done to STOP this. It's making us miserable. They even called on the Holidays!

										I had been getting letters from weltman and the bunch for several months now, I sent all the recommended responses back certified return receipt and all.  And they would immeditely send responses dated the exact same day that the return receipts said they received my response letters.  they sent 3 letters all together and I have all return receipts and copies of my responses, though I only have one of the letters they sent me.  Now its been several months since the last letter and I had thought they had given up, and today I receive two documents total, in a single letter with an Ohio court in the return address spot.  
First one is stamped in the right corner in blue ink supposedly by the court in sept showing my address as my grandmas house, a place I have never lived at before in my life. And the first page has capital one vs me at the top with the stamp to the far right corner.  Below that is 5 numbered statement saying they tried to contact me and the like and the very bottom has the weltman phone # and address.   Also this doc has the exhibit ""A"" page as a normal capital one statement letter that says what I owe, and exhibit ""B"" showing just some credit card agrreement fine print.  Also there is a page that is all blank except for the classic words ""this law firm is a debt collector attempting to collect this debt for our client and any info....""  Which looks out of place as part of a court doc.  
And the second doc, sent with the first, is dated Jan 23 as a summons with the deputy clerks name and sig and everything, but with my correct address, but there is a court letter head address and everything and dated with a court ink stamp with courts name and date and even a case #, saying I have to respond in 28 days after the service of this summons.  But it is the actual deputy clerks name (I looked it up) and ""signature"" at the bottom.  
And finally at the bottom a ""return of service summons"" tear off section, all from a courthouse in the town in Ohio where I have not lived in over SIX YEARS.  But this was mailed to me at my address in CALIFORNIA where I have lived for 2 years.  The debt was charged off in 2002.  SOL in California is 4 years, which i made clear to them in my 3 responses.  And I understand Ohio sol is 15, but since I live in California arnt they supposed to serve me to a court here, and doesn't that mean the sol has expired anyways.  
I am going to call the deputy clerk of the Ohio court house tomorrow to see if its all bogus, But if it is a real case and all, How should I respond? I will talk to an attorney, but only if I have to.  Thanks for all your help.

										After a year of fighting with workers comp I was quoted by a lawyer working for Larry H Parker  to possibly receiving a settlement of 14, 000, the end results was ONLY twelve hundred dollars. I was not happy with this offer but I accepted it. This was the first time they f***ed me). The second time happened like this While fighting with workers comp I received benefits from State Disability Insurance, part of the settlement offer was that workers comp would pay the state back for all the benefits that they paid me while waiting for workers comp to own up to my companies LIABILITY. In the end Workers comp cut a side deal with SDI and only paid them back a half of the benefits that was paid to me. As a result SDI came after me for the other half of the money. A few months after my settlement was over, I had to repay SDI for the benefits they gave me because workers comp did not uphold their end of the bargain. I contact Larry H Parker for months leaving messages and faxing in request for them to take my case back to the workers comp board.  I was being harassed by SDI to repay the money. As part of the settlement offer we agreed workers comp would take care of FULLY repaying SDI. After three months of pleading for help with LHP I finally got a call back from Martin a lawyer over at Larry H Park. Martin stated that taking the case back to the workers comp board was not an option and it would be like opening up a can of worms, and that the company was not willing to do that because it would not be profitable for them. (This is the second time they f***ed me) They left me hanging again! I had to pay SDI 2200.00 which was more than what I received in my initial settlement. So you see they WONT fight for you, they wont even return your phone calls for months.Mosexythanu

										I know this law firm more then I would even want to. I worked with them a short while and, it wasn't long that when I found out that their legal practices are very shady. 
They advertise as they will help anyone who has been in a ""Car accident"" ""Insurance claims"" or anything else they feel the consumer has been wrongfully cheated. Well the truth is, there isn't any truth to most of the claims they deal with. 
There Operation is completly Fraud. They force customers to falsify statements, forge documents, and lie to strenghen their claim against any business. Most people who go to them are suckers looking for free money. There is no upfront retainer, (which most good attorneys charge). They bost up the claims with false and misleading information so they can get the Maximum from the compliant or lawsuit. They take about 40% of the settled amount, so the bigger the falisfication they can create, the bigger the check they get. 
THIS MESSAGE IS FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. This is the exact reason why Attroneys like her should be held for Frivolous Lawsuits.  
The bar should revoke her license to do further investation this law firm. I have also formaly filed a complaint against them with the Texas Bar. I will continue to file my complaint with OIG. 
They are a complete fraud, and, if OIG did visit them, they will throw them in Jail.

A recieved a summons to appear in Civil County Court Jan. 17/08. I wrote to the Judge by Certified mai and filing fee of $55.00 I explained that I was unable to attend the hearing due to the fact that I am 67yrs old, disabled & unable to drive the distance and could not afford a cab. also that I am unable to pay anything on this. My income is Social Security Disability and Old Age Pension.  This attorney knows this, I have to attachable income or assets I cannot pay them anything I have nothing of value.
I now recieved a letter
I understand that there was a class action suit against this person and firm. How can I participate in this?
I will appreciate whatever advise you can give me. Thanks in advance.
Sincerely,
Chantelle

										Short and sweet, even the devil himself is shaking his head in disgust at the acts of this so called law firm, Cohen & Slamowitz. it is a disgrace that this is happening to so many people and there is such a blind eye.
I'm rather tired to go into detail, and you have read it all before anyway. They are predictable. But I finally had a minute to get myself registered here and wanted to plug in.
Of course, they have done it again, the whole nine yards of deception they have mastered so well. 
I too am a victim of these people. But I am going after my American civil rights. I am very very serious in the cause.
Seriously, keep your tv on...the future will tell.
Anyone who would like to join me in the cause of justice to protect your rights as an American citizen, please contact me.
I'm new here so I don't know if I can list my email but will call Ripoff tomorrow to see how we the ""injured"" can connect to band together. I am so serious! 
I'm not a lawyer, just a woman in a wrath of fury. My Game is on! Is yours?!

										I am attempting to get a divorce in the state of AZ. The marriage was very short-term; no property, no children, nothing. It should have been a ""quickie"" divorce, except the estranged is a psycho. He hired an attorney in an attempt to intimidate and manipulate me. I am a recent grad school graduate and a first year educator, translating to having no money for legal counsel. I was contacted by TruLegal, and told them all of the above information. The gal who contacted me guaranteed me that TruLegal could help me. She even told me how they had helped her resolve a legal matter. 
So, I paid them a $30 setup fee and waited to hear from my ""case manager"". Finally, since no one contacted me after receiving my money, I called them. I spoke with two different paralegals; Dan and Rick. Rick was apparently the supervisor. When I relayed my story to him once again, he told me that he was sorry, but they couldn't help with divorces in AZ. I told him that I had told the first girl what type of legal issue I was having and she assured me that TruLegal could help me. He apologized and told me that he would get my $30 back for me. 
To date, I have not seen a refund, nor have I heard anything from this company, even after numerous attempts to contact them via email, phone and fax. If you don't have the money to afford legitimate legal counsel,like I did not, you surely don't have the money to be ripped off!!! Do NOT use this company!!

										Like Deborah and Lynne in Westminster, I have the unfortunate pleasure of dealing with Mr. Farrell. I have received two letters from him in the past 5 days threatening legal action for a debt with Midland Credit Management. I did some research on both Farrell & Seldin and Midland Credit Management and found out that they buy old debt for really cheap and then turn around and try to collect on it. Most of the time their strong arm tactics work and people pay them instead of going through the hassle of fighting them. Midland Credit Management has a state wide class action suit filed against them in California. 
Well I filed and was granted (discharged) Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in 2004. Chapter 7 bankruptcy is called ""Fresh Start"" and that is exactly what I wanted when I filed it. I am going to seek legal counsel and fight these people because if I do not take a stand here there will be other Farrell & Seldins down the road trying to collect on old debt that I do not owe anymore. I am going to write complaints to the State BAR Association, The Bankruptcy Courts, Better Business Bureau, Paula Woodward at 9 News and any other means I can think of. I hope Lynne and Deborah do the same.

Wilmington, Delaware U.S.A. ",,973-753-5100,"200cash.com Dba Jackson Loans Yes, I appied for a loan also at 200cash.com, dba Jackson Loans Wilmington Delaware","
										Yes, I also was ripped off by 200cash.com. I first applied to a company online named Jackson Loans. However without being notiied, my application was sent to 200cash.com.
 They way I found out was after I noticed that there was a debit on my bank account of $19.00 I call them to see who it was and my bank said that it was from Jackson Loans but the debit EFT was sent to 200cash.com. 
They also informed me that I was charged a $22.00 fee for paying the debit because I didn't have $19.00 in my account. If I had had money in my bank account I wouldn't have needed a loan.
 This was on Feb. 12 that my money was debited from my bank. Since then I have tried calling them with no answer. They have a recording saying that you have to go to their web site to inquir about you loan status. 
 When you try to inquir about the loan they say that they are in the process of reviewing you loan and they will get back to you.
 They also say that if you try to reapply that they will debit another $19.00.
So I emailed them yesterday and told they I didn't want a loan from them now. They charge you $30.00 per $100.00, every two weeks. So that would be $60.00 per $100.00 per month interest. 
 Thanks very much to Ripoff Report. and to the people that reported this rip off so that I knew when I read it that I wasn't the only one, Charles.  
 Also Thanks to Google for sarching this site out for me. I was able to just search the 1-800-number of some companies to find out them on Google. Some people may not know that. Thanks again, Charles

										This morning I went online to pay some bills through my bank account. I saw my account was seriously in the negative and a restraining notice was on there. I called the bank and asked what it was. They informed me that the offices of Cohen & Slamowitz,LLP had served them with a restraining notice and freezing my account for double the amount that they claim is owed. I then called them and asked the information. The amont is $ 1886.89 and they can settle it for $ 1513.00. I explained to them that I have never even heard from them before and why did they do this without ever contacting me. Needless to say they claim they have sent me mail that I didnt respond to. Something i have never received. The account is an old Household Orchard/Midland Credit which I did have a Household long long ago. I can not remember back to 2003. However, I do remember not having any outstanding debts from that long ago. Does anyone know if what they did is legal and if not what I could do to get them to lift the restraining notice. I can not believe this is happening and I have never even heard of them before.

They tried taking me to small claims court, but I received nothing on that, but they have information posted on my credit report and now I have received a notice of a hearing for March 18 from the same attorney.
