Sacramento, California USA ",sonobello.com, 9169781087,""," Last year I decided to do something, I had been contemplating for a long, long time;Lipo. Im 45 and although not visibly overweight I could feel the extra weight slowly creeping on. So I scheduled a consultation for me and my daughter(who decided the procedure was not for her).The consultation went ok, It was quite a bit more $$ than I thought with the abdomen, hips, thighs, broken down into more areas and of course they charge per ""area"", and of course one area done without the other would look out of proportion, so I had a total of 7 or 8 areas scheduled to be sculpted, the consultant said the pain was minimal, the recovery was easy and you were awake during the surgery, easy. I Had saved up some money(seriously this was all my savings),stupid but thought it was worth it. I paid the 7900.00(approx..dont have the bill in front of me). On the day of surgery I was asked to get there a little earlier because there was a cancelation, and I did get there early but not as early as requested. Again I was told the recovery is very quick and the pain is minimal. I was told a few times I would be awake throughout the entire procedure. I consulted with the nurse and Dr Hagstrom in Sacramento. I was looking at the before and after when he walked into the exam room and he stated, ""well just remember, only the best go in the book"" which was my first vibe of weirdness. During the exam I told him the sales consultant told me to tell him to sculpt around the knees. She said they usually have no problem with it, but he said ""she told you that, I wish they wouldnt do that"" To this day I dont know if he did or not. I got to the room where the actual surgery was done and I recall asking the nurse for a band to pull my hair back with. The nurse brought me the band, I pulled my hair back at approximately 2pm. The next thing I knew, I woke up at 4am, home in my bed in the most horrific pain I had ever been in. I could not move...I laid there and screamed and cried until someone heard me from another room and assisted me to the bathroom. To put this pain in prospective I felt as if I had had a c-section without anesthesia and thrown to the shoulder from a moving vehicle(I had NO idea it would be this painful. I called the office and was told It was normal, I asked to refill my pain medication and was given one refill and told that was it., they only refill once The pain lasted for at the least a month and gradually wearing off, thank god I was not working at the time, because there was NO quick recovery. I started following there suggested regimen to reap the maximum benefits. It has been about 12 months now and really just want to cry when I think about it. My thighs are asymmetrical and lumpy and I have lumps on my stomache. I did send an email to Sono Bello in Sacramento and got a pretty quick call from them. I spoke with Michael who essentially said , I was not getting my money back. I asked for the corporate number and he gave me the 1800 number for sonobello, Im pretty sure their corporate has a number. havnt called yet, will update if I do. Has  anyone been successful with refunds from thjs place. They promised a service they didnt deliver and I honestly just want some, not even all my money back. ",  Plastic Surgeons

The shape of the left eye was a random rectangular shape and huge, and the right eye had a fuzzy line and small. I felt really bad having made a decision to do a double eyelid surgery because I had attractive eyes with monolid and had liked them until they started to age.At the end, I decided to go through a revision surgery with another Boca Doctor, and I am so happy that I made that decision.  It turned out to be a major work and costly since the doctor in Boca had to do multiple corrections including the balancing the size of the lines, making both eyes infolds, and reversing the overcorrected ptosis (which I had not asked Dr Ress ) that had resulted in a slightly flipped up upper lid look.  It took 3.5 hours to do the revision.  It's been a month after a surgery, and it already looks better than it did 6month post at Dr Andrew ress.  It even looked good on the next day after the surgery despite the bruising and swelling because both eyes were balanced this time!!I really think Dr. Andrew Ress is not a good cosmetic surgeon.  I believe he has no sense of visual aesthetics and balance and skills.  It is a shame that he promotes himself as an ""expert"" in double eyelid which the receptionist told me when I first visited them.  Please save yourself from the trouble and look elsewhere if you are looking to get double eyelid surgery.

 Lone Tree, Colorado USA ",http://www.coloradosurgicalhair.com/, (303) 857-5799 ,""," Two years ago I decided to have my second hair transplantation and found CSCHI online. They said that they had more than 20 years of hair restoration experience and they offered a considerable low price ($2/graft).  Mr. Chris McTyre (owner) told me that my satisfaction was guaranteed. After I talked with Mr. Chris McTyre, I paid the deposit and made an appointment on June 2, 2012. When I reached the clinic in the morning, Mr. Chris McTyre was not there and a nurse welcomed me. Since the doctor was not there yet, I had more time to chat with the nurses. One of the nurses told me that Dr. Gerald Searle would do the operation for me.  He was the most experienced surgeon at this clinic (they had two surgeons at that time) and he had 1.5 years of hair restoration experience. What?! Their most experienced surgeon only has 1.5 years of experience?   Then, why did they say that they have more than 20 years of hair restoration experience on their website?  Since then I doubt if I made a good choice to visit this clinic and I was considering if I could get my money back if I quit the operation. [continued below]....
									
										..... After Dr. Gerald Searle arrived, he checked my head and explained the operation to me.  I asked him if he can do a good operation and leave smaller scars than my previous operation. I told him that I want to quit if he can’t guarantee his work.  He said: Sure, absolutely! I guarantee it.   My doubt was clearly evidenced by what happened next. After Dr. Gerald Searle cut the strip out from my back side, he had a huge trouble to close the gap.   I clearly heard the sound of the thread stripping the skin when he tried to tight the thread.  He told the nurse that he needed to add more stitches. I am not sure how many more stitches he added for my operation. I noticed that he tried to cut more tissues out and tight the threads again and again in order to close the gap.   Finally he took more than two hours to finish the operation. They cleaned the blood many times.  I knew my donor area was completely messed up. During my previous operation at another clinic, the doctor only took a few minutes to cut the strip out and closed the gap.   I don’t need to mention that I had to suffer a lot and clean the blood many times on the back side of my head at the night after the operation.  In the next morning a nurse insisted on washing my head, both the donor areas and recipient areas (I really don’t understand why they did this). But the nurse tried to avoid touching the big area which was messed up. After head washing, I noticed there were several grafts of hairs on my face. It was disgusting and I grabbed them away. After I went to home and checked my head again, I noticed more fallen grafts of hairs. My donor areas kept bleeding and discharging something in the following two months after the operation. The amount was reduced gradually. But I could see some blood/discharge clearly from the towel on my pillow.  The healing process was so slow because the gap along the donor area was not closed well.  In fact, I believe that the gap in some areas was not closed at all because I saw some very thick scabs dropping off from those areas later.  Two weeks after the operation, I went to a local hospital to have the sutures removed. Two female nurses tried to get the sutures out. But they all quit. Finally, they found the most experienced male nurse to finish the job. It took two hours for him to get all the sutures out. After the work, he shook his head and told me that some threads were buried deep in the blood scabs and it was hard for him to find all the threads and get all of them out. The surgeon did a very poor operation. After the operation, the donor areas formed a deep trench on my head. I can clearly feel it when I stroke my hairs from the top to the bottom.  The donor areas also began to lose hairs.  The situation became worse and worse.  The area which was seriously messed up by the surgeon lost almost all hairs and became bare.  The diameter is more than 2.5 inches. Everyone around me noticed it and kept asking me what was going on. It is so embarrassing for me to explain what happened to everyone again and again. I have to leave long hairs in order to cover this area as much as possible. I frequently wear a deep hat to cover this area. After the operation, I often suffer from serious headaches and I believe my headaches are related to the operation.  One year after the operation, I began to think about correction on the donor area. When I talked with two surgeons who have 20+ years of hair restoration experience, they all told me that they never saw such big scars in their whole lives and the clinic who did such an operation should definitely take all the responsibility. But so far I didn’t get even one cent compensation from their malpractice.  What did their “gold standard” service give to me?  I didn’t have any obvious improvements on the recipient area even one year after the operation. But they ruined my donor area and I suffer from everlasting embarrassments and headaches. This is what their “gold standard” service gave me!  Did they guarantee anything?   I am a 100% real person.

I spent a little over 15k only to be disappointed in the overall whole experience. First they advertise that its pain free... and for me it wasn't I was in pain the entire time. They tell me to come back and then they would give me something different so I wont be uncomfortable again like I was the first time. I go back and was in just as much pain if not even worse. When I spoke to the office they said they didnt gaurantee it would be pain free which all over there advertising thats all they say. Second they forgot to put the correct info on my prescription and being that it was after 8 pm when I left there office I wasn't able to get any pain meds after having lipo!!!! The pain was horrible. When my husband called the Dr. there was nothing he could do except ask if we had any marijuana to help with the pain???? OMG... AND THIS IS SUPPOSE TO BE AN HONORABLE BUSINESS ON THE BBB! I'll be wiring them next. they told me healing would be about a week or two... I couldnt do anything for a month!  I nicely complained to them from the beginning and they told me to wait ...which I did. After I decided this was ridiculous I got my butt in the gym changed my eating and lost the weight on my own.  I called them back because after my 2nd to last appointment the dr said he would help tweek some things but I didnt want to go through the pain again which they all know in that roseville office that I did have pain the entire time... All I wanted was some type of reimbursement. Not all of the 15k but something to show that if the experience was this horrible they are a business with integrity and have a1 customer service! HOW THEY CAN TAKE SOMEONES HARD EARNED MONEY KNOWING THAT THERE SERVICE WAS NOT WHAT THEY ADVERTISE AND THAT THERE PATIENT WAS IN THAT MUCH PAIN IS BEYOND ME...

They also said they seen results...  I said yes I did do something about it... i have gym and gnc reciepts to prove it... also when I did workout out I lost weight in my face...clearly I did work out to loose weight after 4 months of no results...I still needed and wanted to do something. The lady said they did give me a discount in the beginning because of how much they took out should have been way more money... which that was NEVER told to me.

My thoughts, he must be good if he has an office in this very expensive area. That proved to be a deadly error on my part. He was able to talk me in to surgery on my nose, saying it was in need of surgery and he could correct what the problem was. I believed him, thinking my nose could use a bit of improvement, although I did not have any problem with it. He told me if I did my nose he could charge my insurance and throw in a mini-facelift at no charge. Remember, you get what you pay for. The day of my surgery he was screaming and fighting with his office staff, he fought with the doctor doing the anethesia because I had a cold and the other doctor did not feel it was safe to put me under due to my lungs being full of flem. I should have ran, but I sat mortified and in the end Dr. Burres won the argument. I woke up during my surgery, only to hear the nurse screaming and crying, yelling ""oh no, oh my God"". I still have flashbacks and suffer with anxiety from this horrible experience. My surgery lasted all of one hour. They took me from the operating table to my car, my nose was dripping blood and the bandages around my face were blood stained. I suffered the worst pain of my life and thought I would die, the pain was beyond anything I have ever experienced. And to add insult to my injuries, the results left me scarred and numb. I still have nerve damage and do not feel the skin surrounding my ears and neck. My left ear is sewn to my face and the right ear is 1/2 inch higher. He enlarged my nose!!! It is bigger and has a large lump on one side. I use to be attractive, but now I look disfigured. On my follow up visit Dr. Burres screamed at me, I was trying to tell him how uneven my face was and how I could no longer breathe out of my nose. He said I looked a lot better than I did before he worked on me. He left the exam room and came back in eating a burrito, he was eating and spitting in my face at the same time. My girlfriend came with me and he was all over her, trying to get her to agree to a consultation on her face! She is 34 years old. We left his office and I was completely hysterical. I have gone to two other doctors who told me I should have done my research before going to this guy. He is hated by the plastic surgeons in LA, they said he gives them a ""bad name"". None of this matters, as I do not have the money to fix the damage. I am filing a law suit against this man, and encourage anyone else who has fallen victim to do the same. Dr. Burres is unclean, his office is filthy and his staff is rude and the screaming and fighting that goes on is not professional.

It actually looks worse now than it did before! he left me with a bump in my nose that he said would heal on its own over time- i had the procedure in january and I am still deformed.  He claimed he is a nose job expert but iinstead, I consider him a butcher with both his scalpel and his attitude- i can't breathe through my nose now because one side is pinched and three other  surgeons say I will need major reconstructive work . An ex employee tells me that his before and after photos on his website are not even his work! i wish i had known all this before i plunked down 6k for him to screw up my face.

My Wife had made the decision to go to Dr Andrew Ress to have a face lift done. I was not there on the initial consultation so I didnt know what was going on until the day of surgery. On that day, when we arrived, I realized that DR Ress does his surgeries in the back of a Hair salon!! That's right! I had to go thru Wild Hare salon front desk, before entering a side door into his surgery center . this guy is doing surgery in a hair salon!!!   As I sat and waited for my wife, which took over 3 hours more than expected because they used the wrong anesthesia, I thought to myself, My wife has to be wheeled out of here and go thru a busy hair salon with all those bandages! Needless to say, The walk thru was both humiliating and mortifying to myself and my wife.   I also find out Ress doesnt use real anethesiologists ! He has Nurses administer the anesthesia!! I guess that makes sense on how he can afford to put his surgeries on Groupon!   I advise everyone not to go to this circus act. There are far better surgery centers in Boca with more qualified surgeons. ",  Plastic Surgeons

Please come to the front door, and we will keep an eye out for you as the doors are usually locked by that time.  Thanks, Nancy  The emails were from Richard Wasserman and not Nancy though they were signed Nancy.   Given the above, I am too scared to go to this ""interview"" as I will be a lone woman, attending a locked office after hours in an office that will clearly not interview men.   In my application letter, I did not state my first name. I did not state my first name on my resume either and was surprised to be identified automatically as Ms. I could have been Miss, Mrs or Mr.    I feel the surgeon has demonstrated clearly from his office's actions that he has ill intent toward woman.

WOW... I complained about various customer service issues, horrendous errors that were extremely unacceptable and upsetting and they just keep passing the blame on the others. I wanted to actually speak to the doctor about several incidents that I think he as a business owner should be aware of and I am repeatedly blocked and told that I am not allowed to speak to the doctor!! This is the only medical facility that I have ever known that prevents the patient clients from seeing the doctor when they have serious issues or concerns. Ultimately, this is a very competitive field- I did take my lipo and Venus Freeze business elsewhere and also going to a different doctor for the Hcg. I guess Dr. Broder thinks he can allow his staff to behave unethically and practice punitive business behaviors towards clients by raising prices after a telephone dispute (yes they actually did that- unbelievable I know) and think he can continue to do well.

When a company or individual joins the Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Program, they must make a commitment to us – in writing – to 'doing whatever it takes to make things right with their customers.' What does that mean? It means that Rip-off Report expects that members of our Corporate Advocacy Program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. [continued below]....
									
										..... It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected, the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. It means that if a customer requests a refund and if there is any reasonable basis for that request, we expect the customer will be given a prompt refund (some refund requests may not be reasonable, so this does not mean a refund is guaranteed in every case). “Making things right” can mean lots of different things to different people, but our point is this - by working closely with the company or individual to resolve any disputes, Ripoff Report can track the footprints of customer service to ensure that our Corporate Advocacy Program members are doing everything they can to treat customers fairly and to increase their customer satisfaction.ALL COMPANIES GET COMPLAINTS, BUT HOW THE COMPANY HANDLES THOSE COMPLAINTS, SEPARATES GOOD BUSINESSES FROM THE REST. By Ed Magedson - Founder, Ripoff Report Jason B. Diamond approached Ripoff Report with the intent of wanting to resolve any customer issues and reports posted on Ripoff Report. As a Part of the Corporate Advocacy Program the member business allows Ripoff Report to send an email to all of those who filed a complaint in the past, letting the customer know, the member business wanted to make things right with them, whatever it takes to do so. Ripoff Report always monitors these emails to insure the member business does what they agreed to. The people at Jason B. Diamond, M.D., F.A.C.S. did just that. Ripoff Report’s discussions with Dr. Diamond have uncovered an ongoing commitment from his and his staff to total patient satisfaction. This means that patients can expect that the company will work towards finding a mutually satisfactory resolution to any complaints or concerns. Dr. Diamond listens carefully to patients’ concerns and sees them as an opportunity to learn from past mistakes and become more efficient as a company in the services offered and the support from those services.  Dr. Jason Diamond is known for creating some of the worlds’ beautiful and natural faces; he has been recognized in the media extensively as Hollywood’s premier facial surgeon to the stars, providing the most beautiful and natural looking results possible. Dr. Diamond himself has informed Ripoff Report that his personal philosophy to his practice is to provide excellence in facial plastic surgery. He continues to please his patients and drive successful results because of his quality care, detailed personalized efforts, and empathetic nature.  Dr. Diamond understands the needs of his patients and strives to meet each of their goals, proving that his approach is one measure of support that reflects why he holds a world renowned reputation. This is why his clientele, which include many celebrities, are so dedicated to his craft and speak so highly of him. Dr. Diamond has grown tremendously in popularity because of his remarkable results. Patients travel from all over the world to be treated by Dr. Diamond, including Russia, the Middle East, Europe, etc. Dr. Diamond utilizes the most innovative and sophisticated techniques to maximize any given patient’s facial aesthetic.  During an extensive consultation, patients can view before and after photographs of Dr. Diamond’s previous patients and discuss personal aesthetic goals. Likewise, patients can visualize simulated photographs on a computer imager to view potential results from surgery. Patients can also read testimonials to get further insight to Dr. Diamond’s high level of patient satisfaction. By the end of a patient’s appointment, Dr. Diamond and his patient are able to choose the procedure(s) that are most suitable. Facial Plastic Surgeon, Dr. Diamond, is one of the finest to consider.Jason B. Diamond, M.D., F.A.C.S. CONTINUES TO CLARIFY WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY CAN DO FOR CLIENTS ""Dr. Diamond has been regarded as ‘The King of Natural’ by Hollywood insiders. Dr. Diamond has been famously quoted saying, ‘I don’t make patients look done; I just make them look great'. Dr. Diamond continues to innovate in the field of Facial Plastic Surgery by creating beautiful faces that are completely natural for famous celebrities, royalty, and patients similar to you & I alike. Making the decision to 'get something done' is rarely an easy matter, and Dr. Diamond understands that the patient’s individual needs are the top priority in every situation. No matter the treatment or procedure you are considering, Dr. Diamond will explore your options with you.” Dr. Diamond chooses not to dilute his focus. He is a facelift specialist concentrating exclusively on the face and applying his considerable talent and training to enhancing our most defining feature. For two years, Dr. Diamond traveled the globe to learn from the most renowned plastic surgeons in the world often the very individuals who developed specific facial procedures. Now, he has brought his practice to Beverly Hills, in a new, state-of the-art medical suite. WHY Jason B. Diamond, M.D., F.A.C.S. IS BETTER THAN THEIR COMPETITORS  Dr. Diamond is very proud of the reputation he has developed as one of the best Facial Plastic surgeons in the world. He only schedules one procedure a day to dedicate his full attention to the procedure at hand, and therefore, his results are widely considered among the best available worldwide. Some patients find the prices to be too high. Dr. Diamond does not advertise and relies on solely on word of mouth, so patients coming in commonly know the fees in general. However, Dr. Diamond has been spending even more time with each individual patient so that they are assured they are receiving the most customized and tailored procedure possible, specific to their facial anatomy.  Dr. Diamond has been paying more attention to educating each patient about the fact that he will only perform 1 surgery per day so that he is never rushed and never tired. 110% effort is always provided. Therefore, most patients believe that the cost is justified based on the level of expertise that is offered. Every patient understands that Dr. Diamond spends more time with them than any other doctor they will see, and the procedure is worth the cost. They are 'paying' for not only the preoperative and operative experience, but to also have the confirmation that Dr. Diamond will provide them with the same service years down the road. Based on the reputation Dr. Diamond has developed as one of the world's foremost experts in Facial Plastic Surgery, many people come to him with unrealistic expectations. Dr. Diamond takes this process very seriously and spends nearly an hour with every person to try and manage their expectations prior to surgery. Dr. Diamond is extremely honest with what changes he believes he can and cannot make, and he relays this to the patient with as much clarity and honestly as he is capable of. Jason B. Diamond, M.D., F.A.C.S. / Statements from the owner.  "" I am extremely proud of the practice and reputation I have developed as one of the world’s leading experts in Facial Plastic Surgery. My practice is like family to me. Along with my family, it is my true passion. I treat every person as they are a family member and want nothing but the best for my patients. On the eve prior to any procedure, I prepare myself thoroughly and adequately for the surgery ahead. I review the patient’s chart and in detail, have a plan of action for the following morning. I am very detail oriented in regards to every technique I will use for each procedure, customized to that person specifically. Every morning is different, meaning that every night before is unique as well. I give my patients the utmost concern and attention both before and after their surgery day, and it is not deemed successful until we are both mutually satisfied with our results.Jason B. Diamond, M.D., F.A.C.S. Quality Patient Care ” Patients first contact Dr. Diamond’s office via telephone or by completing an ‘Information Request Form’ on Dr. Diamond’s website. Within twenty-four hours, they are responded to and offered to set up a consultation appointment in-office, via Skype if outside of the Los Angeles area, telephone, or via email correspondence with photographs. All patient emails and inquiries are handled promptly by the office staff. In order to provide great customer service for all patients, Dr. Diamond’s Surgical Coordinator, Tammy, takes measures to address all patient requests. She answers any questions patients may have and strives to make their entire process run seamlessly from start to finish. When a patient first comes in for an in-person consultation appointment, Tammy assesses their needs and facilities the appointment. Dr. Diamond then consults the patients for over an hour and both Dr. Diamond and the patient mutually decide if a procedure is recommended, and if so, how and when to move forward. Dr. Diamond offers computer imaging software to illustrate the changes that are possible, and the potential results that can be yielded. After the consultation has been completed, Tammy reviews the protocol for scheduling a procedure with Dr. Diamond. The office staff also ensures that every patient is followed up with after a consultation, treatment, or procedure. If a patient has a service administered, the protocol at our office is to follow up with the patient within the same night. The next morning, they will also be seen by Dr. Diamond directly at our office. The patient will then have regularly scheduled follow up appointments for the next two years.”ANY BUSINESS THAT CAN ADMIT THEY MADE MISTAKES AND CORRECTS THOSE MISTAKES IS A BUSINESS YOU CAN TRUST AND WORTH DOING BUSINESS WITH. When asked what he has personally done since complaints were made on Ripoff Report to provide a better level of customer service to patients, Tammy stated, “We have gone above and beyond to make sure any of the concerns brought up are addressed with every patient. We have always thought we have done an excellent job, but we can always improve. Any complaints that are brought to us are addressed immediately. First, I will be made aware, and then Dr. Diamond. I promptly set up a direct line of communication and call them to see what we have to do to remedy the situation and rectify it immediately”. When asked how he would handle a situation where a patient is looking for a procedure done, but in his professional opinion, it is not truly an area of concern, Dr. Diamond stated, “I have often turned people away. I only want someone leaving my office if we both know that the best possible results have been achieved. I tell people very honestly if a certain procedure is not right for them, and I encourage them to get second opinions. Dr. Diamond was asked about the complaints made on Ripoff Report that describe patients that have not felt they received the results they were looking for, and what he has done to resolve these issues. Based on the way my practice is run, I see a low volume of patients. Because I spend so much time with each patient, I cannot see a plethora of patients on any given day. Therefore, I know each and every one of my patients extremely well. Any time there is a complaint, I do everything in my power to rectify it. I am the ‘Complaint Department’. The most important thing to me is that I have happy patients. When I am given the opportunity to address a person not satisfied, I will spend an extensive amount of time talking with them and evaluating their concerns. I will do whatever I possibly can to make the patient feel satisfied. Since complaints were made on Ripoff Report, Dr. Diamond pays even more attention to patient expectations when evaluating a patient’s candidacy for a procedure. Dr. Diamond states, “I have always cared for my patients as though they are family, and those same sentiments hold true today.”STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM JASON B. DIAMOND, M.D., F.A.C.S.. Dr. Diamond recognizes that complaints posted to Ripoff Report (whether true or not) are issues that need to be addressed, not ignored. If handled correctly, complaints can be valuable learning opportunities. With the feedback generated by Ripoff Report’s Investigation, Dr. Diamond has made organizational changes allowing his patients and employees a more streamlined approach to problem resolution, and a commitment to the best patient experience possible.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN LOCATING A GOOD DR. Dr. Diamond recommends that patients be careful in responding to advertisements. It is widely accepted that the best surgeons do not advertise. Dr. Diamond recommends finding a surgeon who is honest, thorough, and will spend as much time needed to have all of your questions and concerns addressed. Choosing a surgeon based on a cheap price is a risky proposition, and one that Dr. Diamond would caution you against. *Any consumer not receiving satisfaction from a member of Rip-off Report’s Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program should email us at EDitor@ripoffreport.com This kind of dedication to customer service means that Jason B.

I see the brother and sister team go to Asian woman alumni to talk.  They market to the aging female's psychy.  Please be forwarned to thoroghly check out their competency; Overlook the office and personell surface; DON'T get oversold on unnecessary procedure/s no matter how they try to convince you that you need it because you know yourself the best!

Ft Lauderdale , Florida USA ",lagrassomd.com, 1-877-574-7744,""," I was refered to Doctor Jeffrey LaGrasso from the Sleek MedSpa location in Boca Raton. I met with Jessica Davis at the Hollywood surgical center and then she introduced me to Dr. Jeffrey LaGrasso. After meeting with Dr. LaGrasso and hearing of his techniques and experiences in the field I decided to trust him to preform my first surgery in April of 2010. That surgery went well. I then decided to trust him and Sleek medspa with a much more invasive surgery... a breast lift and implant. Dr. LaGrasso assured my husband and myself that he was confident that he could achieve the results I wanted and that all would go well. We decided to move forward with my surgery. I went in for Surgery around November 2011. The surgery seemed to go well at first. On day three I was experiencing a lot of pain and puss around my bandages. I went to Hollywood and saw the doctor and he said I must be experiencing an allergy to the adhesive in the tape. I also noticed that my areolas were much differently shaped. Dr. LaGrasso assured me that all would be fine once I healed. After 3 months of waiting to heal I was not only left with 3/4 inch wide vertical scars on each breast, but I also still had very uneven egg shaped areolas and my right breast sat approximately 2.5 inches higher than my left. After going round and round with the staff and with Dr. LaGrasso, they decided to redo my surgery to correct the few issues that I had. I was however responsible for the fee of anesthesia again ($600) I went back in for a correction in May 2012. Dr. LaGrasso now added a secondary scar below each of my breasts (aprox. 4inches on under each). I was hopefully that all had been resolved this time... however I soon found out that it was not. As I sit here today my surgery is even more botched than before. I now have additional scars and I still have very uneven breasts. After a few moths I went back to Dr. LaGrasso and sat with Jessica and my husband. I showed them my breasts and Dr. LaGrasso agreed that the surgery still wasn’t correct. He claimed I needed an additional. I asked him to refer me to another surgeon for a second opinion of what needed to be done to correct it. He refered me to Dr. Mark Pinsky, in Palm Beach Gardens, FL - Closer to my home. I went to Dr. Pinsky, paid the $50 office visit fee and showed him my horror. Needless to say he obviously told me I need yet another surgery to correct what Dr. LaGrasso attempted to do twice. Dr. Pinsky told me a lot about the unnecessary scars that Dr. LaGrasso had created on me and he also explained what was wrong as he photoed my breasts. He then showed me how completely off both of my breasts are in a computer program, my nipples aren't centered, they are two different shapes, they should’ve been made smaller, I have major scaring and most importantly my right breast is 1.5 inches higher than my left and floats around whenever I lay down causing me a huge discomfort. Dr. Pinsky priced my corrective surgery at nearly $7000.00. After all of this I tried to reach Sleek MedSpa at least 100 times. I left messages for both Jessica Davis and Dr. Lagrasso. All which were never ever returned. After 45 days of unsuccessfully reaching someone there I finally reached Jessica by luck of her answering the phone. She proceeded to tell me that Sleek Medspa was no more and Dr. LaGrasso was no longer with them and that I should call his cell phone. I called his cell phone 2x and on the second message he called me back and told me he wasnt with Sleek because they werent paying him and that he had spoken with Dr. Pinsky regarding my breasts and he told me he would like to be present during surgery (he called it ""scrub-in"".) I told him that I just wanted my money back to have it fixed. He told me that I needed to reach Sleek. Sleek Medspa may have taken my money BUT Dr. Jeffrey Raymond LaGrasso was MY surgeon. Dr. LaGrasso is a doctor and ALL doctors take a hipocratic oath to do NO HARM. Dr. LaGrasso certainly has not obided by his oath. Till this day I am still unable to get my medical records and photos for my new surgeon. My new surgeon is actually filing a grevience with the medical board about this. I have also hired a very successful marketing company to launch our website called mybadplasticsurgery.com. Please tune into the site for photos of what Dr.LaGrasso did to me and the surgerys I need to correct the mess he created so carelessly.

After that procedure he suggested a mini-tummy tuck since I had loose skin in my lower abdomen. I had the mini-tuck in February 2014. I paid for both procedures in full. The cost included several months of follow up visits. By my follow-up visit in March, my scar had healed well but one corner was cone-like and protruding. He said he'd correct it and that it was a minor in-clinic procedure. We scheduled an appointment within 2 weeks which was cancelled the day before the visit. The receptionist who called to cancel it told me that Dr. Ishoo had an emergency out of the country and that they would call me to reschedule.

Surprisingly I went in very quickly as I was getting the consult to then pay money for my breast aug. I get the consult from Dr Basile who has very good reviews and we confirmed I wanted the surgery to go in underneath the breasts and all was planned and then paid for with cash.... Then, because I have had issues with Lidocain they tell me I will have to have my surgery in the Ft lauderdale location under general anesthesia with a different Dr. which was Dr Hamm.....I am on the bed getting ready for surgery and Dr Hamm comes in and starts drawing around my nipple. I told him I was definitely wanting to go under the breasts so I dont have scarring and he tells me no your right breast needs a ""Crescent Lift"" . So after much consideration I tell him to go ahead if he thinks thats the best thing for me...So, I had the breast augmentation Jan 23, 2014 with Saline implants.  Im 33 years old, I went from a 36C to a 36D. So nothing drastic. One breast was a little larger that the other so Dr Hamm filled the left breast with 390cc and the right with 350cc which apparently had the ""Crescent"" lift done.... A week after surgery I felt fine and my breasts looked great (Besides the huge cuts on the top of my nipples)....Going to the post op appointments I ended up seeing 3 different Drs because Dr Hamm wasnt ever there or for some reason went to another office. I sat in the waiting room each time for over an hour..... Now onto the worst part....2 months after surgery I woke up and my right breast has literally looked like it deflated as I slept. I am so horrified because the beautiful matching breasts were no longer there. I have a nice firm left breast while my right breast has sagged back to the way it was before the surgery. I had an appointment with again 3 different Drs at Strax who all have now told me different things like - I just need to pay to get a lollipop lift and that sometimes this is what happens and maybe your skin just gave out...but here give us more money to fix it........ I am now going to a different surgeon to have another surgery to fix this and get them back to what they were after the surgery.....This Surgeon stated that she thinks the implant did just leak after looking at the mammogram and ultrasound I had to pay out of pocket to get done. Hopefully the one side did just deflate and I will get some money back from the implant company at least. Needless to say Strax is like a meat factory with tons of people in and out. Once they get your money you are no longer a concern of theirs and they try to get more money out of you. Be sure to do your research and go with your gut! ",  Plastic Surgeons

New York, New York USA ",www.henryspinelli.com., 212-570-6235,""," For those who are considering going to see Dr. Henry Spinelli, I share my genuiness in hopes of bringing great awareness of this doctor, so you will not be in the same position as me. So please read this. Dr. Henry Spinelli is an incompetent, disgraceful oculoplastic/plastic surgeon who ruined my face, and I am only a young adult mind you. The conservative procedure I had wanted, resulted in new unwanting issues. And to boot, he is a charming scam artist who robbed me of my money by doing an additional unneccesary procedure I did not initially come in for  (additional $3,000), and I am also shelling out more money to correct whatever damage I can. Also, in order to get a copy of my medical photographs, the office  charged me a a substantial fee which I paid for, which I recently found out is atypical and currently disputing b/c perhaps this is illegal. [continued below]....
									
										..... So, if you are considering this doctor, I can not urge you enough to STAY AWAY because he is very care-free in his approach and does not have your best intentions at heart. He is unequivocally unskilled and is a scammer only in it for the money, which is ludicrous because certain things are not reversible. This is your face, your life and your money! And please do not be fooled by him being located off of ritzy 5th avenue or the hiring of good PR. Its the final outcome that proves everything and I know now there are others who have suffered.  As for his office staff-Jennifer and Debra, they are horrible too because they are his shield. After some time, when it became apparent that he messed up my face, I decided to call the office in hopes of booking an appointment- for the purpose of confronting him to show what he did. I felt it would be cathartic for me and perhaps by him seeing this before his eyes, he would feel guilty. Although I did not convey all this over the phone when I had callled and simply asked for a consultation, they knew that I was not a new patient looking to have a procedure done and probably sensed that there was a level of dissatisfaction. I also knew at this point that there seemed to have been a trend with complaints of his work, so Im sure this was not something new to them. So the warm friendly staff that they once were, became rude and unaccommodating, by purposely saying that they couldn't schedule me for an appointment in more than 2 months!! And with no remorse. Having a good inclination that they were being biased and not giving me proper treatment as a patient, I had my friend call the office to see what would happen if she blindly made an appointment. Sure enough, she was able to book within a week. When I called back to get an explanation as to why there was a substantial time difference in me getting an appointment than my friend, there was no reasonable defense. The illogical reasoning that was given was that she was a new patient which takes precedence. So obviously they dont care about anything long term with any of its patients. Ironically, the protocol of any visit involves an intial consultation,so it really makes no difference in that regard. Lastly, it would typically make sense and be righteous that an older patient would have a greater opportunity to see the doctor first, but because I was not beneficial for them anymore because they got their money already and the damage was done, they felt it was ok to be unethical and discriminate. This is technically not just unfair, but illegal.    In conclusion, regardless of the damage I have endured on my face, or the hardship now of undoing the damage, I will not compromise my integrity and will do whatever I can to spread the word on this awful doctor.

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants.

I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous.

[continued below]....
									
										.....' What does that mean? It means that Rip-off Report expects that members of our CAP program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected, the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. It means that if a customer requests a refund and if there is any reasonable basis for that request, we expect the customer will be given a prompt refund (some refund requests may not be reasonable, so this does not mean a refund is guaranteed in every case). Making things right can mean lots of different things to different people, but our point is thisby working closely with the company or individual to resolve any disputes, Ripoff Report can track the footprints of customer service to ensure that our CAP members are doing everything they can to treat customers fairly and to increase their customer satisfaction.ALL COMPANIES GET COMPLAINTS, BUT HOW THE COMPANY HANDLES THOSE COMPLAINTS, SEPARATES GOOD BUSINESSES FROM BAD BUSINESSES.Ripoff Report Verified .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..By Ripoff ReportDr. Jay Calvert, MD, PC / Roxbury Surgical Associates approached Ripoff Report with the intent of wanting to resolve any customer issues and reports posted on Rip-off Report.As a Part of the Corporate Advocacy Program the member business allows Ripoff Report to send an email to all of those who filed a complaint in the past, letting the customer know, the member business wanted to make things right with them, .. whatever it takes to do so.

No matter what the complaint may be the office will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible or come up with a solution that is agreeable between all parties.Furthermore, the office has discovered that better patient selection is key in prevention of complaints. There are many patients that have had multiple procedures from other surgeons, that makes Dr. Calvert am very careful to assess whether or not further surgery is advisable for that patient.

Jay Calvert, MD, PC made efforts to ensure that all customers were satisfied and Dr. Calvert assured Ripoff Report that the business has an improved business model that features customer satisfaction as the top priority.Dr. Jay Calvert, the owner of Jay Calvert, MD PC and Roxbury Surgical Associates, stated We carefully consider all customer complaints as constructive criticism and use them as tools to improve our customer service upon. Our customers are the face of our business and their satisfaction is of the utmost importance. We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually improving so that their experiences with Jay Calvert, MD, PC remain strong, consistent and positive.STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM JAY CALVERT, MD AND ROXBURY SURGICAL ASSOCIATES.Theyre new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

He's bad!!! He has a very bad surgical conscience he's dirty and does care for the correct way to follow ""clean or sterile"" surgical procedure in the time I worked for him he tried to do a lipo in one room and a tummy tuck in I other room well the room that the lipo was taking place was in conjunction to the room with the tummy tuck so the door that divided the two was not closed so thats bad right there and the room where the lipo was taking place was too small so he kept contaminating the instruments being used! He was in such a hurry that he did not even do a good job the patient was HUGE! And in my opinion did not need lipo but she did need to lose weight so her money was not well spent after all is said and done dr. Sheibani left and told me to take care of the patients... First of all I'm not a nurse! So I couldn't possibly conduct any kind of post op care for both patients by myself! He does not care about the patirnts after the procedure he's a money hungry surgeon that is nice to you to get you in and then he can just care less about your results!... He hates to do touch up jobs on his patients for HIS mistakes there was a for that had 4 revidions of her implants because dr sheibani does not take his time do do a good job!... I would never get paid on time and what I was getting paid was below standards he would  be very rude hasd multiple personalities he would be very offensive and just not at all professional! ladies please do not go to this man if you want good results! He is bad! He could care less about you, you are only another money sign coming into his office!...  and if someone wants to say that I am a hater or that I wish I could go work for him again you guys are crazy!!! After I quit he has been calling me to offer me my job again I keep telling him NO! I would NEVER want to work for him EVER again he's a bad human overall and I could care less for his practice what I care for is his patients and potential patients that don't know any better I hope you read this and reconsider going with him!... I am not a disgruntled emoyee I have a great job in a very good level 2 and 3 trauma center where I get paid on time I have great benefits and where surgeons are proffesdionsl and board certified...

I am 4 months post operation. Aside from a slight difference on my back bra roll, I look the exact same and weight the exact same. No change in the way my clothes fit ever occured. They made me pay more because I had a higher BMI. The second surgery was far more torturous than the first.  The nurse told me that being four months along, my results are pretty well as good as they will get.  They told me the doctor took 9 lbs of pure fat from my body, so weighting the exact same amount now I have technically gained weight. They stated this is the reason I cannot see any results. I was lied to. [continued below]....
									
										..... My consultant said my problem areas would be permanently gone. She stated if I ever did gain weight, it would be uneven because I would not gain it in the areas I have had the procedure. Before the surgery, the doctor stated it was hard to describe exactly what i will look like. He stated I should find a picture of someone who looked similar to be on the before and after pictures on his website and that was how my results would look. Now, when at the 6 mo check up, if I am still unhappy, I have to pay half price to have them all redone again. More money, more torture, more recovery.... and will I even see results then? I wish I had voice recorded the promises made to me by the consultant and the doctor. Ten grand later, I am unhappy.  Along the way, they were so nice to be. They really specifically told me that my body would be transformed and that the excess fat on my belly wouldn't have any volume to it.

Sunrise, Florida USA ","", ,"","  I went in for a lower bleph and correction to nose that still needed to straighten and lift tip to help breathe better.  I was convinced to do an upper bleph and laser peel.  They had switched name of company, unbeknownst to me, and I researched Dr. and Straxx and saw no complaints filed.  I didn't think about reviews back then.  2008.  Dr. seemed to know exactly what I needed.  My bleph resulted in hooding and droopiness.  My lids would not even shut.  I acquired the name owl eyes and I used to have oval shaped eyes.  I had to spend more money to correct than initial surgery.  I went there, regretably, to save money.  I had to have a forhead lift and a cantherplex to lift the brows and pull up the drooping, repsectively. The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

Tampa , Florida USA ",www.drhalpern.com, 800-963-8483,"", My eye surgery was almost 4 years ago.  I originally went  here seeking a tummy tuck.  He talked me into eye surgery instead (Still unsure now why) but showed me pictures of how it would make me look younger and that talked me out of the tummy tuck as the scare would not be worth it (I did not have huge stomach).   I went through the typically pre-op which included blood work at his recommended center. After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected.

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle.

[continued below]....
									
										.....' What does that mean? It means that Rip-off Report expects that members of our CAP program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected, the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. It means that if a customer requests a refund and if there is any reasonable basis for that request, we expect the customer will be given a prompt refund (some refund requests may not be reasonable, so this does not mean a refund is guaranteed in every case). Making things right can mean lots of different things to different people, but our point is thisby working closely with the company or individual to resolve any disputes, Ripoff Report can track the footprints of customer service to ensure that our CAP members are doing everything they can to treat customers fairly and to increase their customer satisfaction.ALL COMPANIES GET COMPLAINTS, BUT HOW THE COMPANY HANDLES THOSE COMPLAINTS, SEPARATES GOOD BUSINESSES FROM BAD BUSINESSES.Ripoff Report Verified .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..By Ripoff ReportDr. Jay Calvert, MD, PC / Roxbury Surgical Associates approached Ripoff Report with the intent of wanting to resolve any customer issues and reports posted on Rip-off Report.As a Part of the Corporate Advocacy Program the member business allows Ripoff Report to send an email to all of those who filed a complaint in the past, letting the customer know, the member business wanted to make things right with them, .. whatever it takes to do so.

No matter what the complaint may be the office will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible or come up with a solution that is agreeable between all parties.Furthermore, the office has discovered that better patient selection is key in prevention of complaints.

Jay Calvert, MD, PC made efforts to ensure that all customers were satisfied and Dr. Calvert assured Ripoff Report that the business has an improved business model that features customer satisfaction as the top priority.Dr. Jay Calvert, the owner of Jay Calvert, MD PC and Roxbury Surgical Associates, stated We carefully consider all customer complaints as constructive criticism and use them as tools to improve our customer service upon. Our customers are the face of our business and their satisfaction is of the utmost importance. We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually improving so that their experiences with Jay Calvert, MD, PC remain strong, consistent and positive.STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM JAY CALVERT, MD AND ROXBURY SURGICAL ASSOCIATES.Theyre new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

He's bad!!! He has a very bad surgical conscience he's dirty and does care for the correct way to follow ""clean or sterile"" surgical procedure in the time I worked for him he tried to do a lipo in one room and a tummy tuck in I other room well the room that the lipo was taking place was in conjunction to the room with the tummy tuck so the door that divided the two was not closed so thats bad right there and the room where the lipo was taking place was too small so he kept contaminating the instruments being used! He was in such a hurry that he did not even do a good job the patient was HUGE! And in my opinion did not need lipo but she did need to lose weight so her money was not well spent after all is said and done dr. Sheibani left and told me to take care of the patients... First of all I'm not a nurse! So I couldn't possibly conduct any kind of post op care for both patients by myself! He does not care about the patirnts after the procedure he's a money hungry surgeon that is nice to you to get you in and then he can just care less about your results!... He hates to do touch up jobs on his patients for HIS mistakes there was a for that had 4 revidions of her implants because dr sheibani does not take his time do do a good job!... I would never get paid on time and what I was getting paid was below standards he would  be very rude hasd multiple personalities he would be very offensive and just not at all professional! ladies please do not go to this man if you want good results! He is bad! He could care less about you, you are only another money sign coming into his office!...  and if someone wants to say that I am a hater or that I wish I could go work for him again you guys are crazy!!! After I quit he has been calling me to offer me my job again I keep telling him NO! I would NEVER want to work for him EVER again he's a bad human overall and I could care less for his practice what I care for is his patients and potential patients that don't know any better I hope you read this and reconsider going with him!... I am not a disgruntled emoyee I have a great job in a very good level 2 and 3 trauma center where I get paid on time I have great benefits and where surgeons are proffesdionsl and board certified...

I am 4 months post operation. Aside from a slight difference on my back bra roll, I look the exact same and weight the exact same. No change in the way my clothes fit ever occured. They made me pay more because I had a higher BMI. The second surgery was far more torturous than the first.  The nurse told me that being four months along, my results are pretty well as good as they will get.  They told me the doctor took 9 lbs of pure fat from my body, so weighting the exact same amount now I have technically gained weight. They stated this is the reason I cannot see any results. I was lied to. [continued below]....
									
										..... My consultant said my problem areas would be permanently gone. She stated if I ever did gain weight, it would be uneven because I would not gain it in the areas I have had the procedure. Before the surgery, the doctor stated it was hard to describe exactly what i will look like. He stated I should find a picture of someone who looked similar to be on the before and after pictures on his website and that was how my results would look. Now, when at the 6 mo check up, if I am still unhappy, I have to pay half price to have them all redone again. More money, more torture, more recovery.... and will I even see results then? I wish I had voice recorded the promises made to me by the consultant and the doctor. Ten grand later, I am unhappy.  Along the way, they were so nice to be. They really specifically told me that my body would be transformed and that the excess fat on my belly wouldn't have any volume to it.

 Straxx ,"  Straxx  12510 NW 10th St 
Sunrise, Florida USA ","", ,"","  I went in for a lower bleph and correction to nose that still needed to straighten and lift tip to help breathe better.  I was convinced to do an upper bleph and laser peel.  They had switched name of company, unbeknownst to me, and I researched Dr. and Straxx and saw no complaints filed.  I didn't think about reviews back then.  2008.  Dr. seemed to know exactly what I needed.  My bleph resulted in hooding and droopiness.  My lids would not even shut.  I acquired the name owl eyes and I used to have oval shaped eyes.  I had to spend more money to correct than initial surgery.  I went there, regretably, to save money.  I had to have a forhead lift and a cantherplex to lift the brows and pull up the drooping, repsectively. The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

Tampa , Florida USA ",www.drhalpern.com, 800-963-8483,"", My eye surgery was almost 4 years ago.  I originally went  here seeking a tummy tuck.  He talked me into eye surgery instead (Still unsure now why) but showed me pictures of how it would make me look younger and that talked me out of the tummy tuck as the scare would not be worth it (I did not have huge stomach).   I went through the typically pre-op which included blood work at his recommended center. After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected.

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle.

[continued below]....
									
										.....' What does that mean? It means that Rip-off Report expects that members of our CAP program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected, the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. It means that if a customer requests a refund and if there is any reasonable basis for that request, we expect the customer will be given a prompt refund (some refund requests may not be reasonable, so this does not mean a refund is guaranteed in every case). Making things right can mean lots of different things to different people, but our point is thisby working closely with the company or individual to resolve any disputes, Ripoff Report can track the footprints of customer service to ensure that our CAP members are doing everything they can to treat customers fairly and to increase their customer satisfaction.ALL COMPANIES GET COMPLAINTS, BUT HOW THE COMPANY HANDLES THOSE COMPLAINTS, SEPARATES GOOD BUSINESSES FROM BAD BUSINESSES.Ripoff Report Verified .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..By Ripoff ReportDr. Jay Calvert, MD, PC / Roxbury Surgical Associates approached Ripoff Report with the intent of wanting to resolve any customer issues and reports posted on Rip-off Report.As a Part of the Corporate Advocacy Program the member business allows Ripoff Report to send an email to all of those who filed a complaint in the past, letting the customer know, the member business wanted to make things right with them, .. whatever it takes to do so. Ripoff Report always monitors these emails to insure the member business does what they agreed to. The people at Jay Calvert, MD, Professional Corporation did just that.Jay Calvert, MD, PC and Roxbury Surgical Associates has gone through great lengths to make sure they try and resolve any and all customer issues. Jay Calvert, MD, PC has joined the Corporate Advocacy Program because they want customers to know they will resolve any and all customer issues.

As health care providers, we believe safety and results are our first priority.

No matter what the complaint may be the office will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible or come up with a solution that is agreeable between all parties.Furthermore, the office has discovered that better patient selection is key in prevention of complaints. There are many patients that have had multiple procedures from other surgeons, that makes Dr. Calvert am very careful to assess whether or not further surgery is advisable for that patient.

Jay Calvert, MD, PC made efforts to ensure that all customers were satisfied and Dr. Calvert assured Ripoff Report that the business has an improved business model that features customer satisfaction as the top priority.Dr. Jay Calvert, the owner of Jay Calvert, MD PC and Roxbury Surgical Associates, stated We carefully consider all customer complaints as constructive criticism and use them as tools to improve our customer service upon. Our customers are the face of our business and their satisfaction is of the utmost importance. We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually improving so that their experiences with Jay Calvert, MD, PC remain strong, consistent and positive.STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM JAY CALVERT, MD AND ROXBURY SURGICAL ASSOCIATES.Theyre new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

I am 4 months post operation. Aside from a slight difference on my back bra roll, I look the exact same and weight the exact same. No change in the way my clothes fit ever occured. They made me pay more because I had a higher BMI. The second surgery was far more torturous than the first.  The nurse told me that being four months along, my results are pretty well as good as they will get.  They told me the doctor took 9 lbs of pure fat from my body, so weighting the exact same amount now I have technically gained weight. They stated this is the reason I cannot see any results. I was lied to. [continued below]....
									
										..... My consultant said my problem areas would be permanently gone. She stated if I ever did gain weight, it would be uneven because I would not gain it in the areas I have had the procedure. Before the surgery, the doctor stated it was hard to describe exactly what i will look like. He stated I should find a picture of someone who looked similar to be on the before and after pictures on his website and that was how my results would look. Now, when at the 6 mo check up, if I am still unhappy, I have to pay half price to have them all redone again. More money, more torture, more recovery.... and will I even see results then? I wish I had voice recorded the promises made to me by the consultant and the doctor. Ten grand later, I am unhappy.  Along the way, they were so nice to be. They really specifically told me that my body would be transformed and that the excess fat on my belly wouldn't have any volume to it. As you can see from the pictures, all that pain and money was for nothing.    ",  Plastic Surgeons

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

Boca Raton, Florida USA ","", ,""," Nu-Look Cosmetic Plastic Surgery is a company that purchased their client list from Strax Rejuvenation.  This company has nothing to do with Strax Rejuvenation.  However, when the client comes into their waiting room, they are greeted with the exact same set-up that Strax utilizes at their offices in Lauderhill, Florida. For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected. Doctors should be the only individuals who can work on patients. ",  Plastic Surgeons

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle. The Colorado Springs public needs to know not to give their skin, their appearance, over to Dr. Anderson. He just might ruin you.  ",  Plastic Surgeons

We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually improving so that their experiences with Jay Calvert, MD, PC remain strong, consistent and positive.STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM JAY CALVERT, MD AND ROXBURY SURGICAL ASSOCIATES.Theyre new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

He was in such a hurry that he did not even do a good job the patient was HUGE! And in my opinion did not need lipo but she did need to lose weight so her money was not well spent after all is said and done dr. Sheibani left and told me to take care of the patients... First of all I'm not a nurse! So I couldn't possibly conduct any kind of post op care for both patients by myself! He does not care about the patirnts after the procedure he's a money hungry surgeon that is nice to you to get you in and then he can just care less about your results!...

The second surgery was far more torturous than the first.  The nurse told me that being four months along, my results are pretty well as good as they will get.  They told me the doctor took 9 lbs of pure fat from my body, so weighting the exact same amount now I have technically gained weight. They stated this is the reason I cannot see any results. I was lied to. [continued below]....

He stated I should find a picture of someone who looked similar to be on the before and after pictures on his website and that was how my results would look.

I wish I had voice recorded the promises made to me by the consultant and the doctor. Ten grand later, I am unhappy.  Along the way, they were so nice to be.

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

Tampa , Florida USA ",www.drhalpern.com, 800-963-8483,"", My eye surgery was almost 4 years ago.  I originally went  here seeking a tummy tuck.  He talked me into eye surgery instead (Still unsure now why) but showed me pictures of how it would make me look younger and that talked me out of the tummy tuck as the scare would not be worth it (I did not have huge stomach).   I went through the typically pre-op which included blood work at his recommended center. After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle. The Colorado Springs public needs to know not to give their skin, their appearance, over to Dr. Anderson. He just might ruin you.  ",  Plastic Surgeons

										.....' What does that mean? It means that Rip-off Report expects that members of our CAP program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected, the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. It means that if a customer requests a refund and if there is any reasonable basis for that request, we expect the customer will be given a prompt refund (some refund requests may not be reasonable, so this does not mean a refund is guaranteed in every case).

Our customers are the face of our business and their satisfaction is of the utmost importance. We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually improving so that their experiences with Jay Calvert, MD, PC remain strong, consistent and positive.STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM JAY CALVERT, MD AND ROXBURY SURGICAL ASSOCIATES.Theyre new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

He has a very bad surgical conscience he's dirty and does care for the correct way to follow ""clean or sterile"" surgical procedure in the time I worked for him he tried to do a lipo in one room and a tummy tuck in I other room well the room that the lipo was taking place was in conjunction to the room with the tummy tuck so the door that divided the two was not closed so thats bad right there and the room where the lipo was taking place was too small so he kept contaminating the instruments being used! He was in such a hurry that he did not even do a good job the patient was HUGE! And in my opinion did not need lipo but she did need to lose weight so her money was not well spent after all is said and done dr. Sheibani left and told me to take care of the patients... First of all I'm not a nurse! So I couldn't possibly conduct any kind of post op care for both patients by myself! He does not care about the patirnts after the procedure he's a money hungry surgeon that is nice to you to get you in and then he can just care less about your results!... He hates to do touch up jobs on his patients for HIS mistakes there was a for that had 4 revidions of her implants because dr sheibani does not take his time do do a good job!...

They made me pay more because I had a higher BMI. The second surgery was far more torturous than the first.  The nurse told me that being four months along, my results are pretty well as good as they will get.  They told me the doctor took 9 lbs of pure fat from my body, so weighting the exact same amount now I have technically gained weight. They stated this is the reason I cannot see any results. I was lied to. [continued below]....

He stated I should find a picture of someone who looked similar to be on the before and after pictures on his website and that was how my results would look. Now, when at the 6 mo check up, if I am still unhappy, I have to pay half price to have them all redone again. More money, more torture, more recovery.... and will I even see results then? I wish I had voice recorded the promises made to me by the consultant and the doctor. Ten grand later, I am unhappy.  Along the way, they were so nice to be.

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants.

I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle. The Colorado Springs public needs to know not to give their skin, their appearance, over to Dr. Anderson. He just might ruin you.  ",  Plastic Surgeons

										.....' What does that mean? It means that Rip-off Report expects that members of our CAP program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected, the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. It means that if a customer requests a refund and if there is any reasonable basis for that request, we expect the customer will be given a prompt refund (some refund requests may not be reasonable, so this does not mean a refund is guaranteed in every case). Making things right can mean lots of different things to different people, but our point is thisby working closely with the company or individual to resolve any disputes, Ripoff Report can track the footprints of customer service to ensure that our CAP members are doing everything they can to treat customers fairly and to increase their customer satisfaction.ALL COMPANIES GET COMPLAINTS, BUT HOW THE COMPANY HANDLES THOSE COMPLAINTS, SEPARATES GOOD BUSINESSES FROM BAD BUSINESSES.Ripoff Report Verified .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..By Ripoff ReportDr. Jay Calvert, MD, PC / Roxbury Surgical Associates approached Ripoff Report with the intent of wanting to resolve any customer issues and reports posted on Rip-off Report.As a Part of the Corporate Advocacy Program the member business allows Ripoff Report to send an email to all of those who filed a complaint in the past, letting the customer know, the member business wanted to make things right with them, .. whatever it takes to do so.

Our customers are the face of our business and their satisfaction is of the utmost importance. We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually improving so that their experiences with Jay Calvert, MD, PC remain strong, consistent and positive.STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM JAY CALVERT, MD AND ROXBURY SURGICAL ASSOCIATES.Theyre new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

He has a very bad surgical conscience he's dirty and does care for the correct way to follow ""clean or sterile"" surgical procedure in the time I worked for him he tried to do a lipo in one room and a tummy tuck in I other room well the room that the lipo was taking place was in conjunction to the room with the tummy tuck so the door that divided the two was not closed so thats bad right there and the room where the lipo was taking place was too small so he kept contaminating the instruments being used! He was in such a hurry that he did not even do a good job the patient was HUGE! And in my opinion did not need lipo but she did need to lose weight so her money was not well spent after all is said and done dr. Sheibani left and told me to take care of the patients... First of all I'm not a nurse! So I couldn't possibly conduct any kind of post op care for both patients by myself! He does not care about the patirnts after the procedure he's a money hungry surgeon that is nice to you to get you in and then he can just care less about your results!... He hates to do touch up jobs on his patients for HIS mistakes there was a for that had 4 revidions of her implants because dr sheibani does not take his time do do a good job!... I would never get paid on time and what I was getting paid was below standards he would  be very rude hasd multiple personalities he would be very offensive and just not at all professional! ladies please do not go to this man if you want good results!

They made me pay more because I had a higher BMI. The second surgery was far more torturous than the first.  The nurse told me that being four months along, my results are pretty well as good as they will get.  They told me the doctor took 9 lbs of pure fat from my body, so weighting the exact same amount now I have technically gained weight. They stated this is the reason I cannot see any results. I was lied to. [continued below]....

He stated I should find a picture of someone who looked similar to be on the before and after pictures on his website and that was how my results would look. Now, when at the 6 mo check up, if I am still unhappy, I have to pay half price to have them all redone again. More money, more torture, more recovery.... and will I even see results then? I wish I had voice recorded the promises made to me by the consultant and the doctor. Ten grand later, I am unhappy.  Along the way, they were so nice to be.

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

Tampa , Florida USA ",www.drhalpern.com, 800-963-8483,"", My eye surgery was almost 4 years ago.  I originally went  here seeking a tummy tuck.  He talked me into eye surgery instead (Still unsure now why) but showed me pictures of how it would make me look younger and that talked me out of the tummy tuck as the scare would not be worth it (I did not have huge stomach).   I went through the typically pre-op which included blood work at his recommended center. After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected.

										.....' What does that mean? It means that Rip-off Report expects that members of our CAP program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected, the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. It means that if a customer requests a refund and if there is any reasonable basis for that request, we expect the customer will be given a prompt refund (some refund requests may not be reasonable, so this does not mean a refund is guaranteed in every case). Making things right can mean lots of different things to different people, but our point is thisby working closely with the company or individual to resolve any disputes, Ripoff Report can track the footprints of customer service to ensure that our CAP members are doing everything they can to treat customers fairly and to increase their customer satisfaction.ALL COMPANIES GET COMPLAINTS, BUT HOW THE COMPANY HANDLES THOSE COMPLAINTS, SEPARATES GOOD BUSINESSES FROM BAD BUSINESSES.Ripoff Report Verified .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..By Ripoff ReportDr. Jay Calvert, MD, PC / Roxbury Surgical Associates approached Ripoff Report with the intent of wanting to resolve any customer issues and reports posted on Rip-off Report.As a Part of the Corporate Advocacy Program the member business allows Ripoff Report to send an email to all of those who filed a complaint in the past, letting the customer know, the member business wanted to make things right with them, .. whatever it takes to do so.

Our customers are the face of our business and their satisfaction is of the utmost importance. We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually improving so that their experiences with Jay Calvert, MD, PC remain strong, consistent and positive.STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM JAY CALVERT, MD AND ROXBURY SURGICAL ASSOCIATES.Theyre new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

He has a very bad surgical conscience he's dirty and does care for the correct way to follow ""clean or sterile"" surgical procedure in the time I worked for him he tried to do a lipo in one room and a tummy tuck in I other room well the room that the lipo was taking place was in conjunction to the room with the tummy tuck so the door that divided the two was not closed so thats bad right there and the room where the lipo was taking place was too small so he kept contaminating the instruments being used! He was in such a hurry that he did not even do a good job the patient was HUGE! And in my opinion did not need lipo but she did need to lose weight so her money was not well spent after all is said and done dr. Sheibani left and told me to take care of the patients... First of all I'm not a nurse! So I couldn't possibly conduct any kind of post op care for both patients by myself! He does not care about the patirnts after the procedure he's a money hungry surgeon that is nice to you to get you in and then he can just care less about your results!... He hates to do touch up jobs on his patients for HIS mistakes there was a for that had 4 revidions of her implants because dr sheibani does not take his time do do a good job!... I would never get paid on time and what I was getting paid was below standards he would  be very rude hasd multiple personalities he would be very offensive and just not at all professional! ladies please do not go to this man if you want good results! He is bad! He could care less about you, you are only another money sign coming into his office!...  and if someone wants to say that I am a hater or that I wish I could go work for him again you guys are crazy!!! After I quit he has been calling me to offer me my job again I keep telling him NO! I would NEVER want to work for him EVER again he's a bad human overall and I could care less for his practice what I care for is his patients and potential patients that don't know any better I hope you read this and reconsider going with him!...

They made me pay more because I had a higher BMI. The second surgery was far more torturous than the first.  The nurse told me that being four months along, my results are pretty well as good as they will get.  They told me the doctor took 9 lbs of pure fat from my body, so weighting the exact same amount now I have technically gained weight. They stated this is the reason I cannot see any results. I was lied to. [continued below]....
									
										..... My consultant said my problem areas would be permanently gone. She stated if I ever did gain weight, it would be uneven because I would not gain it in the areas I have had the procedure. Before the surgery, the doctor stated it was hard to describe exactly what i will look like. He stated I should find a picture of someone who looked similar to be on the before and after pictures on his website and that was how my results would look. Now, when at the 6 mo check up, if I am still unhappy, I have to pay half price to have them all redone again. More money, more torture, more recovery.... and will I even see results then? I wish I had voice recorded the promises made to me by the consultant and the doctor. Ten grand later, I am unhappy.  Along the way, they were so nice to be.

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected.

I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about.

[continued below]....
									
										.....' What does that mean? It means that Rip-off Report expects that members of our CAP program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected, the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. It means that if a customer requests a refund and if there is any reasonable basis for that request, we expect the customer will be given a prompt refund (some refund requests may not be reasonable, so this does not mean a refund is guaranteed in every case). Making things right can mean lots of different things to different people, but our point is thisby working closely with the company or individual to resolve any disputes, Ripoff Report can track the footprints of customer service to ensure that our CAP members are doing everything they can to treat customers fairly and to increase their customer satisfaction.ALL COMPANIES GET COMPLAINTS, BUT HOW THE COMPANY HANDLES THOSE COMPLAINTS, SEPARATES GOOD BUSINESSES FROM BAD BUSINESSES.Ripoff Report Verified .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..By Ripoff ReportDr. Jay Calvert, MD, PC / Roxbury Surgical Associates approached Ripoff Report with the intent of wanting to resolve any customer issues and reports posted on Rip-off Report.As a Part of the Corporate Advocacy Program the member business allows Ripoff Report to send an email to all of those who filed a complaint in the past, letting the customer know, the member business wanted to make things right with them, .. whatever it takes to do so.

No matter what the complaint may be the office will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible or come up with a solution that is agreeable between all parties.Furthermore, the office has discovered that better patient selection is key in prevention of complaints.

Our customers are the face of our business and their satisfaction is of the utmost importance. We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually improving so that their experiences with Jay Calvert, MD, PC remain strong, consistent and positive.STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM JAY CALVERT, MD AND ROXBURY SURGICAL ASSOCIATES.Theyre new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

He's bad!!! He has a very bad surgical conscience he's dirty and does care for the correct way to follow ""clean or sterile"" surgical procedure in the time I worked for him he tried to do a lipo in one room and a tummy tuck in I other room well the room that the lipo was taking place was in conjunction to the room with the tummy tuck so the door that divided the two was not closed so thats bad right there and the room where the lipo was taking place was too small so he kept contaminating the instruments being used! He was in such a hurry that he did not even do a good job the patient was HUGE! And in my opinion did not need lipo but she did need to lose weight so her money was not well spent after all is said and done dr. Sheibani left and told me to take care of the patients... First of all I'm not a nurse! So I couldn't possibly conduct any kind of post op care for both patients by myself! He does not care about the patirnts after the procedure he's a money hungry surgeon that is nice to you to get you in and then he can just care less about your results!... He hates to do touch up jobs on his patients for HIS mistakes there was a for that had 4 revidions of her implants because dr sheibani does not take his time do do a good job!... I would never get paid on time and what I was getting paid was below standards he would  be very rude hasd multiple personalities he would be very offensive and just not at all professional! ladies please do not go to this man if you want good results! He is bad! He could care less about you, you are only another money sign coming into his office!...  and if someone wants to say that I am a hater or that I wish I could go work for him again you guys are crazy!!! After I quit he has been calling me to offer me my job again I keep telling him NO! I would NEVER want to work for him EVER again he's a bad human overall and I could care less for his practice what I care for is his patients and potential patients that don't know any better I hope you read this and reconsider going with him!...

I am 4 months post operation. Aside from a slight difference on my back bra roll, I look the exact same and weight the exact same. No change in the way my clothes fit ever occured. They made me pay more because I had a higher BMI. The second surgery was far more torturous than the first.  The nurse told me that being four months along, my results are pretty well as good as they will get.  They told me the doctor took 9 lbs of pure fat from my body, so weighting the exact same amount now I have technically gained weight. They stated this is the reason I cannot see any results. I was lied to. [continued below]....
									
										..... My consultant said my problem areas would be permanently gone. She stated if I ever did gain weight, it would be uneven because I would not gain it in the areas I have had the procedure. Before the surgery, the doctor stated it was hard to describe exactly what i will look like. He stated I should find a picture of someone who looked similar to be on the before and after pictures on his website and that was how my results would look. Now, when at the 6 mo check up, if I am still unhappy, I have to pay half price to have them all redone again. More money, more torture, more recovery.... and will I even see results then? I wish I had voice recorded the promises made to me by the consultant and the doctor. Ten grand later, I am unhappy.  Along the way, they were so nice to be. They really specifically told me that my body would be transformed and that the excess fat on my belly wouldn't have any volume to it.

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

Tampa , Florida USA ",www.drhalpern.com, 800-963-8483,"", My eye surgery was almost 4 years ago.  I originally went  here seeking a tummy tuck.  He talked me into eye surgery instead (Still unsure now why) but showed me pictures of how it would make me look younger and that talked me out of the tummy tuck as the scare would not be worth it (I did not have huge stomach).   I went through the typically pre-op which included blood work at his recommended center. After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected.

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle.

[continued below]....
									
										.....' What does that mean? It means that Rip-off Report expects that members of our CAP program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected, the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. It means that if a customer requests a refund and if there is any reasonable basis for that request, we expect the customer will be given a prompt refund (some refund requests may not be reasonable, so this does not mean a refund is guaranteed in every case). Making things right can mean lots of different things to different people, but our point is thisby working closely with the company or individual to resolve any disputes, Ripoff Report can track the footprints of customer service to ensure that our CAP members are doing everything they can to treat customers fairly and to increase their customer satisfaction.ALL COMPANIES GET COMPLAINTS, BUT HOW THE COMPANY HANDLES THOSE COMPLAINTS, SEPARATES GOOD BUSINESSES FROM BAD BUSINESSES.Ripoff Report Verified .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..By Ripoff ReportDr. Jay Calvert, MD, PC / Roxbury Surgical Associates approached Ripoff Report with the intent of wanting to resolve any customer issues and reports posted on Rip-off Report.As a Part of the Corporate Advocacy Program the member business allows Ripoff Report to send an email to all of those who filed a complaint in the past, letting the customer know, the member business wanted to make things right with them, .. whatever it takes to do so.

No matter what the complaint may be the office will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible or come up with a solution that is agreeable between all parties.Furthermore, the office has discovered that better patient selection is key in prevention of complaints.

Our customers are the face of our business and their satisfaction is of the utmost importance. We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually improving so that their experiences with Jay Calvert, MD, PC remain strong, consistent and positive.STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM JAY CALVERT, MD AND ROXBURY SURGICAL ASSOCIATES.Theyre new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

He's bad!!! He has a very bad surgical conscience he's dirty and does care for the correct way to follow ""clean or sterile"" surgical procedure in the time I worked for him he tried to do a lipo in one room and a tummy tuck in I other room well the room that the lipo was taking place was in conjunction to the room with the tummy tuck so the door that divided the two was not closed so thats bad right there and the room where the lipo was taking place was too small so he kept contaminating the instruments being used! He was in such a hurry that he did not even do a good job the patient was HUGE! And in my opinion did not need lipo but she did need to lose weight so her money was not well spent after all is said and done dr. Sheibani left and told me to take care of the patients... First of all I'm not a nurse! So I couldn't possibly conduct any kind of post op care for both patients by myself! He does not care about the patirnts after the procedure he's a money hungry surgeon that is nice to you to get you in and then he can just care less about your results!... He hates to do touch up jobs on his patients for HIS mistakes there was a for that had 4 revidions of her implants because dr sheibani does not take his time do do a good job!... I would never get paid on time and what I was getting paid was below standards he would  be very rude hasd multiple personalities he would be very offensive and just not at all professional! ladies please do not go to this man if you want good results! He is bad! He could care less about you, you are only another money sign coming into his office!...  and if someone wants to say that I am a hater or that I wish I could go work for him again you guys are crazy!!! After I quit he has been calling me to offer me my job again I keep telling him NO! I would NEVER want to work for him EVER again he's a bad human overall and I could care less for his practice what I care for is his patients and potential patients that don't know any better I hope you read this and reconsider going with him!...

I am 4 months post operation. Aside from a slight difference on my back bra roll, I look the exact same and weight the exact same. No change in the way my clothes fit ever occured. They made me pay more because I had a higher BMI. The second surgery was far more torturous than the first.  The nurse told me that being four months along, my results are pretty well as good as they will get.  They told me the doctor took 9 lbs of pure fat from my body, so weighting the exact same amount now I have technically gained weight. They stated this is the reason I cannot see any results. I was lied to. [continued below]....
									
										..... My consultant said my problem areas would be permanently gone. She stated if I ever did gain weight, it would be uneven because I would not gain it in the areas I have had the procedure. Before the surgery, the doctor stated it was hard to describe exactly what i will look like. He stated I should find a picture of someone who looked similar to be on the before and after pictures on his website and that was how my results would look. Now, when at the 6 mo check up, if I am still unhappy, I have to pay half price to have them all redone again. More money, more torture, more recovery.... and will I even see results then? I wish I had voice recorded the promises made to me by the consultant and the doctor. Ten grand later, I am unhappy.  Along the way, they were so nice to be. They really specifically told me that my body would be transformed and that the excess fat on my belly wouldn't have any volume to it.

Sunrise, Florida USA ","", ,"","  I went in for a lower bleph and correction to nose that still needed to straighten and lift tip to help breathe better.  I was convinced to do an upper bleph and laser peel.  They had switched name of company, unbeknownst to me, and I researched Dr. and Straxx and saw no complaints filed.  I didn't think about reviews back then.  2008.  Dr. seemed to know exactly what I needed.  My bleph resulted in hooding and droopiness.  My lids would not even shut.  I acquired the name owl eyes and I used to have oval shaped eyes.  I had to spend more money to correct than initial surgery.  I went there, regretably, to save money.  I had to have a forhead lift and a cantherplex to lift the brows and pull up the drooping, repsectively. The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

Tampa , Florida USA ",www.drhalpern.com, 800-963-8483,"", My eye surgery was almost 4 years ago.  I originally went  here seeking a tummy tuck.  He talked me into eye surgery instead (Still unsure now why) but showed me pictures of how it would make me look younger and that talked me out of the tummy tuck as the scare would not be worth it (I did not have huge stomach).   I went through the typically pre-op which included blood work at his recommended center. After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected.

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle.

[continued below]....
									
										.....' What does that mean? It means that Rip-off Report expects that members of our CAP program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected, the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. It means that if a customer requests a refund and if there is any reasonable basis for that request, we expect the customer will be given a prompt refund (some refund requests may not be reasonable, so this does not mean a refund is guaranteed in every case). Making things right can mean lots of different things to different people, but our point is thisby working closely with the company or individual to resolve any disputes, Ripoff Report can track the footprints of customer service to ensure that our CAP members are doing everything they can to treat customers fairly and to increase their customer satisfaction.ALL COMPANIES GET COMPLAINTS, BUT HOW THE COMPANY HANDLES THOSE COMPLAINTS, SEPARATES GOOD BUSINESSES FROM BAD BUSINESSES.Ripoff Report Verified .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..By Ripoff ReportDr. Jay Calvert, MD, PC / Roxbury Surgical Associates approached Ripoff Report with the intent of wanting to resolve any customer issues and reports posted on Rip-off Report.As a Part of the Corporate Advocacy Program the member business allows Ripoff Report to send an email to all of those who filed a complaint in the past, letting the customer know, the member business wanted to make things right with them, .. whatever it takes to do so.

No matter what the complaint may be the office will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible or come up with a solution that is agreeable between all parties.Furthermore, the office has discovered that better patient selection is key in prevention of complaints.

Our customers are the face of our business and their satisfaction is of the utmost importance. We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually improving so that their experiences with Jay Calvert, MD, PC remain strong, consistent and positive.STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM JAY CALVERT, MD AND ROXBURY SURGICAL ASSOCIATES.Theyre new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

He's bad!!! He has a very bad surgical conscience he's dirty and does care for the correct way to follow ""clean or sterile"" surgical procedure in the time I worked for him he tried to do a lipo in one room and a tummy tuck in I other room well the room that the lipo was taking place was in conjunction to the room with the tummy tuck so the door that divided the two was not closed so thats bad right there and the room where the lipo was taking place was too small so he kept contaminating the instruments being used! He was in such a hurry that he did not even do a good job the patient was HUGE! And in my opinion did not need lipo but she did need to lose weight so her money was not well spent after all is said and done dr. Sheibani left and told me to take care of the patients... First of all I'm not a nurse! So I couldn't possibly conduct any kind of post op care for both patients by myself! He does not care about the patirnts after the procedure he's a money hungry surgeon that is nice to you to get you in and then he can just care less about your results!... He hates to do touch up jobs on his patients for HIS mistakes there was a for that had 4 revidions of her implants because dr sheibani does not take his time do do a good job!... I would never get paid on time and what I was getting paid was below standards he would  be very rude hasd multiple personalities he would be very offensive and just not at all professional! ladies please do not go to this man if you want good results! He is bad! He could care less about you, you are only another money sign coming into his office!...  and if someone wants to say that I am a hater or that I wish I could go work for him again you guys are crazy!!! After I quit he has been calling me to offer me my job again I keep telling him NO! I would NEVER want to work for him EVER again he's a bad human overall and I could care less for his practice what I care for is his patients and potential patients that don't know any better I hope you read this and reconsider going with him!... I am not a disgruntled emoyee I have a great job in a very good level 2 and 3 trauma center where I get paid on time I have great benefits and where surgeons are proffesdionsl and board certified...

I am 4 months post operation. Aside from a slight difference on my back bra roll, I look the exact same and weight the exact same. No change in the way my clothes fit ever occured. They made me pay more because I had a higher BMI. The second surgery was far more torturous than the first.  The nurse told me that being four months along, my results are pretty well as good as they will get.  They told me the doctor took 9 lbs of pure fat from my body, so weighting the exact same amount now I have technically gained weight. They stated this is the reason I cannot see any results. I was lied to. [continued below]....
									
										..... My consultant said my problem areas would be permanently gone. She stated if I ever did gain weight, it would be uneven because I would not gain it in the areas I have had the procedure. Before the surgery, the doctor stated it was hard to describe exactly what i will look like. He stated I should find a picture of someone who looked similar to be on the before and after pictures on his website and that was how my results would look. Now, when at the 6 mo check up, if I am still unhappy, I have to pay half price to have them all redone again. More money, more torture, more recovery.... and will I even see results then? I wish I had voice recorded the promises made to me by the consultant and the doctor. Ten grand later, I am unhappy.  Along the way, they were so nice to be. They really specifically told me that my body would be transformed and that the excess fat on my belly wouldn't have any volume to it.

Sunrise, Florida USA ","", ,"","  I went in for a lower bleph and correction to nose that still needed to straighten and lift tip to help breathe better.  I was convinced to do an upper bleph and laser peel.  They had switched name of company, unbeknownst to me, and I researched Dr. and Straxx and saw no complaints filed.  I didn't think about reviews back then.  2008.  Dr. seemed to know exactly what I needed.  My bleph resulted in hooding and droopiness.  My lids would not even shut.  I acquired the name owl eyes and I used to have oval shaped eyes.  I had to spend more money to correct than initial surgery.  I went there, regretably, to save money.  I had to have a forhead lift and a cantherplex to lift the brows and pull up the drooping, repsectively. The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

Tampa , Florida USA ",www.drhalpern.com, 800-963-8483,"", My eye surgery was almost 4 years ago.  I originally went  here seeking a tummy tuck.  He talked me into eye surgery instead (Still unsure now why) but showed me pictures of how it would make me look younger and that talked me out of the tummy tuck as the scare would not be worth it (I did not have huge stomach).   I went through the typically pre-op which included blood work at his recommended center. After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected.

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle.

[continued below]....
									
										.....' What does that mean? It means that Rip-off Report expects that members of our CAP program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected, the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. It means that if a customer requests a refund and if there is any reasonable basis for that request, we expect the customer will be given a prompt refund (some refund requests may not be reasonable, so this does not mean a refund is guaranteed in every case). Making things right can mean lots of different things to different people, but our point is thisby working closely with the company or individual to resolve any disputes, Ripoff Report can track the footprints of customer service to ensure that our CAP members are doing everything they can to treat customers fairly and to increase their customer satisfaction.ALL COMPANIES GET COMPLAINTS, BUT HOW THE COMPANY HANDLES THOSE COMPLAINTS, SEPARATES GOOD BUSINESSES FROM BAD BUSINESSES.Ripoff Report Verified .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..By Ripoff ReportDr. Jay Calvert, MD, PC / Roxbury Surgical Associates approached Ripoff Report with the intent of wanting to resolve any customer issues and reports posted on Rip-off Report.As a Part of the Corporate Advocacy Program the member business allows Ripoff Report to send an email to all of those who filed a complaint in the past, letting the customer know, the member business wanted to make things right with them, .. whatever it takes to do so.

No matter what the complaint may be the office will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible or come up with a solution that is agreeable between all parties.Furthermore, the office has discovered that better patient selection is key in prevention of complaints.

Jay Calvert, MD, PC made efforts to ensure that all customers were satisfied and Dr. Calvert assured Ripoff Report that the business has an improved business model that features customer satisfaction as the top priority.Dr. Jay Calvert, the owner of Jay Calvert, MD PC and Roxbury Surgical Associates, stated We carefully consider all customer complaints as constructive criticism and use them as tools to improve our customer service upon. Our customers are the face of our business and their satisfaction is of the utmost importance. We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually improving so that their experiences with Jay Calvert, MD, PC remain strong, consistent and positive.STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM JAY CALVERT, MD AND ROXBURY SURGICAL ASSOCIATES.Theyre new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

He's bad!!! He has a very bad surgical conscience he's dirty and does care for the correct way to follow ""clean or sterile"" surgical procedure in the time I worked for him he tried to do a lipo in one room and a tummy tuck in I other room well the room that the lipo was taking place was in conjunction to the room with the tummy tuck so the door that divided the two was not closed so thats bad right there and the room where the lipo was taking place was too small so he kept contaminating the instruments being used! He was in such a hurry that he did not even do a good job the patient was HUGE! And in my opinion did not need lipo but she did need to lose weight so her money was not well spent after all is said and done dr. Sheibani left and told me to take care of the patients... First of all I'm not a nurse! So I couldn't possibly conduct any kind of post op care for both patients by myself! He does not care about the patirnts after the procedure he's a money hungry surgeon that is nice to you to get you in and then he can just care less about your results!... He hates to do touch up jobs on his patients for HIS mistakes there was a for that had 4 revidions of her implants because dr sheibani does not take his time do do a good job!... I would never get paid on time and what I was getting paid was below standards he would  be very rude hasd multiple personalities he would be very offensive and just not at all professional! ladies please do not go to this man if you want good results! He is bad! He could care less about you, you are only another money sign coming into his office!...  and if someone wants to say that I am a hater or that I wish I could go work for him again you guys are crazy!!! After I quit he has been calling me to offer me my job again I keep telling him NO! I would NEVER want to work for him EVER again he's a bad human overall and I could care less for his practice what I care for is his patients and potential patients that don't know any better I hope you read this and reconsider going with him!... I am not a disgruntled emoyee I have a great job in a very good level 2 and 3 trauma center where I get paid on time I have great benefits and where surgeons are proffesdionsl and board certified...

I am 4 months post operation. Aside from a slight difference on my back bra roll, I look the exact same and weight the exact same. No change in the way my clothes fit ever occured. They made me pay more because I had a higher BMI. The second surgery was far more torturous than the first.  The nurse told me that being four months along, my results are pretty well as good as they will get.  They told me the doctor took 9 lbs of pure fat from my body, so weighting the exact same amount now I have technically gained weight. They stated this is the reason I cannot see any results. I was lied to. [continued below]....
									
										..... My consultant said my problem areas would be permanently gone. She stated if I ever did gain weight, it would be uneven because I would not gain it in the areas I have had the procedure. Before the surgery, the doctor stated it was hard to describe exactly what i will look like. He stated I should find a picture of someone who looked similar to be on the before and after pictures on his website and that was how my results would look. Now, when at the 6 mo check up, if I am still unhappy, I have to pay half price to have them all redone again. More money, more torture, more recovery.... and will I even see results then? I wish I had voice recorded the promises made to me by the consultant and the doctor. Ten grand later, I am unhappy.  Along the way, they were so nice to be. They really specifically told me that my body would be transformed and that the excess fat on my belly wouldn't have any volume to it.

 Straxx ,"  Straxx  12510 NW 10th St 
Sunrise, Florida USA ","", ,"","  I went in for a lower bleph and correction to nose that still needed to straighten and lift tip to help breathe better.  I was convinced to do an upper bleph and laser peel.  They had switched name of company, unbeknownst to me, and I researched Dr. and Straxx and saw no complaints filed.  I didn't think about reviews back then.  2008.  Dr. seemed to know exactly what I needed.  My bleph resulted in hooding and droopiness.  My lids would not even shut.  I acquired the name owl eyes and I used to have oval shaped eyes.  I had to spend more money to correct than initial surgery.  I went there, regretably, to save money.  I had to have a forhead lift and a cantherplex to lift the brows and pull up the drooping, repsectively. The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

Tampa , Florida USA ",www.drhalpern.com, 800-963-8483,"", My eye surgery was almost 4 years ago.  I originally went  here seeking a tummy tuck.  He talked me into eye surgery instead (Still unsure now why) but showed me pictures of how it would make me look younger and that talked me out of the tummy tuck as the scare would not be worth it (I did not have huge stomach).   I went through the typically pre-op which included blood work at his recommended center. After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected.

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle.

										.....' What does that mean? It means that Rip-off Report expects that members of our CAP program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected, the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. It means that if a customer requests a refund and if there is any reasonable basis for that request, we expect the customer will be given a prompt refund (some refund requests may not be reasonable, so this does not mean a refund is guaranteed in every case). Making things right can mean lots of different things to different people, but our point is thisby working closely with the company or individual to resolve any disputes, Ripoff Report can track the footprints of customer service to ensure that our CAP members are doing everything they can to treat customers fairly and to increase their customer satisfaction.ALL COMPANIES GET COMPLAINTS, BUT HOW THE COMPANY HANDLES THOSE COMPLAINTS, SEPARATES GOOD BUSINESSES FROM BAD BUSINESSES.Ripoff Report Verified .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..By Ripoff ReportDr. Jay Calvert, MD, PC / Roxbury Surgical Associates approached Ripoff Report with the intent of wanting to resolve any customer issues and reports posted on Rip-off Report.As a Part of the Corporate Advocacy Program the member business allows Ripoff Report to send an email to all of those who filed a complaint in the past, letting the customer know, the member business wanted to make things right with them, .. whatever it takes to do so.

No matter what the complaint may be the office will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible or come up with a solution that is agreeable between all parties.Furthermore, the office has discovered that better patient selection is key in prevention of complaints.

Jay Calvert, MD, PC made efforts to ensure that all customers were satisfied and Dr. Calvert assured Ripoff Report that the business has an improved business model that features customer satisfaction as the top priority.Dr. Jay Calvert, the owner of Jay Calvert, MD PC and Roxbury Surgical Associates, stated We carefully consider all customer complaints as constructive criticism and use them as tools to improve our customer service upon. Our customers are the face of our business and their satisfaction is of the utmost importance. We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually improving so that their experiences with Jay Calvert, MD, PC remain strong, consistent and positive.STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM JAY CALVERT, MD AND ROXBURY SURGICAL ASSOCIATES.Theyre new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

He's bad!!! He has a very bad surgical conscience he's dirty and does care for the correct way to follow ""clean or sterile"" surgical procedure in the time I worked for him he tried to do a lipo in one room and a tummy tuck in I other room well the room that the lipo was taking place was in conjunction to the room with the tummy tuck so the door that divided the two was not closed so thats bad right there and the room where the lipo was taking place was too small so he kept contaminating the instruments being used! He was in such a hurry that he did not even do a good job the patient was HUGE! And in my opinion did not need lipo but she did need to lose weight so her money was not well spent after all is said and done dr. Sheibani left and told me to take care of the patients... First of all I'm not a nurse! So I couldn't possibly conduct any kind of post op care for both patients by myself! He does not care about the patirnts after the procedure he's a money hungry surgeon that is nice to you to get you in and then he can just care less about your results!... He hates to do touch up jobs on his patients for HIS mistakes there was a for that had 4 revidions of her implants because dr sheibani does not take his time do do a good job!... I would never get paid on time and what I was getting paid was below standards he would  be very rude hasd multiple personalities he would be very offensive and just not at all professional! ladies please do not go to this man if you want good results! He is bad! He could care less about you, you are only another money sign coming into his office!...  and if someone wants to say that I am a hater or that I wish I could go work for him again you guys are crazy!!! After I quit he has been calling me to offer me my job again I keep telling him NO! I would NEVER want to work for him EVER again he's a bad human overall and I could care less for his practice what I care for is his patients and potential patients that don't know any better I hope you read this and reconsider going with him!... I am not a disgruntled emoyee I have a great job in a very good level 2 and 3 trauma center where I get paid on time I have great benefits and where surgeons are proffesdionsl and board certified...

I am 4 months post operation. Aside from a slight difference on my back bra roll, I look the exact same and weight the exact same. No change in the way my clothes fit ever occured. They made me pay more because I had a higher BMI. The second surgery was far more torturous than the first.  The nurse told me that being four months along, my results are pretty well as good as they will get.  They told me the doctor took 9 lbs of pure fat from my body, so weighting the exact same amount now I have technically gained weight. They stated this is the reason I cannot see any results. I was lied to. [continued below]....
									
										..... My consultant said my problem areas would be permanently gone. She stated if I ever did gain weight, it would be uneven because I would not gain it in the areas I have had the procedure. Before the surgery, the doctor stated it was hard to describe exactly what i will look like. He stated I should find a picture of someone who looked similar to be on the before and after pictures on his website and that was how my results would look. Now, when at the 6 mo check up, if I am still unhappy, I have to pay half price to have them all redone again. More money, more torture, more recovery.... and will I even see results then? I wish I had voice recorded the promises made to me by the consultant and the doctor. Ten grand later, I am unhappy.  Along the way, they were so nice to be. They really specifically told me that my body would be transformed and that the excess fat on my belly wouldn't have any volume to it.

 Straxx ,"  Straxx  12510 NW 10th St 
Sunrise, Florida USA ","", ,"","  I went in for a lower bleph and correction to nose that still needed to straighten and lift tip to help breathe better.  I was convinced to do an upper bleph and laser peel.  They had switched name of company, unbeknownst to me, and I researched Dr. and Straxx and saw no complaints filed.  I didn't think about reviews back then.  2008.  Dr. seemed to know exactly what I needed.  My bleph resulted in hooding and droopiness.  My lids would not even shut.  I acquired the name owl eyes and I used to have oval shaped eyes.  I had to spend more money to correct than initial surgery.  I went there, regretably, to save money.  I had to have a forhead lift and a cantherplex to lift the brows and pull up the drooping, repsectively. The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

Tampa , Florida USA ",www.drhalpern.com, 800-963-8483,"", My eye surgery was almost 4 years ago.  I originally went  here seeking a tummy tuck.  He talked me into eye surgery instead (Still unsure now why) but showed me pictures of how it would make me look younger and that talked me out of the tummy tuck as the scare would not be worth it (I did not have huge stomach).   I went through the typically pre-op which included blood work at his recommended center. After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected.

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle.

										.....' What does that mean? It means that Rip-off Report expects that members of our CAP program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected, the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. It means that if a customer requests a refund and if there is any reasonable basis for that request, we expect the customer will be given a prompt refund (some refund requests may not be reasonable, so this does not mean a refund is guaranteed in every case).

Ripoff Report always monitors these emails to insure the member business does what they agreed to. The people at Jay Calvert, MD, Professional Corporation did just that.Jay Calvert, MD, PC and Roxbury Surgical Associates has gone through great lengths to make sure they try and resolve any and all customer issues.

No matter what the complaint may be the office will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible or come up with a solution that is agreeable between all parties.Furthermore, the office has discovered that better patient selection is key in prevention of complaints.

Jay Calvert, MD, PC made efforts to ensure that all customers were satisfied and Dr. Calvert assured Ripoff Report that the business has an improved business model that features customer satisfaction as the top priority.Dr. Jay Calvert, the owner of Jay Calvert, MD PC and Roxbury Surgical Associates, stated We carefully consider all customer complaints as constructive criticism and use them as tools to improve our customer service upon. Our customers are the face of our business and their satisfaction is of the utmost importance. We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually improving so that their experiences with Jay Calvert, MD, PC remain strong, consistent and positive.STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM JAY CALVERT, MD AND ROXBURY SURGICAL ASSOCIATES.Theyre new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

He's bad!!! He has a very bad surgical conscience he's dirty and does care for the correct way to follow ""clean or sterile"" surgical procedure in the time I worked for him he tried to do a lipo in one room and a tummy tuck in I other room well the room that the lipo was taking place was in conjunction to the room with the tummy tuck so the door that divided the two was not closed so thats bad right there and the room where the lipo was taking place was too small so he kept contaminating the instruments being used! He was in such a hurry that he did not even do a good job the patient was HUGE! And in my opinion did not need lipo but she did need to lose weight so her money was not well spent after all is said and done dr. Sheibani left and told me to take care of the patients... First of all I'm not a nurse! So I couldn't possibly conduct any kind of post op care for both patients by myself! He does not care about the patirnts after the procedure he's a money hungry surgeon that is nice to you to get you in and then he can just care less about your results!... He hates to do touch up jobs on his patients for HIS mistakes there was a for that had 4 revidions of her implants because dr sheibani does not take his time do do a good job!... I would never get paid on time and what I was getting paid was below standards he would  be very rude hasd multiple personalities he would be very offensive and just not at all professional! ladies please do not go to this man if you want good results! He is bad! He could care less about you, you are only another money sign coming into his office!...  and if someone wants to say that I am a hater or that I wish I could go work for him again you guys are crazy!!! After I quit he has been calling me to offer me my job again I keep telling him NO! I would NEVER want to work for him EVER again he's a bad human overall and I could care less for his practice what I care for is his patients and potential patients that don't know any better I hope you read this and reconsider going with him!... I am not a disgruntled emoyee I have a great job in a very good level 2 and 3 trauma center where I get paid on time I have great benefits and where surgeons are proffesdionsl and board certified... To everyone considering sheinani I can only advice you to go elsewhere this man is a butcher not a surgeon!... ",  Plastic Surgeons

I am 4 months post operation. Aside from a slight difference on my back bra roll, I look the exact same and weight the exact same. No change in the way my clothes fit ever occured. They made me pay more because I had a higher BMI. The second surgery was far more torturous than the first.  The nurse told me that being four months along, my results are pretty well as good as they will get.  They told me the doctor took 9 lbs of pure fat from my body, so weighting the exact same amount now I have technically gained weight. They stated this is the reason I cannot see any results. I was lied to. [continued below]....
									
										..... My consultant said my problem areas would be permanently gone. She stated if I ever did gain weight, it would be uneven because I would not gain it in the areas I have had the procedure. Before the surgery, the doctor stated it was hard to describe exactly what i will look like. He stated I should find a picture of someone who looked similar to be on the before and after pictures on his website and that was how my results would look. Now, when at the 6 mo check up, if I am still unhappy, I have to pay half price to have them all redone again. More money, more torture, more recovery.... and will I even see results then? I wish I had voice recorded the promises made to me by the consultant and the doctor. Ten grand later, I am unhappy.  Along the way, they were so nice to be. They really specifically told me that my body would be transformed and that the excess fat on my belly wouldn't have any volume to it.

 Straxx ,"  Straxx  12510 NW 10th St 
Sunrise, Florida USA ","", ,"","  I went in for a lower bleph and correction to nose that still needed to straighten and lift tip to help breathe better.  I was convinced to do an upper bleph and laser peel.  They had switched name of company, unbeknownst to me, and I researched Dr. and Straxx and saw no complaints filed.  I didn't think about reviews back then.  2008.  Dr. seemed to know exactly what I needed.  My bleph resulted in hooding and droopiness.  My lids would not even shut.  I acquired the name owl eyes and I used to have oval shaped eyes.  I had to spend more money to correct than initial surgery.  I went there, regretably, to save money.  I had to have a forhead lift and a cantherplex to lift the brows and pull up the drooping, repsectively. The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

Tampa , Florida USA ",www.drhalpern.com, 800-963-8483,"", My eye surgery was almost 4 years ago.  I originally went  here seeking a tummy tuck.  He talked me into eye surgery instead (Still unsure now why) but showed me pictures of how it would make me look younger and that talked me out of the tummy tuck as the scare would not be worth it (I did not have huge stomach).   I went through the typically pre-op which included blood work at his recommended center. After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

Boca Raton, Florida USA ","", ,""," Nu-Look Cosmetic Plastic Surgery is a company that purchased their client list from Strax Rejuvenation.  This company has nothing to do with Strax Rejuvenation.  However, when the client comes into their waiting room, they are greeted with the exact same set-up that Strax utilizes at their offices in Lauderhill, Florida. For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected.

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle.

Our customers are the face of our business and their satisfaction is of the utmost importance. We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually improving so that their experiences with Jay Calvert, MD, PC remain strong, consistent and positive.STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM JAY CALVERT, MD AND ROXBURY SURGICAL ASSOCIATES.Theyre new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

He's bad!!! He has a very bad surgical conscience he's dirty and does care for the correct way to follow ""clean or sterile"" surgical procedure in the time I worked for him he tried to do a lipo in one room and a tummy tuck in I other room well the room that the lipo was taking place was in conjunction to the room with the tummy tuck so the door that divided the two was not closed so thats bad right there and the room where the lipo was taking place was too small so he kept contaminating the instruments being used! He was in such a hurry that he did not even do a good job the patient was HUGE! And in my opinion did not need lipo but she did need to lose weight so her money was not well spent after all is said and done dr. Sheibani left and told me to take care of the patients... First of all I'm not a nurse! So I couldn't possibly conduct any kind of post op care for both patients by myself! He does not care about the patirnts after the procedure he's a money hungry surgeon that is nice to you to get you in and then he can just care less about your results!... He hates to do touch up jobs on his patients for HIS mistakes there was a for that had 4 revidions of her implants because dr sheibani does not take his time do do a good job!... I would never get paid on time and what I was getting paid was below standards he would  be very rude hasd multiple personalities he would be very offensive and just not at all professional! ladies please do not go to this man if you want good results! He is bad! He could care less about you, you are only another money sign coming into his office!...  and if someone wants to say that I am a hater or that I wish I could go work for him again you guys are crazy!!! After I quit he has been calling me to offer me my job again I keep telling him NO! I would NEVER want to work for him EVER again he's a bad human overall and I could care less for his practice what I care for is his patients and potential patients that don't know any better I hope you read this and reconsider going with him!... I am not a disgruntled emoyee I have a great job in a very good level 2 and 3 trauma center where I get paid on time I have great benefits and where surgeons are proffesdionsl and board certified...

I am 4 months post operation. Aside from a slight difference on my back bra roll, I look the exact same and weight the exact same. No change in the way my clothes fit ever occured. They made me pay more because I had a higher BMI. The second surgery was far more torturous than the first.  The nurse told me that being four months along, my results are pretty well as good as they will get.  They told me the doctor took 9 lbs of pure fat from my body, so weighting the exact same amount now I have technically gained weight. They stated this is the reason I cannot see any results. I was lied to. [continued below]....
									
										..... My consultant said my problem areas would be permanently gone. She stated if I ever did gain weight, it would be uneven because I would not gain it in the areas I have had the procedure. Before the surgery, the doctor stated it was hard to describe exactly what i will look like. He stated I should find a picture of someone who looked similar to be on the before and after pictures on his website and that was how my results would look. Now, when at the 6 mo check up, if I am still unhappy, I have to pay half price to have them all redone again. More money, more torture, more recovery.... and will I even see results then? I wish I had voice recorded the promises made to me by the consultant and the doctor. Ten grand later, I am unhappy.  Along the way, they were so nice to be. They really specifically told me that my body would be transformed and that the excess fat on my belly wouldn't have any volume to it.

Sunrise, Florida USA ","", ,"","  I went in for a lower bleph and correction to nose that still needed to straighten and lift tip to help breathe better.  I was convinced to do an upper bleph and laser peel.  They had switched name of company, unbeknownst to me, and I researched Dr. and Straxx and saw no complaints filed.  I didn't think about reviews back then.  2008.  Dr. seemed to know exactly what I needed.  My bleph resulted in hooding and droopiness.  My lids would not even shut.  I acquired the name owl eyes and I used to have oval shaped eyes.  I had to spend more money to correct than initial surgery.  I went there, regretably, to save money.  I had to have a forhead lift and a cantherplex to lift the brows and pull up the drooping, repsectively. The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

Tampa , Florida USA ",www.drhalpern.com, 800-963-8483,"", My eye surgery was almost 4 years ago.  I originally went  here seeking a tummy tuck.  He talked me into eye surgery instead (Still unsure now why) but showed me pictures of how it would make me look younger and that talked me out of the tummy tuck as the scare would not be worth it (I did not have huge stomach).   I went through the typically pre-op which included blood work at his recommended center. After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected.

I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle.

We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!!

The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left.

I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

Tampa , Florida USA ",www.drhalpern.com, 800-963-8483,"", My eye surgery was almost 4 years ago.  I originally went  here seeking a tummy tuck.  He talked me into eye surgery instead (Still unsure now why) but showed me pictures of how it would make me look younger and that talked me out of the tummy tuck as the scare would not be worth it (I did not have huge stomach).   I went through the typically pre-op which included blood work at his recommended center. After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected.

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle.

The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

Tampa , Florida USA ",www.drhalpern.com, 800-963-8483,"", My eye surgery was almost 4 years ago.  I originally went  here seeking a tummy tuck.  He talked me into eye surgery instead (Still unsure now why) but showed me pictures of how it would make me look younger and that talked me out of the tummy tuck as the scare would not be worth it (I did not have huge stomach).   I went through the typically pre-op which included blood work at his recommended center. After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

Boca Raton, Florida USA ","", ,""," Nu-Look Cosmetic Plastic Surgery is a company that purchased their client list from Strax Rejuvenation.  This company has nothing to do with Strax Rejuvenation.  However, when the client comes into their waiting room, they are greeted with the exact same set-up that Strax utilizes at their offices in Lauderhill, Florida. For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected. Doctors should be the only individuals who can work on patients. ",  Plastic Surgeons

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle. The Colorado Springs public needs to know not to give their skin, their appearance, over to Dr. Anderson. He just might ruin you.  ",  Plastic Surgeons

[continued below]....
									
										.....' What does that mean? It means that Rip-off Report expects that members of our CAP program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected, the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. It means that if a customer requests a refund and if there is any reasonable basis for that request, we expect the customer will be given a prompt refund (some refund requests may not be reasonable, so this does not mean a refund is guaranteed in every case). Making things right can mean lots of different things to different people, but our point is thisby working closely with the company or individual to resolve any disputes, Ripoff Report can track the footprints of customer service to ensure that our CAP members are doing everything they can to treat customers fairly and to increase their customer satisfaction.ALL COMPANIES GET COMPLAINTS, BUT HOW THE COMPANY HANDLES THOSE COMPLAINTS, SEPARATES GOOD BUSINESSES FROM BAD BUSINESSES.Ripoff Report Verified .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..By Ripoff ReportDr. Jay Calvert, MD, PC / Roxbury Surgical Associates approached Ripoff Report with the intent of wanting to resolve any customer issues and reports posted on Rip-off Report.As a Part of the Corporate Advocacy Program the member business allows Ripoff Report to send an email to all of those who filed a complaint in the past, letting the customer know, the member business wanted to make things right with them, .. whatever it takes to do so.

No matter what the complaint may be the office will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible or come up with a solution that is agreeable between all parties.Furthermore, the office has discovered that better patient selection is key in prevention of complaints.

Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

Tampa , Florida USA ",www.drhalpern.com, 800-963-8483,"", My eye surgery was almost 4 years ago.  I originally went  here seeking a tummy tuck.  He talked me into eye surgery instead (Still unsure now why) but showed me pictures of how it would make me look younger and that talked me out of the tummy tuck as the scare would not be worth it (I did not have huge stomach).   I went through the typically pre-op which included blood work at his recommended center. After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

Boca Raton, Florida USA ","", ,""," Nu-Look Cosmetic Plastic Surgery is a company that purchased their client list from Strax Rejuvenation.  This company has nothing to do with Strax Rejuvenation.  However, when the client comes into their waiting room, they are greeted with the exact same set-up that Strax utilizes at their offices in Lauderhill, Florida. For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected. Doctors should be the only individuals who can work on patients. ",  Plastic Surgeons

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle. The Colorado Springs public needs to know not to give their skin, their appearance, over to Dr. Anderson. He just might ruin you.  ",  Plastic Surgeons

[continued below]....
									
										.....' What does that mean? It means that Rip-off Report expects that members of our CAP program will review and respond to ALL customer complaints promptly. It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect. It means if a customer did not receive what they expected, the company will work with that customer to fix the issue. It means that if a customer requests a refund and if there is any reasonable basis for that request, we expect the customer will be given a prompt refund (some refund requests may not be reasonable, so this does not mean a refund is guaranteed in every case). Making things right can mean lots of different things to different people, but our point is thisby working closely with the company or individual to resolve any disputes, Ripoff Report can track the footprints of customer service to ensure that our CAP members are doing everything they can to treat customers fairly and to increase their customer satisfaction.ALL COMPANIES GET COMPLAINTS, BUT HOW THE COMPANY HANDLES THOSE COMPLAINTS, SEPARATES GOOD BUSINESSES FROM BAD BUSINESSES.Ripoff Report Verified .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..By Ripoff ReportDr. Jay Calvert, MD, PC / Roxbury Surgical Associates approached Ripoff Report with the intent of wanting to resolve any customer issues and reports posted on Rip-off Report.As a Part of the Corporate Advocacy Program the member business allows Ripoff Report to send an email to all of those who filed a complaint in the past, letting the customer know, the member business wanted to make things right with them, .. whatever it takes to do so.

No matter what the complaint may be the office will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible or come up with a solution that is agreeable between all parties.Furthermore, the office has discovered that better patient selection is key in prevention of complaints.

We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually improving so that their experiences with Jay Calvert, MD, PC remain strong, consistent and positive.STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM JAY CALVERT, MD AND ROXBURY SURGICAL ASSOCIATES.Theyre new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands.

Tampa , Florida USA ",www.drhalpern.com, 800-963-8483,"", My eye surgery was almost 4 years ago.  I originally went  here seeking a tummy tuck.  He talked me into eye surgery instead (Still unsure now why) but showed me pictures of how it would make me look younger and that talked me out of the tummy tuck as the scare would not be worth it (I did not have huge stomach).   I went through the typically pre-op which included blood work at his recommended center. After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

Boca Raton, Florida USA ","", ,""," Nu-Look Cosmetic Plastic Surgery is a company that purchased their client list from Strax Rejuvenation.  This company has nothing to do with Strax Rejuvenation.  However, when the client comes into their waiting room, they are greeted with the exact same set-up that Strax utilizes at their offices in Lauderhill, Florida. For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected. Doctors should be the only individuals who can work on patients. ",  Plastic Surgeons

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle. The Colorado Springs public needs to know not to give their skin, their appearance, over to Dr. Anderson. He just might ruin you.  ",  Plastic Surgeons

It means that every complaint will be taken seriously and every customer will be treated fairly and with respect.

Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

Boca Raton, Florida USA ","", ,""," Nu-Look Cosmetic Plastic Surgery is a company that purchased their client list from Strax Rejuvenation.  This company has nothing to do with Strax Rejuvenation.  However, when the client comes into their waiting room, they are greeted with the exact same set-up that Strax utilizes at their offices in Lauderhill, Florida. For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected. Doctors should be the only individuals who can work on patients. ",  Plastic Surgeons

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle. The Colorado Springs public needs to know not to give their skin, their appearance, over to Dr. Anderson. He just might ruin you.  ",  Plastic Surgeons

Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

Boca Raton, Florida USA ","", ,""," Nu-Look Cosmetic Plastic Surgery is a company that purchased their client list from Strax Rejuvenation.  This company has nothing to do with Strax Rejuvenation.  However, when the client comes into their waiting room, they are greeted with the exact same set-up that Strax utilizes at their offices in Lauderhill, Florida. For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected. Doctors should be the only individuals who can work on patients. ",  Plastic Surgeons

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle. The Colorado Springs public needs to know not to give their skin, their appearance, over to Dr. Anderson. He just might ruin you.  ",  Plastic Surgeons

Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

Boca Raton, Florida USA ","", ,""," Nu-Look Cosmetic Plastic Surgery is a company that purchased their client list from Strax Rejuvenation.  This company has nothing to do with Strax Rejuvenation.  However, when the client comes into their waiting room, they are greeted with the exact same set-up that Strax utilizes at their offices in Lauderhill, Florida. For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected. Doctors should be the only individuals who can work on patients. ",  Plastic Surgeons

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle. The Colorado Springs public needs to know not to give their skin, their appearance, over to Dr. Anderson. He just might ruin you.  ",  Plastic Surgeons

Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

Boca Raton, Florida USA ","", ,""," Nu-Look Cosmetic Plastic Surgery is a company that purchased their client list from Strax Rejuvenation.  This company has nothing to do with Strax Rejuvenation.  However, when the client comes into their waiting room, they are greeted with the exact same set-up that Strax utilizes at their offices in Lauderhill, Florida. For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected. Doctors should be the only individuals who can work on patients. ",  Plastic Surgeons

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle. The Colorado Springs public needs to know not to give their skin, their appearance, over to Dr. Anderson. He just might ruin you.  ",  Plastic Surgeons

Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

Boca Raton, Florida USA ","", ,""," Nu-Look Cosmetic Plastic Surgery is a company that purchased their client list from Strax Rejuvenation.  This company has nothing to do with Strax Rejuvenation.  However, when the client comes into their waiting room, they are greeted with the exact same set-up that Strax utilizes at their offices in Lauderhill, Florida. For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected. Doctors should be the only individuals who can work on patients. ",  Plastic Surgeons

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle. The Colorado Springs public needs to know not to give their skin, their appearance, over to Dr. Anderson. He just might ruin you.  ",  Plastic Surgeons

Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

Boca Raton, Florida USA ","", ,""," Nu-Look Cosmetic Plastic Surgery is a company that purchased their client list from Strax Rejuvenation.  This company has nothing to do with Strax Rejuvenation.  However, when the client comes into their waiting room, they are greeted with the exact same set-up that Strax utilizes at their offices in Lauderhill, Florida. For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected. Doctors should be the only individuals who can work on patients. ",  Plastic Surgeons

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle. The Colorado Springs public needs to know not to give their skin, their appearance, over to Dr. Anderson. He just might ruin you.  ",  Plastic Surgeons

Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

Boca Raton, Florida USA ","", ,""," Nu-Look Cosmetic Plastic Surgery is a company that purchased their client list from Strax Rejuvenation.  This company has nothing to do with Strax Rejuvenation.  However, when the client comes into their waiting room, they are greeted with the exact same set-up that Strax utilizes at their offices in Lauderhill, Florida. For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected. Doctors should be the only individuals who can work on patients. ",  Plastic Surgeons

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle. The Colorado Springs public needs to know not to give their skin, their appearance, over to Dr. Anderson. He just might ruin you.  ",  Plastic Surgeons

Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons

Boca Raton, Florida USA ","", ,""," Nu-Look Cosmetic Plastic Surgery is a company that purchased their client list from Strax Rejuvenation.  This company has nothing to do with Strax Rejuvenation.  However, when the client comes into their waiting room, they are greeted with the exact same set-up that Strax utilizes at their offices in Lauderhill, Florida. For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected. Doctors should be the only individuals who can work on patients. ",  Plastic Surgeons

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle. The Colorado Springs public needs to know not to give their skin, their appearance, over to Dr. Anderson. He just might ruin you.  ",  Plastic Surgeons

Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...

The nose was incomplet with no tip as admitted by the Director.  it just fell off and now my nose droops.  Defeated the purpose to try and breathe better.  My nose is bulbous now.  I think I breathe worse now in fact. The Director told me they could lengthen the nose, pulling forward so it doesn't droop.  They wanted to do a face lift at a discount to make up for the blotched surgery.  My initial Dr, an oriental doctor, supposedly the best at blepherplasts, of course blamed my eyes and placement of brows.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I wouldn't let them touch me.  I wanted my money back. After a bleph, they're supposed to smooth out the crappiness that occurs after removing the ""bagss"" (or fat).  My doctor said not to do because it would cause more droopiness.  So now I have this nasty crapiness, evident when I smile that I NEVER had.  I barely have wrinkles now and back then I didn't have a wrinkle issue at all!  It was I went to doctors I consulted with and others to fix my eyes which was the most important and most severe of the two blotched up procedures.  Saying blotched but that is a HUGE understatment.  The correct word begins wth an F and ends with a KED!! NO doctor wanted to touch me!!  One said, who only did eyes, that my eyes were a surgeons dream, simple.  However, I wanted the nose done too and he didn't do that.  I wish I had somebody tell me NOT to go to Straxx.  I guess I was naieve.  I did my homework and was proud that I did and felt I was in good hands. The day of my surgery, the Doctor was taking forever, supposedly in a surgery prior to mine.  My appointment was only the 2nd one scheduled.  I wish I had left. I wouldn't go out for a year till I could afford to do the forehead lift.  I was so depressed and still am over it.  I'm angry and insecure as well for both by nose and eyes.  I will not go without eyeliner for a second.  I need it to give the appearance of a lengthened, more almond shaped eye.  I'm going to look into a permanent eye makeup for the eyeliner. I looked into suing but knowing it's elective, I didn't think I would be able to.  I didn't have money to pursue at the time and I was very busy trying to work, single mom. Now I hear of more and more complaints and I want to do a class action suit.  My pain and suffering and the extra costs to fix should not come out of my pocket.  The loss of work for the forehead lift, all this adds up.  It's not just the extra cost of correction.      I   ",  Plastic Surgeons

After surgery it was strange as he had flowers waiting for me and was so strange about making sure we took them home.  I was out of it but my husband had to get me to the car and these stupid flowers.  This is irrelevant but I have read lots of people mention this about him - I think it shows he is a bit excentric and unconcentrated on his main priority - surgery.   The follow up and down time from this surgery was horrible - over three weeks - so painful.  He and the staff (one woman who said she had it done on a Friday and was back to work on Tuesday) never ever portrayed the eyelift surgery as being this major.  I was cut inside my mouth with stitches everywhere (he never ever mentioned this either)  I looked like I had a a full facelift.  I feel even more so today he changed the shape of my eyes and my face is a little saggy.  I was only 42 when I had this done.   The worst news is yet to come - to my shock I found out I was pregnant which means the blood work I had given was not properly assessed.  I had no idea and had not been trying to have a child (Obviously 42) - but I was positively pregnant when I gave the bloodwork and had the surgery.   This meant all the pain killers I took after the surgery could have affected my baby.  That baby is now 3 and all is well.     I had heard he was a great plastic surgeon and from friends heard of success stories with breast implants. I would not recommend him to anyone.      ,  Plastic Surgeons 
 Nu-Look Cosmetic Plastic Surgery ,"  Nu-Look Cosmetic Plastic Surgery  899 Meadows Road, Suite 203 
Boca Raton, Florida USA ","", ,""," Nu-Look Cosmetic Plastic Surgery is a company that purchased their client list from Strax Rejuvenation.  This company has nothing to do with Strax Rejuvenation.  However, when the client comes into their waiting room, they are greeted with the exact same set-up that Strax utilizes at their offices in Lauderhill, Florida. For me, the work done at Strax is excellent.  Their doctors stand by whatever promises are made. I originally spoke with Nu-Look's office employee who scheduled me for a procedure called ""Wrinkle Filler"". It was and is a simple procedure.  They quoted me a price of $389.00 which uses the product Juverderm.  I had an appointment scheduled for Monday, 2/3/14 at 10:30 am.  When I arrived there, I went into the examining room and learned that there would not be a physician working on me but a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Anna. Regardless of what was promised to me by the Office Scheduler, Anna told me that she would not give me the procedure unless she could do more work on my ENTIRE FACE for double the amount of money originally stated. This did not make any sense.  I had this procedure performed before (not at this facility) and no doctor ever said that they couldn't do this procedure without building up the bill. Anna refused to provide me with any credible explanation.  I didn't know if she was even licensed to do what she claimed she could do.  Unfortunately, there was no one in the office who could offer me a logical explanation of this entire fiasco. The original price quoted me was $389 which went up to $800.  The filler originally promised was called JUVERDERM which Anna said she would not use.  She could only use RADISSE. Although I was irate, I kept my temper intact and walked out of the office like a lady.  Obviously, I will NEVER return to this facility.  If I need any work done, I will drive the extra miles and go to an office called STRAX REJUVENATION in Lauderhill, Florida 33311.   There should be some kind of monitoring organization for companies such as this.  Clients must be protected. Doctors should be the only individuals who can work on patients. ",  Plastic Surgeons

Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.coloradodermatologyinstitute.com, 719.359.9669 ,""," In September of 2012 I was scheduled to have a skin cancer biopsy done on my cheek after my families urgency to resolve the question, ""Does she have skin cancer?"". I was apprehensive but I researched online and thought, from all of the medical articles I read, that this procedure would result in a possible small scar and healing time of 6-12 months. I understood that; I did not go into this appointment thinking that I was going to walk away perfect.  Dr. Anderson decided to biopsy the predetermined mole but also wanted to do one more small bump where my dimple was. Big mistake. First, he went too deep with the shave biopsy. You could fit a small marble in my face. I immediately got depressed but was willing to deal with the shock of such a large scar as long as it healed well. I thought he knew what he was doing, he was nice after all.  It will be two years now and the scar is horrendous. It is still red, angry, raised all around the edges, and massively indented in the center. It basically looks like a volcano that has erupted. On my cheek, for the world to speculate about. Now, I am not saying that I expected it to turn out great or completely normal again. However, Dr. Anderson did not perform the procedure correctly by going extremely deep, nor did he advise me of what to expect.  I would give anything besides my soul to go back to that day so I could avoid Dr. Anderson's office. There is no big fix. My personal life suffers, my intimate life suffers, my public life is near non-existent, and my self-esteem is nearing the bottom of the bottle. The Colorado Springs public needs to know not to give their skin, their appearance, over to Dr. Anderson. He just might ruin you.  ",  Plastic Surgeons

I was never advised about any extra possible costs, and after the surgery I was told that I was a text book case and everything went as planned. A few weeks later I received a bill for an additional $1,920.40 for ""unplanned"" surgical costs. I contacted the office and Soraya told me that this will all be taken care and ""don't worry hun"". Another month later I received another bill from the surgical facility for the same amount. I spoke with Soraya again and she advised md again that this will be taken care of and that this is not the first time this happened and that there was a specific ""person"" Dr. Greene speaks with at the facility that takes care of this for them. I asked for the persons name and she said well you know its.....I said fine whatever just let me know when it has been resolved..... I never heard back from the office. Today 1/11/14 I received a third and final letter telling me if I don't pay this bill I will be sent to collections.

I was called by ""Dawn"" and was told they did not want to provide me service any longer. I paid $500 to have some bumps removed on my face. I was told at that time it might take two sessions. Once for the initial treatment, the second to treat the original areas a second time, and to remove additional bumps. I was never given the opportunity to have my follow up appointment, so basically I was ripped off $500.   Hipaa violation: My fiance' was also a patient of this medical facility and had a medical appointment pending. He was also phoned by ""Dawn"" on December 5th, 2013 and told they would no longer accept him as a patient since he was affiliated with me. She discussed with him private and sensitive medical and personal information about me and my history as a patient. This extremely upset him and myself. I feel this violated the Hipaa security rule.   Civil rights: I was a patient of this office and was denied service after I had already been seen as a patient for many years without incident. I was called by ""Dawn"" and was told they did not want to provide me service any longer. I believe that ""Dawn"" had a personal issue with me based on my race as a Native American. When I was last seen in August 2013 by this medical facility I updated my record and checked the ""race"" box, which I hadn't done in the past. Dawn was rude and abrupt! When I tried to email other administrative individuals at the medical facility, ""Dawn"" would immediately take over and intercept all communication. This applied to phone calls as well. She wouldn't let me speak to anyone else to see why I was being denied service.  This was a very painful experience as It didn't make sense that I had spent thousands at this medical facility, then all of a sudden my money wasn't good?   ",  Plastic Surgeons

We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually improving so that their experiences with Jay Calvert, MD, PC remain strong, consistent and positive.STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM JAY CALVERT, MD AND ROXBURY SURGICAL ASSOCIATES.Theyre new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. Jay Calvert, MD, PC - willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.At Jay Calvert, MD, PC, we are willing to hear all complaints and problems. We deal with complications immediately and effectively with an eye on generating the results patients desire. There is no substitute for prompt attention to problems (which do occur with any type of surgery) and making all efforts to be certain patients are happy. We recognize the importance of safe, effective, prompt treatment of problems when they do occur. We have been in practice for 12 years and at our current location for over seven years. We know what it takes to make our patients happy and achieve the results they want.WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY Plastic Surgery is a field of medicine and surgery that has many aspects to it. There is the reconstructive aspect where patients are being treated for problems that were not of their choosing (cleft lip, burns, breast cancer, hernia, deviated septum, wounds, etc) and there is the cosmetic aspect where patients have chosen to alter something they do not necessarily like but is not life threatening or diseased. Roxbury Surgical Associates patient population is varied and each plastic surgery practice is as varied as the patients and surgeons who come together in those practices. Every surgeon has complications. Every surgeon has patients who are not happy with their results or their care. Thus, complaints about any practice must be considered very carefully as some practices take on very different patients. For instance, a practice that does only breast implants is very different than a practice that does facelifts and noses. The best way to know if you are choosing the right practice is through word of mouth. The internet is a good starting place, but much of the information can be skewed or misleading due to paid advertising, herculean individual writing efforts by angry patients or over-joyed patients and the perspective patient has a hard time making sense of it all. The best thing to do is to speak with former patients or ask your doctor about your referral...
