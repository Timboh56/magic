										 I am a mother who has recently found herself homeless with two kids, since my fiance had been picked up by immigration. My fiance has been detained and I was told to do my best to hire a lawyer. I contacted Musca Law in Orlando Florida and I was told to pay them 2000.00 and they will help me. I had to borrow the money in the hopes that they would be able to help in lowering my fiance's charges which will release him from the detention center. I could only pay 1500.00 and they said well, we will do research and see what we can do from there. 
I waited a week and he had no information for me, and began asking me redundant questions. Three weeks later no call again, so I called, after being given the run around and me having to remind him of my case he tells me ""oh, yea there's nothing we can do sorry when will he be deported?"" I was stunned by his response so I asked him did you contact the courts where is the research that was done. He said he threw it away. 
I told him I'm homeless with a infant and a teen, is there any money left from the 1500.00 he said no, we used it all. I asked for a copy of the research so that I can try and see what else can be done and he told me oh give me a few days I will call you back and have the info. I waited he never called I called again, and I said I don't know anywhere you can go and spend 1500 and have nothing to show for it. He laughed. The main lawyer I dealt with is Mark Menser. My family and especially my kids can use that money to get real help. I found out through other lawyers and legal aids that I can get help for him and what can be done. Now this lawyer obviously did no research and just took my money.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										 this thief contacted me regularly intil i paid the first 500 dollars. he was supposed to perform a forensic audit on a mortgage loan. i recieved a request form via fax to send to my mortgage company. The form asked for documents that was supposedly needed to complete this task. The mortgage company informed me that the request was not valid.
after one month of him stating that he would have his people reconfigure the request document, he tod me there was another way to go around the combative mortgage company. This was simular to the audit and required just a copy of the mortgage note. After more than a month of phone tag with this thief, he contacts me to give me the great news. He states that his people found numerous major violations in the loan documents.
he told me the senerio that was more than likely to happen once these violations are revealed to the mortgage company. he also stated that i needed to satisfy the balance for this service which was another 500$.  I was to recieve via mail all the documents with the findings. They were to be notorized and mailed in to the mortgage company. I have not yet recieved any documents and i am in the process of filing the fraudulent claim with paypal.

Check out my story:     Day before Thanksgiving, 2008 I recieved a letter from SSI in my interpretation said: ""Mary Stamper"":  You are losing your mind, daughter, home, belongings, truck and money.  All this came from Pamela Boone & Mischelle Marie Shaffer when I signed permission on a piece of paper from the HRS giving Mischelle permission to stay at Pamela Boone's house.  Mischelle thought she would gain the money which was her dad's death benefits.  When a child turns 16 the benefits go down to $750.00 per month and is comes in the child's name.  Mine were going to be coming in my name with Mischelle's listed secondary.  This was not Pamela Boone's nor Mischelle's plans.  Mischelle thought she would get someone either Pamela Boone or Dona Rizzano to take over guardianship so that she would gain the check and get to do whatever she wanted which at the time was go to Ohio to join her lesbian lover, Brandy.  Mischelle was violated and caught with Jesse James Thorne so many times after his release from prison for armed bank robbery in Lake County.  She lost the money, Pamela Boone kicked her out, supposedly Mischelle is somewhere in Ocoee and so she says she is pregnant due soon.  Pamela Boone and Mischelle took my signature from that one piece of paper giving her permission to stay across the street because she was getting violent towards me.  You can refer to all these stories also within this site about Pamela Boone and Mischelle Marie Shaffer.  Both of these women, because my daughter to me became a woman when she had sex at 9 years old while I was working night shift training manegers and cooks at Dennys.  Then when she took the money, my husband's, her dad's death benefits across the street to help another family, a crack head, meth head family, with their meals, bills etc...These women took my signature to doctors, dentists, schools, clinics etc...to gain guardianship so that they can and did go to the SSI office and get the death benefits to go across the street in Pamela Boone and Mischelle Marie Shaffer's names.  When I got the letter it immediately started sinking in that my own daughter, Mischelle Marie Shaffer and Pamela Boone are taking the death benefits across the street, they or she is not going to help her own mother with the bills till I either get my disability or get rehired at Dennys.  I was three months ahead in the rent but Pamela Boone, Mischelle Marie Shaffer and the owner of the park were working together on getting rid of me, getting me evicted.  Jim Free used to try to rape me in my home and was even caught a few times my my bff at the time, Phyllis Quoma who worked for the SSI office for many years came in and caught him trying to rape me.  I told Jim Free to go to Crissy, Pamela Boone's daughter.  She will give oral sex for a few dollars.  Jim was the manager of the park at the time and Michael Wiedemeyer's whiskey and beer drinking buddies.  All of them worked together to take my house, scam, trick me however possible to get rid of me and Mischelle had them all believing I was abusing her but a good friend and angel I have in the HRS office will testify to all the investigations and false accusations these two came up with which all closed successfully, thank GOD!  I loaded all my belongings in my old 95 Dodge and a wagon.  Took everything to the woods which down the road made good bon fires out in the woods.  While I was loading all my belongings out of a home that Mischelle grew up in, which I built from the joist up.  I laid floors, subfloors, insulation, walls, ceilings, then carpet, tiles, lenoleum, a gorgeous master bath I was building and the first bath was allready done.  The entire house was done.  One really huge room as you walk in, a huge living room, seperate dining area, gorgeous counters I built, beautiful kitchen with all new appliances, trim work looked pro.  Three bedrooms which I spent over $600.00 for each room for the carpet.  Didn't know I was going to have to give up another house I built.  Mischelle, Pam and all their friends were out in the street laughing, dancing and chanting:  We took your daughter, we took your money and now we are taking your house and making you homeless.  I wanted to end them if you know what I mean.  I was through fighting the park, Jim Free, Michael Wiedemeyer, Pamela Boone and Mischelle Marie Shaffer over the death benefits and house I built.  I walked out the gate to where they were all partying together and laughing at me and handed the title/deed signed over to Mischelle Marie Shaffer to Mischelle and said now the fight is over.  I went to the woods and had a mental and physical breakdown.  Someone finally called an abulance and caught my boyfriend Michael Eugene Nash kicking me in the face because I was getting sick over everything that had happened and throwing up.  I was accused of purposely ruining his life and his families Hollidays.  I didn't know what really happened because for three days I could see a huge black man always staring at me.  I assumed he was my one on one.  He was assigned to watch over me while I was staring at him for three days and couldn't move or talk nor tell anyone what happened.  The lot rent was not due for another month, I was three months ahead, yet Mischelle and Pam handed the title/deed over to Michael Wiedemeyer and he wanted $3,000.00 straight up for my house.  I even made the skirting all around it from scratch siding.  Didn't get to even take a second look at all my work.  All the memories of her growing up there, birthdays, Easters, Christmas', Halloweens, Thanksgivings etc...gone.  Wiped out in one day!           November 27, 2008.  Starting to comprehend what all had happened and realizing I had a physical, mental and medical breakdown.  I was not the same person anymore.  If I hated life and people before I now hated them even more.  Finally coherant I wanted to get a shower but there was a lot of water on the bedroom floor and bathroom floor.  The water was so much it overflowed into the bedroom.  I kept asking the male nurse to please get someone to clean it up.  It was nasty, had been there for days, had tons of black curley hairs in it and was stagnated.  After asking four times I decided to take my only wash cloth and clean it up.  They only give you one bath towel so I had to make the wash cloth work.  I knew it would take hours like this but eventually I would get to take a shower.  I stepped into the water that was overflowing into the bedroom and this changed my life for the worse forever.  I laid in that nasty water for about 45 minutes or so yelling for someone to come help.  No one showed up.  Eventually I was able to get to my feet and limp, pull myself or hobble to the front desk the best I could covered in nasty water.  I told them what happened and they didn't seem to care.  I kept telling the mail nurse over and over what happened but he continued ignoring me.  The next day was a Monday when the doctor came to see me.  I told him what happened.  He was furious.  He wrote up his entire staff and the male nurse then told them to get me to a hospital as fast as possible.  Still no shower I went in an ambulance to the hospital.  I had not been prescribed any medications up to that point so no one could say I was medicated.  I was admitted into the Eatonville Lakeside Alternatives for mental/physical and medical depression/a breakdown.  The hospital did tons of test and MRIs.  They found 4 herniated disk in my lower back, 4 herniated disk in my neck, bone degenerate & joint degenerate which all of this radiates to my legs and feet.  The docs said I would be bed ridden for the rest of my life, no walking, no ladders, no bending/stooping-life as I knew it was gone.  I was going back to Lakeside after all the test etc...They still needed to do the paperwork and prescribe meds and refer me to an attorney and get me into therapy.  An accident/slip and fall attorney came to Lakeside and met with me in a private room and told me he was taking on my slip and fall case if I wanted him to.  I signed everything and gave him permission to proceed because he said he could get me into see a doctor and therapy and order all the MRIs they need etc...I was put into therapy and under a docs care for 18 months then was released because not only was 18 months all he prescribed for me but there was still no improvement only getting worse and therapy was making everything worse.  Today is December 25, 2012.  The 4 year anniversary of the slip and fall has passed.  I am now prectically bed ridden.  Aside from bathroom and grocery trips I'm bed ridden/a shut in.  No knows and no one cares.  I've been to quite a few pain specialist and pain manegements but because of the Medicare co-pay I never get to stay with them.  The last one wanted to do three epidurals in my lower back and three in my neck.  Thank God I backed out because of the co-pay.  I wasn't looing forward to that and am happy it didn't happen.  I called Lafe Purcelle's office every week for the past four years and now their office has closed/fell off the face of the earth/missing in action or D:  got thousands of settlements and hauled butt.  Does anyone out there know anything about this attorney and his where abouts or is there any attorneys on this earth that can pick this case up and help me?  I still have all the MRIs and my doctor has all the records of all the specialist, MRIs, test etc...I thought this settlement was going to help me get into treatment, therapy or any surgeries or epidurals or whatever else I need to help me get out of this bed.  What happens to the thousands of clients?  I'm just a small pea in that huge pod.  After all this happened to me a 12000 pound shed fell on me I was trying to move it into the woods to have something to ive in then I was on TV for having the worse case of mirsa in history because my boyfriend at the time Michael Eugene Nash would not let me call an ambulance because he was sick of me ruining his hollidays and life by getting hurt and sick.  There was tons of tragedies that happened to me during all this time and life might have been different for me if everyone eg: all my friend/enemies had not stolen my SSI settlement or I would have gotten this slip and fall money so I could go into treatment and therapy long term.                                                  Signed:  Mary Stamper                                                   SMALL PEA IN HUGE POD     									",Attorneys & Legal

										18mths ago I hired Assured Pardons of Canada to complete the pardon application process for me.  I had researched the different companies on the internet and had decided on this company because his price was competitive, I found no complaints and Assured Pardons had been used by other respectable businesses as a testimonial for their services. 
I had the option to pay in full or to make payments via credit card over a 6mth period.  I was to nervous to pay in full and thought that paying over time would allow me to assess their competency and committment before the final payment was made. I spoke with Joe Black several times on the phone and through email. I don't think I waited longer then a day for his response and was very pleased with Joe's manner of business. It took a couple of months to complete all the necessary forms and complete the identification certification process. Joe told me the process usually takes 12mths but maybe longer depending on situation. I had done research beforehand and was satisfied that everything was on plan and moving forward.  I made my final payment and waited until approx month 10 to ask for a status report.  Joe Black did not return my calls or emails for approx 1mth when he told me he had been ill but was now able to give my file the attention it needed.  He then sent me more forms to complete - they were duplicates of the forms I had already completed.  This was very worrisome to me but I felt better late then never.  My next emails and phone calls were ignored.  I couldn't even get him to acknowledge receipt of my forms.  I returned to his website to see if there was another phone number and noticed he had opened offices in 5 new cities.  It was then obvious to me that he was only interested in the income from new clients and that existing clients like myself were just an annoyance. I have emailed him weekly and phoned all the offices listed online.  All I wanted was an acknowledgement that I was still a client.  I was so desperate I would have been satisfied with another ""I have been sick"" email.  However, this week I decided to try to pick up where he left off and spoke with the Canadian Parole Board only to learn that my application had not even been registered. 
I have lost $600 and more importantly 1.5yrs. Assured Pardons of Canada is still taking money from new clients with no intent to provide the service.
It is only a matter of time before Joe Black of Assured Pardons will be hiring one of his competitors to assist with his pardon process.",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

During this time I had health issues.Shortly after that we were able to get the foreclosure canceled so NO work was done or needed by this company.I emailed asking for a refund because they had went ahead and withdrew a payment and I explained that it was my understanding  that no funds would be taken until we were able to review a package they were sending (withdrawal taken before we received this package last week) and I got the okay from my husband.To make a long short and after several emails I was stalled long enough for them to take out a second withdrawal which according to my bank was drawn before the scheduled day we had set up of Nov.14, 2011.My gut said something was wrong when they would not accept my cancellation request by email staying i would need to call and speak with them before they could cancel anything with the assurance no other funds would be withdrawn and they would take care of the refund as soon as I called them..Made the call ended up speaking with a Mr. Wilson who stalled once again stating he felt I needed to speak with one of their attorneys so I could be sure how Texas laws handled things.I told him that that the rep had explained all that and things were good and that I had got the foreclosure cancelled so we didn't need them after all.He refused to take no for an answer setting me an appointment with an attorney scheduled a few days later.  The call from the attorney was brief stating we seemed to have everything under control and didn't need their services.Called back informing Mr Wilson of the brief conversation, seemed surprised it was so brief (my opinion)..Mr Wilson at that time informed me that he would immediately take care of the refund process...this was on the morning of November 11, 2011.The following Monday, Nov. 14 I was surprised that another draw had been taken from our account.  I immediately contacted Mr. Wilson him then stating there was a form o needed to sign to get my money refunded..When I received the form it had $750 on it so I marked through it and put $1500 since that is what they owed me now.Within minutes I was contacted by Mr. Wilson informing me I was only entitled to $750 of course I strongly disagreed directing him to his account rep who I had been emailing back and forth and had been attempting to get this cancelled for weeks now.....and NO work had been done or authorized.He Very Rudely stated I am the rep's supervisor I don't  need to contact him you either sign the form or you don't get any money back.I was shocked that I had just been taken by this COMPANY that had done NO WORK for us because there wes no work to be done and now being threaten you sign or you don't get anything back.I signed the form writing ALL over it that I was not in agreement with this being a Full refund and that I would be filing a complaint.I also sent an email stating this and asked that they provide me with documents that they had done work for us.I also stated that they had stalled me to make sure they would get that second draw.....I should have been informed of a release form when I spoke to Mr. Wilson over a week ago...they had not taken that second drawn so when they agreed to the refund a couple of weeks ago what were they going to refund since they said they earned that $750 and that was all they had at the time they agreed to give me a refund......I definitely was stalled allowing them time to make that second drawn....My lesson learned is to follow my gut..Something just did not feel right....not accepting an email as a cancellation tool....then stating they had to speak with me before they could cancel anything...many Red Flags ..many whispers....as Oprah says I had to get a Brick up side the head....Speaking of a Brick upside the head ...Oprah was used as a pawn to get us to sign up saying ""you know Oprah would Not endorse something she did not believe"" .....Oprah would probably tell me that this was just ""crazy a**""  ""crazy a**""!!Oprah would definitely be Pissed that her name is being used to take money from hard working folks at a low point in their lives trying to save a home they worked hard to get!.....I pray this at least saves one person from being used and their hard earned money taken from them ...next step is to figure out where I file my complaint with The BBB.",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										A waste of time and money, and they put me in an even bigger hole than where I started. I had a family law matter which, in hindsight, I would have been better off pursuing pro se. The initial meeting was with a paralegal, with an attorney brought in about an hour and a half later. Initial price quote was $3700, reduced to $1500 after I informed them I was underemployed (like so many others these days). They didn't guarantee a favorable outcome - which they are forbidden to do anyway - but intimated strongly that I would win based on legal precedent and the merits of the case. I made a down payment and a payment schedule was established. I was provided with several pages of documentation to fill out and return. 
Over the course of the next four months the only person with whom I had any regular contact was the accounts receivable rep assigned to my case. She was very pleasant, of course. I spoke with my attorney by phone twice, for a total of less than two hours. He dismissed, rather condescendingly, the 12 pages of paperwork I had filled out, along with two of the three courses of action they had originally agreed to pursue on my behalf. My attorney was confident we would prevail on the remaining issue.
I met once with my attorney, five days before the court date. He explained his strategy, the legal basis for it, and that it was as close to a slam dunk as existed in the legal world. He showed up late for our appointment and had to return to his office to retrieve my file. He was not familiar with who I was or the status of my case until he had the file in front of him.
My attorney called me after appearing - and losing - in court. He gave me a detailed blow-by-blow account of the proceedings, and expressed his shock and dismay at the court's ruling. He then laid out his strategy for an appeal, as an idea had occurred to him just then that he hadn't considered before the hearing. He was confident his appeal strategy would prevail, and it would only cost me another $1500.
Seriously? I'll admit to being an idiot for ever retaining these thieves, but I do eventually figure things out. The deception and incompetence of this firm extend beyond the well-documented issues in their real estate division, and are apparently endemic to the entire organizational culture and operational philosophy. They exist for the sole purpose of separating the public from their money, and one can only hope that sooner rather than later the state will shut them down.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										About 6 months ago I posted a complaint on www.(((REDACTED))).com. I got ripped off by a loan mod company out of Florida. They got me for almost $4000.00!!! A few days after posting my complaint i was contacted by Cathy Conrad and she told me she could get my money back. She explained the attorney she works for Michael W. C. Fourte, are filing class action lawsuites against several companies. All we had to do was pay $1500.00 and within 90 days they would have our money back. After about 6 months i wasnt getting any call backs and the cell phone number she gave me was disconnected. It was the same scam all over again. I finally got in touch with Cathy and Michael and they said they lost the battle and they will not be refunding any money to anyone. They then hung up on me. I was scammed again.These people are the bottom of the bottom feeders! They not only prey on people that were f*cked over by their mortgage company but people that were f*cked over by loan modification companies. Do yourself a favor and stay as far away from these people as you can.

She has a sign displayed in front of her house and business cards for a number of ""businesses"" she runs (ie scams) with different names on them. Pyramid schemes. She uses drugs and is constantly high when ""supervising"" your visit, at least she was when she did ours. Dont believe me? Request a drug test and see if she passes. Any reputable supervision service should be able to provide one. Also, her husband who is permitted around your kids is a convicted felon, convicted drug addict and a rumored child molester. Public records speak for themselves. His name is Donald Riedel. This is probably why she uses a fake last name Adamski!How is this person not in jail?!

										ADAM LEITMAN BAILEY WORST ATTONEY IN NEW YORKI lost every cent I ever saved and my apartment building too, all of which went to Adam Leitman Bailey and his misrepresentation of my case. My wife divorced me as a result of my monetary loss and what I believe was a fling with Bailey. It started with a tenant of mine who agreed to pay me a small cash amount above the fixed allowable rent. I had a great relationship with the tenant for decades but while the tenant was in Europe and I was vacationing in Mexico there was a flood in her apartment. The water not only flooded the apartment but because she was gone so long the carpets became mildewed, the wood floors destroyed and other fabrics including drapes were ruined. I was very sympathetic to her when we met but told her to use her insurance company for repairs. A few days later she informed me the insurance had lapsed and she had no recourse but to ask me to make repairs as it was a burst pipe in the wall that caused the flood. Of course I refused, it was not my fault she failed to maintain the insurance policy. The next week I received a call from her attorney demanding I pay for the damage. This was when I made the biggest mistake of my life, I refused. Weeks went by and I noticed contractors were fixing the tenants damage. It was peaceful and my wife and I started planning a trip to Jamaica. The day after we bought tickets the shit hit the fan big time. A lawsuit was filed against me by my tenant for damages and grief, but worst of all a letter came from the City attorneys office requesting a meeting over charging excess rent to not only that tenant but two others I had made arrangements with. Life for me would never be the same. I called my local attorney to help me but he told me he could not as I needed a real estate attorney. I went online and discovered just a few specializing in defending this kind of action. One in particular listed press articles about how good he was defending landlords from frivolous claims, Adam Leitman Bailey, the man who would destroy my life forever. I am a conservative Jew and when I met Mr. Bailey I saw right away from his head covering, he too was of my faith. He immediately explained to me how successful he was defending landlords who got themselves in trouble winning all his cases. He showed me press articles about himself and his firm. His request for retainer was reasonable and I signed with him immediately as both the City and tenants litigation was over my head.  I was initially impressed as Mr. Bailey postponed deadlines on meetings with the city and plaintiff. Our trip to Jamaica was back on, the last trip I would ever take with my wife and likely the last vacation of my life. My deposition took place three months later. I was not prepared for the hell that resulted. Mr. Bailey appointed one of his staff to be present and did not rehearse me properly. I was torn apart by opposing council. After decades of accepting cash payments for most of the rents including overcharges I forgot I had given all three tenants receipts for same! Dead in the water and not prepared by Bailey. This was just the beginning, though Bailey postponed the city hearing repeatedly that was the extent/ postponements. Later when I called the court directly I was told Bailey postponed hearings all the time and sometimes never appeared or cancelled! Then the bills starting coming for the postponements, over a two year period hundreds of thousands of dollars. He explained he had extensive phone conversations with both the city and tenant councils, meeting with lawyers in his firm to discuss my case, research in law books, lunch meetings and hundreds of hours dedicated to my case. I asked him why I had not been rehearsed thoroughly and prepared for my deposition. He told me it was best to just be honest and tell the truth. I told him the truth crucified me. He had no response on that. When my money ran out I met with him and so did my wife. He appeared quite interested in my much younger wife but I paid no attention. In an hour long meeting I agreed to sign a contract giving him my lifelong hard worked  for apartment building for any shortfall of money I might owe him, better I had committed suicide. I could continue on hear but my readers must know the end of this story. I lost everything, the case, my beautiful building to the tenants and Bailey and the investigation of the city for overcharging and my wife. I sit in a miserable tiny apartment in the Bronx living on my social security and welfare checks and contemplate suicide every day. Noone should go through this with an incompentent attorney. If you had a similar experience relate it here.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										After being deneyed a home modification for no reason I was told by attorney Lucas Garcia from Litchney law firm that he could help me get the modification that I deserved, and that we had a great case to sue. I explained that I only wanted my childhood home back and he said the banks only listen to Lawyers and that he could help me talk to the banks.  Lucas Garcia sent two letters to the bank and called me twice to tell me that the bank is reviewing my home modification, and believed I should have been given the permanent modification. At this point I gave him $3500.00 dollars for two letter and two phone calls and nothing was resolved, I go through foreclosure still believing that Lucas Garcia is going to work something out with the bank. I call and get told that he needs more money.  Than the eviction comes I pay Luca Garcia another $1500. to represent me with the eviction. The weekend before court I call him up to review what may happen in court on Monday just to be told by the receptionist he does not work for our company and more.  I explained to the receptionist what had happened and she put Sara Litchney on the phone.  Sara explained how Luca Garcia does not work for the law firm anymore. She invited us to come down to speak to her regarding what happened. Although she was very nice and pleasant she did not offer a refund on my money nor did she even offer to show up in court for me.  So the day of court comes and the judge Yells at me for Luca Garcia not showing up or signing any affidavit showing he does not represent me.  I had to go back to Litchney law to get the attorneys office to sign off and the following day spend 6 hours to get free legal service at the court so I could represent myself. I was left addressing the court with no legal advisory with me because litchney law did not fulfill their obligation. They took total of $5000.00 from me, and nothing was done for me! also the attorney from free legal at the court said we should sue and we are in the process of doing just that!

I have a sister who moved to Las Vegas during the spring of 2005.  My sister Lynn was diagnosed with Alzheimers disease in 2009.  Commissioner Norheim assigned Jared Shafer to be her guardian.  I was told Lynn could leave the state to return to our home in Denver in two months after paper work was cleared up. Jared Shafer through his attorney Elyse Tyrell blocked the proceedings.  Legal fees began to build up to the tune of $40,000.   I met with Alan D Freer who was my attorney.  What he told me changed everything I believed about the American legal system.  Alan Freer said I can get Lynn released to you, my fee is $350 per hour.  Understand some of this money must be paid to Commissioner Jon Norheim and Judge Chuck Hoskin.  Norheim and Hoskin will get their cut one way or another.  If you pay me for an additional 100 hours of work, Norheim and Hoskin will be taken care of. I guarantee they will rule in your favor.  We have a doctor who will report the Las Vegas climate is not healthy for your sister.  This money will also take care of the doctor.  A hearing will be scheduled and your case will be heard as the last one on Norheims court calendar.  If there is other parties in the room, Norheim will clear the court.  Jon will make the ruling and Jared Shafer will sign the papers to facilitate the transfer of guardian ship from him to you.  If you want to fight, Jared and Elyse will continue to block the transfer until they have created fees of $80,000.   Alan Freer leaned across the table and said the choice is up to you.   I was speechless.  The shock of his words reminded me of doing business in Senegal where we had to pay $5,000 to a local leader to get medicine distributed to a rural tribe.     Alan Freer smiled and said we have this thing really tied up.  I do not give clients the easy way out, but since your sister is very sick I believe she should pass away with her family.  Yes, it is going to cost you, but lets be business like about this.  I looked directly at Mr. Freer and said youre fired as my attorney; god will punish you for what you are doing to seniors who live in this state.  Alan Frres words are now online in this rip-off report.   Ive reported this conversation to the police and the Nevada state bar.  I will be filing with additional governmental agencies.  The results of possible future governmental actions will be submitted to this report.

										Anyone that's looking for a loan modification I will NOT recommend the law office of john m. ribarich unless you have deep pockets.

As time went on we are sending them our documents faithfully. To make the long story short We got denied three for a loan mod. Our home was up for auction Dec 9, 2011.

										Are you looking for an attorney to assist you with your Workers Compensation Claim?? Well, if you've been forwarded to the firm of Perona, Langer, Beck, Serbin & Mendoza (PLBSM), please... KEEP LOOKING! I absolutely will not leave you in suspense. Here's the story on the process folks. Here's what happened to me along with a few examples of what happened to others who have wisely acquired new attorneys in their cases.
Once you foolishly fill out their online form, within 2-5 minutes, expect a call from someone from their office. The person calling you may or may not be an attorney. They will ask you a few questions about your situation and then tell you they will send someone from their offices right to your home the very next day for you to sign the papers for them to take care of your case. DO NOT SIGN! Once you've signed, the firm gets a percentage of your claim even if you fire them, or they fire you. I am personally aware of both of those circumstances. 
After you sign, they will open a case on your behalf. In my personal case, they NEVER met with me even once prior to filing my case with the Workers Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB). They never did an indepth interview with me. They had very little actual knowledge of my accident or injury. Of course this means that when they filed my orignal claim, they didn't file it with all of the injured body parts. From there, it just went downhill. The thing is, since they never sent me even one copy of anything they did, I didn't even know they had opened the WCAB case much less that it was wrong until long after I fired them. When I hired a new attorney, who spent nearly 4 hrs interviewing me so as not to be left without any important information, that's when I found out PLBSM had inacturately filed my WCAB claim. 
To add to the chaos, every time I called their offices, I was put into a phone queue and had to wait 30-45 minutes to get a live person on the line, if able to get a live person at all. On the occasions I was able to speak with a live person, they either provided me no information at all, or provided me incorrect legal advice, despite the fact they were not the attorneys. One of them advised me on a matter that lost me a great deal of money in benefits. Of course, the firm will deny any wrong doing for any of their mistakes. That's why we are all joining forces to go public and to file this Class Action Suit using a very well respected attorney. In addition, we are seriously contemplating our appearance on a well known media outlet. We are not giving up until we are compensated for the errors made in each of our cases. 
Here's an interesting scenario. When I would call and leave a message requesting a return call from someone from their office so I could get a status on my case, I didn't receive a return call. So, I input information into their webform, this time with a different name to see if I could get someone to call me. Low and behold, the return call came within minutes. That test tells me they will call you immdediately to hook you in, but once you've signed on, it's extremely difficult to get them on the phone for anything. 
It's considered a Breach of Ethics according to the CA State BAR when your attorney fails to communicate with you about important issues regarding a case. This is just one of the issues I, along with many others with whom I've had contact, have had to deal with once we agreed to allow the PLBSM firm to represent us. We feel strongly that this issue is so egregious it amounts to malpractice. If you're interested in joining forces with us, read the other posts in this category and contact the person listed. Be prepared to provide detailed information from your case if you wish to join us in our pursuit for justice. 									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

Twice I overheard my husband telling Mr. Blumberg ""you don't understand, my wife and I don't tell each other what to do"".  Why was my attorney calling my husband to tell me what to do?   Why didn't he call me?

Mr. Blumberg refused to listen to me  and refused to represent me even though he took my money, and then fraudulently took more.  He teamed up with his partner, Michael Ziton, my husband's attorney, to shut me up.  Blumberg and Ziton had their own goal. [continued below]....
									
										.....  They flew to New York, with my husband, while I was left to my own defenses.  I was screaming for and paying for representation and got none.y attorney, Bruce Blumberg, did that to me when I was paying him a ton of money to represent me. I want other women to be warned of Bruce Blumberg.  He is very unethical and very unprofessional.",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										Asset Discovery was contacted to conduct a bank search. I informed ""Fred"" that I was in a rush (as everyone is) and he informed me that it would take 3-5 business days. I had already used another company to obtain the bank search information for my client but was just  looking for ""Fred"" to confirm what I already had (I did not inform Fred of this). I received information from him simply listing the name of a random bank, no further information. I knew that he was a fraud at that point because I already knew the (3) banks from my first bank search and the bank that he gave me was not one of them. Also, the client was aware of the 3 banks that came up in the bank search. The first company that I used informed me that they 100% guarantee that they did not miss any banks. I called Fred on this and he kept saying that it is still being worked on. He then said that if the name of the bank is the only information that is out there, ""It is what it is."" He also stated that many people are not satisfied with the results but he has plenty of business and did not need mine.
At that time, I informed him that I already had the bank information from another company and was looking for him to just verify, which he did not. He said that he is still working on it and I would have it by the weekend, which would make it 19 days. He then stated that it takes up to 17 banking days. I laughed at him and told him that he is a fraud. He said that he did a better job than the first banbk search company because he came up with a bank that they did not. LOL ! That was a great line. What a con man and a fraud. I cannot believe that this guy is still in business. Hopefully the District Attorney charges this guy with fraud and puts him out of business. Don't make the same mistake that I did, check out the business. I was in a hurry and did not.    									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										Assured Pardons of Canada is a RIP OFF!! 
I used Assured Pardons for my pardon. I paid in full hundreds of dollars on time without issue. After the last payment was made almost all communication was cut off and no service was provided. The man there is Joe Black. He will very rarely answer the phone and the answering service is useless! its just a woman who passes along the same message you leave on his infamous voice mail. Joe is a big scam that will take your money, lie to you and waste over a year of your life. Do not use this company as you will be in the same boat as many others. They have accumulated an F rating with 16, so far, bad reviews with the BBB just in 2011 alone. In fact, i cant find even a single good review any where on the internet. Just a lot of negative ones. Those of us who have been victims of Joe Black, should get together to discuss action. I personally have the answer if anyone is interested. Everyone, beware of this cheaper company and read all possible reviews so you dont get scammed like us. 									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										Attorney Amy E. Martinez (SBN 245871) of the Geraci Law Firm Knowingly and Recklessly filed a completely Baseless and Fraudulent motion for ""Relief of Stay"" on July 2nd 2010 against Debtor Larry Michael Rusin. Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Case # 2:10-20998.
    The motion was supported by a completely Baseless and Fraudulent declaration under the penalty of perjury by John Aschieris of Foothill Financial lp and Partner Ron Aschieris. This is a side business for Ron Aschieris as he is also a teacher at Morango Elementary School in Pasadena. 
     The Motive for the Fraudulent claim and filed motion was that if they did not get a ""Relief of Stay"" by 
July 15, 2010 the default notice of the foreclosure process would expire under the California CivilCode 2924 would have to be refiled and the foreclosure process would have to go through the legal process after the 365 day expiration period. [continued below]....
									
										.....
      Furthermore, Foothill Financial Lp John and Ron Aschieris feared their loan would be Legally lien stripped by debtor Rusin if refiled because of the fact Debtor Rusin Attorney Rhonda K. Walker (SBN 175108) had failed to include the declaration from the appraiser in the lien strip motion
     Instead of going the legal route.. They decided to take a chance and thinking they would not get caught ""Committing Fraud"" under 9011 and illegally and Knowingly Violated the ""Automatic Stay"" by overwhelming debtor Rusin and proceeded to foreclose and take my home to trust deed sale and sell their Junior loan for the amount of $ 60,000. 
     The 1st lender Ocwen Loan Servicing had previously modified the 1st loan and took no part in the Foreclosure and they had no problem with me as the borrower.
      This act of Fraud upon the US Bankruptcy Court of the Central District of California has nearly all the same RECKLESS AND MALICIOUS acts of what took place in the case of EILEEN FAGAN US BANKRUPTCY CASE  #04 B 23460 9 (ASH).
The Fagan case shadows almost every aspect of what transpired in my Chapter 13 case with the exception of .. .1 IMPORTANT THING !!
*** EILEEN FAGAN NEVER ENDED UP LOSING HER HOME AND NEARLY ALL OF HER BELONGINGS AS I DID AND HAVING MY LIFE NEARLY DESTROYED !
** EILLEN FAGEN  ENDED UP RECEIVING OVER $10,000 IN SANCTIONS FROM THE FILING ATTORNEY
*  FALSE CERTIFICATION OF POST PETITION DEFAULTS
******************************************************************************
THIS CASE WAS ENTERED FOR PUBLICATION  : IN Re: Gorshstein, 285 B.R. (Bankr S.D.N.Y.)
      Motions to lift the stay may be routine and inconsequential to secured creditors and their councel.  But to a debtor and his or her family, such a motion and the consuquent loss of the family home may be devestating.  Most creditors and councel and conscientious.  But some are callus by design or inadvertence, as exemplified by this motion and two thers presented to this Court the same week.  The danger here is that a debtor who does not have an attorney or the resources of intellect or spirit to defend against a baseless motion may lose his/her home despite being current on post- petitiion mortgage and plan payments.
      I know of no way to protect against such an eventuality if no material consequence attaches to the filing of motions bases upon false certification of fact.  Secured creditors and their counsel who know that filing motion to lift the stay will result in material sanctions if caught will undoubtedly be motivated to a higher standard of care.

										Back in the day we had Laurel & Hardy, those slapstick comedians of the 30s and 40s who bumbled their way through scenes in a hundred or so movies they made together.  
These days, we have Preston & Scott, those legal comedians who bumble their way through cases and clients with inexperience and unexperience (that would be no experience at all -- and theres a difference between the two). 
It would be entirely accurate to call them a rinky-dink operation, one in which they lack not only experience and knowledge (i.e., credibility) -- which renders their legal advice, guidance and direction as questionable -- but also their lack of funding and staffing ability. They had to borrow money against their own furniture to fund their office opening, and they staff it with inexperienced, what I would refer to as, kids. You half expect to see cartoon character lunch boxes at their desks. Nothing beats experience, and this crew doesn't seem to have it. You would think after decades in the legal business as practicing attorneys, they would have a clue, but by every indication I've seen, this is a law firm without a clue. 
Beware of these guys. They're operating on a shoestring budget and will do pretty much anything for revenue flow -- you know, income, cash, a payday. They'll try to bully you into doing something that may not be in YOUR best interests, but is in THEIR best interest. Don't be intimidated, don't be bullied.

BARBARA JEAN KUEHN [#152283], 47, of Burlingame was suspended for three years, stayed, placed on three years of probation with a one-year actual suspension, and was ordered to take the MPRE. Credit toward the actual suspension will be given for an interim suspension which began Dec. 5, 1998. The order took effect Sept. 17, 1999.
Kuehn represented a woman in a dissolution in which the family home was sold, profits were to be split 50-50 after payment of debts, and Kuehn was entrusted with the proceeds of the sale.
She distributed more than $6,000 of the entrusted funds to herself without obtaining the courts authorization. As a result, she was charged with, and pleaded no contest to, embezzlement. She agreed to cease practice for one year, home detention for six months, a fine of $3,750, three years of probation and 200 hours of community service.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

Barbara took a look at what we had presented and confirmed that they could handle our case, however, she said she could not begin the process until she had at least $1300 up front.  My husband and I were caught off guard as the representative we spoke with prior to meeting Barbara said we would not need to give any money right away.  All we would need to do is compile the necessary documents and allow Barbara some time to review and provide the guidance on the next steps.  Needless to say we gave her cash and the only receipt we have showing that we gave her cash does not have her signature as a recipient.  Barbara said she would send us a receipt and provide us on the next steps we should take.  That was in April 2012.  As instructed on the receipt and expressed verbally by Barbara we would need to send two additional payments of $1300 each made out to Claremont Funding.  One in May and the other in June.  We followed these instructions and eagerly awaited to hear from the lawyer.  We were told not to contact our mortgage company but to contact them should our mortgage company call us....so they could handle the calls.  We signed a letter authorizing Claremont Funding to speak on our behalf.  We never received any correspondence from Claremont.  No phone calls.  No mail.  Each time we contacted Barbara to follow up on our case she made excuses that she was either out of town, sick or ""will get back to us"".  If we got a hold of a representative we were told that we needed to submit additional paperwork not limited to paperwork that we had previously sent.  We have avoided making contact with our bank because we sincerely thought they were handling everything but boy did we get snowed!  We spoke to our bank today, March 7, 2013.  They never heard of Claremont!  There is nothing on file stating that we gave Claremont or anyone else for that matter the authority to speak on our behalf!  We are in foreclosure and the only way we might be able to avoid that is by being reviewed for a modification.  My husband became very furious at the thought that we have been scammed and called Barbara...who conveniently said that she is going to have surgery.  Barbara also told my husband that she was no longer with the company.  When he asked her where the office was located she said there was no office and that they all work out of their homes.  Well....when were we going to be notified about this?   When my husband asked for a refund, she said you only get refunds when you get rejected.  How can we be rejected if nothing was ever done on our case?  About 2 hours after his conversation with Barbara someone named Albert called him back to reiterate that we are not in foreclosure and everything is going along as planned.  Albert said he had just spoken to our mortgage company, blah, blah, blah.  When my husband asked Albert for his name the man hung up.  Mind you he called my husband from a restricted number.  I don't know what's more disturbing...the fact that our most personal and confidential information is lying around in someone's house or the fact that we are not the only people that have been scammed!  If there is ever a lawsuit to be filed against these people we would be more than willing to sign the petition.

										BE WARNED, this practice will release your private information to opposing parties involved in your case.  I retained the Law Firm of Ravin Greenberg in New Jersey, Stephen B Ravin was a partner of the firm. I retained Ravin Greenberg LLC to assist me with a case against former business partners of mine, I was pursuing a law suit against them. 
After retaining the firm, I abruptly received a letter stating that the firm was closing due to a partner death, they would no longer represent me.  Unbeknownst to me, the firm had accepted service of papers for a law suit that was being filed against me from a creditor.  I was never notified that papers were received, consequently, I did not appear in court, resulting in the
award of a default judgment in the plaintiffs favor.  A few years later, I receive an information subpoena from the firm Forman Holt Eliades Ravin & Youngman LLC, which Stephen B Ravin is a partner of.  This firm represents the plaintiff.  What this
means, is Stephen B Ravin was a partner of a firm that was retained by me, received papers from a plaintiff on my behalf, did not notify me, once the judgment was entered, he represented the creditor to collect from me on the creditors behalf.  I have no idea how this is legal, but BE WARNED.  ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										Beware Landlords...Do Not use this service for filing evictions unless you want to wait weeks and months to get a tenant evicted. This software company is partnered with Leticia M. Padilla Morales in Charlotte whereby the software product supposedly schedules property evictions without you, the landlord having to go to the courthouse and file the paperwork personally. 
You do everything online and they will provide you great service in getting your account setup, but they will fail miserably in performing their eviction service. Eviction was established on a set date and then it was delayed by the partnering attorney without getting approval from the landlord owner. They arbitrarily decided to allow the tenant to stay in the property longer when they were not paying rent from the time the eviction was filed. 
They also say they will file a writ of possession as well, but this writ was scheduled to be filed on the 11th day after possession was granted by the court. It was weeks later before they actually had the writ filed. 
The company Tsoft Software and Ms. Morales cost me an entire month in lost rent on top of paying for their service fees.
They will not communicate with you regarding details of the service and you will find out about delays weeks after you thought things were already completed with the service. Landlords are advised to run far away from the thought of using this TSOft Software or attorney Leticia M. Padilla Morales. 									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										Bob French charged us over $51,000 in legal fees for creating worthless reams of documents. He completely missed the basic law premise of 'date of fraud'. He told us to pursue a $1.2 case for non-disclosure with a real estate company. After 18 month of personal emotional distress Mr. French was told by the real estate expert we hired that he was entirely wrong and the best we could possible get was $100,000 in a settlement. A couple weeks later at the pre-trial settlement conference we negotiated the $100,000 ourselves with the real estate company. 
Even after making this unbelievable mistake Mr. French continued to bill us for over 30 hours of work to review the settlement document that needed no reviewing. When we refused to pay he took us to the Placer Country Bar Association. They agreed that his legal work was totally incorrect and he missed the very basic law that first year law students learn in law school. Despite this the Placer County Bar Association or lawyers good ole boy club, allowed Mr. French to collect his fees. Now Mr. French is again filing mounds of paper and bludgeoning us in the courts for the unearned $11,000. 
Never ever use this arrogant narcissist  lawyer for any work, he does not know what he is doing but will do anything to bleed you for his fees.

										Broward County Warning Robert Scott Hannan, Joyce Julian BIASED TOWARD MALE GENDER
AVOID THESE ATTORNEYS these are my opinions backed with online research i found through the courts and media. These ttorney are apparently biased according to what happened to me and other writing online. 
I also had personal experience with this mentioned law office....
These attorneys and judges appear to be connected and no one may have a fair trial with these people and their antics.
5 attorneys in fort Lauderdale were disbarred in November.  I wish to remain anonymous, I do not wish to give up my hard copy of what
I call threats or letters of the attorneys in question, however if you  want hard copy
evidence, you can request Robert Hannans as well as Joyce Julians  cases, you can even verify their Facebook information too along with the Judges in the links below. [continued below]....
									
										..... I included links to back up my observations 
however I am in a legal battle and do not want these attorneys or ex judges or their apparent connections to ruin things for me. 
FACT:  Joyce Julian operates out of Robert Hannans office, according to google maps.
She was a judge that was kicked off the bench for being drunk and naked in public, she also claims she was sexually assaulted. She also had another call against her for drinking and domestic at her residence. So the police were contacted twice on her. This woman operates out of Robert Hannans office, and because Joyce Julian claims she was sexually 
assaulted, wouldn't this show her biased toward men and domestic violence cases, according to at least one online 
review, claiming a woman filed domestic violence when Joyce Julian represented her.(courtesy of google reviews)Is this firm or has this firm told ANY of their clients to possibly file a report for leverage?Did You know that according to Robert Hannan's PUBLIC Facebook page shows him connected to the Kaplans and did you know that Judge Kaplan
oversees domestic violence? Interesting isn't it? I wonder how Roebrt Hannans domestic cases turned out for him especially related to the male gender?
Joyce Julian may still have connections to judges and remember Robert Hannan is friends on Facebook too. Why is Joyce Julian an ex judge able to practice law in the same courts, let alone an office with Robert Hannan involving domestic and divorce???  See Below for their PUBLIC Facebook Evidence and connections to these  observations.

Here Are Robert Hannans Facebook connections to Judges and their family thereof:
Facebook Has Robert Hannan connected to the Kaplan family, Michael Kaplan is a judge here in Broward County. Robert Hannan is also friends With Carlos Rebollo, a Broward Court Judge as well. Robert Hannans friend and partner Joyce Julian, are friends with  judges according to Facebook and as she was an ex judge, Facebook 
shows Joyce friends with Janine Rice who works for the district attorneys office as well, this goes all the way to the top.Now if they are friends on Facebook, does that mean that they are friends in the court room, or better yet favored, since they are FRIENDS?
According to complaints online I am not the only one but I am reporting it. With Robert and Joyce's connections, its safe to say they may only have their best interest in these cases, as it may seem wouldn't you 
agree? motive? could it be money? Why else would a divorce be continued for 1-2 years? read on for evidence.....
 
Robert Hannan is apparently friends with Judge Hurley on Facebook or at least writes to him publicly, as evidenced,even
writing on his election page. Remember Judge Hurley was accused of injecting his personal and religious views into a case as reported in the Sun Sentinel See Evidence Here: http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/broward/blog/2009/03/cristappointed_judge_faces_scr.html
 Hurley also took criticism in 2009 when he got upset over a comment on the JAABlog that revealed the location of the judge's wedding. The judge called the blog to try to learn the identity of the commenter. When that didn't work, 
Hurley phoned the Broward Sheriff's Office to see if there was a way for him to learn the commenter's identity. Is there some connection with the Sheriff?Apparently Robert Hannans Facebook Friend Abuses Power
looks as if Judge Hurley is using his power as a Judge to try and find
out online identity of an anonymous blogger seen here: http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/pulp/2009/12/judge_jay_hurley_tries_to_bust.php
Robert Hannan currently owes and in a civil suit against him for 250,000.00 in Marina Garcia Woods court, THE same Judge that presided over several of his divorce cases, now presides over his debt, isn't that  interesting? I wonder If Robert Hannan's divorce cases were favored? 
Does he know this judge? Is he friends with this judge?
 
Robert Hannan has obtained multiple tickets and fighting  them with Judges, He also appears for a Tyler Hannan? for evaded toll. Is Tyler a relative? This further proves he has more connections doesn't it?
 
Recently Robert Hannan and Joyce Julian have been making negative headway's with clients posting about them 
online since 2007. Further people are researching these attorneys with clients claiming, he basically told me to shut up to filing paperwork late, to not returning phone calls etc. People claim He has dragged divorce over a year,possibly  to recoup his 250,000. It appears people are afraid to report them to the Florida Bar in fear of retaliation with
the apparent friendship and connections.This is frightening Joyce Julian and Robert Hannan operate out of, 404 Southeast 14th Court, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33316. Joyce Julian if you remember in the early 2000s was a sitting Judge in Fort Lauderdale Florida, the same city where 5 attorneys were disbarred from in November 2011. The Sun Sentinel reports Joyce Julian in December 08, 2001, Broward Circuit Judge Joyce Julian's run-in with police at a North Florida resort a week ago was the second time in 15 months she had been involved in an alcohol-related police call. Security personnel found the judge, disoriented and naked from the waist down, in a third-floor hallway of the resort, where she was 
attending a meeting of the Florida Conference of Circuit Judges.See Here http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2001-12-08/news/0112070864_1_judge-s-home-joyce-julian-circuit-judges
And See Here : http://www.noethics.net/News/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=878:is-attorney..
 
On Sept. 23, 2000, Plantation Police responded to a late-night domestic disturbance call at the judge's home in the south part of the city, according to the officer's report on the incident. ""At the scene, I met with Joyce Julian [mother] and Elyse
Julian [daughter],"" Officer John Velez wrote in his report. ""Both subjects advised that they were involved in a verbal argument that escalated into a minor altercation. While interviewing both parties, it was apparent to me that Joyce Julian had been drinking and was somewhat intoxicated."" Now Lets look at Robert Scott Hannan, Broward County Public Search has Robert Scott Hannan ticketed with no license, as well as hunting/fishing/trapping without a license, and appears Robert Hannan took these to court to fight them, Isnt that costing the tax payers  money?
I wonder why people claim Robert Hannan writes to Judge Hurley on Facebook? The same judge that was reported by the Sun Sentinel as being accused of injecting his ""personal, political and religious views"" into a case.
 
One must wonder what kind of connection this Robert Hannan may have? When you research Robert Hannan on Broward county, you will see he has a pending issue with apparently a mortgage company in the amount of 
250,000.00 in Marina Garcia Woods courtThe Same Judge that presided over many of Robert Hannans divorce cases , what is going on?
Robert Hannan is affiliated with Women In distress,according to avvo.com, 
One person on Yelp alleges Robert Hannan preys on women, and another alleges Robert Hannan told them to""basically Shut up""
 
People allege that Robert Hannan and Joyce Julian write their own positive reviews to try and remove negative behavoir, but I managed to recover some negative posts below.
Here are recovered negative reviews online about Robert Hannan (taken from yelp.com)
 
Terrible attitude and quality. He didnt file a financial doc until after it was due and almost got me in hot water. He also basicly told me to shut up everytime I needed to discuss my case. He didnt even know his assistant had already collected key information. Almost seemed to be sabotaging my custody case. His who scene is very shady and he wants to 
be paid up front because he knows you wouldnt pay him after he screws upyour case and tells you how hes gonna win.
 
This Robert Hannan  really sounds like a crap hole and should be reported for SCAMMING people and taking advantage of their emotions. I know this guy and have seen the way he operates, he sucks big time and is in it all for the 
cash. I certainly wouldn't recommend him to anyone because he's a opportunist from what I've heard who prays on woman.
 
This person accuses him of preying on women, keep in mind avvo.com has Robert Hannan affiliated with Women In Distress....connecting the dots?moving along.....read his website and you will see what kind of guy he 
is........
 
Interesting, now lets take a look at online reviews practices with Robert Hannan (courtesy google reviews) Seen Here: Joyce Julian Negative Reviews

Read this and do your homework first Panel Drops Complaint Facing Judge
January 13, 2003| By Ardy Friedberg, Florida Correspondent The commission that disciplines Florida judges has dropped a complaint against Joyce Julian, who lost her bid for re-election to the Broward Circuit Court in
November.Allegations of drunken behavior and lying to law enforcement officers stemmed from an incident in December 2001. Julian, 45, was arrested after being found drunk and partially undressed at a judicial conference at the Amelia Island Plantation Resort near Jacksonville, according to police.The incident was compounded when she said she had 
been drugged and sexually assaulted.The Nassau County Sheriff's Office declared the drug and assault accusations ""unfounded"" later that same month. Disorderly intoxication charges against the judge were dropped 
because she enrolled in a 30-day alcohol-rehabilitation program.The Judicial Qualifications Commission on Tuesday issued a one-sentence notice of dismissal, which said, ""The Investigative Panel . . . hereby dismisses the Notice of Formal Charges without prejudice."" Without prejudice means they could be filed again, though the commission loses 
its jurisdiction over judges once they leave the bench.Julianis still a licensed attorney and The Florida Bar could proceed against her, but Julian's attorney, Michael Dutko, said on Friday that he knows of no further action pending against her. ""We have had no notification from the state Bar or any reason to think that will occur,"" he said. 
Julian is currently ""exploring various career options in the private sector,"" Dutko said. Julian could not be reached for comment. As a Judge... she put my 5 year old child and myself out on the street after ""landing"" her as my judge in 2003. I filed a domestic abuse case, with law enforcement backing me and photos of the investigation. My ex was 
law enforcement... she took care of him. She put my home up for sale since I was a stay home mother and couldn't make the payment. She was voted off the bench. Local law enforcement negotiated that issue for her. Her last case was mine... Dec 2003. She showed up 20 minutes late, drunk and under the influence of some other kind of
drugs as well.... it was overwhelmingly obvious to everyone in the room. She had been out all night partying. Be very careful... I would NEVER want what my child and I have been through to happen to ANY other 
family no matter what the case is. Signed, Someone who cares
 Avoid this law firm!! was referred to this lawyer for my divorce. turns out she was a judge kicked off the bench for unprofessional behavior. she handed the case to her junior associate who proceeded to bungle the 
whole case all the while running up bills of $20000. when she got in over her head, she withdrew from the case leaving me high and dry, without a lawyer, a mess of problems and now she wants to get paid for the rest of the work she supposedly did. watch these people like a hawk,they will rip you off. they are supposedly good mediators but if you 
need a lawyer that will be your advocate and defend and protect you against some other sleezebag attorney look
elsewhere. broward county is disgusting. all the lawyers are buddies regardless of how they may appear in court, they are looking out for themselves only. to hell with their clients. i have been told of cases involving these guys on opposite sides of divorce cases teaming up to drag things out for months and months just to continue milking the 
client for more and more
 
I noticed that people are accusing Robert Hannan and Joyce Julian for writing their own positive reviews 
online, it may appear so now wouldnt it? I found that Yelp filtered reviews, they were flagged, I wonder WHO would flag negative reviews and keep a positive that looks as if it were written by an attorney?
 
Keep in mind in Novemebr 2011 5 attorneys were disbarred in fort Lauderdale, the same town that these attorneys practice in.
 
Natalie Kay also operates out of this address with Robert S Hannan and Joyce Julian, lets take a look at what
Robert Hannan and Natalie Kay have in common, well According to BrowardCounty Clerk, they both handle divorces and domestic issues with them, this is odd dont you think? It appears that some of this firms clients 
file domestic violence, surely the attorneys are not telling their clients to do that right? That would be a false report, wouldn't it? How can these attorneys operate together in the same office or divorce cases, or even domestic cases, when Joyce Julian claims she was sexually attacked? Wouldn't that be a conflict of interest to opposing counsel, 
and SHOW a Biased toward men ???Especially since Robert Hannan is affiliated with Women in Distress according to avvo.com and he is affiliated with womensdivorcelawyer.com??? Does Robert Hannans male clients see justice? Does Robert Hannans opposing husbands see justice, or are they in fact biased as it would appear? But hey 
thats my opinion with information I gathered to present to you.
With the reviews it seems that Robert Hannan and Joyce Julians male clients get the short end of the stick and opposing males get the short end of the stick. Could this be because the ex Judge Joyce Julian claimed assault on a man?
 
Robert Scott Hannan, Fort Lauderdale,
Natalie Kay, Joyce Julian operate out of the same office/firm. Robert 
Scott Hananan was ticketed for hunting/fishing/trappingwithout a license viewed here: 
http://www.clerk-17th-flcourts.org/BCCOC2/OdysseyPA/CaseSummary.aspx?CaseID=3746327&hidSearchType=party_case&DisplayCitation=yes&CaseNumber=04089630TI40A&SearchType=
 
He also had ticket for no drivers license, apparently has no respect for 
the law in which he practices . These tickets can be verified on Broward
County Clerk here: 
http://www.clerk-17th-flcourts.org/BCCOC2/OdysseyPA/CaseSummary.aspx?CaseID=4379570&hidSearchType=party_case&DisplayCitation=yes&CaseNumber=09080687TC30A&SearchType=
 
Now Joyce Julian, she was a Broward Circuit Judge,KICKED OFF THE BENCH  
Joyce Julian's run-in with police at a North Florida here in the Sun 
Sentinel: Joyce Julian PA
 
Then Natalie Kay and Robert Hannan are divorce attorneys, but why is it several of their divorce cases have a domestic violence attached and why did a lady write on google reviews that Joyce Julian 
was her attorney and she filed a domestic issue? It kinda seems like a pattern,  Again it appears there may be some bias toward men at this firm.
 
Why are people claiming online reviews that Robert Hannan TOLD them to file a report?
I think we need to watch Robert Hannans cases and Joyce Julians cases VERY CAREFULLY
in 2012, and how the Judges of Broward County TREAT them, because 5 ATTORENYS have been disbarred all in Fort Lauderdale, where Robert Hannan and Joyce Julian practice, along with Natalie Kay. 
View Here: 5 attorneys Disbarred in Fort Lauderdale For corruption
I still would like to think that our Judges aforementioned or any in Broward for that matter, got mixed up on Facebook without any knowledge of Robert Hannan or Joyce Julians reputations which apparently precede 
them.After all people can write what they want online according to the 1st amendment and have their privacy protected.
If you look here Robert Hannan is in court for a mortgage debt of 250,000.00 and people claim he drags out divorces over a year, could it be to recoup money? Here is proof
http://www.clerk-17th-flcourts.org/BCCOC2/OdysseyPA/CaseSummary.aspx?CaseID=2643986&hidSearchType=party_case&DisplayCitation=no&CaseNumber=CACE10030392&SearchType=   
Seems like he tries to hold people responsible for things he avoids, 
see the hypocrisy?
 
Furthermore there is a connection with Joyce 
Julian, Robert Hannan petitioned to divorce his wife Laura M Hannan 
6-26-1995 and retained..........yup Joyce Julian, who later became a 
judge, interesting isnt it? See evidence here: 
http://www.clerk-17th-flcourts.org/BCCOC2/OdysseyPA/CaseSummary.aspx?CaseID=1441945&hidSearchType=party_case&DisplayCitation=no&CaseNumber=FMCE95008791&SearchType=
 
Seems like an office full of attorneys who resorts to scare tactics, and remember the old 
saying, Birds of a feather flock together? You do the math, dont take 
my word for it, make your own decision, do your research, I gave my opinion, with research
online and you can give yours.I have suffered immensely from This Robert Hannan and his unethical antics, threats and harassment toward me. 
 
Now going back to Robert Hannans Facebook he is friends with Carlos Rebollo, a Circuit Court Judge, group 22 wonder what that means? http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000083176507&ref=pb
 
Robert Hannan is also friends with Kenneth and Micahel Kaplan, Surely he is not friends with Judge Michael Kaplan?? WOW this seems to go deep. See Here: http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=702443710&sk=friends&v=friends
Then divorce court is transferred to Marina Garcia Wood,the same judge that presides over many of Robert Hannan, And his firm's divorce cases, Remember Marina Garcia Wood transferred and now is currently presiding over Robert Hannans civil debt $250,000.00 the same civil debt, which clients claim he drags out divorce over a year....possibly 2 years to help recoup his debt. that is weird isn't it??? 
Lets hope that Judge Marina Garcia Woods is firm and fair with Robert 
Hannan, and treats him like any other citizen of Broward County
So do the math, Robert Hannan and his firm have clients that file or possibly had clients domestic violence 
with a divorce which Judge Kaplan handles.
Why would this firm do this?? Is it because a domestic issue is one case and a divorce is another that equals 2 case$. ? Hmm It seems it is money related now doesn't it?
Keep in mind Robert Hannan is currently pending in Marina Garcias Woods court for $250,000.
This information showing connection pertaining to the people attacking clients through what I consider to be unethical means, opposing attorneys need to move to dismiss any and all legal actions against  from this particular court on the grounds of possible bias and corruption coming from this legal firm and its connections to the current court over any case and others alike client and opposing.
I would also move to have others entire case transferred to another county and under the authority of a different judge if at all possible as we don't know how deep this runs in Broward County, or at least another unrelated judge there in the county until an investigation is finished upon Joyce Julian, Robert Hannan, Natalie Kay and anyone else 
that is or has operatedwith these attorneys.
Not only does Hannan have a history of legal abuse from people reporting him online, but he continues to show 
his negative antics allegedly on his professional business sites by outlining how he deals with the husband of a particular case concerning moving his Clients out of the courts reach, filing for domestic violence orders against the husband etc. Robert Hannan is affiliated with Women in distress and apparently takes on several women as clients, 
interesting? Wouldn't this be biased toward men once again? And If Robert Hannan does take on a man, would they benefit from hiring him or his staff, especially Joyce Julian?
He also seems to demonstrate a close and unprofessional relationships with others working there in the
same office, whom some of which have been terminated from the bench for whatever reason and moreover, seem to have a highly stereotypical outlook on the male gender whom further, effects the way they handle each case as it comes in, as Joyce Julian claimed sexual assault.
That again, seems to be geared to cause great emotional and financial damage to not only the other side, but to their client as well Robert Hannans office, and because Joyce Julian claims she was assaulted, this makes her biased toward domestic violence cases, in which Robert Hannan and the like practice and shows biased toward the 
male gender.
Here is more Evidence that Robert Hannan may be biased toward the male gender he is affiliated with womensdivorcelawyer.com People complain tha tRobert Hannan an dJoyce Julian coerce exuberant amounts of child support, here are reviews to back up these statements:Joyce Julian  (seems i am not the only one with issues)
Attorney ReviewsReview:     totally disregards clients needs or wants/ requests. does not appropriately communicate with clients. inappropriate billing/ over billing. attorney says she is going to do something and does not 
follow through. does not communicate what is going on with the case whatsoever, you have to chase her for answers. does not return phone calls in a timely manner. delegates EVERYTHING to someone who is incompetent and then says its to save her clients money but in the long run all the back and forth with the incompetent individual costs more than the attorney fee per hour of service. tells client to be calm in court and she gets nasty with judge so judge throws 
case out leaving client with a bill and ABSOLUTELY NO RESULTS! in 8 months all that has been done was child support more than tripled. no increased visitation until 8 months after retaining her services. child support order reduction put 
in place after 5 months of asking to do so. 3 days before hearing she cancels hearing and withdrawls
Added on 0000-00-00Review:     Has a troubled history as a general master and a judge.Bad attitude and unprofessional towards clients and judges.Is a known manhater that never found a divorce case in favor of the male when she was a 
judge.She even has sabotaged the cases of her own male clients so their wives would get everything.A truley manhating psycho that needs to be disbarred!Added on 2009-03-30Review:     one word...HORRIBLE word to the wise don't listen to word she says at initial consultation most of her few clients that she has had leave as a result of her lies also her staff leaves as well 
Added on 2011-05-25Review:     Horrible attorney OVERBILLS! She promises all kinds of things at initial consultation and tells you she wil fight for you and how she is an experienced judge and then once she gets your retainer, you can 
never get her to talk to you. She must not have a lot of clients because she is always doing mediation. She is a mediator and is always ""out in mediation"" yet your bills reflect she works like night and day on your case. She bils you for 
research and preparation then when it is time to go to court on a motion she tells you it is in your best interest not to go and that she predicts you'll loose the motion and it will look bad for your case. Due to her past arrest and 
legal problems with the law, it seems like she is afraid to go before a Judge. 
She overbills for ""research and preparation"" then does nothing. All you get are bills no outcomes. She is the worst attorney. Dana Swickle an attorney that had worked for her is amazing but she left the firm to go out on her own. She is in Fort Lauderdale check her out if you plan to hire a divorce attorney, she will fight for your case. Don't waste a dime on Joyce Julian, in my opinion the Judges dislike her.
Added on 2011-04-26Review:     Aggressive with her clients very very rude
Now people claim she is aggressive toward clients, remember in the beginning I gave links to where she was in a domestic dispute, not once but twice? It seems her behavior is the same in the office as it is in her private life doesn't it?
These above are my opinions with facts I found online and Broward County Clerks, my personal experience and of course other online reviews on these above aforementioned. I hope someone out there is strong enough to stand up 
and report them to the bar, I cant be the only one suffering.
These attorneys need to be PERMANENTLY DISBARRED",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										Carleton Thomas told me he has a doctorate in law.  He has the initials LLB and then LLD after his name on his business cards.  I found out by ringing the University of Queensland, St Lucia, that to have a doctorate in law which is an LLD, you have to do a LLB (law degree) BUT ALSO HAVE TO DO A MASTERS IN LAW (LLM).  So Carleton Thomas should have LLB, LLM and LLD.  Carleton Thomas is a nutcase and a fraud.  Google ""Carleton Thomas Phoney"" and you will see what I mean.  Also, google ""Carleton Thomas anzmi"" and see what you come up with.  He is a con man; con artist and takes advantage of people wanting a lawyer and pay him big money and he does not come up with any legal documents or work; just a lot of hot talk and puff and pant and nothing happens.  He drops your case at the steps of the courthouse claiming that you have abused him or some rot and then he takes off down the road leaving you to appear in court yourself!  I have found from talking to others in Woodridge area that he turns up at the Lions Club at Woodridge, with business cards, and stands in the beer garden handing his cards out to all the misfits there up on drug charges and assault charges.  Found out he charges them $200 for an hour of advice; that adds up to a lot of big bucks if you have 10 of them in a week:  $200 cash - NON TAXABLE!!  He does not have a law degree despite his employer Paul Donnelly (who, mind you WAS HIS LAWYER IN THE FRAUD CASE which police charged him for) saying that ""Mr Thomas told me he has a lawyer degree and I have no reason to believe otherwise"".  What a great coverup.  Paul Donnelly from Donnelly Lawyers now EMPLOYS CARELTON THOMAS AS A LAW CLERK - and ""Dr Thomas"" works from his housing commission house at 16 Stirling Street, Rochedale South, Brisbane.  If you are a doctor in law - why the heck do you live in housing commission at $60 a week?  THIS IS A BIG WARNING FOR ANYONE SEEKING LEGAL SERVICES FROM CARLETON THOMAS - and in fact Paul Donnelly who covers up for Carleton Thomas.  CARLETON THOMAS NEEDS TO BE ARRESTED ONCE AGAIN like he was back in April 2011 (see the Courier Mail and Sunday Mail articles about him) and be locked in jail and throw away the key.  I suppose PAUL DONNELLY FROM DONNELLY LAWYERS IN UNANDERRA would once again represent this fraud.  What legal ethics does Paul Donnelly have I ask?

										Commissioner Jon W Norheim Killed my father!
In the fall of 2011 I filed a rip-off report exposing the corruption taking place in the Las Vegas family court.  One year has passed and my father is dead.
Jon W Norheim and Patience Bristol attempted to solicit a bribe of $100,000 in exchange for a favorable ruling for my father.  I followed my friends advice who worked for the Department of Justice and refused to make the payment.  Jared Shafer, the guardian for my dad responded by making my fathers living conditions a living bad dream.  Dad died of dehydration in July of 2012.  The police, FBI and the Nevada attorney general Ms. Masdo mockingly stated my case is a civil matter.  No one listened and nothing was accomplished. Two days ago I ran across Jon W Norheim at a democratic fund raising event in Las Vegas.  He approached me and said Im not sorry about what happen to your father.  If you were reasonable and took Patience Bristols suggestions your dad could have been living with your family in Seattle today.  Unfortunately you followed the wrong path, which lead to his death.  Norheim went on and said you have only yourself to blame.  You might ask yourself who is Jon W Norheim and how can he treat people in this manner?  Jon W Norheim is a lawyer for the mob.  This individual has a life filled with corruption, fraud and the guilt of countless suffering seniors who fell into his corrupt court.  Jon W Norheim thought nothing about defending a Las Vegas mob figure who crippled and killed a man who attended a topless bar in Las Vegas.  The American Mafia publication will reveal Jon W. Norheims distorted history and the name of the mob figure who committed this horrible crime.  Jon Norheim never thinks twice about assigning seniors to Jared Shafer, Las Vegas most corrupt guardian.  Jon Norheim considers the theft of senior property to be a normal method of doing business in the guardian ship industry.  For Jon Norheim a new day brings another crime.  The Las Vegas court is very open about the fact it is mob controlled.  In fact Norheim uses the Senior Citizens Law Project as a tool for laundering money.  If you research the Senior Citizens Law Project you will find it is not registered as a business in Nevada or in Clark County, but this business has a bank account at the Bank of Nevada. The Senior Citizens project lies in court to allow Jon Norheim and Jared Shafer to drain senior accounts dry.   Its just one crime after another when it concerns Commissioner Jon W Norheim.  Reports will continue to be filed and perhaps someday justice will be the result. Until that day arrives, seniors will have to suffer and die.

To this day he has not paid us back and is still getting away with this.His partner in crime is OJ Odunna, who also has a criminal record. OJ had his license revoked and falsely advertises himself as a lawyer. Darryl Mitchell lets OJ do his dirty work and he allows it since he has a law degree. OJ was also indicted for stealing thousands of dollars for filin fake paperwork in connection to a mortgage scheme in Florida in 2008.This unethical behavior needs to be stopped. Please warn all your friends and family to steer clear of these two crooks. Please do your research before hiring a lawyer. Log onto any state bar website and type in the lawyer's name and you can view all disciplinary actions against them. We filed a complaint with the better business bureau as well as the Florida bar and will also file a police report.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										David Edward Lederman, California attorney, is AN EVIL, UNETHICAL, DISHONEST, SLANDERER, MISOGYNIST & THIEF. 
I'm a very close relative of David E. Lederman. For almost 4 years, my late husband & I let David stay our my homes as if they were his (under the condition that he would provide legal work for us. Lederman was a bum who quit his job at Greenberg Glusker in Century City, CA after he got passed up for partner. Lederman moved into one of my homes w/o our permission, while we were on our honeymoon. Being that he's my blood relative, I didn't have the heart to kick him out & let him be homeless. He's extremely cheap & would not pay for his apartment once he quit his job b/c his overly Huge, narcissistic ego could not handle that the someone else was chosen over him to be partner. Furthermore, Lederman is much too lazy & uncreative to be an entrepreneur & start his own business.
I took care of his expenses -- food, shelter, utilities, cars, car insurance, maids/housekeeping, & country club memberships. David was an inconsiderate, rude, messy, unpleasant, argumentative, & ungracious guest. David Lederman felt entitled to everything that I have (without asking), & he wouldn't lift a finger to help me. Furthermore, he covered for my husband -- while my husband was cheating on me. I'm a blood relative of David, yet he betrayed me & covered for my husband, who is not a blood relative. David Lederman did not give me one drop of empathy or compassion when I learned my husband was cheating on me. Instead David was mean, nasty, & blamed me for being a bad wife. I was always a loyal & devoted wife, yet David slandered & defamed me. He blamed me, the victim, when my husband was the cheat. He turned the story around & told everyone that I was the one cheating on my husband. David Lederman is extremely sleazy, slimy, greedy, lazy, arrogant, unethical, dishonest, sexist & chauvinistic -- he treats women worse than objects. David doesn't realize that women are human beings with brains, feelings, emotions & equal rights. David thinks it's perfectly normal & acceptable for men to commit adultery & treat their wives like sh*t. 
David Lederman lies like he breathes. David Lederman has no integrity & completely lacks morals & ethics.  When I learned that David Lederman made alibis for my husband, I kicked him out of my house. David stole my jewelry -- including my wedding band & engagement ring. Lederman then moved in w/ my late husband & my late husband's girlfriend. David Lederman is a prideless, groveling obsequious sycophant, & criminal.  David Lederman is one of the most evil, unethical, greedy, dishonest, sexist, liars, & thieves that I have ever even heard of. Please protect yourself from this phony.
David E Lederman. He thinks he's g-d just because he went to Harvard undergrad & Harvard Law & because he's got a penis. David Lederman is a first class phony, & the worlds most horribly attorney.

										Debra stated before I paid her, in 2/2010 on my first visit, that if I needed to change my separation to a divorce at some point in the process, the time for it to finalize would not be lengthened, and that it would not cost me anymore. Satisfied with that answer, I paid her. Up to that point she went out of her way to advise me and counsel me, to the point irritation; telling me she was more on my side than his, to see a therapist, to divorce him before I got AIDS like another woman she knew. I just wanted a legally sound agreement, with no bias as my husband and I were agreeable to the terms. However, Debra was actually highly recommended by 2 of my friends (one of whom later changed her opinion of Debra due to the way her own experience with her ended), hence my decision to ignore the sudden claims of affection and strange unrequested loyalty  (""you are very dear to me Amy"" -this from a woman who had met with me 3 times) and engage her legal services.When I later informed her that I had decided on divorce (about August 2010), she said it would cost 350 or so more. I reiterated what she told me before about it not costing more, and she became defensive and said that I could get in trouble for receiving a waiver for the original filing fee. [When I first came in, my husband and I had a fair amount of money and could easily have afforded the extra fee for filing, on top of the 1,500.00 to Debra. I told her we could afford it, and she said ""If you do not have a job, you don't have to pay it"" and I said ok. Later she tried to turn it around and threaten me with it] She hung up on me (the first of about 3 times - the last 3 calls I have had with her -me being very calm and nice and her being quite antagonizing, talking without letup and needless to say not helping me, her client, at all). When she finally returned my calls about a week later, she said the price was now higher, about 400 or 500. I said, ok, I don't have that, (as at that point I was quite broke, with no financial support or job) but I will look into it. Now being a bit wiser, I asked her to give me something in writing stating for X amount of dollars she would do X (finish my divorce). She stated quite rudely ""I'm not going to waste my time with that"" and talked non stop for about a minute before hanging up on me again. I called back and left several very pleasant messages (not wanting to set off this obviously crazy person to whom I had paid a fortune and had my legal future in her hands) asking for a simple email. This was never done. She does not return my calls, and I have no idea if my husband was served (he says he never got any papers), or if my case was filed at all. It has been about a year since I have heard from her, despite my having left voice mails, and of course paying her 1,500.00 which I have since learned is about what an attorney would charge for a non contested divorce like mine. I am now faced with doing this divorce myself, with little to no money, and do not even have a case number, as she is completely AWOL.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										Don't trust this mail order lawyer. Had a charge from a vacation trip in Myrtle Beach and kept receiving his junk mail weekly when I got back home. Finally after talking with my wife and taking the case as far personally as we could we decided to call him and see what he could do. 
Basically all he could do is take my $1,500 forget to file motions, forget to evidence in a case, have his first year assistant Matt (who knew nothing of the case) answer questions, and then try to force me to take a deal. 
My first offer was for 1 day given time served and 3 charges dropped. The city had no case and didn't want to pursue. All this was based on my previous work of getting motion of discovery and evidence before hiring Mr. Frederick. I refused and Bobby said he would get a hearing for the missing evidence. 7 months he did nothing and then when he tried to get me take a plea deal I wouldn't. [continued below]....
									
										..... 
When he found out he'd actually have to go to the evidence hearing or resign his position he chose to email me at night, tell me quit and to never contact him. Lost evidence, time, money and more with this guy who never even had the decency to tell me couldn't fulfill his contract properly and tried to weasel his way out the last.
He basically just stole my money and when finally questioned why he hadn't done nothing on the case tried to quit and hide. I promptly filed a complaint with the bar.  
He's big on mailer advertisements so if you get one just steer clear. Lazy would be the best word for him if he already wasn't a liar. At first consultation you'll probably get the creepy feeling anyway though as he believes in half buttoned shirts rather than a professional presentation.
He told my wife he couldn't do his job contracted for and for me to just do what the solicitor wants. Asking yourself if you want that type of defense?									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										Frieda Gordon billed me $700 for a telephone consultation which was at best unhelpful, and at worst, outright theft. Before the consultation, I had to sign a contract along with credit card approval documents stating that she would bill me for $350 for one hour of phone consultation and an additional $350 for one hour of ""document preparation time"". During the 47 minute phone consultation, which I recorded, she gave me only generic information regarding California probate law. When I questioned Ms. Gordon about the particulars of my case, she was obviously unprepared. On the recording, I can be heard asking her four separate times, ""Did you read the documents?""  When I mentioned the name of the primary actor, a person whose name appears 122 times in the documents, (I did a word count) she had to ask me who that person was.  Looking back, I should have terminated her right then over the phone.  I have listened to the recording multiple times and have become convinced that Frieda Gordon is truly the embodiment of all  that can go wrong with a private practice attorney; she is corrupt and incompetent.  Before I could send her a  letter of termination, I received a new and unexpected contract from her in which she had raised her hourly billing rate to $400 per hour!In my research, the lowest advertised fees I found for probate attorneys in California were  $180 an hour. The fees charged by Cooper-Gordon are at the very top end of the scale. I recommend contacting one of the attorneys  listed on Bill Handel's web site located here:  http://www.handelonthelaw.com/home/  The method of screening these attorneys is not described anywhere on Bill Handel's site, but every single attorney I contacted answered my questions intelligently via e-mail, free of charge.Regarding Frieda Gordon's client-attorney contract; it is massive and curiously detailed. In it, she attempts to indemnify herself from every possible accusation a client could possibly make regarding ""creative billing"".  After looking it over again, I couldn't help but wonder if it was a catalog of past client billing accusations against her. Truly an odd document, which in my opinion, falls suspiciously short of what a good faith client-attorney  contract should be.One last comment. Negative reviews about professionals such as this one are typically short lived on the net. This is because attorneys, doctors, accountants etc, who garner these type of reviews employ ""reputation repair"" services. As of this writing in 2011,   I was able to find only one brief and poorly written positive review on Frieda Gordon, and not a single negative review, despite her being a practicing attorney for more than 25 years.

										Glenn John Niemela claims to to be an attorney specializing in civil and commercial litigations. However what He really specializes in is scamming people. He's a professional crook and he should be in jail.
Here is a list: charging clients (friends of mine) ridiculous amounts of overages in fees, overtime charges for when his secretary works after hours, photocopies at .50 cent a page and make 2500 copies, charge you every time he makes a call and doesn't get a hold of you and keep doing so until he's racked up 3 hrs of attempted phone calls at 350$ per hour. 
He claims to do ""Legal searches"" but doesn't even bring the case to court. I am talking Federal court case amounts. Hundreds of thousands of dollars taken and no one knows where it goes.
He also purposefully mis calculates hours which he ends up charging several thousand dollars more than he should and his clients never get their money back. 
I've looked up his history. Niemela has done this every time to previous clients and I'm pissed that he's getting away with it still.  
He has 23 of his own personal cases where he's been charged for not paying credit institutions, banks and other business institutions, his own mortgage, car and fails to report taxes and not claiming what he charges in taxes to his clients. He's a thief and a crook! He's steals from innocent people he vows to help and steals from the Government without a second thought about the consequences.
Any contract or agreement to charge his rates he adds a clause saying he's allowed to increase his hourly rate at any given time and if you don't pay he will immediately stop working with you. This is total thievery.
 Honestly, Niemela makes me sick to my stomach. He knows exactly what he's doing. Once he steals from you, you'll never be able to get a hold of him except for his secretary who will tell you he's not in his office or in a business meeting. You may leave a voicemail but there's no point as you'll never hear from him again.
He's ignored his court hearing dates, the BC Law Society, CRA, any trials against him and the judgements made against him are pretty much a worthless piece of paper because he hasn't paid what he owes to anyone. 
DO NOT sign any contracts to hire any services from Glenn J. Niemela as he's committed fraud and has a history of stealing his clients money and premeditatedly does so without any guilt or care in the world for anyone but HIMSELF. 
He should be stripped of his title as an attorney at law as he defiles the system and the profession used to help others to help himself. 
For a man getting away with violating every law and not doing his due diligence to the clients he represents Niemela should be removed from his so called profession. 
I SERIOUSLY advise working with Glenn Niemela. He's the last person anyone should choose to represent them in any matter. I wish I had known so my friends didn't get robbed by him. After 4 years, they are still fighting to get their money back. He's a crook and he knows it.
I hope you find this information helpful and save yourself the trouble of being robbed by this terrible person.
Spread the word. This man needs to be taken down.",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										Hi guys...I have been dealing with freedom and litvin for over 18 months now at $595 a month. How do u like that? I've heard it all. I have dealt with Jesica de la cruz, christine George (by the ways ...she is not the worst)...and Vivian Palinsula. This is how it goes. Supposedly the George lady was doing my loan mod and the Vivian Palinsula lady was doing the paperwork for the foreclosure defense (she is the foreclosure paralegal). I have been able to speal to Christine about 4 times. When I have a question about the foreclosure case Christine tells me she will transfer me to the Vivian lady. My gosh... this woman (Vivian Palinwhatever...%^&*%^&) never picks up the phone. Sometimes, i have gotten transfered and she says i will be with you and she never comes back on phone. In over 18 months i have spoken to this lady only once and ...this was 11 months ago...how do u like that? I had an attorney that supposedly was Adan Rey. This guy I have never been able to speak to. Then after that I spoken to another attorney (not the rey guy... the rey guy will never call you back no matter how many appointments you make) about three times. The new attorney whose name i cannot recall (I gotta say the guy was honest with me) told me that my audit revealed the bank had the original note and the mortgage and that I had to work with the bank. I told him that freedom had told me the bank had lost the note and that there was fraud in my loan. This new attorney at least was honest and told me he could not lie to clients. But that lady my gosh Vivian... she was supposed to schedule my mediation according to cristine george and she never did and for that reason i got a letter from the court i had not participated in mediation. what is the vivian lady doing?

										hi my name is wendy miles and i am contacting my local county board and state legislators to assist with any help i can get as a person fighting a child custody matter that I have been getting the run a rounds with. i expected that if I contact somebody high with some high authority, maybe i may get the help that im seeking. Well for starters my name
is wendy and I am 24 years of age. How my situation began was i just gave birth to a baby girl that i named Madison on April 29, 2012 , who is now 5 months old. My adoptive mother who adopted me when i was young, but is not the
biological grandmother to my child was given temporary custody over my child immediately after i gave birth. However this is not a woman i view as safe by any means, she legally adopted me when i was young but was also very abusive
physically towards me growing up, along with my adoptive family and my adoptive mothers friends to whom i was abused by sexually at the ages of 3-8. Right now I am trying to get my five month old away from this her and its been very hard.Due to the way i was treated as an adopted child myself as i mentioned my adoptive mother treated me harshly, i fear now for my daughters safety. I'll explain how she got temporary custody. my adoptive mother and i have not had
any contact with each other going for 6 years. after i graduated in 2006 around 17 or 18 and did some college i moved away from her in philadelphia to go to california because i was tired of my adoptive mother and adopted family
mistreating me. She now contacts me 6 years later this past January because she heard i was about to give birth to my first child , she even apologized to me for all the horrible things shes done to me as a child through my teens. so she
requested that i travel from california to new york being that new york was close to her where she lives in philadelphia &for me to give birth to my child close to her. i was very skeptical because this was the same woman who her and her family mistreated me growing up, but i thought that people would change. and she lied however setting me up. I ended up traveling 3000 miles on the greyhound bus and when i finally arrived to new york my adoptive mother never showed i called her and she didnt want to make any arrangements on where i was supposed to go. she left me nine months pregnant in the streets. and this wasnt the first time she has done this , when i was younger after being abused
, so she wouldnt deal with getting into trouble by the law if i was to tell on her , she usually threw me out so i wouldnt be around to speak up against her.Due to traveling so far and in the condition that i was in ,not being able to get back to california and nine months pregnant, i asked a maternity house to help me in my travels. the way i got treated by this maternity house after i
left the city to head towards spring valley new york and Westchester new york was very horribly. it was a home for pregnant women. two ladies bullied me requesting that i leave and why was i there if i had enough money to get from
california to new york when they didnt have much of any they said. i even had my education thrown in my face with two of the mothers stating since i have a diploma and college experience , then what was i doing there with them. when i
addressed it to the staff of the place they did nothing about it and ignored and the two females continued with their pestering. the room i slept in they would play on the door turning the knob back and forth and also opened my
bedroom door a few times. i told the staff again and they said that i comes off like i think that im better. i immediately then asked to speak to a higher authority to report the staff for not doing anything  that i would like to speak to their chairman.Immediately when i requested that, instead of answering my need the worker present got on the phone called an ambulance and had me escorted to a hospital.i didnt understand what the logic was or what was in common with what i was looking for by me going to a hospital. i thought i was getting checked out due to being nine months pregnant. Instead the maternity house had me escorted to a mental institution and lied and said that i was causing trouble at their maternity home. The hospital then called the maternity home who was told to pick me up from the hospital and the lady i threatened to report to her chairman refused to come. i ended up staying in the institution for 4 weeks because they said they couldnt let me leave unless i had somewhere to go. once they told me to leave i returned to the maternity home to retrieve my things and they took me to a different maternity house, as soon as i got there , they got on the phone again and had me escorted to a whole new hospital because i told them that i would still report them for not handling the inside of the home and for defamation of character by trying to make it appear like there was something wrong with me because they didnt want to get into trouble. the 2nd house then took me to another hospital to where i was held another 4 weeks until i went into labor they released me. when i gave birth to my child due to not having nowhere to go cps was immediately called to my delivery room. i tried to explain to them that i lived i california and my adoptive mother had requested that i traveled because she wanted to rekindle a relationship with me after my not feeling safe with talking to her for 6 years, but that she lied to me and never showed up. i explained that she wasnt a good parent and does lie alot but i believed her and came anyways. cps basically said if my adoptive mother was the one to ask me to come the least she couldve did was make arrangements and i wouldnt be in this situation and then on top of that had to go to two maternity houses that had me falsely hospitalized as means to cover themselves, for the things that was going on in their homes. when cps seen that documented not only did my adoptive mother messed me up but so did the two maternity houses and i was trying to explain to cps that there is nothing wrong with me and my adopted mother lied as well. Because of the whole situation when it came time for my daughter to have somewhere to go while i was traveling they called my adoptive mother and asked her if she can temporary watch my baby until i see if im going to stay or fly back home then i would have to fight for custody after. and i didnt understand she couldnt come through for me in the beginning, but when it came time to take my baby she came for that and i think shes a sick twisted woman. shes desperate for children when she was a foster parent when i was young that didnt go well. in addition i was adopted by her and i was mistreated by her and my adoptive family and now shes trying to take my baby away. she even went along with the story with the two maternity houses saying theres something wrong with me when there wasnt. im now considering suing my adoptive mother for defamation of character, emotional distress, and the two maternity houses i traveled to. i decided to stay in new york now with my fiance rather than go back to california. we are both in court working on gaining custody of my daughter to which my adoptive mother only has temporary custody over. and after i will continue to stay away from her shes done this before not just with me but other foster children when she does wrong she tries to persuade people that theres something wrong with the kids in her home, to make it look like we have the problems and not her. my mistake is that as a child to my teens i didnt speak up and sometimes my adoptive mother told me not to which she then had me being looked at like there was something wrong with me ;with her manipulating the system. i know not to travel for her ever again after this horrific experience, she even put two false police reports against me when i was younger after she physicaly attacked me stating that i had hit her first when i actually only pushed her off of me on one occasion in
self-defense when she was abusing me as a child and shes now using that past information by saying ive only been arrested twice in my life to keep my child. my fiance works with the nassau county fire department and police department &we have now been going to court to get my baby back from adoptive mom. To bring things in closure i read a website on situations like these and was told
to contact my local county board, state legislators& lawyers, i should get my child away from her soon though and will be suing these people ive met in my travels. My adoptive mother even said that shes not trying to keep my baby but
before i was pregnant , she was calling 24/7 to apologize for all the bad things shes done to me by trying to lure me in. after she lied and took my child now the phone calls have stopped she lied the courts to where my child is, saying that my child is at her house. however my adopted mother is a lesbian& has been hiding my child away at her girlfriends to whom i dont have no idea where the woman resides. my fiance & i are trying to fight for custody of my child and my adoptive mother even withdrew her petition so she wouldnt have to ever come new york ever again after hearing that we are fighting to get our daughter back. My adoptive mother has always been a evil person mistreated me when i was adopted by her and will do anything desperate to have children even if it has to do with luring me in like she did by
apologizing for all the mistreatment ,just to get close to take my child away from me.Furthermore i feel that cps did their assesment wrong rather than investigate due to the two girls bullying me at the maternity houses because i
argued back with them stating i was going to report them cps wrote that as me being a violent troublemaker, yet it doesnt make sense im 9 months pregnant when i was the one being attacked and due to my adoptive mother not showing up who use to abuse me when i was young, they wrote it as me and my child not having a place. But yet i live with my fiance. I feel that im having injustice done to me for other peoples actions that are trying to cover themselves for
there wrongs and i need immediate advocacy. I also dont feel that due to other individuals lack of care and  irresponsibilities to where i had to advocate for myself when it came to the good counsel maternity house and my adoptive mother was any reason to take my child away. i did nothing wrong to my baby and never even been around my child, my child was taken from me right from the delivery room. the hospital i gave birth in westchester medical center even falsely represented me i had gotten up a few times to use their phone to get ahold of my fiance due to my cell not working and they told cps that me getting up was considered stange behavior.The only time anthing physical ever happened was before i gave birth when my baby wasnt even in the world yet. the maternity house that lied having me falsely institutionalized after i threatened to report them for how they did nothing about the bullying . when i was at the institution i tried to explain to the staff how i was being falsely held there, a few of the workers ignored. i then started writing letters to the board of the hospital explaining my position and the more i did that the workers didnt want to get involved with me. one of the patients reacted to me filing a complaint due to them saying they were friends with the staff members. when that patient reacted and got mad about it me standing for myself they told and atleast 5 of the workers came over and began grabbing me and mind you im pregnant. they said that due to that patient being upset that it was considered as me being a bother. i was very much nine months pregnant they were tackling me very hard to the floor and i kept shouting to them that im not doing anything and stop im pregnant and that they were very much hurting me. when i held onto on the staffs hair to get her to let me go when i got discharged from the hospital ,that staff said she wanted to file charges against me saying that her hair got intentionally pulled. i spoke to a detective explaining how these individals were grabbing me and even ignored me alot when i start writing letters to the board and i was told by the detective not to worry about anything and that nothing bad was going to happen. the detective basically made me feel like i fell trapped into a bad situation with people that only protected themselves and the more i kept speaking up of their misconduct the more trouble it only caused for me. however i dont think that these situations involving other people with myself was no reason to take my baby away, i never did anything wrong to my child.",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

That really tells me it wasnt Lee on the phone.Also I keep getting papers almost everyother day from bank of america who I hired them to go after.Was wonder why if they have a letter from my attorney that they are now repersenting me why they aint getting any paper work.Every time I recieve something they want me to send it to them. So again why is it coming to me? Because they are a fraud!!! I guess if they are really working for me then they no the lastest actions taken. I have now got the attorney generals office involved. People like this need to be stopped before they take money from another person just looking to get help not RIPED-OFF.

										Hired him as attorney when getting a divorce. No kids involved, should be cut and dry. He billed me for $30,000 worth of services. I paid half, lost my job, lost everything in the divorce because he didn't do anything to represent me. After being harassed from my ex husband hired another lawyer and in two months and for $5000 this other lawyer cut the ties with my ex, got me everything back I had lost and accomplished way more than Craig Robertson and Robertson Associates had done in two years and $30,000!  He came after me for the $15,000 I still owed him even though I was in employees for half of 2011 and my taxable income was $8000 for that year.  He was even nice enough to add $3000 of late fees for me making my total $18,000 for a job not done!  I got a loan and paid him what I thought was a lump sum pay off of $8000. I never received another bill, email or phone call saying I owed anything else. Ten months later I go to pay for gas and my bank card won't work, they had frozen my account for non payment. I called and emailed them because this was Friday afternoon, I would be penny less all weekend if they didn't unfreeze my account. Around 4:30 Craig emailed me back to tell me my debt owed was $16,000 and he would not unfreeze my account until it was paid in full. My account is still frozen and no one has returned my emails. I bet his family doesn't go without a meal this weekend. If you want a lawyer who will fight for you, Craig Robertson and associates sat back and let my ex take everything from me. If you want a lawyer who will fight to make the most money for himself and not care who he hurts in the process then Craig Robertson and Associates his the guy for you. He claims to be a Christian community supporter but my dealings with him and his humanity have been a heartless money hungry lawyer who isn't even a good lawyer!

										Hired this attorney for a divorce case. Turned out to be the worst thing decision I ever made. Very early in the case, he started to do whatever he wanted, filing thousands of dollars of unnecessary notices and petitions, padded his bills, would not ever return a phone call or answer a letter so I had absolutely no idea what was happening.
I did know that he was refusing to follow my objectives and intentionally continually angering the other lawyer to rile him up and made it much harder to move forward and he would not call him back or mail documents to him. He was very good at dragging this out three times longer than necessary and billed three times he quoted fee. I eventually had him fired so the case could be finished....he wanted to drag it out for years. He is the worst, and a liar. Hard to believe a lawyer could get away with this.
I reported him to the local grievance committee so his unethical and unprofessional behavior could be sanctioned. This lawyer should not be allowed to treat clients this way, I hope people realize what he does before they suffer financially and emotionally for no reason.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										I am a retired, 71 YEAR OLD, senior citizen and my wife is still working hard to pay off our mortgage. She works hard for the money & Ive always been honest & forthcoming. Our home and 2 rentals are under water and we were hoping we could modify our loan. I got this letter from the mail from ALL STATE LAW GROUP which promised me a home loan modification. Being that I was in a bad position...I called and was roped in by one of their sales asscociates, ERIC LIU who are tied & affiliated with Realty Law Center. I was PROMISED the WORLD! And that I was going to get a modification! He said that my case was pre-approved, so I gave him THE downpayment of $4,500.00. I even got a confirmation from Bank of America that I am represented by a lawyer... so far, so good!  ERIC LIU made demand for my second payment and he wanted it WIRED ASAP, so I gave another $5,000.00 and my modification will come out in 30 days. When I didn't hear from him in 60 days after several emails and phone calls, I called BofA and they gave me a new phone number for the law office and the office name had changed to Realty Law Center. I should have known then that I was being scammed. I was eventually taken on by Realty Law Center. They changed their name from All State Realty to Realty Law Center, and everytime I called I was always speaking to another person or that the previously working person was magically not there anymore. I was never able to speak to a real person soon thereafter! Id always get answering services and nobody would EVER call me back! I literally called them 5-10x an hour just to speak to someone!Fast forward 1 year...to this date, I cannot get an honest answer from Realty Law Center about my modification. I spoke to Tracy Lee several times and he seemed very helpful! I have finally resolved to the fact that I was SCAMMED!

										I am a Senior Citizen (long winded) and I wanted a report of what seemed to be a simple search, namely to see if I was still married to my second wife (less than twenty years ago, in NYS). My Second moved out of state about ten years ago and it would be a bit onerous for me to travel there to check the Public Access Computer.
My Second does not ride on a broom but I wanted the specifics of our marital status without mixing it up with her.
There are reasons why older folks get married yet again. My reason is better health insurance. I'm not quite old enough for Medicare but I'm almost there. Almost doesn't count if you get really sick. The bills will kill you if not the physiological stuff.
Finally, the Itty Bitty Nitty Gritty.
I entered our married name on the splash page: http://www.govdivorcerecords.org/.
One Record Found in both our married name and her maiden name. Sounds reasonable. OK I gave them twenty five bucks for access.
Disturbing results:
""Searching One Billion Records""
Our married name: no records found.
Her maiden name: no records found
My name: no records found
Various misspellings used intentionally: no records found.
Each search result page had a splash hocking a Deep Comprehensive Search for forty clams a pop.
I was not stupid enough to fall for this nonsense.
I could see at that point, I had been taken. 
Just for laughs I entered my first wife's name (all permutations, less than 30 years ago, in NYS).
Not so remarkably at this point: no records found.
What is really remarkable is that I trotted my elderly fanny to downtown Manhattan and sure and behold my divorce record is there on the Public Access Computer.

										I am a victim of this marketing scheme used against lawyers who are sole practitioners. In the sales pitch they show inquiries by potential clients for the two months prior.  The sales pitch shows many valuable potential clients, a valuable source of business for an attorney seeking new clients. 
These hits were fraudulent. After 30 days in the plan, it is obvious that all they bring in is the clients having cases without any potential value for either the client or the attorney.
A related sales tactic is endorsements from attorneys who claim to have had great success using LegalMatch.  These endorsements are not truthful.  If the attorneys making the endorsements were subpoenaed, placed under oath, and challenged to provide evidence of the truthfulness of their statements, they would be revealed as co-participants in this fraudulent scheme.
A class action needs to be filed in California, with a punitive damage count, against not only the corporation, but sales representatives, and principal individuals managing and organizing the business.  A substantial non dischargeable judgment will shut this operation down.

										I am an experienced entrepreneur with more than 20 years of business experience. I have used quite a few attorneys throughout my business career. They each have obviously had various levels of success. Robert Zarco, however, has easily proven to be by far the worst of the worst.
Robert Zarco was very hard to reach. When he did bother to finally respond to telephone messages and emails, it was only after numerous repeated attempts. It was the most frustrating experience, and for what? I think to say that Robert Zarco was even mediocre as an attorney would be a huge stretch. I do not base that on my negative end result, but rather on Robert Zarcos professional performance. I think Robert Zarcos legal filings were poorly drafted and off point. I am not an attorney and I can see that, but the judge confirmed that in his ruling. I dont think hes very honest either. [continued below]....
									
										..... I believe his only concern is how much money he can make off of his clients.
I would never again consider hiring this guy Robert Zarco because I think he is the worst kind of attorney. I dont trust him as far as I can throw him. I think he gives all attorneys a bad name.

										I am currently living week to week making $10 an hour. Like so many I also had to start over and this is where I'm at in life....about 10 or 11 yrs ago I had the brilliant idea to not file taxes, that the IRS wouldn't care about little ol me. Uh uh stupid I know now. The IRS recently started garnishing my wages and seem to think that all I and my family need to live on is $305 a week. So I had seen so many tax masters commercials on tv and finally gave them a call. They contacted me the next day, went over everything, and told me it would be $5050.00 to fix the situation, being to file my 03,04,05,06,07,08,09,10,11 taxes. And to have the garnishment removed,and to act as negotiator with the IRS. They would then give me the option of paying the IRS or I could pay them which would be cheaper because they apply the payment to the principle rather than the interest. I was kind of surprised I wasn't expecting it to be so much, and asked if they would be working while I paid or did it have to be paid fist. The rep assured me that they would start the case while I paid and the garnishment would be off within 3 to 4 weeks. $500 to start the process, an additional $776 within 10 days and then $1000 a month for 4 months starting 3/15/12 which there was no way I could do. So that next week I paid an additional $2500 making my deposit to get everything goading $3000 . A whole lot of money for me. Ian the Mean time I told my company that my tax issues were being taken care of that the garnishment would be lifted soon, so they started giving some of the work to meagain, since I had been put on the back burner while the other guys that would actually benefit from the extra work were getting it. After about 4 weeks of not hearing from anyone I a called and the man I reached was I could tell trying to get rid of me, every time I sked a question I was put on hold at the end of it I was repeatedly told that they had everything they needed and would be in touch soon. I demanded to speak to someone and was given to another lady who tried to shoo me away, finally admitting that my case hadn't even been processed. She also said they would need to have a power of attorney and a copy of my garnishment order since it wasn't in my file, but that she would put my casetheoughwith a rush order. She said she would be in touch with me in the next day or few. 3 or 4 weeks later I called them again after having called and leaving messages and no response. The same guy answered and told me they had supposedly had a consultation with the IRS but couldn't do anything but repeat what was on the paperwork that I had sent them with the power of attorney.

										I am the former wife of Alan D Freer a family attorney in Las Vegas.  Recently a close friend called my attention to the numerous reports written about Alan and Jared Shafer.  As his former wife everything said in these reports are 100% true and accurate.  It was because of Alan Freer's criminal practices with Jared Shafer I divorced him and didn't ask for community property. Alan used to brag to me about the amount of money stolen from senior accounts by Jared Shafer and how Jared Shafer got away with it.  He told me of normal people who were declared incompitent so Jared Shafer and his friends could plunder the senior accounts.  Alan said ""bill high so the families can't fight back.""  One evening Alan said Jared Shafer will never release a guardianship because if the wards were still alive Mr. Shafer could be sued.  Alan said he thought Mr. Shafer made sure several of his wards or clients would die before their time so their estates could be closed.  Closing the estates prevented Jared Shafer from being sued under Nevada and California laws.  Alan believed all of this was funny.  Along with being a horrible husband, he enjoyed it when others were hurt.
The final straw came when I came home and found Alan in bed with two men in our bedroom.  Alan had been hiding the fact he was gay from me for ten years.  Alan believed I would not be home from my trip for two more days and what a surprise. My former husband is as bad as all of the filth who practice law in Las Vegas.  He lies, steals from people who can't fight back, pouts for days when he is angry, dresses up in womens clothes, and is a real slob.  The killing of old people is horrible.  The police and law enforcement in this town are bought off by Jared Shafer and Harry Reid.  The truth is out now and I hope something can be done.

Don't trust these people or waste your time and money to believe in them, they almost got me to a narve break down from what they did to me that day on 08/30/12, with no sense or conscious, these people they take our money to heart us, we give them the power to do that to us with no regret.
Again don't trust these people or give them the chance to hesrt you as they hearted me, and hearted other people too,search and read the others reviews and experiences before you hire these people, or any other people for services, be extra carfull, don't buy their lies or believe in it, and don't give them your money...

										I contacted Legal Zoom in order to obtain an LLC, file a DBA form, and obtain a tax ID number.  Simple...or it should have been.  I filled out the forms on their website and paid with a credit card.  I was given the option to pay extra for faster service or pay the regular fee for completion in 20 days. I chose the latter as the total cost was already several hundred dollars.
Thus, I did not expect everything to be completed that week, but I also did not expect the process to take nearly two months! To be fair, a Legal Zoom representative did call about three weeks ago to apologize for the delay. I told him of my growing dissatisfaction and the need for the documents so that I could begin to do business. He apologized and promised to have everything expedited to me in an overnight delivery. That delivery was to have included all three documents upon which I had been waiting. 
The delivery only included the LLC papers. There was a blank tax ID form included because, as they claimed, I had not asked them to prepare one. The DBA form was absent.
I called customer service. The lady who answered claimed that the DBA form is on its way, and that they had not been able to obtain the tax ID number as yet ""because the IRS website has been down."" She had no reply to my expressed doubt that it would have been down for a month. 
I may eventually receive the documents for which I paid. The fact is, however, Legal Zoom is SLOW. They are deceptively expensive. It starts cheaply enough, but there are lots of hefty extra fees built in for various important elements. Not buying them is kind of like buying a house without the windows or doors. They give conflicting messages without good explanations for the discrepancies. They are full of apologies but fail to make good on promises. 
In short, I cannot recommend them. Think twice and look elsewhere before considering.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

No surprises there as I had only sent about 7 lines worth and the most basic of details about my case.  Anyway he encouraged to me to call him back (I never did).About 20 seconds after I listen to the voicemail which i did immediately after he hung up, I receive an email from him saying that his retainer is $5,000 and there's a retainer agreement attached.  I'm sitting there saying to myself 'what the ****' not only have I never even spoken directly to the guy, i've not even told him much of my situtation and he fully admitted that he didn't know what I wanted to achieve, so how on earth can he expect to say he can help me and want me to sign a retainer agreement before even having a consultation???????  On top of that $5,000 is way to much!!!!!This  man has been on tv on various shows - just search You Tube for his name.To me and many others he is running a scam, I have not, and will not have any further contact with this so called gold digger (aka attorney).",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

Now I don't know how most bankruptcy attorneys conduct their business, but I can tell you that with the plethura of attorney options out there, Christi Giddeon PLLC is a terrible and bad choice.  After losing my money I did some research and well be careful when scouting for an attorney. Miss Giddeon used to work for Steven Langer and as far as I can tell, they were not only associates but they were also engaged at one point.  If you can trust your money to a woman who does insufficient work, mixes business with pleasure, and you want to hand over well over a thousand dollars rather quickly, then Giddeon PLLC is just what you're looking for.
DO NOT CHOOSE THIS ATTORNEY to handle your bankruptcy.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										I found this company online and they looked legitimate so I called up Kirk Wilhite, who told me to send summons and complaint along with a check for $75. I saw good things about them online (though they were dated from a few years ago). I sent everything and saw that the check was cashed a few days later. I didn't receive any confirmation that the suit was delivered, however, so I gave a call and he assured me that it would be. I called again the next week since I hadn't heard anything and it went to voicemail. I've called him many times and he hasn't picked up.
I talked with another process server company since I need to serve process ASAP and he told he he's heard of several other people in the past couple weeks that have paid to have summons delivered but for whom nothing has happened. It's clear that this is a scam; he'll take your money and never give you the services, and give you the run around. Under no circumstances should you use this service, I'm also planning on reporting it to the police.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										I got my mail the other day and had several 3rd party letters from attorneys. I opened one of them and it stated to contact them that they can help me because I am being sued. I googled the company as I had never heard of Midland Funding before. They told me it had been turned over to Kramer and Frank and gave me an 800 # to call. I tried calling and it rang and rang then went to a fast busy signal. So I went to the website and found a local # so tried that and the same thing happened. So I emailed them to please contact me since none of the #'s I received worked. So the next day I had two missed calls and no voicemail. I called the # back and it was Kramer and Frank. I gave them my info and asked why I was being sued that I hadnt received any phone calls or any type of letter or email stating I was past due on a past credit card. I spoke with Heather and she stated they sent two letters, but that by law they didnt need to call or send anything. This is messed up b/c I would have tried to set up payments before it got to this point. Like millions of other people I was laid off back in 08 and then again here just recently in 11. They said they would do the payments but that I still have to go to court that they cant dismiss it.

										I had a small state tax lien and my wonderful accountant and I worked together with my state to resolve it in my favor.  It's been resolved for over a year now.  Clear Creek got my name and number from a delinquent taxpayer publication and have been calling me incessantly at least once a week, sometimes several times a day, after being told hundreds of times that the matter was resolved long ago and they were working off outdated information.
They have accused me and my employees of lying, divulged confidential information to my employees, and refused to stop calling me, despite respectful requests to be taken off their calling lists.  The more I insisted they stop calling, the more they'd call.  It's become a game to them now to see how irate they can make me or how long they can get me to stay on the phone before I hang up on them.  When I don't answer the phone, they call back over and over until I unplug the phone.  This is a business phone!!!  
At this point it is completely obvious to everyone involved that I'd never use their services (which are utterly fraudulent and unnecessary as my state attorney general advised me) so it's become a malicious game with them.  
After speaking with the FCC and filing a report, I was advised to get their full business name and address and send them a cease and desist order by registered mail.  If they disregard written notice, my attorney advised me to record their call and then we can take action.  I have also been told to report this to my state attorney general (in process now) who will work with the Colorado Sate attorney general, to have this company investigated.  Information posted here will be useful so if anyone else reading this, hasn't reported yet, please do so.
I was also told that the way this company makes money is to tell people that old liens are still collectible and that they've collected monies and fees to satisfy consumers tax debts that either were already resolved, like mine, or could have been resolved quickly and inexpensively by the consumer.  Beware of anyone who takes money over the internet without full disclosure of who and where they are.  Clear Creek refuses to even accurately disclose what state they're in.

										I had an incident where I needed an immigration attorney.  In October 2010, I met up with an attorney name Michael S. (I say S. cause I don't know how to spell his name).  He reassured me that because I was a citizen that everything should go smoothly.  I will need to pay an initial fee to get the process started, $300 to begin the paperwork to look for an I-94 and $250 towards a $500 attorney's fee.  After paying that off, I didn't hear from this attorney for 3 months.  I called and asked for him and was told that he had left the company and that my case had been transferred to a Patricia Barbie who was over the immigration department.  
In January 2011, I went in and had an interview with immigration lawyer Noel Suniga through Skype or Telecam.  He said he was in a Dallas office and initially I had to start all over with my case.  (What happened with my initial fee? I don't know.)  They had me fill out a new contract and was told that this will now cost me a total of $4,190 to accomplish this.  I needed to pay them $2,700 by the time I had an interview with Immigration.  I had to pay $500 to get started (again).  So back to square one.  
At this point, 2 months went by, I never heard from them for anything.  I went into the Bedford office and asked for my attorney.  I was told that they didn't have any of my information and that I had to fill out another application and contract.  Through the whole year of 2011, I dealt with a secretary or assistant name Vanessa and Christine both very very rude and short with me.  When I asked for my refund Christine would advise me to call back and speak to Noel Suniga.  I was so frustrated with their inability to accomplish anything on my case.  At this point 2012 rolled along and I still demanded for my $500 refund for service they never rendered that I paid to them. Then Noel Suniga called me back and asked (no begged) me to please hang in there with them and that we will be able to accomplish everything this year and if I was to get a refund now then I would have to start all over again. I felt his sincerity that I decided to hang in there with them and was told to continue to pay towards my balance of $2,700 before the immigration interview.  
In February 2012, I being a sucker paid $500.  Then in March 2012, I paid another $500 towards my balance.  In April 2012 paid $440 towards my balance and dug up another $60 towards my balance...a total of $1,700.  I was told in May that I will have to find a co-sponsor because I don't make enough money.  I told them well I wasn't told that when I began payment towards my balance.  In June 2012, I called Christine and she specifically told me that they will not do any paperwork until I find a co-sponsor.  In August, I was so tired and fed up with their lies and nothing done that I asked for my refund and this time I wasn't turning back.  
I called Christine several times and their office and was told that my attorney Noel Suniga was on vacation.  I asked specifically when will he be back from vacation and I was told to call back next month.  I called back September and asked for my attorney again and was given the same run around answer.  I then called and asked to speak to someone in HR because I wanted an answer about my refund.  I was then referred to Vickie Davis the manager of HR.  She specifically told me that my attorney was fired.  I told her that I was told he was on vacation for a whole month and wasted all my time calling.  I demanded that I have my refund for work that was never rendered.  She promised me that she will definitely get back to me and that she will take care of everything.  She even apologized for the way I was treated.  After a two weeks later of not hearing from her, I called her and left messages. She never returned my call about my refund.  
In the end of September, I decided to go directly to the Bedford office and see if someone can get me in touch with Vickie Davis.  The receptionist called her and I was told that the person I need to speak to is Craig Pepper, he was her boss.  I called him up and left a message on his voicemail.  A day went by and no answer back from this person.  I called him again and he finally answered, he was very short with me and asked me what did I want.  I explained to him my dilemma in trying to retrieve my money back since they didn't do anything to my case.  He was very rude and sounded like he was so annoyed that I was asking for my money back.  He said that he can't just take my word for it, but he will talk to the immigration department and will return my call.  
He called two days later and told me that he spoke to the immigration department and Christine told him that they did all the paperwork and that I will not be getting my $1,700 back.  I told him that when I spoke with Noel and Christine, they assured me that no paperwork will be done until after I find a co-sponsor.  This man Craig Pepper was so rude to me and interrupted every word that I said and told me that they already processed all the paperwork.

I made subsequent calls to his office and I got a voice message everytime. Having left a couple of messages and receiving no return phone call, I gave up. What's concerning is that I forwarded all my private case information to his office.It's my hope that he has not shared this information with the attorney I may be filing suit against.

										I had the misfortune to be misrepresented by Mr. Darwin F. Johnson in 2008-2009. I was working for AT&T at that time. I routinely took F.M.L.A. and certain management made it known that they didn't care much for me doing it. When exercising my rights under article 8 (P.M.R.) of the labor contract for diagnosed repetitive motion injuries I was betrayed by A.T.& T and C.W.A. local 3204 and went outside the company to get representation for my job related injuries. After the 2004 5 yr. labor contract the union local 3204 leadership wasn't worth the union dues. The local 3204 leadership wasn't worth much even before that. Any way I contacted Louis B. Lusk who referred Darwin F. Johnson as my council. Don't get me wrong. D.F.J. did get me some compensation for my injuries, I got disability payments which I wasn't getting. Some coworkers had informed me that they had received $5k for each surgery they had for the same condition I have. I had got nothing, even after two surgeries on my dominant hand. My misrepresentation by D.F.J. consisted of not going to trial, not getting company paid medical benefits and severance pay covered under the contract as requested. Having to sign multiple resignations and documents to please the A.T.&T. attorney. Not listening to me when I said I was in pain and would likely need surgery in the near future. Darwin said go to work and keep your head down and collect the checks until the case settles, which would takes months. Two weeks later the case settled and the disability payments stopped. D.F.J. refused to furnish my with my case file and requested documents. Darwin simply ignored my request. Then I began seeing D.F.J. advertising on television as often as A.T.&T. If I wasn't under the influences of multiple medications including lyrica, fluoxetine, meloxicam I might of detected this misrepresentation sooner. A.T.&T has influenced doctors, lawyers, many managers and others and they will continue to until the government bodies take ethics seriously.

										I have been witness to my boyfriend's demise under this attorney.  Lie after Lie, un-answered phone calls, inept work force, too friendly with opposing attorney, so much we don't trust her anymore, because we keep losing and losing and losing.  I can't believe she can hold her head high and keep on taking people's money and not properly representing them.  I could do a better job in front of the judge than she does.  My boyfriend would have been better off without an attorney, that is how terrible she is. She never explains what is going on, blows us off, and just tells him to sign this and sign that and then we find out that it's not in his best interest.  Any attorney can and will bulldoze over her and God help who she is representing.  If you can, get away from her and quik.  She took all his money up front and now we are stuck with her.  I hope someone reads this and doesn't lose sleep, weight, and hope. Find someone else. Oh yes, lets not forget that she always blames the judge and never herself.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										I have had my life left in ruins ever since ATTORNEY RHONDA K. WALKER (SBN 175108) did not show up and challenge a FRAUDULENTLY FILED DEFAULT CLAIM  ( RELIEF OF STAY HEARING ) against my Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Case # 2-10 -bk-20998 by my 2nd lender FOOTHILL FINANCIAL LP and its partners RON ASCHIERIS and JOHN ASCHIERIS   and their REPRESENTING ATTORNEY AMY MARTINEZ  on July 2, 2010.
THE MOTION FOR RELIEF OF STAY FILED BY CREDITOR FOOTHILL FINANCIAL LP AND ITS PARTNERS RON ASCHIERIS, JOHN ASCHIERIS AND THEIR ATTORNEY AMY MARTINEZ WAS... ENTIRELY FRAUDULENT AND IT WAS FILED WITH FULL DOCUMENTED KNOWLEDGE BY ALL PARTIES AS FRAUD UPON THE COURT TO OBTAIN RELIEF OF STAY. 
THE MOTIVATION WAS THAT IF
THEY COULD NOT GET RELIEF OF STAY BY JULY 15 AND TAKE MY HOME TO SALE BY THAT DATE JULY 15, 2010 ...THEY WOULD HAVE TO START THE ENTIRE FORECLOSURE PROCESS ALL OVER AGAIN UNDER CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE 2924 BECAUSE UNDER THE LAW THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS OF 1 YEAR (365 DAYS) WOULD OF EXPIRED IN JULY 15, 2010.
I had been making all the timely required payments as required to the chapter 13 Trustee  Kathy Dockery which also included Attorney Rhonda Walker legal fees each month as part of the Chapter 13 Plan. As difficult as it can be I was in compliance to all of the requirements demanded by the Chapter 13 Trustee so that I could have my Chapter 13 Plan confirmed if not by July 8, 2010 I should
be able to comply within 30 days and the court allows some time to revise an Amended Chapter 13
Plan.
I wanted to make sure I stayed on top of taking care of every requirement because my beloved family home of over 37 years was a stake along with my business because I was able to work from my home.
I had a CONTRACT with Attorney Rhonda K. Walker that was included with my required filed paperwork that CLEARLY states that she will represent me and defend me in... ANY RELIEF OF STAY PROCEEDINGS WHILE MY CASE WAS ACTIVE AND NOT DISMISSED.  
Attorney Rhonda Walker fees as contracted were $ 4500 to represent me in my Chapter 13 Case 
and were being paid through the chapter 13 plan each month as required. 
On July 4th,2012 over the extended 4th of July Holiday weekend the Shortened Time motion was dropped on my doorstep received hearing was for July 8th, 2010 so I knew Foothill Financial LP and their Representing Attorney  Amy Martinez were trying to pull a fast one by me hoping I would not receive the package until the day of the Hearing July 8th because of the extended holiday weekend knowing  Monday the Courts and Post office would be closed. 
I was still ready and prepared.  Because of numerous problems with Attorney Rhonda K. Walker repeatedly not keeping on top of my case and  having to repeatedly rushing to file required paperwork for my case at the US Bankruptcy Court myself I had opened up a PERSONAL ACCOUNT WITH .. PACER ELECTRONIC FILING TO FOLLOW AND STAY ON TOP OF MY CASE. 
On the Friday afternoon around 3pm before the 4 day extended 4th of July weekend I logged on my PACER account and discovered THE OPPOSITION AND THEIR ATTORNEY AMY MARTINEZ FILED a SHORTENED TIME RELIEF OF STAY MOTION.
I immediately called and left several message and emailed my Attorney Rhonda K. Walker to warn her and let her know I read the Motion on PACER and that it was ENTIRELY FALSE WITH NO MERIT AND OPPOSING PARTY AND COUNSEL HAD KNOWINGLY FILED A FRAUDULENT MOTION UNDER THE RULES AND GUIDELINES SET BY THE COURT UNDER THE (ADEQUATE PROTECTION ORDER FROM 4/28/2010).
My Attorney Rhonda K. Walker finally responded after 3 days  to my many calls of concern on July 6, 2010. The Shortened Time hearing was only 2 days away and she said she needed me to fax over docs and proof of payments to show I had made all my timely payments by certified check. I did so immediately. I had faxed the required docs in the weeks before and she said to fax over the proof docs again and don't worry about it
On July 8, 2010 I went to meet my Attorney at the Bankruptcy Court.  She was doing everything to avoid taking to me and I became very suspicious while she was watching the calender being called
for my case and seemed to be very nervous.  I had all the requested documents needed the Chapter 13 Trustee had demanded to comply as required to resolve the objections for the Confirmation hearing.  The Shortened Time Motion for relief was to be also heard the same day but my Attorney was talking to another Attorney while I patiently waited.
OUT OF NOWHERE and right before my Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Case is about to be called by the Judge Alan Ahart from the Court Calender.... My Attorney Rhonda K, Walker blurts out ""I need you to go downstairs and file these papers in the clerks office downstairs asap"" I was upset and said my case is about to come up any minute. Attorney Rhonda K, Walker said just do it real quick you will be right back. (I knew something was going on and I am not an Attorney or a paralegal that is suppose to be filing my documents and other people documents).  It is not my Job to be doing what My Attorney is suppose to be doing). My Attorney Rhonda K. Walker is contracted and suppose to ""file my papers""
     I literally ran as fast as I could to the filing office a few floors down dropped off the papers and ran back as fast as I could to get back to the Courtroom to be present as my case is called.  It only took me a couple minutes to only come back.  I got back and Attorney Rhonda K. Walker was already taking to the judge and letting the trustee call out objections and not responding or objecting  or defending me in any way whatsoever... all the time knowing I had  everything at hand
available to handle any objections to continue on with my case.  Attorney Rhonda K. Walker only requested the judge to not impose the
180 bar order to refile another Chapter 13 case. 
 I had previous bankruptcy filings filed with my Attorney Rhonda K. Walker which under the Bankruptcy code would leave me with no protection in a multi filing situation ..No Automatic Stay.  After a prior case is dismissed you dont have the Automatic Stay to block the Foreclosure Sale. 
 I have to petition the court for a hearing to request the court grant the Automatic Stay again which takes approx. 2 weeks.  Without a Automatic Stay order in place... Nothing could stop my home of over 30 years of going to Foreclosure Sale in only 7 days and she knew it the entire time.
Judge Ahart even stated to Attorney Rhonda K. Walker  on the record when she requested to not have the 180 bar to refile another case imposed. "" Judge Ahart stated "" I will not impose the 180 bar for multifilings, but Council  I don't understand what you are trying to accomplish to help your client when  refiling another case will not give any Automatic Stay protection or help him in any way.
I ended up discovering that Attorney Rhonda K.Walker on July 1st, 2010... Yes the days before and leading up to most critical and most important time of my life KNEW SHE WAS GETTING SANCTIONED AND BARRED FROM PRACTICING LAW  by the very same court for $900 AND COULD NOT EVEN FILE PAPERWORK BECAUSE OF NON COMPLIANCE OF FILING DOCUMENTS THROUGH PACER.  And she was suspened and barred from practicing law at the US Bankruptcy Court Central District of California on July 13, 2010..... Yes at the very same time in between she threw my case intentionally to get DISMISSED. and 2 days before I lose my home forever she knows she is GOING TO GET BARRED FROM PRACTICING LAW AND.... NEVER TOLD ME ANYTHING AND THEN AVIODS   OVER A 100 DESPARATE PHONE CALLS AND SIMPLY LETS MY HOME of over 30years go to foreclosure sale jULY 15, 2010  as she knew I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
I have since discovered that Rhonda K. Walker SBN #175108 has had several other cases where she has taken the clients money and left them stranded and end up losing their longtime homes as I I have and lost nearly everything.  Yet this Attorney seems to only get minor disciplinary actions and probation while the UNSUSPECTING CLIENTS she has intentionally robbed and left stranded become homeless and literally end up losing everthing. She has done  the same thing repeatedly. Simply put. Taking a clients money and leaving
them absolutely stranded continually is the same violation and pattern... over and over again.
This is about the worse thing an Attorney can do to you, because even if want to get another
Attorney she took your money and it will cost 2 times as much to clean up the legal mess she
continually leaves behind.
This Attorney Rhonda K. Walker needs to be disbarred for life.  She has ruined many families lives with absolutely no remorse. She tries to divert the pure thievery away by saying her ex husband left her stranded with 1 child. She claims her ex husband left her stranded... In reality he has morals he can't stand having a Unethical Immoral Thief for a wife !
  My life is devastated and will probably never be the same.  Attorney Rhonda Walker gets to go to a nice warm home and still even kept the money she took from numerous clients  for doing nothing but contributing to a lifetime a misery and further major life changing set backs for hard working families. All of this  from someone  whom we thought we could entrust and legally represent us in our time of need. Rhonda K. Walker is a  embarrassment to the Cal State Bar and to all of the other ethical Attorneys and ethics it represents.

										I have just realized that I am not the only person that has been taken advantage of by this so called ""attorney"".  I called the Soucy Law Firm for possible representation regarding a criminal matter.  Mr. Soucy told me he was very experienced with my particular matter.  After speaking on the phone, he told me to meet him to discuss my case further.  I left the address he gave me at home so I goggled his office address.  What I found was that all the addresses on his website were not real offices but simply mailbox locations.  I finally got a hold of him and he told me he was in the process of moving and that was why he had no physical office address but would within a week or so.  I believed him and and gave him a check for $5000.00 in the parking lot of his ""supposed""office address.  About a month went by and I got very little contact from him so I called him since I knew my court date was coming up. After leaving several messages, he finally called me back to tell me he needed more money to pursue my case.  I ended up having to go to court alone unrepresented.  I later found out that this firm was a start up company and a guy who had trouble working for other companies and tried to start his own firm but without any real legal experience.  He had no experience in what I needed him for and takes whatever money he can get.  Avoid this guy at all costs! Don't let him fool you by telling you the ""other"" complaints about his company are with another firm with the same name.

										I hired Charles G. Williams as an attorney to collect some debt. At first he seemed very professional.He initially contacted me first and described his plans for action. Which included court filings and much more.
As he requested, I transferred all documents regarding my delinquent client to him. After that things started to get odd. He would state that he filed the complaints and contacted the client. I asked him for copies of the complaint and other paperwork and her would always just answer with a ""I'll get to it."" My requests continued for over a month. Sometimes I would not get a reply for days in which he would say it already has been sent. But failed to provide any tracking information. 
I was getting tired of waiting, as I already paid him prior to the filing. I contacted my client to ask him if he received the court paperwork, he replied that he never spoken to the lawyer or received anything. [continued below]....
									
										.....
This is when I called the lawyer and emailed him. He admitted that he was ""too busy"" to do the paperwork on time and offered to send a refund of the paid amount (not including and court fees). I asked him to send me the refund and the paperwork that was done so that I may find a better suited lawyer for this issue. He agreed.
Nothing was ever sent. I kept contacting him for weeks asking for my paperwork and the refund. And even went to his office address, which doesn't exist!
After two months he finally replied that he has NOT sent it.But he will by the end of the week.

For my appeal case, I hired an attorney from (((competitor's name redacted))) in the same area (Peoria).  My new legal representative graduated from a famous law school (Harvard;  Ghantous's degree was from Thomas Cooley College...that sounds made up).  (((redacted))) lawyer spent more time with me to prepare my case and we won on appeal.  AND my bill was less than Ghantous charged me for brief pre-trial meeting and a losing decision.
Maybe I should take Ghantous to court to get a refund.  After seeing him in action fumbling through my case, I'm pretty sure I could win a case a against him acting as my own attorney.
If you are looking for a good lawyer in the Peoria area, stay the heck away from Ghantous Law Offices.  I can happily recommend (((redacted))), and have also heard good things about (((redacted))) and (((redacted))).  I heard a few bad things about Ghantous, but he quoted me the lowest price initially, so I went with him and paid more money in the long run just to lose and have to file appeal. sorry, allowing you to give a competitors name would instigate others to just file against their competition, to only come back later to suggest their company, ..plus, if you post a competitors name more than likely they will show up on search engines as a Rip-off! - - your comments on this policy are welcome.

										I hired Michael Ziton to defend me against false money laundering accusations.  Instead of defending my innocence, he brokered a deal with the DA even before any charges or discovery took place,  a deal that would have resulted in years of prison time and forfeiture of millions of dollars that I did not have.  He told me the deal was a gift, and that I should think of my wife and family.  He demanded tens of thousands in additional fees during the course of his efforts, and deceived me into paying them  outside of our existing written contract.  Mr. Ziton accused me of turning my head away from criminal activity  my own attorney falsely accused me of criminal activity  holy cow!  He appeared to believe all of the DAs accusations regardless of what I had to say, based on extremely weak evidence.
Fortunately, I eventually fired him after paying well over 100k in legal expenses to him and his partner, and found another attorney to undo the damage already caused by Michael Ziton. [continued below]....
									
										.....  My new attorney was anxious to actively defend 
me against the false accusations and his efforts resulted in no charges ever being filed.  My new attorney also informed me that many of the things I was told by Michael Ziton previously were simply not true; should have known is not good enough for a money laundering conviction, no one wins against the feds  my new attorney does, etc..  
What I learned from this experience is never hire the first attorney you find on the Internet  even if under severe duress.  My mistake almost cost me years of prison time and an unbelievable forfeiture, because in my opinion, Mr. Ziton was far more interested in lining his pockets than providing the defense I hired him for.

One day before (alledgedly) going to trial I was contacted and told I had to pay another $1200. I mentioned that I was sort of a captive audience. The response I received was that I could find another Lawyer. I paid the fee and was told the next day that there would be no trial. I waited a month or two and called to speak with the attorney Darlene Danielle and she said she would look into it and get back to me. I waited and finally called back and was told that she was willing to return $250. I then had to call 3 times to finally get the meager $250 back. I was overcharged by a great deal. Stay away a ripoff.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										I hired Tax Crisis Institute in May of 2012. I gave them a hefty deposit and made several payments to them in hopes that they would deliver what they promised. That promise was to stop a levy. They did not follow thru with this promise. Not because they worked hard and failed but because they didnt even do 1 thing on my case. They didnt even file as my Power of Attoreney on my case like they said they did. My family is now attempting to live off of $268 a week as my weekly paychecks are being garnished. I have a wife who has severe health issues and a young child who is disabled. Im fearful now that we may have to become dependent on the state for aid as I am unable to obtain more work with the work schedule I have. Please do your self a favor and do not see these people. My wife recently was contacted by several news media outlets and has also found an attorney who will work pro bono so that we can get all or at least most of our money back. I will update as soon as this is resolved which hopefully will be soon if Tax Crisis Institute is smart they will work quickly to resolve this issue if not I forsee many problems for them.

										I hired the attorney Brad Kelsky for specific matters and he did not address. Then when I asked for an update, his response is asking for more money and he did not take care of the matters I came to him and paid him for. Then 1 of the matters he finally addresses, which he told me the first part of the year he was submitting, the vacate motion, he just tells me he is just submitting, clueless as if he did it or not. Then I ask about all of the erroneous charges and not doing what he was hired for, he tries to justify and refuses to return my money. I hired him for critical matters and if he wasn't capable or going to do exactly what I retained him for he should not have taken my case. Everything that I came to him was critical and time sensitive. I requested an invoice from him as he had not sent me anything, he forwards me several emails about replenishing my account with more funding and then gives me invoices with all of these erroneous charges with a lot of charges for phone calls/emails and requesting repetitive documents and charging me every time he spoke with me by phone. He never informed me of any of this. He has refused to do what I hired him for and has the nerve to have taken my money and saying I owe more. I informed him of my situation financially and he knew that what I retained him for was critical. If he was not able to do he should have not taken my money and just said that he could not assist. I am elderly, loss my son and spouse, responsible for a lot financially. I explained this to him. He took my check for $2000.00 and told me he would start as soon as he cashed, he didn't. He took my next check for $1,500.00 and still nothing.  It's so much I want to explain. When I asked him to return my documents, which I initially told him, I did not want him to keep, he told me, he wasn't returning them, that I owe him more money, when he never did what he was suppose to. Then when I stated, you have conjured up more fraudulent charges and you know when we spoke you agreed to scan my documents and return them. So he finally said he would return and send an invoice, when he is the one should be returning my money. I have e-mails showing what I went to him from as well as the invoices he conjured up last week when I requested. I am so upset and hurt that he can take advantage as he did. When he took my money he told me that he would take care everything we discussed and he does this. Brad became very nasty when I requested my documents, he assumed at that time he definitely wasn't getting any more money so he sends me an emailed saying he no longer represents me. He is a thief and he preys on the elderly.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										I hired this firm by contract in early 2012 to resolve an old warrant in the state of Florida. When I called them intially, I was made all kinds of promises that this is an old case and would be ""no problem"" to clear it up. They even came down on their price 50% to get my money. That should have been my first clue. After payment, they did nothing for me. They did not return phone calls, attend scheduled meetings and actually made my case worse. They had me book a trip to florida stating the judge had to remove the warrant and before I traveled I checked with the court and the warrant was still there.
I was out around 1800 in travel expenses and the lawyer never called me back. I persisted to try to get them to take some action on my behalf and even had a detective as a character witness. Mr Moore never showed for the pre court date confrence and the detective called me saying ""where is your lawyer"". He then told me I spoke to the state attorney, he should no problem as he could not wait any longer.  I heard nothing. Later that day I called the legal assistant Diane Mattson who told me ""the judge is mad and we have done enough for what you paid"". I consider that breach of contract as the matter was never handled correctly once they received payment.  Typical Lawyer Sharks. I have filed a BBB complaint against them after requesting my be refunded over a month ago. Not even a phone call.  You will be better off with legal aid or a court appointed attorney.  If you google them, they seem to ""specialize"" in everything.

for 2 cases, when the court day came he wasn't there because he was out of town representing 
another client, I was going to end up representing myself, the court was reset for another day so when we got there he was clueless about y case so we had to go over it outside the courtroom.
What a ripoff, I felt I threw $4,500.00 in the trash.
 I payed him $2,000.00 more for something called discovery that was ordered so that makes it  $6,500.00.

 I was told by other attorney's he filled the wrong things, he didn't pay attention to my case, he didn't know what was going on with me, this was a very important case for me and my family and everyone is saying my attorney didn't do his job. 
He stated we can appeal the case and it would cost me $4,000.00 more. 
He said one thing and when I read the paper work it was not what he told me, This was the biggest ripoff of my life, my entire family is very affected by this, I feel I should get my money back since nothing absolutely nothing was done. because of this attorney I might end up back in jail.

										I knew this dishonest and bad attorney through another attorney, her name is Momal Iqbal last July/2011, after I hired her on my Immigration case and paid her $500.00, but she asked me for another $2000.00, and she sent attorney Juan Dotson to collect the money and work on my case with her, and she went on a trip out of the country at that time.
Now we are in March/2012, and this attorney never did anything on my case, not even any kind of littele work, he promised me last July that he will file a hearing in the court to get me out of custody withen two to three weeks, and based on my serious health problems and my record any judje will release me, but Mr. Dotson never,did any effort to help me, he even asked me to do the original draft for my case, so he can put his legal decoration on it (which I did) but he made mistakes with some of the information I wrote on my original draft, and I used to fix for him, and he used to come back to me with the same mistakes over and over, and he will tell me that he can come the next week, but the next week will be two week and three, and one month and so on...he never did any help for me at all, when I wax under a daily mental abuse and other abuses in the detention center in Santa Ana, or when i'am under a continous pressure from the ICE, or even when i'am having many health problems, and I need medical help outside in my home, or even further when the mice attacked the buildings i'am living in last August/2011, causing me unlimited damages,and one of the very painfull losses is the loss of my favorite bird I had since 12 years(my lovely parrot) and another bird too.l have to threw a lot of my staff and some of my furniture or give it away of that problem, and I begged hem hardly to help me to get out of the custody, but he never cared, ne used to hide over and over, he never accept any collect call from me for the price of $1.89 and 08.cents for each minute after that, he is great in lies and lies only. He even risked my life on 8/24/2011 after I got transfered through the ICE to another location, and I never knew where i'am going, or find him to help me, I had high blood pressure since that 
day, and i'am on daily medication for that since that date, and I had a stroke after that, but he again never cared to come or check on me, it took him one month to come and see me in the new location I wrnt to it in Irvine, and continue his lies again over and over, he even risked my loyal old friend Charlotte's life to be very close to a heart attack, after he never responded to calls for help in my situation, and my friend's age is 86 years old, he didn't had respect for her age or risking her life too, and he knows well that she is the one one who is helping me outside, because I have no family members or immediate relatives in this country.
This irresponsible attorney never cared to return her calls to him in a reasonable time, it used to ta,e him five days or more to return a phone call for her, or ignore, she even catched him twice when she used to call him regarding my case, but she use to notice that he is under kind of drugs or so,.because he can't eben answer het questions tegarding my case, and what he is doing in it, and she knew tnat he is not brilliant attorney, and he is not doing any tninh in my case period.
This attorney is a very bad issue, he is dihonest, crook, liar irresponsible, ignorant, he doesn't care about his clients or their urgent need for legal help, I even asked him one time that what is the maximum time for the Immigration holed, guess what was his answer to me that,,, he don't know,,, attorney and he don't know!! Just what he wants is money only, and he will not do any work, just lies..
Don't trust him or lose your money on him, and I will tell what he did to me to any madia interview in the guture, or any place if they need to adk me about my very bad experience with him.
I even had been told by some Federal Agents that he is not the good attorney for my case, and he had A THEFT CHARGE on his record in year 1993, and he will never help me in my case, just he got my money and took a hike,and before I'am writing this report I gave him a big chance (he and attorney Momal Iqbal) and sent him a letter asking him to return my money back to me by the end of January/2012, nevause he never did any work on my case him OR her, but he never care as usual, not him, not she (Attorney Momal Iqbal) 
actually she sent me a threaten letter tjat dhe will take a legal action agsinst me regarding het reputation, 
and she forget that she took my money and she did nothing on my case too, just dhe sent me this crook 
DOTSON to tip me of tjrough her, botj of them are bad and crooks.
He is very irresponssible and ignorant and a liar in a big way, be aware... Don't let him to do to you what he did to me, be carefull, these ones are after money only, not after sincere work on your behalf, I filed a 
complaont against both of them to the board, and if I have to take more steps  against them I will do, because they have to stop ripping the people of and hide...just be carefull of them, don't trust them..

Jeanne Damirgian was a former prosecutor and requested $5000 as a retainer. My wife and I met with her for approximately 1hour. I was just recovering from Kidney Cancer and I was very distraught. We paid the $5000 and she told me she would review the case. Two weeks past and I started calling her office to see the progress. Jeanne Damirgian informed me that she was not interested in the case due too a high profile lawyer one of my co-defendants was using. She said he liked publicity. I asked her about the retainer being returned after she took what she felt was fare for her time and she informed me she would look at her time spent. I was expecting a fee of anywhere from $300-$500 for the time she spent reading the charges and the consulting with my wife and I. I tried calling her back after a few weeks and she would not take my calls. I never received a penny back. Here I was in a very scary predicament and a lawyer rips me off for at least $4000 if not more.  I never pursued the transaction legally and I paid another attorney $20,000.

The IRS is taking from my social security and I understand that is less than what they want me to make in payments. All I have received for the money I paid them was my back taxes done and nothing more. I have called and sent emails and if I am lucky I might get a response. They said the letters would stop they have not. I am on a fixed income and need help getting my taxes taken care of I know I have to pay but I hope I could pay less than what owe. If they can not help than I want some of my money back so i can find someone that will help me. I could have had my back taxes done for a lot less than $1000,00.

										I paid to have their services handle both my pardon and afterward a waiver to travel to the USA - to date i have nothing. The company originally told me they would do all the work which seemed at first to be the case. After not hearing back from them after 8 months or so they informed me they needed more info which I provided. Another year goes by and they ask for more info which i tell them i can't remember the info they want seeing as it was over 20 years ago but they insisted i either get the info or they wont do anything more on it. I again told them i had no recollection of what they were asking (specific court dates etc) and no way to get it and that was their job to call around not mine and that I was told you would do all the work involved.
When I mentioned this to the girl at Canadian Pardon Services( signs only as Michelle)she said "" Do you want me to work on it at all?"" and then threatened to put my file at the bottom of the heap unless I lost my attitude and based on how long it's taken I believe she did.
A year later still nothing. More time goes by and they contact me again to have me phone court 
houses etc to get more info for them - work they'd told me they would be 
doing. I inquire again and they tell me they are still waiting on me finding out this court info and begin to advise me how I might get it although there was no guarantee I would get it they said! So I called the courthouses until I found out what they wanted and sent it in. Then they didnt send it in in time and i had to redo apay again to have my criminal background check done again as apparently it expired before they sent it in. 2 years go by still nothing. Then they want more info which i provide and new forms now since they've taken so long ther's a different process in place for pardons.
I called again and this time ask for a supervisor since my assigned 'worker' seems to hate me but again they put her on the phone with me.
Today I just received another letter, this time from the Records and Suspensions board requesting even more info - info I gave Canadian Pardon Services 6 years ago. So wait still I do, meantime Ive been refused at the border on a job, been unable to coach my kid, and been unable to advance professsionally because of this lack of a pardon.

I called the company and the phone was answered by yet another individual with a heavy foreign accent. He answered by saying, ""Hello? May I help you?""--no company name was stated.
I then told the man what I was calling about and he proceeded to ""read"" me a page listing 3 criminal charges that were being filed against me by his client. I advised him that I had no idea what he was talking about and I have not committed a crime. He was difficult to understand and was extremely rude. At one point he told me that if I was ""claiming to not be a criminal, then [I] would need to explain that to my criminal attorney after the sheriff got my file"". He wound up hanging up on me.
I then called MY lawyer and briefed her secretary about what was going on. She said the lawyer would need the law office's name. I called ""Dexter Cruz"" again and asked the man who answered the phone to tell me the name of his law firm and spell it for me. He said it was Johnny Best Law Firm.

Illegal aliens with six to 12 months of unlawful presence are barred for three years; those here for more than a year illegally are barred for 10 years.This law applied to me, But Erik Jensen seemed oblivious to this, and went ahead with the paperwork and charged me $3000 up front. Only my due diligence in researching immigration law while he made multiple mistakes on
the forms and filed forms that did not apply to my case allowed me to find this law before he filed the paperwork, when I confronted him on this he was clueless. [continued below]....

As of today I am still married and my husband is not paying child support. During the beginning of the process 2 years ago I asked Gordon's employees Mya and Adin over the phone if they could file  temporary relief while we wait for the  custody date. They told me I had to wait till the the divorce is final before they could file any relief. However we do go to mediation November  2011. That was a waste of time, when my husband was told he had to pay support of $300.00 he said he wanted to go to court. Now Gordon said if I want to retain him again for him to be my lawyer for trial I would have to pay another 5,000.00. I can't afford my rent,  how am I going to pay him another $5,000.00 when he already has $4500.00 of my money and has nothing to show for it. He has done absolutely nothing for me.I retained him in good faith that he would take my side and help me thru my divorce. He has not shown me anything in writing where my money has gone. So as of now I had no other choice but to find another lawyer. Lee Pickett is my new lawyer and he's great. Mr. Pickett called Gordon to see if he could get my file and Gordon refused to hand it over. I don't understand why he will not let Mr. Pickett get the file. There is no reason for Gordon to have my file . I feel like Gordon Nicol did not full fill his part of the contract.  So I would like this complaint to be addressed with him.

										I retained Mr Kinsey on 6 Dec 2011 and handed all the paperwork from my previous counsel. Gave all the demographic details of my spouse. My trial was set for May 3 2012 and Final Status Conference was set for April 26,2012.Discovery cut off date was March 26,2012.I constantly requested and reminded Mr Kinsey to send the Notice of Deposition to the other party. But Mr Kinsey did not pay any attention until the last moment .On February 21 2012 Mr Kinsey mailed the Notice of Deposition setting the Respondents deposition on March 30 2012 at his Office in Seal Beach Ca.The opposing counsel objected to the deposition on March 12 2012 based on C.C.P Section 2025.26(a),which is true as my spouse resides in Santa Clara almost 500 miles from his Office and this thing was told to Mr Kinsey on the very first day.To cover his mistake Mr Kinsey filed an EX PARTE on March 26 2012 for ORDERS COMPELLING THE ATTENDANCE OF THE RESPONDENT AT HER DEPOSITION CURRENTLY SET FOR MARCH 30,2012 IN THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY FOR THE PETITIONER OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE FOR ORDERS SETTING THE DATE,TIME AND PLACE OF THE RESPONDENTS DEPOSITION.The EX PARTE was denied but the Court ordered April 11 2012 as a hearing date for the Motion to Compel deposition of the Respondent. Mr Kinsey Judged that the matter would be going to the Trial and demanded $5,000.00 more as retainer which I transferred on April 4 2012.On April 9 Mr Kinsey emailed me to continue sending him the Exhibits but when he went to the hearing on April 11 2012 instead of discussing about his motion to compel Respondents deposition Mr Kinsey proposed Mediation and the Judge transferred the matter to the ADR.The Judge also advised Mr Kinsey to file a motion to reopen discovery as the discovery is not automatically re-opened with the new trial date.When I questioned ,Mr Kinsey told me lie that the Court had proposed mediation 
WHAT HE DID 
1)He was lazy to propound the Notice of Deposition and when he did it was objected because of his mistake as she lives more than 150 miles from his Office. 
2) Because of his action the discovery cut-off date of March 26 2012 was passed and he incurred me $3450.00 for the EX PARTE and motion to compel her deposition. 
3) On April 11 2012 hearing he proposed that both the lawyers have opted for mediation ,whereas he never disclosed this thing to me on the contrary he took 2nd retainer of $5000.00 from me as he told me that the case would go to the trial. 
WHAT HE DID NOT DO 
1) He did not talk about his Motion to Compel her deposition on April 11 2012,instead proposed mediation which hampered my case for 1 year from April 11 2012 to March 22 2013. As a result of his action April 11 2012 hearing will be done on March 22 2013. 
2). He did not file a motion to re-open discovery as advised to him by the Judge Mark Borenstein on April 11 2012.As a result of his action now I can no longer perform any discovery on my case.He did irreparable damage to my case. 
3) He proposed mediation but did not take any step to mature it nor did he informed or updated me by any means. I was kept in total darkness as to what is going on in my case from April 11 2012 to time I decided to fire him in October 2012. 
4).When the opposing party disqualified the judge he did not do anything for 4 months.,whenever I called him to take some action to bring dates back on calendar he would state that ,""Rapinder tomorrow is your day"" and unfortunately ""tomorrow"" never came and I had to fire him to take the case in my hands. 
How did I uncover everything 
I had a hearing on Motion to Compel Request for Admission on February 13 2013 .At that hearing the Judge wanted to see the transcript form the last hearing.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										I want to tell you about a guy that actually thinks that he is Macomb County judge material.  The other day I attend court with my husband.  This, John Temrowski, character is suing my husband for defamation of character.  Thus far, he hasn't gotten anywhere.  Anyways, he is also my husband's ex-wife's divorce attorney.  There was also a show cause hearing for a later time that day as well against my husband.  My husband is behind in Child Support as almost all of his money has had to go towards hiring attorneys to have the FOC enforce the written visitation order that his ex-wife has completely disregarded.  And that is a fact, no doubt about it.  Anyways............
My husband was ordered on June 13th by the Friend of the Court judge to produce any and all documents of people that he owes money to within 14 days.  Mr. Temrowski is very concerned to see if my husband has any more money for him to get before he pursues his case.  Per the judges order, my husband sent the loan notes to Mr. Temrowski on the morning of the 25th.  He had other papers to send Mr. Temrowski as well so he waited until he got them all together and had them sent out certified mail.
This IDIOT comes up to me and says in his little mousy, cowardly voice, ""Mrs. Blank, you've been served.  And you better show up or you will have a warrant out for your arrest""  It was a subpoena for me to give a deposition.  Then he cowers off into the outside hallways.  As soon as he leaves, we get one attorney who passes us a yellow POST IT note first, and tells us that what he did was completely improper and not a valid form of service.  As soon as we read this, ANOTHER attorney taps my husband on the shoulder and tells him the same thing.  My husband tells that man that 'yes' he knows and makes a comment about how Mr. Temrowski is running for Probate judge in Macomb county.  They both chuckled.   One made a comment about how he has a lot to learn before he ever becomes a judge.
I might also remind you that not only was the subpoena served improperly but it was requesting me to provide a loan letter that was ordered of my HUSBAND not me AND it was already on it's way to his office within the 14 days ordered by the judge.  No way in hell, am I missing a day of work for a new job for something that was 1.) not my responsibility and 2.) already provided to him and 3) not properly served.
Meanwhile, and this tells you further what a slime ball this man is.  He is sneaking up to the 6th floor and telling the Macomb FOC that my husband has failed to appear and that he must pay $1802 but the end of July and that he owes Mr. Temrowski another $500.  After our hearing was concluded, we went up to the 6th floor and get the whole run down by the nice lady at the desk about how Mr. Temrowski told my husband that he has to appear upstairs or else he would be in contempt.  I sat right there, side by side, with my husband.  He did say that 'why don't we go upstairs and take care of the show cause motion first since they are not quite as backed up?'  But, as Mr. Temrowski is, he twisted his words to his own advantage.  
I have been with my husband for over five years and have gone through all of this with him.  I've seen every dirty trick that this man has pulled.  My husband hasn't seen his son in almost two years because of all the red tape that both his ex-wife and Mr. Temrowski have put him through.  You would think that this young boy has been molested or abused in some way.  But the way he got it all started in the beginning of 2011 was to send the order of the judge to speak with all parties, my husband and his ex-wife, to his parents' home.  He knew that my husbands' parents were on vacation for over three weeks and that my husband would never get the notice in time to appear.  The Friend of the Court had our home in Walled Lake listed as our residence.  So why would you send a court order to his mommy and daddy's house in Troy?  From that point on, it took my husband about three months to save the money to hire an attorney.  Finally, in October/November of 2011 my husband was required to see his son in a facility for parents that basically have either abused their children or didn't even now they were the daddy for the first two years of their life.  At least that's how my husband described it.  
After that experiment didn't work out and his ex-wife refused to bring his son for further visits, even after she was ordered by the court a SECOND time to comply, then they went to a deal where my step-son needed to see a psychiatrist to deal with the trauma.  My husband had to sign the consent papers and agree to split the cost of any co-pays.  I was with him when he signed all of the papers in his attorneys office in January of 2012.  Well, Mr. Temrowski received the papers and just said he didn't get them.  The visits were terminated as a result and we didn't find out until JUNE 2012 that my husband's son only attended TWO visits and then cancelled.  
I remind you, my husband never got a phone call, nor his attorney, nor anything mail correspondence to state that there was any problems.  Granted this was at least 3-4 months since this order had been placed but, as we have learned to expect with the Macomb County Friend of the Court, everything takes a long time.
I am basically filing this report as more of a PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT.  If you ever deal with JOHN F TEMROWSKI, then you are deal with a real crook that should have been disbarred from the State of Michigan quite some time ago.  I have heard through the grapevine, that Mr. Temrowski has already been either disbarred, disappeared or simply failed to renew his license from several other states.  And if the later is true, why would an attorney not renew his license?  
But hey, GO VOTE JOHN TEMROWSKI FOR MACOMB COUNTY PROBATE JUDGE!!!

										I was also ripped off by this company. Everyone beware of this company (Full Count Eviction Services). I also engaged with this company to prepare a Unlawful Detainer action against one of my tenants in a commercial building I own. I first spoke with Devon. He took all the information and charged my credit card $464.00 for the start up cost. I was advised by him that Linda Dunn would be in charge of my case. This all happened on Aug. 01, 2011.I received an e-mail from Linda Dunn whom told me that they are preparing the UD and would be getting to the process server within a couple of days. Well, that was the last I heard from her. I sent her e-mails asking how the case was going. It took several e-mails before she replied. She told me that the process server had gone to the address that I had given her and that the tenant didnt live there. She said that it would cost me an additional $65.00 for the process server to go to another address. She said that the process server spoke to the tenant at the address I gave them and also spoke with the manager and both stated that no one with that name lived there. I knew this was bull as I own another building just down the street a few buildings and knew that they indeed lived there. I also confirmed that they lived there.They told me that they would deliver the notice to the office he was renting from me and if they didnt get ahold of the tenant that they would then have to file for a Order to Post. Again I kept writing her e-mails and not getting any replies. They never tried serving this tenant at the building. We have video cameras in our building and I kept checking to see if the tenant came in the building and while I was checking that I looked to see if anyone tried serving any papers to his Suite and there was no one.To make a long story short,I heard from Linda Dunn via e-mail that the got the Order to Post from the court and that it would be posted on the tenants door in a day or so. Needless to say, another 30 days went by and no Order to Post was posted on the tenants door. Nor did I get any answers to my e-mails from Linda Duun. I then took it into my own hands and got a hold of the tenant and got him out. I sent a e-mail to Linda Dunn telling her that I had waited long enough for them to get this tenant out of my building and took it in my own hands and got them out and that I wouldnt need their services any longer and requested any money owed to be to be returned. Much to my surprise I got an e-mail back from her within 5 minutes of sending her the e-mail telling me that they would notify the court and that I didnt have any money coming back to me. The bottom line here is it cost me over $700.00 for nothing. This company is a rip off and I want to warn everyone to be aware of this company.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										I was called on my cellphone from Protection Law Center, LLC, and told they could modify my mortgage on a condo that I was renting.  I told them that they couldn't modify because I did not live in the condo, because I had already tried.  Fiore, the salesman, told me that they could and they do it all the time even when I didn't live in the condo.  I also told him I tried to modify another townhouse I lived in and was denied because of my debt to income ratio, so I was not interested.  He was adamant that they could get me approved, that he could guarantee it, without actually guaranteeing it.  He said everybody with the exception of maybe one has gotten approved.  (I guess I'm NO. 2)  I asked if I would get a full refund if it didn't work, and he said I wouldn't get a FULL refund because they would have put work into it.  So I agreed to try it to the tune of $1950.  And when I got the agreement to sign, it said that if I canceled, they would charge something like $300 per hour for the attorneys and $150 an hour for paralegals (estimating), so I immediately called Fiore and told him I wanted them to look at my financial info first before they do any work to see if it would work because I didn't want to pay that much if it wasn't going to work, and he agreed they would do that.To cut to the chase, 7 months down the line, when they told me it would take 3 months, I had received several denial letters for not being owner-occupied and because of my debt to income ratio, exactly what I told Fiore.  I called PLC furious, and they would always say it's still being reviewed for some other program.  After a few months I stopped receiving calls from PLC, and the bank was calling me themself asking for documents.  Finally, about that 6-to-7-month period, the bank called and said I was denied and there were no other options and when was I going to make that final payment.  I also received a certified letter saying they were going to start foreclosure proceedings if I didn't pay that one payment.   I demanded my money back from PLC so I could make my payment and was refused because they said they had put over 20 hours into it.  Then they offered to submit it again for another program, even when I told them they were threatening foreclosure.  I did not send them any other documents because by that time I did not believe they could do anything and were just trying to avoid giving me any money back.When I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, PLC's response was they have to submit it to all the programs and they expected that I would be denied for those reasons, but they still submit them and they put 20 hours into it, which left no refund.  They never reviewed anything prior to submitting it.  That is not their policy, even though Fiore told me they would.  Fiore also told me I would not be denied for not occupying the condo.They still refuse to give me any kind of refund.  They took $1950 from me and gave me nothing in return.  I was only asking for $1000 for a refund because I realized they did put some work into it, albeit work they didn't need to because I told them I would be denied and they even admitted they knew I would be denied for some of the programs they submitted me to.  They lied to me to get me to sign up on many levels.  If they would have told me the truth, I never would have signed up, and now I'm scammed out of $1950.

										I was contacted by Derek Randall of Attorneys Legal Network (which is also The Law Offices of Antonia Woghiren) regarding a loan modification on my home.  After signing the contract and making 2 payments of $834.00 I was unable to get in contact with anyone regarding my case to get questions answered when contacted by my lender.  During that time I was denied the modification, and because I could not get in touch with anyone at the company I stopped the last payment.   
On June 26, 2011: I sent Derek an email: Hello Derek attached is a letter that I received from GMAC, Im not sure what I need to send them, are they asking for financial information from my ex-husband? He no longer resides here, and he was taken off the Title. Please advised  Derek responded with I forwarded the documents to processing you will receive a call and they will let you know what to do 
No one ever contacted me and I had a deadline to turn the information in. I contacted Derek again 2 weeks later, informing him that no one has contacted me, and the information was time sensitive, please advised on what I should do. Again, no response. 
On July 7, 2011: I sent Derek another email: Hello Derek, is it possible for you to find out whats going on with the modification, I havent heard anything from anyone, I dont know what to do when I am contacted by GMAC, I just received a denial letter, am Im losing my house, can someone please let me know something. Derek responded with: If you have any questions regarding your file and cannot get a hold of your current processor that you have been working with please contact our processor Mario Peralta. 
I responded with: I have no idea who my processor is, the only person I have ever spoken with is you. Derek responded with: It looks like your modification was not finalized because you missed your 3rd payment on 6/15/11. I have contacted processing, a lot of work has been done on your file and submitted to your lender you will receive a call today from processing that will update you on your case, after they update you , we will need to receive the 3rd and final payment to move forward on your modification if you are not contacted today please call Mario right away and let him know 
By this time, I was contacted by a non-profit organization that contacted GMAC and was told that my home is currently in foreclosure. I am now losing my home, I contacted Derek to inform him of this, and requested a refund because no one would help me when I had question, I was in the dark, I had no idea what was going on with GMAC, I was informed by a non-profit organization that it is illegal for a company to charge for home modification, I sent Derek an email saying that Iwould like a full refund. I show on August 4th 2011, that Derek read my email and never responded. No one responded.  To this date I have not received a refund.",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										I was contacted by this company through the internet on 4-23-09 when my house was in foreclosure by a guy named Ben Scheck. I was told that they could stop it for $2,000.00 and get me a loan modification. I sent them what I thought was a retainer fee, and all of my info as well as my wifes. Many e-mails with someone named Lori M Heim a paralegal with this firm asking for yet more info 6 months into this matter. I had got a call from her in september and at which time she said that I should contact the mortgage company myself because they was not responding to her and that I should try for a modification through them, and see if they respond to me ~ which they did. The last contact that I had with this person was an email on 10-5-09 asking for yet more info ~ They had everything I had. Then the contact stopped ~ I called the number that I had and left many of messages with no response, and no reponse to the many e-mails that I had sent. Me and my wife felt like fools to have gave away our money as well as all of our personal information, and didnt know what to do other that not say anything to anyone else about it, and pray nothing else bad becomes of it. We were turned down for a loan modification through 2 different mortgage companys because the original one sold the note to BOA and they kept giving us the run around, and wanted all of the back payments up to date before they would even talk to us and the only reason we stopped making the payments is because we were told by the paralegal not to send any more payments until we were approved for a loan modification. In may of 2012 we just walked away from our house because of the stress it was causing to myself as well as my family. This law firm did nothing for us and took our money and ran so use your judgement before you hand over your money to anyone ~ You can go through your own mortgage company for a loan modification and it wont cost you a dime and you will probably get the same results.  									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

He then informed I would be served papers at my address in 2 hours.As soon as I got home I looked American Legal Services up online and found out that it was a scam. Just to make absolutely sure I went to my local police department and asked them about this and to see if they had recieved any faxed papers and they said they hadnt.  I had no court papers waiting to be served.This whole thing was really unsettling to me because I have a clean record and never want to go to jail. Im still concerned because they do have my social security number and address.  Im just glad I didnt fall for their scam.

										I was injured about 6 years ago. A friend recommended Wattel & York to help me with my case. They said they'd take 1/3rd if I settled and 40% if I had to go to trial. After 3 years and constant x-rays ,therapy,and numerous other Doctor visits. It was time to either settle or go to court. I've interpreted personal injury cases before so I knew when they offered me only $35k for a legitimate injury that  it was not a fair offer.  I was to receive 2/3rd's but somehow my attorneys found away to up charge me an ex-tra 1/3 leaving me with a little over $12,000 so I told them I'd prefer to go to trial instead.Going to trial was originally given to me by my attorneys as an option. My attorneys threatened me! They said if I didn't accept the settlement that they'd put a lean on my home and then sue me for my home. I had already racked up so many doctor bills! I was affraid I'd lose my health insurance! I was losing work because the injury began to cripple me. I have x-rays to prove my case. I have arthritis thoughout my back due to being knocked down. They ignored my plees. I even said 1/3 isn't even a good % for all"" your"" efforts.They just wanted to settle ,collect and go on to the next case. So they found away to bilk me out of another 1/3rd. I've applied for disability-denied!!! They said, I'm not of the right ethnic background. Also to make matters worse , you consumers out there may not even know this. If you ever get a legal settlement(at least this happened with my health insurance company-Health Net of Az) once they are alerted that you have received any kind of $ from an injury case they will not pay anymore of your Doctor visits until you've spent the last dime of your settlement $. Forget about pain & suffering. They don't seem to have a formula for that so you have to spend all your settlement before they cover your next bill. Health Net raised my premiums 6-7x's and my deductable 3 x's with out any Birthday or any other real reason.. I couldn't afford health care anymore. I can't work anymore. I can't drive more than 1 hour without severe suffering. I gave up all sports that I loved. Insurance only takes your $. When you need help they find a way to deny you. I wish I would have takin these unscrupulous jaded attorneys to the State Board. It's too late now. They deserved to be disbarred,they ruined my life. I don't even have enough $ to try alternative medicine.  The problem is there are so many cases that are bogus, If people would stop clogging the courtrooms with illegitimate cases maybe someone like me could actually get a fair trial. Maybe the Attorneys would have believed me. I had x-rays and x-rays don't lie. What about the lady at Mc Donalds that dumped coffee in her lap? I'm sure she doesn't have a care in the world after winning all those millions. we do need Tork reform so that legitimate cases get a fair chance. All I can do now is give you all out there some advice that cost me my quality of life. 1) Interview many Attorneys. 2) Get referals of people who had simular cases and won. 3) If you don't get an attorney who is very sure he will win your case, don't sue. Yes, don't sue. As soon as your insurance finds out you are in litigation they immediately start raising your premiums. if you can't work( like me) you won't even be able to pay the co-pays. 4) most important don't go to Wattel & York. They gave me so much hope. Instead I lost my health, my health insurance, my hopes and dreams and most of all my dignity. I also paid into S.S all my life and they treat me like a homeless woman begging for what actually is a benefit I paid for all my life. What's even worse as you know in AZ. we have so many illegal aliens here and they get better health care than I do. That last statement is not meant to be political or remotely racist, I just want the same benefits that are permanent guests recieve. I was royally screwed by Health Net Insurance (BTW most Doctors don't accept Health Net anymore, I was told Access is far better) .Most of all I was totally railroaded by the Attorneys at Wattel& York. They cheated,strong armed me, and blackmailed me(with losing my home) into accepting an insulting offer,that thus far is less than $2,000 per year for a $200k injury thus far and I'm not near regaining my back health. Please, Sir public don't go to them, you'll lose more than your case.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										I was looking for someone to help me for the second time after being scammed once to help me remodify my mortage with Wells Fargo after waiting for them for over a year to do it also after two attempts. So I looked for companies on the internet and found Residential Litigation Group . They contacted me via email and then by phone and sent me documents to sign after getting all of my personal information ss#,banking information etc. They had me electronically sign documents and I did without thinking and they said they would start taking $1200 a month out until a total of $6000 is paid but at the end of the law suit I would get it back. Now they called me today 1/14/13 and said he was an attorney so we could discuss our agreement but I said I could not talk . He said he would call back on 1/15/13 at 12:00. I want to cancel the contract but don""t know if I can so I am going to notify my bank so they cannot draw out any money on the 25th of every month. I hope I can do this. In the meantime I don't know what is going on with my mortage and I need to know who can help me with this problem. The first people that scammed me got $1500 they were Top Legal Advocates and I cannot get in touch with them. They will not return my calls and I would like my money refunded.

										I was recommended to this attorney by a local realtor, for foreclosure defense services.  What a racket and what a bunch of nonsense.  My house was being lost to foreclosure in a few months, so I first reached out to him and left many messages and emails, only later to be told he was sick.  Ok, so I gave him some space, and then again tried to contact him, many messages and emails, and this time was told he was out of town.  Finally we got together, and I had a gut feeling not to retain him, as he was very much about the cash retainer of $3,000, upfront, but I was the classic desperate homeowner, foreclosure auction now only weeks away, so I went ahead with it.  Now again the nonsense started; no work, no answer, no reply... nada for fifteen days, and now the auction is days away, and he finally surfaces and advises me that he lost all of my files, hence no work accomplished... at this point I nicely and humbly advised him that I was not going to be put over the barrel by him in this fashion, and that I would need my fee refunded to me.  He of course refused, and then again, no responses, no replies... just vanished with my cash, and of course no response to the court, no defense... thus I was forced to file a bankruptcy, so a disaster all around..

										I was signed up for services that did not exist. I found out about that when I used the services available. When I requested a cancellation and full refund for fraudulent sales practices I was denied as I had already used the services. 
Their Identity theft program pulled my credit report 3 times in 2 weeks and caused my credit score to drop almost 100 points! 
I had an attorney write a letter to my landlord because of his refusal to refund my deposit. I get a form letter back saying if I needed to use their services again I would have to pay a retainer and hourly fee. I was told when I signed up that this was an legal services pool and that I had $170,000 a year coverage. I wouldn't have to pay anymore fees. They were included in the monthly fees I paid. 
I was told Legal Shield offered Credit Repair services, which they don't. 
I already had an attorney on retainer with reasonable rates. less than what I was told I would have to pay these guys.
I was told I could not pay my monthly fees on credit/debit card it had to be ACH. I was not told about the $10 signup fee not that the $45 I was charged a month would be broken up in to parts. So when the charges didn't hit my account for over a week - I was assessed 3 $22 NSF charges! Had it gone through on my debit card as requested, there would not have been any charges. I had only left $36 in my account to cover what I was told I was being charged...not the $45 that actually came through! 
I did get $7.75 back from the Identity Theft, but not the rest. They have refused to refund on the basis I used their services so am not entitled. Whether that is how I found out I was defrauded or not.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

Well we finally get to go to the deposition together I am basically and it was a horrendous mistake bringing him there..

										I went through a tough time the past few years, divorce, sick child and was laid off. It all culminated in my decision to file for bankruptcy. I looked around for an attorney to assist and found Eric Benzer in Baltimore Maryland. 
He seemed like a good guy and said he was willing to help me. Even told me about his life issues, which were similar. He said if I filed, I would start new and would be alright in a few years. He said he needed a retainer which I thought made sense. He asked for the retainer which was $25,000.00, I paid him from my personal checking account, some of the last money I had. 
As soon as he got the check, things changed. I never could get him on the phone, never could get him to answer emails. This proceeded for two months. I went to his office a few times and was always told he was in court or not available. Finally I got fed up, I waited outside his office and saw him walking to his Mercedes, I confronted him. He dodged all my questions and finally said he had given my retainer to another firm, and they had stolen my money!!!
What kind of lawyer would give your retainer to another lawyer! He never consulted me and this is not how lawyers work. Its obvious to me that Eric Benzer is a fraud, a thief and crook.

She and her staff are unprofessional she takes personal calls during the consultation, she tried to remember what I wanted my wife and my terms to be while driving and then typed the origanal agreement all wrong and re-charged me to do it again.

										I'm not going to get into details because I'm taking this to court.  I install a roof for a customer who was just looking for an installer.  No one knew about the roof because the company was new. Unfortunately for the lame customer I've had to deal with, the company who made the roofing product went bankrupt after only 2 years. I installed the roof to factory specs.  I tried to talk this customer out of this crap roof that weighed 70Lbs per sq. But he kept insisting this is what he wanted. The states paid roofing expert wrote in his report that I had put it on incorrectly.  The report changed from being my fault at arbitration when we sat across from one another. At arbitration the expert tore the manufacturer up and told us what a cheap product it was.  Before closing the arbitration I asked the state's expert, ""But I did put the roof on to the factory specifications right?""  He replied, ""yes, unfortunately your the installer. That proves no negligence on my part. So why did I lose a case on a roof I put on correctly over 4 years ago?  It's the same as the owner buying a Delorean car, then he sees it doesn't perform like he thought and since Delorean is bankrupt he has no recourse but too turn around and sue the assembly line workers and win.  How ludicrous can this be?  Then Steven McCormick gives the stubborn old cuss double the amount the roof would cost to replace.  
Straight up he screwed me and I still don't know why.
My only advice to anyone out there is that unless your a member of the Mason's, Shriners or Royal Order of Jesters, don't use this firm because you never quite know who the other person is your going up against.

I made the mistake of not meeting him in office because I was in San Diego, CA and his office was in Beverly Hills, CA which is a 2.5 - 3 hour drive so we met half way in Dana Point, CA.  His fee was $7,000.00 which I didn't have in full and told me he had a payment plan that I could be on. The 1st installment was $2,000.00, which I did pay. My definition of a payment plan is that when you make the first payment you have retained the services of the company you are paying the fee to.  Well, according to Roger Marchand this is not the case which he does NOT TELL YOU!  He made me believe that they were working on my case all along which was A BLATEN LIE!!! About 3 weeks later he tells me that nothing will be done until the full the $7,000. [continued below]....
									
										.....00 is paid.
 I gave him all my original paperwork in our 1 and only meeting which he was going to copy and send back to me.  That never happened he stole all my paperwork!!  I kept asking how long it was going to take to file the lawsuit??  He first told me that his paralegals were preparing the lawsuit, BIG FAT LIE, NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE!  Then I was told that I needed to pay for securitization audit, $600.00, so that they would have the specific causes for my case.  I understood that and paid the $600.00 to him on 7/19/12, he said it would be 5 business days before it would come back and that was what we were waiting for to file the lawsuit.  Well its now 7/31/12 over 7 business days later it never came back, I believe it was never ordered!!! He claims it was but I believe he is LIEING! JUST AS HE HAS DONE THE WHOLE TIME!  
On 7/31/12 I asked Roger once the audit was in when the lawuit would be filed?  HE NOW CHANGED HIS STORY AGAIN TELLING ME THAT THE LAWYERS NEEDED TO BE PAID AND WAS PUSHING ME TO PAY MORE MONEY AHEAD OF THE 3 MONTH SCHEDULE WE HAD AGREED TO. This is another LIE, he told me he uses paralegals for all the legal work!  Now he changed the story again, saying that he now needs the full $7,000.00 before anything will be filed.  This is such a gross lie that he led me to believe he would work on my case from when I paid the first monthly payment.  He has admitted in an email that nothing has been done and nothing will be done until the $7,000.00 is paid.  THAT IS NOT HOW A PAYMENT PLAN WORKS!  I retained this JERK and nothing was done on my case!  HE WILL NOT REFUND ANY MONEY AND WON'T REPOND!  I am pursuing a formal complaint with the Attorney General AND EVERY outlet I can find so no one else will be taken advantage of by this SCAM ARTIST AND LIAR!
As of 7/31/12 I paid Nevis Holdings LLC a total of $2600.00.  I have repeatedly tried to contact Roger Marchand on the phone and by email.  He will not respond at all.  My last communication was on Jul 31, 2012 at 8:45 AM via email.  I want a Full REFUND since he did not do any work at all on my lawsuit.  I also want all my original documents I gave him returned to me.
 I have the proof of him clearly stating that he has done nothing on my case and refuses to do anything work until the full $7,000 is paid.  On his website he advertises his services.

I paid my money and was told they would contact me and let me know how much to pay and when and where to pay it. He said it would be late Spring before it would be due ( I remember specifically because I told them I may be out of town for summer work up north). I gave them my number and address and left.

										..... They said they would get it taken care of and send me the paperwork to pay my fine. I had not heard anything or received anything from them by November. I went in to speak to them and was told I was assessed a $250 fine for failure to pay and I now owe $505. 
I asked to speak to someone in charge and the receptionist went into an office and returned with an attitude and toldme no one was there to speak to me. I was told there nothing that could be done except pay the new fine ( I was fined initially $255, instead of the $125-$150 I was told). I asked her to check my record and mysteriously the files were
removed at the end of 2010. She said someone would call me at the end of the day, which never happened. 
I received a phone called from a woman who proceeded to tell me that she was a supervisor and she looked at my file and said they called and left a message for me. This NEVER happened. I was told that my file said do not mail but when I spoke to them in July, they asked for my address to mail me my papers.When The lady said that I was rude and yell at the receptionist in a loud enough voice she could hear me over her music.
I was told no one was there to speak to but now there seems to have been a supervisor that WAS there but could not be bothered to come out because she was on lunch break  at 4pm.

use to get me out of my apartment. I paid over $700 with no success and 
no money back. They are too unorganized to be called a business, and 
too crazy to be called professionals. 
They care more about bringing new 
customers in then they do about taking care of the ones that they 
already have. Of course its because i had already signed a contract of 
promise to pay. I made a huge mistake dealing with these nut jobs and i 
hope that nobody has to go through what i went through.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE spread the word and help get these people out of business!									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										If  you are out of state and need services for a Florida attorney in Orlando, be very careful of an attorney named Paul N. Schaefer!  He was hired to assist in a legal guardianship matter and quoted $4500 prior to his contract being signed.After his contract was signed,  he was not available to assist with documents being filled out or questions being answered.  He sent multiple letters asking for more money than was actually agreed upon.  He did not know  county regulations regarding  legal guardianship matters even though he stated he had ""conducted"" years of guardianship cases.Mr. Schaefer lied  about court dates that was never on docket;  was misleading and was not upfront about information regarding the legal guardianship matter.  The only thing Mr. Schaefer was interested in was obtaining as much money as he possibly could.  Paul N. Schaefer mispresented the hours that he  actually worked on the  case and he over charged for the hours that he performed regarding the legal guardianship matters.  When he was asked him to account for the funds that was sent to him  (which was $5000 ) Mr. Schaefer submitted fifteen pages of hand written  SCRIBBLED notes which no one could understand or read!! Mr. Schaefer will take advantage of you if you pay him in advance,  yet if you do not pay him,  he will claim there are court dates that he wishes to ""reschedule""  for this, that or another reason""  when in fact,  the only reason he wants to do that is so that he can obtain the funds from you!He was asked to refund at least HALF of what was sent to him because he did not perform the work that he claimed he performed.  So far he has NOT refunded any funds.  This man will take you on an expensive ride if you are not careful !! I would not trust this man with any type of legal matters if I were you. Paul N. Schaefer made a  derogatory remark AFTER he was paid in full.  This man is unprofessional as an attorney.  He will try and soak you  out of your hard earned money and claim he has worked for hours that he actually has not worked!   He will tell you there are court dates when there are in fact,  no court dates on the docket! Mr. Schaefer was sent evidence to help build a case yet stated he never viewed the evidence...then claimed he ""earned""  the money that was sent to him!  Mr. Schaefer uses bait and switch tactics in my personal opinion.  He gives someone a  quote prior to signing his contract and then turns around and begins soaking them for fees they did not agree upon prior the signing the contract.   All you will receive is one letter after another by this man asking for more and more money!   He made multiple errors on his documents and then charged for his own spelling errors.  It is his client's fault he can't spell ??He told his client to email information to him so he could complete the documents and then he got mad that the client emailed a lengthy email that HE had to ""read"".  He then turned around and charged the client.  Then he made spelling errors and charged for that too!    The man is a bamboozler in my personal opinion.  If you want a professional....there are plenty of them in the Orlando Florida area.  It sure as hell isn't Paul N. Schaefer.  He cost the client $5000.  If you want to lose FIVE grand and get no results...he's your man!  The client could not even hire another attorney to help them because this bamboozler would not even refund at least half the money to the client so they could continue on with their case.  What a freakin' low life!  That's an attorney for you right there!",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										Im a past employee of Jared E Shafer Las Vegas former public guardian from 1979 through 2003.  In 2001 I joined Mr. Shafer after leaving college.  Over the years I personally witnessed Mr. Shafer stealing from accounts of his court assigned wards who were old, sick, and disabled.  Mr. Shafer was enabled by Shawn King of Gamett and King, a Las Vegas Certified Public Accounting firm who places their stamp of approval on Jared Shafers unlawful activities against senior citizens.    One case I want to share with you has been bothering me for three years.
Jared Shafer took over the guardianship of Nyta Mclintock in 2004 after she was diagnosed with dementia.  Nyta had a disabled son who was crippled with muscular dystrophy.  Nyta and her son were very close.  Nyta was her sons life and her son depended on her for his existence.  Nyta had money, enough to stay in her home and be taken care of with employment of care givers.  Her son could have benefited from his mothers savings. Shawn king was their accountant.  When Nyta became ill Shawn let my boss know a tasty senior prize was available for the taking. 
When Jared Shafer assumed his responsibilities he said to both mother and son you will not be together.  Two handicapped people living in the same house is a big Burdon and as your guardian I will not have this. Mother and son objected, but my boss, Jared Shafer told them to man up and keep their stupid mouths shut. A relative of the family hired an attorney to fight Mr. Shafer.  During the proceedings Shawn King of Gamett and King reported to the court the money Nyta had in her trust was lost.  It appeared someone had placed Nytas securities on margin through a mysterious set of guardianship orders and withdrew large amounts of money from the family trust.   Jared Shafer removed mother and son from their home and sold the house.  Both of them were placed in substandard care facilities, which had numerous health department violations.  The son killed himself on November 10, 2007 and within two months Nyta died of starvation.  
Claire Shafer received a large amount of money from Shawn King, which they said came from her uncle, but when I saw the records, which showed this money to be from the sale of the same securities Nyta had owned my suspicions were aroused.  
I have reported Jared Shafer and Shawn King to the Las Vegas police, the Nevada attorney General, the Las Vegas FBI, Social Security, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  All agencies turn a blind eye to cases involving Guardian abuse.  Shawn King constantly meets with Jared Shafer.  Shawn and Jared settled a securities fraud case in the federal court of Utah in 2008 involving the sale of securities without a license.  These securities went bankrupt. Both Shawn king and Jared Shafer knew the securities were in danger of failure when they sold them to seniors who were looking for extra income. Shawn told the senior investors the securities were as safe as United States savings bonds.    Shawn has told me that his accounting practice wouldnt exist without the help of Jared Shafer.  
Guardian abuse is now at epidemic levels throughout the country with Nevada leading all states. Failure to regulate and enforce guardian regulations are the cause of this abuse.  The attorney general Ms. Masdoe owes her position to Jared Shafer through a friendship Shafer had with her father. As such she will not defend any senior who falls victim to Jared Shafer. This is a direct policy of her office. Ms. Masdoes behavior is understandable, according to a Los Angeles times reporter, Ashley Powers Masdoes house is under mortgage water.  She needs Jared Shafer to bail her out of debt.  It is widely known throughout federal law enforcement Nevada operates on the good old boy network.  Close to 100% of elected and non elected officials in Nevada owe their positions to friendships or political connections. The Los Angeles times article in 2006 entitled Juice for Justice called Nevadas legal system a pay to play fiasco.  The times article wrote about the criminal courts, it would be very interesting to read what they write about the Las Vegas family court.  
The group of individuals in charge of protecting seniors in Nevada managed by Jared Shafer makes their living by harming senior citizens.  The groups relationship with each other is incestuous, especially in the way they protect each other from unlawful actions the group members commit against seniors.  Lying, stealing, submitting false documents, bribing judges, threatening family members, and embezzlement of funds are normal daily activities for this horrible group of degenerates.
I will continue to report their activities and post to all forums.  Someone will eventually listen and take action to stop the deaths and abuse of countless innocent seniors.

										In 2007 my wife and I asked this law firm to file fraud law suits against Eldridge construction in London, Utah.  The law firm filed the suit and 30 days were given for the defendants to answer the suit.  The law firm kept asking for more money and we kept trying to find a way to give them money.  After one year the law firm dropped the law suit and they would not return our calls.  After the statute of limitations had run out on the case I found out that the law firm didn't do much of anything on our case!  When a suit is filed the defendant has thirty days to answer the charges against them.  if the answer is not filed with in the thirty days, my attorney may file for an automatic judgment.  We found out that a good three months went past before the defendants filed an answer to the charges.  We should have had an automatic judgment by then.  Our attorneys didn't  bother to ask the court for a hearing date on our case in fact we aren't exactly sure what they did on our case.  I demanded two different times for an itemized statement showing what they used the money for and showing just exactly what they did on our case with no success!As a result of this law firms incompetence we lost our house and everything we own with no way of recovering anything!  And Eldridge construction owned by Steven Eldridge and Lindon Parks got away with several counts of fraud which we had documentation for!  WE HAD PROOF!

										In December of 2011, we contacted David J. Willis at LoneStarLandLaw to assist us with writing up legal documents for an owner finance transaction.  He quoted us a fee of $550 excluding county clerk's filing fees.  We paid him the full amount up front.
He sent us draft documents to review with our buyers.  We had issues with the buyers and a few months elapsed.  However, we kept in constant communication with David at which time he never mentioned or notified us of a deadline.
On the week of March 5th we communicated with him that we finally had our buyers information together and asked him to make the change to the draft documents.  The only thing that was to change on these documents was the buyer name and address.  Everything else was to remain the same.
At that time, Mr. Willis began sending us emails that we needed to start the process over. [continued below]....
									
										..... We did not understand what was going on.  In an email he said he could not be responsible for documents that were 4 months old.  First of all, the documents were not 4 months old and second of all, he had the original draft documents in his possession.  Why would anything be at risk?
So my husband proceeded to contact him and ask him what he meant?  He then went into some mumbo jumbo explanation about going to a doctors office one time and then going again and wanting the service for free.  Then he hung up on my husband because he said my husband was hostile.  I was there during that call and my husband was in no way hostile.  Trust me, he would have know if he was hostile!  Then we tried calling him back because obviously there was a miscommuncation but he would not return our calls our our emails.  
After several email attempts I proceeded to let him know that he did not complete our transaction and that he should refund us our money if he was not wanting to continue.  If he did not, I told him I would report him to the BBB.  He finally proceeded to respond that he owed us nothing, that he did his job and that we gave final approval.  That was a total lie!
If we had completed the transaction he should have filed the paperwork with the county and he did not.  Timelines were never discussed and we never gave final approval.  I asked him to show proof that I gave final approval and he did not responde.  
He just didn't want to do the work anymore because he had already received his money. This guy is rude, obnoxius, discourteous, a theif and does not care one bit about his clients. No wonder he does all his business online because he cannot deal with people. Do not use his services.  He will find a way to scam you out of your money!",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										In my experience with Marc Hershovitz he pretended to be a competent lawyer and proved himself to not only be unable to win an easily winnable case because of his bad decision making but simply a rude and ""slimy"" seeming fellow.  
I regret hiring Marc Hershoitz and would never recommend him to my friends or colleagues.  
Marc Hershovitz repeatedly lied to me and sent me a bill that was absolutely insane.  He included billable hours for times where he spoke to me on the phone about his family members.  The man is in my opinion absolutely unethical.  Many would say that lawyers are often unethical and that is not generally my opinion.  I have had great lawyers for certain things and hired Marc Hershovitz for a specific type of case that he held himself to be an expert with.  
I find Marc Hershovitz to be an incapable lawyer.  He pretended to be successful but upon further investigation for my pending lawsuit against him, He was found to live in an average apartment and drive an old Honda Civic.  (Post Glen - 4120 Peachtree Road, Atlanta, GA)  Look into this guy before hiring him.
It is my advice to never hire Marc Hershovitz.  He is a terrible lawyer and a terrible value.  Find someone else for the same rate and you'll come out money ahead and have a better chance to win your case.

These ""advocates"" are not qualified CPA's nor Accountants that can actually guide you on your tax issues.  In some cases they are not even qualified to obtain your personal information.
Letters via email are known to be Scams. USPS letters that arrive by regular mail are being sent out to unsuspecting taxpayers in order to acquire personal data that you wouldn't normally offer to a stranger. Be extremely cautious if you or your employer receives a letter questioning your Withholding Allowances. 
These letters instruct your employer to no longer honor the allowances you claim on your tax forms.
It instructs them to withhold at 0. According to the Federal Trade Commission no one decides that for you. Employers are worried if they don't comply they will be liable for taxes owed by their employees. (according to the irs.gov  website)
The only website for tax related/IRS answers is www.irs.gov 
If you get a letter that pertains to Lock-in withholding allowances from an IRS Advocate please do yourself a favor and check it out before contacting them.

										It is apparent that Robert Hannan files motions, financials and other important documents late. Seems opposing counsel and clients are left in the dark most of the time. I really dont like reading a review I found online which appears to be a woman Robert. This woman states you basically told her to shut up? If this is true you are a coward Mr. Hannan. 
I know that you are a pilot to Robert, I also found you here: Pilot. This site claims you hold a commercial pilots license Robert. I have a question, I wonder if Robert Hannan charges people to fly from point A to point B. I further wonder if he does charge people, if he claims it on IRS, or writes it off, since the Broward courthouse has him owing two hundred fifty thousand dollars to a mortgage in Marina Garcias court. Interesting it is with her court, considering Robert Hannan Tries many divorce cases through her. [continued below]....
									
										..... I wonder if Robert Hannan is shown leniency?I have also read on another post on you that you may have ties with Judge Hurley, is this true Robert?
I am so glad that someone else posted on you Robert Hannan, otherwise I would have never found Rip Off report and brought you to justice, which you deserve. 
Robert Hannans style of divorce I simple, drag it out, file motion after motion, conjure up a huge bill.
Avvo.com appears to show Robert Hannan again writing his own positive review. Avvo also appears to show an affiliation with Woman In Distress and Mr. Hannan. With these claims, I hope Mr. Hannan isnt preying on womens emotions, it would appear so, but that is just my opinion. One review which was flagged on Yelp claims he does prey on women, but again anyone can write whatever online.  Here is the facts Avvo claims he in affiliated with Woman in Distress, and someone wrote he preys on women, and apparently a woman wrote he basically told me to shut up every time I asked about my case. My mind is made up but you the reader need to be the judge. 
 
I also found 2 other rip off reports on Robert Hannan on here: Robert S Hannan
And also another one located here : Robert HannanIn closing, If you have anything to report on Robert, do it on Rip Off Report, they keep these reports up, its called freedom of speech.

Phone: 910-483-7680Please take my advise as a former client of Attorney James H. Cooke he will be detrimental to your case. He will not do the necessary research on your behalf thereby placing you at a disadvantage from the on-start. He will not prepare for any of your hearings placing a prepared opposing party at an advantage because he will not be prepared to fight for you. There will be no pre-trial preparations also putting you at a disadvantage. He will not prepare monthly statements so you can stay on top of where you are financially with billing and ultimately you will receive an extremely ridiculously high bill with little ""real""work done by him or his staff. His timekeepers billing is so horrible resulting in many overcharges but you will never get your money back. His staff is ill prepared and lack basic knowledge and very rude and they do not even pretend to advocate for you. Basically, you're like a number not a real client just being moved right along and collecting your money. I regret not doing my research before retaining him so I am warning everyone reading this note to do your research and you will find several complaints about his level of representation which in my case was low, low, low the worse representation money can buy for my hard earned thousands of dollars. I do not have money to throw away but that is exactly what I did by retaining his services. If the opposing party has a good lawyer you are dead in the water he will make arrangements without informing you, settle or negotiate an agreement that will favor the opposing party all because he comes unprepared and not ready for the gun fight. Before hiring him do your research honestly, you are better off being a Pro Se. This is my opinion and reflects my experience. I am not telling anyone not to retain this attorney just a word of caution to do your research. I would never recommend him to anyone who's looking for honest representation.

										January 2012 we obtained Prudent Law Group to assist us we our Loan Modification with BOA, after two and a half years of battling with the bank and submitting hundreds and hundreds of financial documents, we were exhausted, stressed, and in need for legal assistances.
 
After being declined 8 times and receiveing a letter from BOA that we needed legal representation we decided to look for a Law Firm that would provide the legal assistance needed to help us work with the bank. 
We called several Law Firms in hope that we would not be ""Taken for a Ride"" or ""Ripped OFF."" After our first initial conversation with Donelle Goodwin, a representative working for Prudent Law Group, we decided to go with ""Prudent Law Group"" because Donelle seemed to be compassionate and understanding because she herself was in a similar situation, we felt comfortable knowning that there was a Law Firm that was willing to help us get our Mortgage Loan Modified, all we had to do was make a deposit of $3,500 into their Bank of America Account (#2439474655) (routing# 026009593), then they would start immediately on our behalf. 
It's been 7 months and we have not heard anything from Prudent Law Group, after several phone calls and email messages I started to get a gut feelings that we have just been ""RIPPED OFF."" or ""Taken for a Ride"" and just got dumped, something we feared from the start and now it just happened to us.
Our story is only 1 of millions in the same situation, we are so upset that we were taken advantage of and now we are struggling even harder to hold on to our home with no help, we fear the worst, like a knock on our door to vacate the property will little to no notice.

										Kate Schmutz was my attorney for my divorce case. She never explained to me my rights. And she never represented my rights either. All she cared about was getting paid. Now, I live very meagerly and my health is not getting better. Kate Schmutz never questioned me about my health condition. So, now having to work two full time jobs to pay child support in which I could never afford in the first place is very stressful. I told Kate Schmutz that I would have to live in a homeless shelter if I had to pay child support. But, she didn't care. Also, my ex-husband moved to another state so, both the State of South Carolina and the other state in which my ex-husband is living in are trying to collect child support from me for the same four children. I was told that the case in South Carolina was supposed to be closed five years ago. But, it is still open. This is destroying my credit.The state of in which I presently reside in could care less too. They said if I have to prostitute myself to pay child support, that I should do it.

										Lee lawyer, care center dispute family's claim that woman with dementia had will changed By AISLING SWIFTPublished Tuesday, September 18, 2012FORT MYERS Thirty days before her death, 84-year-old Audrey Muller was wheeled from a Lee County skilled care nursing unit and back into her bedroom in the assisted living section.It was June 9, 2010, and the retired longtime Edison State College dean had lost 70 pounds, suffered from dementia, three types of cancer and was on heavy painkillers.The civil lawsuit that describes her medical condition in her final days also alleges that two friends who were asked to be witnesses watched as a nursing home employee ""guided"" her hand to sign a new will that amended her 1992 will and trust.""She was almost comatose and she did not acknowledge (the friends) and most importantly, someone had to hold her hand to sign,"" attorney Steven Jaffe told a judge at a recent hearing. [continued below]....
									
										.....An hour after she was released from Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers on June 25, 2010, and sent home for hospice care to die, the lawsuit says, Muller signed another document that revised her 1992 trust and made a Lee County lawyer the representative of her estate. Two weeks later, she died.Instead of leaving most of her estate to two relatives, trust documents show the bulk was left to Cypress Cove at Healthpark Florida; before that day, court documents show, the adult residential center Cypress Cove wasn't even a beneficiary.Those allegations are at the heart of a lawsuit Linda Brega, 50, and her son, Daniel Muller, 25, of North Miami Beach, filed against Cypress Cove and Fort Myers attorney Kevin A. Kyle. It alleges Muller's physical and mental capacity had declined so much and she was so ill that it left her vulnerable to undue influence and opportunism.The lawsuit, filed last year in Miami-Dade County, was transferred this year, at the defendants' request, to Lee Circuit Court, where the defendants' attorneys and Kyle practice and Kyle's two brothers are judges.The lawsuit alleges that on June 25, 2010, Muller removed Wells Fargo Bank as her trustee, named Kyle trustee and gave him $10,000. Documents show it was Kyle who amended the will and trust. His firm wrote the original will and trust.Jaffe said Brega and Muller couldn't comment until the case is resolved. Josh Levinson, who represents Cypress Cove, and Matthew Linde, Kyle's lawyer, declined to comment, as did Kyle.* * * * *Muller worked from 1973 to 1990 at Edison, initially as a department chair and quickly rose to assistant dean of academic affairs before being named director of the then-Collier Center in Naples in 1981.But in her final days, Muller was in a ""diminished, confused state,"" on heavy painkillers, her mind so controlled by persuasion, pressure and outside influences that she didn't sign the documents voluntarily, doing so instead at the urging of others, the lawsuit alleges.Court records, Daniel Muller's sworn statement, private investigator Mike Fisten's account and arguments during a June 27 court hearing provide this account:Muller, a Catholic school dean before becoming a dean at Edison, never married or had children. She was close to her niece, Brega, who is a nurse, and her son, whom Muller treated like her grandson. In 1992, she set up The Audrey Muller Trust, giving them equal shares after disbursements to Edison College and others.Seven years later, Muller paid $250,000 to move to an independent living condo at Cypress Cove, where she also paid a monthly fee that covered living and medical expenses as she aged.In 2007, after she got lost while driving, Cypress Cove took title to her car. Two years, later, she began to suffer lapses of memory and confusion. As she aged, she moved to the skilled nursing care section, where she received full-time care, often was hospitalized and was placed on painkillers.""In early 2010, Linda Brega received a telephone call from Audrey Muller, who expressed the delusion that she had lost all her money  and feared that (Cypress Cove) was going to remove her,"" the lawsuit says.Brega noticed all of her art work, furniture, jewelry and heirlooms were missing from her room. Afterward, she and her son repeatedly tried to call Muller, but said they were prohibited and weren't told about her declining health.On June 9, 2010, when her will was amended, Muller was under 24-hour nursing care. Days later, she was found on the floor unconscious and taken to Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers.""On June 25, the hospital sent her home to hospice care, to die,"" Fisten said, noting that an hour later, she was placed on a conference call and again signed amendments to her estate papers. ""On the day Kyle made himself the trustee, on the 25th, she was on such heavy pain medication I doubt she knew what she was doing at all.""She died in July 2010 and was sent to a funeral home to be cremated.""The funeral home said they can't cremate without the authorization of family members, but Cypress Cove said she had no relatives or contact with family members,"" Fisten said, adding that Brega and her son visited her, were always listed as her contacts at the nursing home and their numbers never changed.* * * * *The defendants deny the allegations and filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit.Lee Circuit Judge J. Frank Porter rejected the defense motions to dismiss in July. Jaffe has begun taking depositions from nurses, doctors, nursing home employees and outside doctors and nurses.Last month, Cypress Cove filed papers demanding that Brega and Muller prove their allegations, including that they're relatives  and that they'd visited, called or received gifts from Muller. The business' attorney also demanded they provide photos of themselves with Muller.Under court procedures, if a beneficiary like Cypress Cove cannot provide a reasonable explanation about its active role in procuring the will, it's enough for a judge to find undue influence occurred. However, if Cypress Cove has a reasonable explanation, the burden shifts to Brega and her son to provide evidence the will was changed due to undue influence.At the June hearing, Jaffe told the judge Brega and Muller only discovered her death after checking obituaries online. Jaffe argued Kyle intentionally didn't inform them of their rights or provide them with the 1992 papers that gave them the bulk of the estate, so they were unaware that there was anything to contest.Legal papers filed by the defense maintain there was no undue influence by Cypress Cove. The defense contends that because Brega and Muller never challenged the June 9, 2010, will and trust, they can't contest the June 25, 2010, revised trust.Cypress Cove's attorney, Levinson, contended Brega and Muller cashed their $1,000 checks from the estate and never contested the will in probate court.""The will now is what I call uncontestable,"" Levinson argued in court. ""This prevents them from having their cake and eating it too.""For his part, Kyle has denied in court papers that he failed to provide the relatives with the 1992 trust, but admitted he didn't send them a notice to inform them they had 90 days to contest the amended trust. He also denied refusing to provide them with the earlier version of the trust or telling them the 1992 trust never existed.Jaffe contends he has the evidence to prove his case against Cypress Cove and Kyle.""You can't get an incapacitated person to sign legal papers,"" said Fisten, Jaffe's private investigator. ""And a nursing home cannot take anything from a patient, especially one suffering from a medical condition.""If that were the case,"" he said, ""you'd have all these elderly people suffering from dementia turning their money over to nursing homes.""

I had to call weekly to get the updates. The response from this company was they are working on it. We didn't have alot of time to waste.  Our mortgage was getting further behind. I continued to call Legal Loan over & over again to find out the status & I kept getting the same response we are working on it.  The mortgage company stated no one was contacted them.  3 months into this process our mortgage company switched our loan to another mortgage company. I called & sent all the paperwork to Legal Loan concerning the new mortgage company change.  After another 3 months they didn't send anything & we were very close to our home being forclosed. So I had to handle a modification on our own. I sent all the paperwor to the mortgage company (since LLR didn't send it) & was assigned a mortgage rep that worked on our modication. After me handling everything with out LLR help we got a modification but it was nothing what LLR promised. We didn't get a 2% interest rate & our payment only was reduced by $98.00 not what LLR promised of around $550.00. To sum this up we payed LLR for a service we never received. I did all the work LLR didn't do anything but scam us out of money & promised things we didn't get. WE WON'T OUR MONEY BACK. We are still struggling & we sent money to this company we didn't have.

										Lexington Law may be a legal company, but they know how to scam you. The way they do it is by having you sign up for their services and then you are the one who has to furnish them with your credit reports... they can't get them on their own, so you must pay for the reports and send them to them. Then they wait until the end of the billing period before sending out dispute letters on your behalf..and might I add that this is nothing more than what you can do on your own without their assistance.  Then they do nothing until it is time for you to get billed again and then they send out another couple of dispute letters, instead of sending them all at once the 1st time. To make a long story short, my FICO score was 632 when I started with them and SIX months and SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS later it was 635.By law, they can only continue services for more than six months unless you give them permission to renew your contract. They make it hard to cancel your contract by having to MAIL them a cancelation notice in writing. You can't cancel over the phone or by email. You hear nothing from them until your contract is about to expire and then they start blowing up your phone. If you don't answer their calls, they will cancel your contract in exactly six months and then BILL YOU AGAIN AFTER it has been cancelled and tell you that it's your final bill for services they had already performed.In the end, I payed 700.00 dollars to change my FICO SCORE THREE POINTS!  SCAM!

										Men getting divorced in Wisconsin:  Do not allow Karen Zimmerman to act as the Guardian Ad Litem for your child during a divorce.
Fathers, if you are getting divorced and want to see your child under no circumstances permit Karen Zimmerman to be the GAL for your child if you ever want to see them again.  Zimmerman is totally biased against men/fathers.  She will take the wife/mothers word as the gospel no matter how outrageous or outlandish the allegations are.  All your ex spouse has to do is say you do drugs or drink or anything no matter how false it is and she will not even question it and then you are stuck trying to prove a negative i.e. that something didn't happen, like you don't drink or don't take drugs which is very hard and expensive to do.  
She favors the mothers so much it should be criminal.  Then on top of all that you have to pay her $300.00 per hour not to see your child--which you can do for free.  She will also send you to some therapist that she is buddy buddy with who will charge you another $200.00 per hour to sit there and watch you meet with your child as she scrawls notes down on everything you do.  
The bottom line is Men don't let her anywhere near your case, you will regret it.

										Michigan - Friend of the court has charged me surcharges and fee's that took my original support debt of $11,500 to $29000.I had custody of my two children along with the other parent's child from 1989 to 1992. In 1989 I left the state with the children to California and then to Oregon, which Oregon should of had Jursidication at this point. I sent children to Mothers in Michigan in summer of 1992. She went in to Michigan court and filed for custody and Michigan ordered it with support against me. I had no support during 1989-1992 against her. they wouldnt do it because they didnt like me. they dropped the ball again as usual. so at this point she owes me for 2 and a half years with a extra child of hers.During her custody years of the children from 1992-1994, she abused and neglected the children and i regained custody again. I had to rescue them in Michigan from  her abuse/neglect of the children. Again, no support order was ever put against the mother. I have had the kids since Dec. 1994 to their legal ages of 18. I have had no help getting a support order against her. they dropped the ball again. i even had a order started against her and it dissapeared in the friend of the court<enemy of the people> they should be called.Now it is 2012, and i find out i have a judgement entered against me in the amount of $25000.00. In which is only  approxiamelty 6000.00 on original support order and the remaining in surcharges and fees. While she has skated her whole life with no support order! i rescued them from her documented abuse, neglect, and welfare fraud,they did nothing. now after 18 years they are, giving her monies for neglect. she had them 2 years i had the 15 years and im owed nothing. if i owe 25,000 she owes me 120,000. if she paid me i could of paid them. so they want me to pay three times for raising my kids,,and charge me surcharges while i have the kid for all those years. and she skates again, and is proud of it because the courts allowed her to be proud of almost killing my kids. i arrived in michigan in the middle of december to rescue them because i got a call they hadnt eaten in 3 days and they havent seen there mother in a month,,mind you my childrens ages were 3,5,. i thought some one killed the bitch so i dropped everything and went to there home to check it out from oregon. when i got there they had the door wide open cuz it wouldnt shut to much stuff piled in the way. 3 oclock in the morning i got there.then i proceed to look for them and they were cuddled up in a pile of dog and cat feces ,and garbage pile. the whole house was 3 to 4 feet high of garbage. i started balling when i got them to come out of the pile of garbage. no heat, power ,,food,, or water,,and shes on welfare. so i went to a hotel and got them cleaned up and they were malnourished and a wreck, my two beautiful kids punished by her and the state. so i called the state and told them how i found them and they came and arrested ME for non support and caused my kids more trauma at the hotel room. i gave them there bullshit 500 to get out after spending 4 days in jail and they put my kids in foster care in the mean time. then they said i could not leave with the kids until i signed off charges for abuse and neglect on her. why was i suppose to do that? i dont know, so i did so i could leave the state of michigan under duress to sign., back to our residence in oregon. i never got any credit for saving them or my trip and she skates again. so at that time i owed them like 8,000 for the two years and now it went up to like 30,000 .i tried on numerous occasions to get a order on her and they never got it done. so how can 1 person have to pay and not the other. and now they say like 11,000 is owed to her. like im going to pay her for leaving my kids for dead and using all the welfare money and food stamps for her drug habit. now shes selling presciption drugs on the street here in oregon and still skates. i would love to sue the state for what they put my family through. they caused permanent damage to my kids and myself. how much more can a person take? they suck and i need help from someone,,i have enough to hire someone if they read this. i have proof for everything i have said i have saved all of my documents from the begining. so government agency the friend of the court,,i motion to change there name to enemy of the children!!!!",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

I did everything I was suppossed to do in order to file and met with him, I gave him all the information he needed, my credit counseling certificate and his money.  I told him I needed the case filed ASAP as I was facing losing my home and vehicles.  Well, he cashed my retainer the next day and it has now been a week in a half and he has not filed my case and will not return phone calls, emails or texts.  He replied once saying he had left his phone in his ex-wife's car and just got it back and would resolve my issues immediately-well, that was 3 days ago and he still has not responded again.

										Mr. Inserra was retained to file a bankruptcy in NY state for us. We had explained repeatedly how years ago, we had to file bankruptcy and our vehicle was never reaffirmed. They assured us they would take care of it. Prior to filing bankruptcy, we did a loan modification to lower our payments for 6 months, to allow us to save some money to move from NY to CA, as my active duty husband was being medically discharged. We told Mr. Inserra's office this before filing. We contacted Mr. Inserra's office every month to find out when the paperwork would come in to sign to reaffirm our 2007 Chrysler Pacifica, so that we could keep the vehicle. They told us that they would call Santander, the finance company, and find out where the paperwork was. They said this every month. We also called Santander to request the paperwork be sent every month. They told us they emailed it on May 11, 2012. Mr. Inserra's office received the paperwork, but said they did not at first. Our bankruptcy was discharged May 14th, which made it too late to reaffirm the loan. When I contacted Mr. Inserra's office, he said they contacted them via email and mail, but had not called the company, and that with our modified payments, we wouldn't have been eligible for a reaffirmation, which was not what they told us. Santander, upon receiving notice of our bankruptcy and desire to reaffirm the loan, canceled our modification of payments, but did not notify us, as all communication had to be done through the attorney's office. Had Mr. Inserra's office called them, they would have been told this so that we couldve made the full payments, and the reaffirmation could have been completed. Mr. Inserra admitted his office dropped the ball by not contacting us, but then dodged my husbands phone calls, until he finally told him he is not allowed to contact his office again and hung up on him. Now, we have a vehicle that will be repossessed and no contract to keep it, and my husband and children are stranded in NY and cannot make it out to CA to our new home. We have no extra money to pay a down payment on a new car, as it was going to the modified payments on a vehicle we thought we were keeping.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										My experience with Guardian Ad Litem Jennifer A. Rackley began when she was appointed to the child custody portion of my divorce case. I went to my temporary hearing on January 31st 2012 and my ex seemed very adamant on having a GAL appointed to our case. The only reason I was opposed to it, and I was honest with the judge about, was because I have a non verbal learning disability which affects me socially.
Being disabled doesn't just mean being in a wheelchair. You can have a disability that's not physical. I told Judge David LaFrancois that due to my disability, my words and actions could possibly be misinterpreted by the GAL. LaFrancois didn't care about my disability whatsoever and assigned Rackley to my case.In my first conversations with Ms. Rackely, she seemed very nice and professional.
When I spoke with her over the phone this first time, it was to give her my correct address so she could send me paperwork. [continued below]....
									
										..... I felt no hostility from her, she seemed like she really cared about her job and doing the best for the child involved. The next time I spoke with Ms. Rackley was to set up a time for her to come to view my home. I had been busy with an audition (I was trying out for a television show) and needed to schedule the home visit either before or after the audition took place.
Ms. Rackley was kind, understanding and respected my scheduling needs. When she came to my home, it felt more like she was a friend than an authority. She was very nice and was kind to the roommates I had at the time and to my animals. We got along well and I felt comfortable being honest with her. I thought she was there to help me. The home visit went fine and Ms. Rackley and I had a good conversation about the case.
I was honest with Jennifer about my ex husband manipulating the courts and making all kinds of false statements against me.
My ex had told Jennifer Rackley I 'did drugs' and had 'mental problems'. Both accusations were not only false, but extremely hurtful. I had starting going to my primary care physician for monthly drug testing on my own free will starting in roughly July of 2011..... EVERY TEST CAME BACK CLEAN.
As far as the 'mental problems', my ex isn't qualified to be diagnosing ANYONE with mental problems nor have I EVER had any kind of history of mental problems. My learning disability is NOT a mental problem, it is a neurological problem. More recently,  and I have been suffering depression and anxiety since my ex husband cheated and left for a heroin addict prostitute he met in AA and I visited my doctor for help with the depression. 
I received an antidepressant, a small dose, and took it reliably under my doctor's care. My ex turned a simple ailment such as situational depression and anxiety and let Rackley to believe I 'had mental problems'. When Ms. Rackley showed up here, I walked my talk. I showed her my papers from my doctor, stating I'm being treated for depression and anxiety, cannot work and am on an antidepressant on a temporary basis. She seemed satisfied with my home, the environment AND the care I took of myself, said home and my daughter. I felt Ms. Rackley saw my sincere honesty that day and I trusted her to make the right decision regarding my daughter...... I was gravely wrong.
To the tune of $1000, Ms. Rackley performed a horrifically primitive investigation and was easily persuaded by my ex's money and expensive lawyer..... I was extremely disappointed to see Ms. Rackley's integrity go from who could provide the best home environment for the child to who could financially afford her.
My ex offered Rackley nothing but false statements with no proof.... and Rackley bought every bit of it hook, line and sinker.
Instead of exercising proper judgment and holding my ex accountable for filing false statements, she decided it was easier to bleed me for an extra $120 I don't even have for a HAIR DRUG TEST, due to my ex's false accusations. She also wrote that 'both parents have criminal records'...Hogwash. My ex had been arrested multiple times since he was a juvenile, got a DUI and was charged with a felony.
I, on the other hand, have only been arrested TWO times my entire life!
The first time, I told a Portsmouth Police officer ""No, I will NOT have an affair with you behind your wife's back!"" and he falsely arrested me to 'teach me a lesson'..... I was arrested but the charges were mysteriously dropped because the cop didn't want me to tell the judge about his praying on and stalking me. I've been taken advantage of by authority before because my disability makes me an easy target..... The second time I got arrested??? I took the fall for my ex, who was facing a felony charge! If he got arrested, he would have gone to jail and my daughter would have had no father. I took the fall so he wouldn't have to miss time out of his daughter's life.....Pffft. What a stupid woman to compare my two dinky arrests to my ex's extensive criminal record.
She didn't do ANY investigating into what was being said, she merely placed her judgment on who could pay their way out of it. For the $1000 fee she was paid, I expected a 5 star investigation and no stones unturned. I was dead wrong.... Not only was I being forced to buy my child back, instead of taking my word and the proof of a drug free lifestyle from my primary care doctor, Rackley demanded I spend the money on a hair drug test to show ""I cared for my daughter"". APPALLING!!
I went to my doctor to show her father I was doing NOTHING wrong, now this GAL is telling me my doctor's tests are nothing because I didn't 'spend money on them to prove I care about my daughter'. She cared more about how much I SPENT on my daughter than how much I LOVED her. It didn't matter I loved my daughter more than anything else in this world to Ms. Rackley, what mattered to her was the fact I didn't have a trust fund to buy the authorities like my ex.
It didn't matter to Rackley my ex lied to the courts just a year ago when he filed a false statement for the purpose of obtaining a restraining order against me when I had done nothing wrong. He deliberately deprived a child of a wholesome and loving relationship with her mother for no reason other than he felt like hurting me. That was 'acceptable' to Ms. Rackley, she wasn't the slightest but disgusted by the young man whose built an empire of lies. The same man who lied to a judge last year was at it again....and this time he had the money to buy Ms. Rackley's judgment instead of rightfully earning it.
Ms. Rackley awarded an equal judgment in her first report but then turned her judgment around on July 3rd 2012. While at court with Rackley, my ex and his lawyer, his lawyer stuck her head in the room I was in and spat lightly on the floor. This is a woman who deliberately provoked me when she kept breathing into my face at a mediation session. The woman knew I had a disability and knew if she kept getting close to my face I would have a problem with it.
Well, the lawyer provoked a disabled person at court....and instead of sympathizing with me, Jennifer Rackley discriminated against my having a learning disability, stating she 'didn't like how I behaved' and because she didn't like, she decided she didn't want my daughter around me. I was around adults and there was an adult altercation that occurred, it didn't involve my child whatsoever and here Rackley was making it out to the courts like it had.
There was no proof of any wrongdoing on my part, it was my ex's lawyer who shouldn't have deliberately provoked a disabled person in court that day. The lawyer was not reprimanded by anyone for her behavior that day, but I was! Rackley's disposition completed changed. Instead of telling the courts what a wonderful, fine, talented and fit mother I was, Rackley put on her little acting face and told Judge David LaFrancois in a baby voice how ""she was concerned if my daughter saw the courtroom incident.""
My child wasn't there, only adults were. And one of the adults did something they shouldn't have and deliberately provoked a person with a disability who was clearly stressed in that situation. Rackley was 100% aware of my person and how I was as a mother. I had been honest with her about the stress of the divorce and look where it got me: childless, penniless and possibly homeless too!
Ms. Rackley turned on me the day my ex's money mattered more than my daughter's welfare. It's a shame Ms. Rackley cares more about how much money a parent has compared to how much they care. Ms. Rackley's 'investigation' included calling my then attorney several months ago and obtaining the names and phone numbers of relatives. She got the phone number for my mother and called demanding a complete background on me.
My mother had nothing to hide. I was a good kid, never got into trouble but I DID have a non verbal learning disability. It doesn't interfere with my ability to be a parent but it does affect me in social situations such as a court case. However, Ms. Rackley NEVER called my ex's only living parent, his father. If Ms. Rackley called my lawyer and got my mother's name and number, chances are she called my ex's lawyer requesting the same information.... and she was NOT provided with me ex's father's name or number.... and he's very much alive, well and willing to give an honest account of his son's very trouble background....
Rackley never spoke with my ex's father and as of this writing, she hasn't returned his calls. My ex's lawyer did NOT want Rackley speaking with her client's father because she knew the father would paint a drastically different picture of him than the one she was painting. Why did Ms. Rackley not call my ex's father? Was she told he was no longer alive? Estranged? Refused to talk? None of that's true. My ex's dad was, is and always was willing to speak with Rackley, whom he met on July 3rd for the first time. She gave him her business card and urged him to call as soon as possible.... July 3rd was the first, last and only time my ex's dad spoke to Rackley. He has called her numerous times since July 3rd to report the seriousness of his son's mental state, Rackley won't return his calls.
Since I lost custody of my daughter AND my decision making rights to my child on July 3rd, it's been downhill from there. My ex has been taking minimal care of our daughter, sending her to daycare filthy dirty and greasy hair. There was a complaint with the daycare regarding my ex's bathing of the child and allowing the child to starve at school. The daycare workers assured me they would be calling Rackley about this and they claim they did. However, Rackley on the other hand, did absolutely nothing about it.
My mother, the child's maternal grandmother, relayed to Rackley that her investigation has been extremely poor. Rackley will no longer return her calls either. We're asking questions and Rackley is running and hiding . There's no way this situation is in any way right or fair. A special needs child is being deliberately isolated from the mother and grandparents who love her so much. The mother and grandparents who have done NOTHING wrong, we've fallen victim to a narcissistic young man with a wad of money in his pocket.
There are no complaints against any of us which would have warranted the temporary termination of my time with my daughter, my decision making as far as she goes, my ability to be a parent has never been questioned. My daughter has always been healthy and happy with me.
Since my daughter has been separated from me, I have been issued 'supervised visits' because of the opinion of the end result of my learning disability. If I want to see my daughter, I have to go to her daycare center at certain times OR, GET THIS- I have to PAY a 'parenting support center' to have a 2 hour visit with my own child! This is where sex offenders go when they have children of their own who were not their victim. Here I am, paying to see my own kid alongside all the sex offenders.
This is 'perfectly fine' with Ms. Rackley, as she has done NOTHING to help in any way. A special needs child ISN'T going to understand why they have to go to a center to see mommy. If I did something wrong, I would accept this as a consequence, BUUUUUUT! I have done NOTHING wrong, having a disability isn't wrong and under the Americans With Disabilities Act, I have the same rights as any other person. My rights as a mother and as a human, have been violated.
My integrity in authority has been violated. The first complaints the daycare had with the care of my daughter when she was turned over to her dad full time went pretty much ignored. However, this past Monday July 23rd 2012 I paid my daughter a visit at the daycare center. I was horrified to find my child petrified in a corner, filthy dirty, greasy hair, blotchy face. I immediately took out my Android cell phone and took pictures of the horror in front of my eyes. I was shocked the daycare workers let my child come into the center looking like that.
I have included one picture below, I have placed a white band across my child's eyes to protect her identity. This was taken when I walked in, as I found her.... She was playing by herself, forlorn and disgusting. I had to leave the daycare that day because my ex showed up to pick our daughter up. Wednesday, I went to the daycare again. My daughter was gone for the day at her therapy, they told me. She wasn't at the center.
I was still extremely horrified at the sight of my emotionally distraught filthy child on Monday and wanted to show the pictures to her. I asked a teacher named Chandra outside the facility if I could speak with a person of authority while I was there. My daughter was gone for the day, I had a legit complaint and desired to make my concern known in as polite a way as I could.The director of the daycare was of no help.
She not only denied what I'd seen on Monday, she also denied the first complaints from 2 and half weeks ago even though the woman who relayed them to ME and my MOTHER at the same time was standing right there. She said nothing at all.
They refused to help me, so I left.I got a call from a ""Wendy"", claiming she was a supervisor. I relayed my concerns to her and the new concerns that her workers were not doing their job and being a mandated reporter. She denied her workers were failing to report anything and she hung up on me.
Thursday July 26th, I came to the daycare to see my daughter. When I walked in I asked the teacher Chandra for the name and phone number of a supervisor above Wendy. I wasn't going to quit on my complaint. My child's well being was at stake. Chandra said she would get me my requested information, instead she lured me into the director's office, promising me the information I sought was in there.
I have filed a separate report for the daycare involved so if you're interested in reading look up Great Bay Kids Company.
The director lied to my face, claimed there was never any abuse, denied the previous complaints and the final kicker was when I wasn't satisfied with her lying about the condition of my kid, she called the Exeter Police Department telling them I 'wandered into the facility yelling and screaming'.
That was a lie of Holly Davis, Director of the Great Bay Kids Company, I came in quietly, walked into the classroom my daughter was in and asked the teacher politely for the name and number of a person in charge. NO YELLING, NO SCREAMING. I was a concerned parent and crying for my chld's safety at this point.
When the police showed, Holly Davis continued to lie to them, she was inconsistent in her story though. One minute, there was 'never any complaints' the next minute she changed her story and said there ""was one complaint filed 'awhile ago' "". It was not even 3 weeks ago this happened, my mother saw it and here is director Holly Davis lying her ass off. She even tried telling the cops that my photo's were taken 'last week, outside, while the child was playing.'
I have an Android, when you take a photo, it saves the details including the date and time you took the picture. I showed the police the photos AND the info: The photo was taken inside the facility, not outdoors like Holly said, AND the details corresponded with MONDAY the 23rd, not LAST WEEK! The cops caught Holly in a lie, but it was easier to throw me out instead.
The cops treated me horribly and Holly Davis told a false statement to the police right in front of me. The police said this incident was going on file and I could pick up a report in a few days at the station. I will obtain a copy of the report, scan it and place it online for public review. I thought my drama was over..... I was dead wrong.
It was 6:21 pm on Thursday, July 26th 2012, I was home alone with my two dogs just trying to relax from my ordeal at the daycare earlier. My phone rang and I recognized Rackley's phone number on the caller ID. Ms. Rackley has talked to Holly Davis, the director who lied to me and the police and denied any complaints had ever been filed about my daughter. I explained to Ms. Rackley I had done nothing wrong and was there relaying a legit complaint to someone in charge. Ms. Rackley explained to me that she had just spoken to Holly and gave the impression the version Holly told her was portraying me as something less than the concerned, fearful parent I was.
I fell apart emotionally. I couldn't take it anymore. I began to cry, I was coherent and comprehensive but emotionally from everything from losing my daughter to being discriminated against for being disabled. I told Ms. Rackley I was horrified she allowed this to happen to my poor child, as I was nothing but a fit mother to begin with. I poured my heart out to her that I was being victimized and manipulated by my ex, his lawyer and the courts. I told Rackley I could handle being a mother, I couldn't handle being in a court mess like this the best due to my disability. There was NO PROOF I had no ANYTHING wrong as far as my child went. There were NO COMPLAINTS AGAINST ME. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT RACKLEY'S SUDDEN DECISION TO TAKE MY CHILD FROM ME AND PLACE HER WITH HER ALCOHOLIC, NARCISSISTIC FATHER.  SO WHY WAS MY CHILD TAKEN FROM ME? For my being disabled, it seems.
Rackley then said to me ""Are you alone in your house right now?"" I told her yes. She then says to me ""I'm worried about you being in your house alone while you're crying, I think you need someone there with you."" I snapped at Rackley. Who was she to be telling me I 'shouldn't be alone in my house while upset'? Did you think taking my child and my decision making away WOULDN'T make me upset???
What self respecting mother wouldn't be DEVASTATED at the loss of her child? Jennifer Rackley expected me to be made of stone?? I told her I was at home with me and my daughter's two therapy dogs. I was never alone in my home, thank you very much. Rackley and I were on the phone for exactly 8 minutes and 57 seconds (thanks Android!) in addition to the above, the conversation ended with Rackley telling me she was 'going to call my mother' and she hung up the phone on me.
She said before she hung up that she was going to call my mother, I was still upset so I called another friend for support. at 6:44pm I called the friend, at 6:47pm another call came in from a private number as I was on the other line with my friend. I clicked over the answer it and I was told I was speaking with a Sargent from the Exeter Police Department. I at first thought he was calling me about the daycare incident earlier that day. I told the man I had been home minding my own business for the past couple hours, how could I help him?
""Ah, you weren't on the phone with a Jennifer Rackley?"" The Sargent asked. I told him yes, that Ms. Rackley was the GAL in my divorce case and she had called me to discuss what happened at the Great Bay Kids Company. The officer knocked the bottom out of me when he said to me next: ""So you didn't threaten to KILL her??"" I was shocked and STUNNED. I said to him, Of course I hadn't said anything like that to Rackley, I was almost 30 and knew better than to criminally threaten ANYONE, let alone the GAL in my case.
""You didn't threaten to 'get her'?"" The Sargent asked me next. No, I hadn't said anything to Ms. Rackley that was anything like that, the word 'kill' wasn't even used during the entire almost 9 minutes I was on the phone with Rackley, crying and pouring my heart out to her about the courts using the fact I am disabled as some sort reason why I 'couldn't be a mother'.
Ms. Rackley and I had a conversation about her poor effort and unfairness of the judge involved and my learning disability. Now here she was doing the SAME THING.
I told the Officer I hadn't said anything of the sort and I was appalled Ms. Rackley would deliberately call up a law enforcement agency with a false statement against a disabled person for the purpose of harm.  She was was angry at my accurate observations of her horrible job as a GAL and decided to use her authority and the police to frighten me and upset me further. Why would a professional such as Ms. Rackley do this? I am deeply concerned something may not be right if she thinks it's acceptable to do that.
Ms. Rackley told me she was 'calling my mother' before she abruptly hung up on me. She never called my mother.... I found this out after I hung up on the Sargent who called me. My mother was never contacted by Jennifer Rackley on Thursday July 26th 2012, Rackley called the police on me instead. I am putting this complaint out in the open as Ms. Rackley is a public employee and should be subjected to a public jury if she's made any violations in her professional or personal life.
I am an adult living with Asperger's and I am the proud mother of a beautiful (also autistic) child. I have coped with the stresses of life better than most people without a learning disability and I do no deserve to have my child taken from me because of a neurological disorder I have no control over.
Jennifer Rackley deliberately failed in her responsibility to protect my daughter and respect my civil rights as a mother, human and disabled person. The above account is 100% true and correct.  I, the author, have no problems proving my serious allegations against Ms. Rackley and will be glad to speak to the media regarding this truly horrific experience.

										My husband and I worked with Ravi Mannam for my husbands immigration filing. We were filing for a green card for my husband. We trusted Mr. Mannam with all of our records and felt like he would be a great legal representative for us. We paid him over a thousand dollars at first. One day, we received a letter from INS stating that because my husband did not turn in the appropriate papers, that my husband may have to leave the country. We immediately called Mr. Mannam to find out what happened. He assured us that they sent the letter mistakenly and would call us back. When he did, we got a bombshell. The office had not sent our papers and on top of that Mr.Mannam could only request that INS make an exception, but he couldn't guarantee that my husband would not be deported. I felt as though Mr. Mannam was not caring or apologetic towards the mistake his office made. He returned the money to us and basically left us on our own. Better yet, he did not even tell us hisself. He had an associate female lawyer call me and tell me he would not represent us anymore. So, he did not fix the mistakes his office made and put our lives in jeopardy. I was so disappointed. How mean and selfish can someone be when they know that your survival and losing your family is on the line? One question I do have for Ravi Mannam is, what if your family was threatened to be torn apart because of someone being careless? I bet you would have fought for them. For anyone considering using him, do your research first and remember when your dealing with immigration, use someone that you know cares 100 percent about you and your families well being because if they make one mistake like this, it could tear your family apart. Thankfully, we found good people to help and finally got things straightened out. It took us 2 years of explaining and begging because of this.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										My husband called this deceptive company after our mortgage lender would not help us with a loan modification.  After speaking to a person called Sean, he was sucked into their web of lies.  A contract was entered into for about $4,000 and the nightmare began.  We were asked to send in many pages of information so that they could begin the process, and that we would be kept
informed weekly on the progress of our case.  I had to initiate all the calls to see what was being done with our case and if the mortgage lender had been contacted.
After not receiving any progress with the intake team who all the paper work was sent to, I was referred a  caseworker named Annabelle Edman, who insured me that she would give me a weekly update on the progress of the case, which she never did.  I called or emailed weekly starting March 15th only to be told that the case is being worked on and asked for additional information which was faxed to them immediately.
May 2nd was the last date the lender had given us to comply with them before foreclosure would begin. I received a call from Annabelle on Thursday, April 26st stating that she heard from our mortgage lender and the loan modification was denied because they did not receive all the information requested.  What was missing were pay stubs for February 2012.  The Danielson group had received all pay stubs from us, from January  April 2012, but they did not send the mortgage lender a complete file. She informed me that we should get a bank bankruptcy attorney to stop the foreclosure.

										My parents needed help when my father became disabled. We went to see Mark Shalloway who had done a seminar on elder law at their complex.  We didn't see Mark, but did see his father. They explained they wanted to have me, their only child, become the primary person the Powers of Attorney and Health Surrogates and wanted to find some way to protect their assets if one of them had to go into a nursing home. We spent 2.5 hours with Michael Shalloway who made them all kinds of promises and made alot of notes. He explained that for a $6000 fee the firm would take care of all their legal needs for the rest of the their lives. I was skeptical, but they wanted to go ahead. That was in October 2011. The first set of documents we received were nothing more than what we had given them originally for POA and Health Surrogacy. Nothing had been changed. When I called to complain there was a lot of double talk. And they said they would send the documents again. The second set of documents had some correct and some incorrect. In the meantime it was already the end of November and my father was failing rapidly. In the first week of December I took the incorrect documents to the Shalloway offices so they could see what was incorrect. Our ""case manager"" Sharma took me into a conference room and spent an hour being incredibly rude and telling me why the errors were just clerical and I shouldn't be so upset. I told her that I needed the documents done correctly and I couldn't understand why they weren't right in the first place. I asked if anyone checked the documents before they went out. She told me that Michael Shalloway was out of town until the middle of December and he would get back to me when he returned.
He didn't. The holidays came and went. In the first week of January, my father died. I called Shalloway to tell them that the new documents needed to reflect this change. Again, our ""case manager"" was incredibly rude and I finally lost my temper and I told her to cancel everything and send us our money back.
Mark Shalloway called me himself within an hour. Very apologetic and he would take care of everything himself and I didn't have to talk with anyone but him from then on. We went through what I needed. We agreed that he would send me the completed documents to my address and then he and I would meet offsite to go over them before we met with my mother. I waited about six weeks and never received anything. I called Mark to say I was done and I wanted our money back. He told me that he had been waiting for me to call and didn't seem to remember agreeing to sending my the documents as soon as they were done. He said he would send them out immediately. When we received them, there was a glaring error...AGAIN. I called the office and talked with my new case manager who just brushed it off as a clerical error. How would you feel if at the bottom of your Power of Attorney the work ""genocide"" appeared? Clearly no one was checking any of the work. I then emailed Mark and said I was done and I wanted our money back. He called and left me tens of messages none of which I returned. Finally he got me and I said I didn't think the trust was right anyway and he said I just didn't understand it. I said I wanted my money back. He didn't respond. I am filing a grievance with the Florida Bar Association and suggest anyone who has had the same experience do the same. They are feeding off the elderly and not providing services promised.

We saw the advertisements on the Internet for Martin and his ""associates"". We felt confident that they would be able to properly represent us to the Bank where we have our home loan.  It seemed appropraite to have a legal firm represent us even though we were not in forclosure. Even I know you dont have to be in financial trouble to have you loan refinanced or Modified. When we made contact with the attorney (we thought) by filling out the online form, a man came to our business claiming to represent the firm in Los Angeles. He gave us a lengthy explaination about how credible they were and how well they did in the loan modification process. [continued below]....
									
										..... He assured us his ""firm"" would send us peridioc updates and emails as to the status of our progress with the bank on a biweekly basis. He even went so far as to quote a ""rate schedual"" 
with a breakdown of payments and iterest rates we would be paying if we allowed them to represent us in the modification. To summerize the meeting he said in three months ""after depositing $3500.00 with thier firm"" we would be down to paying $25.00 a month and would have had a counsler ""a modification counsler"" that is assigned to our case within the first 30 days.  The catch was we needed to be in default on our payments and we were not. His reaction was ""well then theres nothing we can do to help you"" which if you have ever delt with a modification is a complete lie, I just wish I had known it then (sigh).  Ironiclly even though we were not in default they accepted our money as a ""retainer"" and gave us no indication of how the funds were to be spent.  									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										Nasty divorce left me holding the debt after 18 yrs of marriage. 
I had a judgement against me from Fredrick J Hanna.
I set up a automated draft and moved along. Apparently the permission for the draft expired after 12 months. When I noticed it was not being drafted I called and called and called and left messages on at least 6 employees voice mail.
I got a letter, I responded and called and called again. I finally got a response, and re-set the draft and made a payment. 
The next month, the draft didn't go thru again.
I called and called and called, and finally an operator told me I could pay online.  I was thrilled.
I ran over to the website and tried to make a payment and the site threw a ""payee"" error. I took screen shots and gave up to try again in a bit.
tried again, and still no luck. I called and left messages again. 
2 weeks later I tried again online, still didn't work (was not a user error, it is a configuration error). 
I took screen shots again and called their office.
It took 9 calls before I spoke with a real person (left messages everywhere). only to be told I was under a garnishment and I owed the entire balance of 3100.00
I spent the next 2 days, calling and leaving more messages, begging to please take the dang payments, as I REALLY want to pay it. 
Nope, the garnishment lady assured me she would get the 3100.00 out of my bank.  I assured her I didn't have 3100.00, she again assured she she would continue to get it until she got her money.
I never refused to pay them, I have made efforts (kept documentation) to repeatedly pay and now they are going after my bank account.
I have gone to my local court and will file the paperwork with an attorney to get before a judge, I plan to subpoena those recorded calls to prove MY effort......wish me luck/moon

										Not sure which one of these Attorneys is the actual problem but they both seem to be in on the scam and they both blame each other, in fact my research has shown that they actually have filed suit against each other in Riverside Bankruptcy court for Fraud. Attorney Phillip Evans took clients money and never performed the work, then Attorney Todd Turoci supposedly purchased the clients from Phillip Evans and was supposed to complete the bankruptcy cases, they each sent letters to myself and other clients advising us of just that. Then Todd Turoci had the nerve to request more money or he would not complete the work. It is my understanding the situation is under investigation by the State Bar and in fact Phillip Evans attorney license is now showing as inactive.

										On April 17th 2012, I called Tax Lifeboat and spoke to a man who listened intently to my fears and tears as I explained to him how I got into the mess of my taxes.  I gave him all the details of what my case was about.  He asked me what I wanted him to do for me.  I told him what I wanted, and that was to reduce the taxes owed, and cancel out on the penalties I was being charged with for my 2011 tax year.  He told me he thought the company could help me and suggested I take the time to research the company, asked how I had heard about them, and said the other companies only wanted my money, so I should be careful.  He assured me this was a reputable company, and said that after I research the company on line, and if I am happy with it, I will need to give them 5800.00 up front over the phone to retain the services.  He also said it would do me no good to call the IRS because they are not interested in helping.  He said no matter what I needed an attourney due to the amount I owed.  And he felt they would be my best bet.  Fool me, I believed him.  I did go on line and do the research and could find no bad reports and they sounded so sincere. SAD!!
I hired Tax Lifeboat that day by doing a bank transaction over the phone.  It was about a week later, I got a call to get some forms filled out and sent back.  Which I did, and again I stated the same information on the forms that I stated to the guy on the phone.  Almost word for word.
 
About another week went by and I got another call from a gal who told me the name of the attorney that would be asigned to me.  Once I got with her, I was given the tasks that I needed to do, and I did them and returned them.  I also gave her the same information I had given the previous two times.  
Now a month has gone by and no word on anything.  So I am thinking that must be a good thing.  The attorney called me again and told me I needed to apply for a loan and get the letter  showing I do not qualify for one, then send it to her.  I did that and tried for a line of credit.  I got the letter and sent it as requested.
 
A few weeks later like in July, the attorney called to tell me there was nothing she could do for me, and the best thing for me would be to take my money out of my retirement to pay it off. I told her I could do that but it would put me in the same boat I am currently in, but only this time I would not be able to recover, and I would lose everything again, only this time for good.   She said ""I am sorry, I do not know what to tell you"". SAD!!!  
I called the IRS and state and talked to them myself several time to try and take care of it.  The state would not budge, not because they wouldn't, but because the law prohibits it.  The IRS said my penalties were waved on the late payment automatically because it was a first time incident for me.  Go figure!!!
 
I let the attorney know I was not happy or satisfied and I wanted my money back.  She said she was sorry I felt that way, and that she would pass the word on to the collection department.  She gave me the name of the person and left it at that.  
I gave it a month, and when I did not hear anything I filed a complaint with the BBB and was asigned a case number.  I waited a couple weeks and did not hear from the BBB, so I e-mailed them. The BBB responed and said the company had 30 days to respond to the filed complaint.  After the thirty days, BBB contacted me and said they had not gotten a response and wanted to know if I had heard anything.  I had not. BBB said they would keep me informed if they heard anything and asked me to do the same.
On Feb 4 2013 I received  a call from Tax Lifeboat telling  me I would be getting a full refund, it was being processed  and I should see the check by the end of February.  The middle of March and I still had no check.
I had e-mailed the attorney who had my case asking her about it, and after a few weeks she responed that she had been out of  the office and she would check into it.  I gave it another week and no response, I e-mailed again and she responed that she had placed a call to the gal who does the refunds and had not gotten a call back.  I replied and asked for the e-mail address of the person who left me the message and the person who does the refunds.  NO RESPONSE.  Go figure.  I e-mailed her again and told her I did not appreciate getting jerked around, and if I had to seek legal help, I would be asking for more then the money I gave them.  They have had my money for nearly a year now.  Collecting interest I should have, I had to pay penalties to the state I otherwise would not have had to pay, had they been honest up front, and I would be asking they pay for my legal fees having to deal with the matter in this way.  I am appauled at the lack of moral conduct on thier part.  I know no wonder she did not respond.  But I did not set the presidence for the company, and I do not work for the company as a represative.  I believe I am a justifiabley dissatisfied customer.
I then went to 7 on your side to see if they would be of any help, as they were a great big help for me when I had a bad deal with a major retail store years back.  I have not gotten a response yet.  The public needs to know The Tax Lifeboat does not stand behind what they advertise. They need to know not to trust them.  And I want my money back!!!!									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										On April 3, 2013, I called the child support agency to inquire about not getting my child support for April, because since 2005, I have ALWAYS received my daughters child support payment around the 3rd and no later than the 5th, because my ex husband is in the military and there is a wage withholding in place with DFAS.  
I was told by the worker that my account was froze, because they were updating my file with the new order, which they received January 24, 2013.  I really did not understand what they were saying, because I had worked child support in the past, and I HAVE NEVER in my days, heard of this.  I asked politely to speak with someone else about this, and was told quite rudely that I would have to wait to call back on the 5th, because it was flagged to be released on the 4th.  Right after I got off the phone, I sent an email to the state office in response to an earlier email telling me that they would be ""UPDATING"" my file next week. But mind you, no notice that they would be freezing the money at this time. 
On April 5th, I attempted to call, but why of course, could not get through.  Considering I had just moved into my new apartment, I did not have access to internet, so I went to a friends to use their wifi to check my account.  At this time...no update.  The money they received on the 1st of the month, like they always have had been received yet, they money had not been dispersed like it should have, according to Federal law. 
On Monday the 8th I attempted to call again, and got the run around, so I called State Representative Aycock's office.  I also called the OAG's office and spoke to a very rude lady there.  Never did hear back from the Child support Office, so I called Mr. Aycock's office on the 9th and let them know that nobody had returned my call.  About an hour later, I received a phone call from the Temple Office, Finance Officer, Barbara Macek, who basically told me a bunch of excuses, that in all honesty, had absolutely nothing to do with my case. She said the money would be released on the 10th.  I asked about the NSF fees and she avoided at all cost the subject, and the answers I asked.  
In the meantime, I had called my bank asking them what would be the best course of action.  I was told that if I was to stop payment, then I would not be able to have an automatic draft to those companies again, and advised me against it since the child support was suppose to be released. At this time close to $300.00 had already racked up in NSF fees.  
On April 12, I received the money, but as I thought, the amount was close to $400.00 less than I normally get.  So, today April 15, 2013 I made it to the child support office in Temple, and was told through this child support officer that the Unit Supervisor, Valerie Richards, would not give me the fees back, because I was told on the 3rd that the money was froze, and that was ample of enough time to stop the payment, which is so not true.  Never an apology or even an answer as to why they froze the account.  
I am a disabled vet, and have been very sick for the past 2 and 1/2 years.  Not able to work, so my daughter does depend on this money.  This lady Valerie Richards did not even bother to meet me.  I have never seen such unprofessional nor lack of compassion or empathy from someone who ultimately has a job because they depend on court order child support to ensure they have a job.
Prior to this new order that they received on January 24, 2013, I never had a problem, why?  Because my case was not in a local office, it was automatically coming out so a human never had to touch it.  My attorney's office initialized the current support but could not address the back support that was due.  
I am writing this report because they believe they are exempt from taking responsibility for their actions and believe that I should just eat the NSF that my bank account accrued.  But for an incompetent worker in their office who did not analyze the case before taking action, this would have NEVER HAPPENED.",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

When the date came for the withdrawal from my checking I saw it didn't go threw couldn't understand why the money was there. I had called to see what was going on and they said they are running it but its getting denied. Called my bank and they told lpful on me they are trying to run it threw the savings which had already been done twice mind you I'm getting overdrafts each time the run it. I called again told them they are running it wrong that its going threw savings not checking. They do it again same way savings getting another overdraft fee that there gave me a red flag when we decided to cancel the service the payment got withdrawn again but correctly this time from checking. When I told the Amanda my go to person I want to cancel she had to direct me to her supervisor Vanessa I had explained to her I wasn't liking the service of them not getting payment right so I feel that the rest of my experience was going to be the same I want to cancel my account and get my money refunded back,she had agreed told me I would get the full refund that it would take up to 2 weeks and if I hadn't received it by then call the accounting dept.This took place on Feb 28th 2012.

Week went by no refund call again no answer leave voice mail..no call back,call again no answer leave a message . When i called again I got a lady who told me that the refund will be in with in a week or sooner. Another week still no refund . I call spoke to Neph he put me on hold and when he came back he told me he was going to put me threw to someone who is going to get this resolved and the money refund. Josh Ghazal was the person I got transferred and was not a pleasant individual,he had explained to me that I wasn't going to get my full amount refunded to me due to services that had been performed on my file mind you they didn't have all the proper documents from me to put a file together. Josh said that I was getting refund $253.00 due to the man hours that were put into my file mind you that I had cancelled,he had people he had to pay. I told him that I didn't agree with what he is saying I want my full amount refunding he said that is impossible.,then he ask what is a reasonable amount to be refunded to me I said a $1,000.00. josh response is not happening,i said okay I'll have my husband call and discuss this with you further. Josh proceeded the same with my husband and ask my husband what would be a reasonable amount back, my husband tells him 80% of it back. Josh said I'll see what I can do and I will call you back. Josh never called back we had to call him again asking what did we come up with on the refund this was a week later I went from him saying I was going to get back $253.00 to according to him in the negatives to were they aren't going to charge me those fees. We asked for him to provide a progress doc.for services he claims they had done after I clearly told them I didn't want ,Josh is saying he can't provide any we still demanded that he does and we will see if anything will come . During this conversation Josh kept hanging up on us due to questions he couldn't answer and we kept calling back and not getting anywhere. i am not giving up on getting my money refunded to me and the way things are these days and for someone to feel they can take your money like that and have no problem doing it is a crook.

This resulted in daily visits from our landlord and threats to have my and other employees cars towed away.
I also learned that Williams Cole Inc. DBA Attorney's Diversified Services had not paid taxes since 2007. It seems that what is going on is similar to what some capital management firms do on a larger scale. Buy a business, load it up with debt by borrowing money the company doesn't need, use that money to help pay yourself way too much, then finally walk away when your pockets are full and the company can't function. The corporation goes under while the owners walk away millionaires, meanwhile lots of people are out of work and the banks have been defrauded for the amount of the loans.

										Paid $1000.00 in May, 2011, to have Mr. Ripoly (owner) prepare a legal document (Writ of Mandate) to be filed in Superior Court. I provided all information and documentation which had all dates, times, names included to ensure that correct information was used. Every Writ he gave for me to proof read had several error in names, dates, spelling and grammar errors. These were sent back to Mr. Ripoly for correction and each time he returned a Writ with new errors or errors never corrected.He had 6 months to have this ready and failed every time. He refused to refund my money for his lack of being able to produce a accurate Writ of Mandate within a reasonable time. I was told I demanded to much in wanting the document to be accurate.Poor quality of legal document work, poor customer service and a ripoff. I had 1 week left to file and ended up having to pay someone to rewrite an accurate Writ of Mandate with all the corrections, due to the failure of Mr. Ripoly to produce and accurate legal document (Writ of Mandate)",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										Paid $2,900 to Brunty/Bacon Law Firm for services to negotiate mortgage rate/payment down. After FOUR months of awful and misrepresented services, the bank turned me down and explained (unfortunately) that attorneys like Bacon are making $$$ scaring consumers into thinking they can do more for a customer than a bank can. Turns out, THEY CAN'T. To keep this simple, here's a bulleted list of the many issues I had w/Bacon. p.s. I paid my money to Brunty, the file was transferred to Bacon. Here's a quote from the rep that pretty much sums up the scam. Please understand that yougave your money to the Brunty Law firm, Mr. Brunty and the law firm does notexist anymore.
        
The staff I spoke to PRIOR TO paying $2,900 virtually guaranteed a successful outcome of this case. I was told to stop paying my mortgage, now I face foreclsoure. I was told that the bank could not come after me for not paying the mortgage; that I was protected by some Obama law. Now, Chase wants their money and they want it fast, paid in full.The promises and hype and attention I received at the beginning of this journey were many. Then, once they received my money, things went silent.Three months into the service, Chase told me they'd never even heard from Bacon.I was handed off to multiple people over the course of four months. Often, these folks e-mail and telephones either stopped working or were forwarded to other folks entirely. The service was WAY overhyped, severely misrepresented, and are predatory practices at best.

										Phototake, a stock photo agency we have not come across before, has hired one of the lawyers from Photo Attorney, Carolyn E. Wrights law firm. California newbie attorney Leslie Burns has put her signature to the previously reported Photo Attorney Extortion Letters.
Leslie Burns was admitted to the California State Bar in June 2011. Definitely a newbie lawyer if I ever saw one. These Photo Attorney letters are starting to annoy me and I am 
starting to see them way too frequently. Similar to the McCormacks extortion letters, there are many issues in the letters that are grounds and deserving of State Bar and Attorney General Complaints. The sad part of this is that nearly all of the Photo Attorneys are relatively young and it will be quite upsetting for them to get such complaints so early in their careers.
There are a great many presumptions and accusations that overstep boundaries. [continued below]....

If I was expecting only a few hundred dollars it would be different but I am expecting several thousand dollars.  The loses I had from being involved with Quixtar far exceed anything I could ever get back.  I am looking forward to finally moving past the problems I had in my past with this company but Rust Consulting has made something that should be fairly straight forward into a giant mess.

										Recieved a letter from this law firm for a unpaid balance on a bank fee. The full amount owed was stated on the first letter. I called the attorney's office to confirm the amount and asked if I owed any more court fees or costs. I was told NO by the secretary on duty. I paid my amount due and thought I was done.

I called the attorneys office again to negotiate these new fees and have a solid confirmation that when this fee was paid I no longer owed any more money to this firm, ever again. I was told by the assistant that ""Ma'am you are just like everybody else that calls our office and If I did not pay the balance in full with interest then I would be subject to further fees and attorney costs. She said that the fact that, I may be subject to attorney fees, where clearly stated in the first letter and that there are no negotiations on fees and the letter can not be re written."" I was told that the acting attorney does not negotiate or talk with the defendants and there is no negotiation on the fees. I asked again if they would please re write the letter to state that once I paid these new fees in full then I was done and would never owe any more money to that firm.

When he got the money his story changed so many times as to what his client was facing. To make a long story short the day of the trial this attorney-Mr. watts sent the clients family out of the courtroom and told them they were about to select a jury (LIE) and he would call them at 1:00 pm to come back to court. (ANOTHER LIE) The only witness that showed up that was suppose to be on the prosecutions side stood up and said NOTHING happened.  When the clients family left the court room Mr watts then went in to talk with his client who had not even been in the courtroom because they had just brought him over from the jail. Mr. Watts told his client that 3 of the victims were there to testify against him LIE LIE LIE!!!!!!!!!! Only one so called victim showed up and said  nothing really happened. This was great news but NOT what everyone wanted to hear including Mr. Watts himself.He did not want this to take any longer and wanted it over with right then. . .Maybe he had a golf game to get to??? So what did he do? He went in and Lied to his own client and told him that 3 victims were in the court room and that they were ready to testify against him. Then he said they have offered you 7 years and you will have to take it. The client didnt want to takke it but Mr. Watts said they could give you 15 years so you should take it. The client took it. He got 7 years for having a gun that was not loaded and threating to use it. His client DOES NOT HAVE A VIOLENT RECORD.. . GUN was not loaded and No one got hurt!!!!.  There have been people who use a gun and  do FAR worse and get way less.    No victims were in the court room. He lied. One showed up but what he had to say was in favor of  Mr. Watts client. mr. Watts owed the Prosecution one and  at this point the client was Mr. Watts pawn in a game that he was playing while in bed with the prosecutor.

										Robert E.

Atkinson is, by association and extension, a business associate of Murphy's because of the work he does for him. Atkinson's name also was on the eviction order posting on the front door of Copa. 
Atkinson is complicit in assisting Kelly Murphy with doing things like recruiting people as ""straw men"" to use them to arrange for things like getting liquor licenses for Murphy, who is unable to legally obtain a such a license under Nevada state law because of his past felony convictions.

Please look at the attached pictures of Robert Hannan and his public Facebook profile, further proof that he may be connected to this judge or moreso other judges. Maybe an investigations into Roebrt Hannan's filings with the court will produce PROOF what people are saying online, such as scare tactics, trying to prosecute someone in the manner for his benefit of money?Why is it so many of Robert Hannan and his divorce have a domestic issue attached and why have the courts allowed Robert Hannan and his clients TO CONTINUE frivolous filings, is he connected to a judge, LIKE FACEBOOK SHOWS? It might appear so now, wouldn't it ? See the pictures i have attached as evidence to back up my claims. [continued below]....
									
										.....It appears Robert Hannan, or Yelp is filtering negative reviews, I came across 5 negative reviews taken down, and one positive that i believe was written by none other by Robert Hannan himself. But hey the internet you can write whatever right?I urge you do do the research on Robert Hannan, and his personal criminal traffic infractions, his debt in the amount of $250,000 he is awaiting and his hunting/fishing/trapping without a license. Seems good ole Robert Hannan, (Robert Scott Hannan) feels he should not have to pay debt, but yet he enforces prosecution and jail on support payments, it appears he feels the world owes him a living and he should not be accountable for his own actions it would appear now wouldn't it ? As an attoreny he took an oath to uphold th elaw, but seems there is hypocrisy here doesn't it ?I urge anyone to verify my claims at Broward public records here:Broward Search (see attached photos)To the judges of Broward County, and The District Attorney, I urge you to investigate, the paperwork Robert Hannan files and his firm, question it, put his behavior on record. Hold Robert Hannan accountable for his actions. To Rick Scott, whom I am forwardind this to, please help the citizens of South Florida against Robert Hannan.-Apparently Family's are being torn apart by Robert S HannanHave Robert Hannan explain why divorce takes so long with him and why there are so many domestic issues intertwined with them?Surely Robert Hannan isn't telling clients to file charges, that would be illegal right? Well I have recovered a few depositions in which his client admitted that Robert Hannan told them to file.  This appears to be his style, to file bogus charges, then follow up with scare tactics to extort and coerce payment from opposing party.Further people write online that he with holds information too.I wonder why he would do that? Surely it couldn't be to drag things out because of his $250,000 dollar debt would it? Some might say it appears so.Moving on To Robert Hannan and his involvement with Judge Hurley, Robert S Hannan writes on his PUBLIC Facebook account"" ""You know I am behind you 110% ..On Judge John Hurley's wall to retain him.

Is there a personal involvement with Robert S Hannan and this judge or any other judge In Broward county? It's interesting that Robert Hannan would write that he is behind this judge 110%, shouldn't the courts and attorneys be fair to the general public?

										Robert S Hannan, make sure you research before you retain. Often times these days, many people find themselves in legal dispute and discord with either another person whom they barely know or even a business or a spouse and so, we find ourselves totally depending on not only the legal system but our attorneys to guide us on through whatever legal troubles that might be plaguing us at the time. 
But what happens when we unknowingly hire a bad attorney to represent us in a court of law?,Or better yet, find an unethical attorney opposing us that moreover, resorts to scare tactics in order to lead and badger us into doing something that isn't advantages to our wants, wishes or legal goals? Not good in my opinion.
Again, what occurs, When the opposition attorney violates our civil rights and our counsel doesn't seem to be coherent to the fact and allows the other side to have their way with us. [continued below]....
									
										..... Further, what is the result when our counsel isn't as legally savy to the issue as they portray when selling their legal services to us? 
There is nothing worse then going to court and being thrown on the mercy of strangers just because your attorney didn't know what he was doing in the first place,wouldn't you agree?  Sure you would; and that brings me to the point of why I'm even writing this article today.
In my travels I've come across the perfect candidate to not only offer as a case study but to prove my point concerning what I consider to be a unethical attorney and illegal practices.  Again, I was very lucky in finding a particular South Florida Attorney by the name of""Robert Scott Hannan""  who states There is nothing quite as stressful as family and relationship issues. 
I found it interesting that Mr. Hannan makes this statement on his site, while promoting his services yet, when researching further into Mr. Hannan's track record of legal professionalism, I discovered that he generated many bad client reviews coming from people who have allegedly contracted his services in the past. 
Let's keep in mind that many of the reviews in question were posted both by Hannan's past clients and by those who have been on the downside of his stated legal harassment. Furthermore, a few of Mr. Hannan's past clients went on to say such things as he was horrible at litigation, he screwed up several custody cases, apparently kept charging them more and more until he cleaned out their bank accounts and or, life savings and lastly, that their spouses had the upper hand on them in the courts due to his legal incompetence.
On the other side, or concerning those people that were on the other side of the issue, they went on to say that Robert Scott Hannan was badgering, hostile, leading and threatening towards them with no real interest in fairness or mutual justice, and that he was all about making the buck of his clients and their spouses. 
We have to consider that these are just Internet reviews and that should Mr. Hannan read these reviews for himself, he would just maintain that these persons are disgruntled on both sides and that they should come and speak to him personally to resolve their issues however and again, this is subsequently a man that will sue at the drop of a hat and they might be hesitant in resolving anything with him from what I've read.
Again, this is a man who has apparently, written is own positive reviews on Yelp. When on Yelp scroll down to the last review and  at the bottom left there is a link called 4 filtered to the right of where it says write a review(red button) see the filtered links, apparently someone had negative reviews removed, I wonder who did this? And who seemingly will stop at nothing to remove any bad press that has been posted about him, with positive reviews apparently written by him or his staff.
When In my further research it's further alleged that Mr. Hannan and his family law practice there in Fort Lauderdale, FL 33316 has in fact, badgered Clients and defendants alike, lied to the court, withheld pertinent information from both the courts and Clients in order to manipulate for leverage or personal finance not to mention, placing folks under emotional distress by threatening to throw them into jail continuously even when there's no cause for incarceration in the
first place according to the courts themselves.
So in summery, We've heard others yield their personal accounts of Mr. Hannan on both sides of the issue concerning his ethical behavior and that of yet others submitting their speculation, summation and opinion of this particular Attorney there in Fort Lauderdale, FL 33316 Whom moreover, proclaims to be an ethical, experiences and aggressive
Attorney of twenty years who specializes in family law, or more specifically divorce and battered spouse law.
However, the postings on this gentleman and his legal service seem to state otherwise or contrary within exception to his aggressiveness to which both sides unanimously agree.  Still all in all, and not believing everything you read on the Internet, I would urge you to go by the facts and not anonymous postings stating this or that about a person
or service. 
Ok, moving away for the allegations, statements and opinions made above by others on the Internet regarding this specific attorney and his practice, let's look at the provable history and factual circumstance of the attorney in question to either substantiate the claims made against him on line, or to write it all off as pure rederick and speculation.
Possible Fact: Apparently, Mr. Hannan specializes in domestic and divorce cases according to his site, to which often times blend together and further, that the majority, if not most of his clients may appear to be women.  Search Here Broward County Clerk Fact: Robert Hannan according to Broward County Clerk of Records public search located here: Broward County Clerk you can search for yourself, and find how many domestic issues are intertwined with his divorce proceedings. Does he tell women to file bogus charges to gain legal leverage in court? Makes you wonder doesn't it?
Fact: That in many of his cases end up charging the husband with spousal battery while using this and other scare tactics to entrap the husband into paying huge amounts of money in the form of support payments.  Again Search Broward County Clerk. 
If you perform a background search on Mr. Hannan through public records you can obtain this information for yourself along with simply reading over his site to gather other pertinent information. You can also look up any reprimands he's been given or possible disbarments he may have acquired over the years along with his licensed to practice law, if any. 
Mr Hannan appears to be an aggressive and ethical attorney who fights for the rights of clients, or possibly women everywhere however, we dug up a few other things that seem to dispute these statements as well. Mr. Hannan says
that he's an ethical guy, and his conscience is clear when he legally moves towards others for being late in their child support payments and or, legal payments to his firm.
By stating that he holds a current license to practice law, he's essentially stating that he will uphold and obey the laws of the land and the court system that he further expects and demands that others live by but I sense a trace of hypocrisy in his actions as can be cited below in the public records obtained.
It would seem that ""Robert"", or ""Bob Scott Hannan""  has several criminal traffic tickets along with a civil suit and or matter with a mortgage firm to the tune of $250,000.00.  Real Prop Non-Homestead Res Fore =/>$250,000
and not leaving out being ticketed for hunting without a license, fishing without a license and or trapping without a
license. See Here Search Robert S Hannan Robert Hannan had a case against him Bellsouth Adv & Pub Corp
Plaintiff vs. Robert S Hannan Defendant <- Contract and Indebtedness This doesn't really sound like someone that serious about upholding the law more so, then someone looking to get over on society, the city,  state and federal government, what do you think?  It sounds like a man that wants everyone else to live by the law and courts decrees yet, he himself feels exempt to these very same laws. Mr. Hannan, do you think that the laws apply to the rest of us and not yourself?  It would appear so, in my opinion.
Again, in conclusion and in my opinion, Mr. Hannan sounds to be a person that typically uses the court system to his own benefit, an opportunist whose only goal is in obtaining the buck no matter the ethical lines he must cross to do it.  A person that has little to no regard for the law and whom feels he's above it.
A person with little to no respect for his own clients, the opposing counsel or the courts and lastly, someone who has little respect for himself or the profession he represents; someone that feels entitled and that the world owes him a living. 
Of course, people can say whatever they wish to say on the Internet these days and we really can't be sure what is true from that which is malicious however, we can speak to a companies or firms directly and or, previous clients to see what the outcome of their particular service was, how the client was actually treated throughout the process.
When we see things posted on line against a person or firm this should give us all reason to stop and check someone out before hiring them especially, when it comes down to your finance and freedom being up for grabs in a court of law. 
The most frightening thing I have seen posted on this attorney can be viewed here: Robert S Hannan , apparently a client or opposing counsel is accusing him of being on opiates. Again this was obtained online in a review, but lets stick to 
the known facts with Broward County Clerk Of Courts.
We can also do our homework by researching a person such a Robert Scott Hannan to ensure our safety as his site appears to be professional however his subsequent actions and or other activities being alleged over the Web seems to contradict everything he states on his web sites. 
Here is a quote from an alleged client on Yelp  ""Terrible attitude and quality.  He didnt file a financial doc until after it was due and almost got me in hot water. He also basicly told me to  shut up everytime I needed to discuss my case.  He didnt even know his  assistant had already collected key information. Almost seemed to be  sabotaging my custody case. His who scene is very shady
and he wants to  be paid up front because he knows you wouldnt pay him after he screws up your case and tells you how hes gonna win.""
Allegations like this have been made on the Internet against Robert S. Hannan that he apparently withholds pertinent information from the courts and his own clients, to which leads me to believe that he hasn't disclosed his own dirty laundry to the clients in question, and not leaving out the public at large.
Again, and to reiterate some facts here, this is a man that doesn't pay his own bills, breaks the laws while thinking nothing of it and lastly, continually threatens to put people in jail for not paying their bills or child support on time, who doesn't even respect the laws in which he represents and or, whom manipulates his clients for the sake of self gain financially over seeking justice through fair and ethical due process and legal practice. 
I would encourage the consumer whom happens to be having serious legal issues concerning divorce, divorce attorneys, child custody issues, family law issues, criminal laws issues or anything else to do with Tort law or criminal or civil law to do their research pertaining to a particular attorney that you may choose to represent you as after all, everything you've worked for, family, finance and your very freedom might be on the line.
I would also encourage Robert Scott Hannan, to clear up some of these issues online concerning his past civil records convening criminal traffic tickets, lawsuits against him for not paying his debts, tickets for hunting, fishing and trapping without a license, and how he feels about attempting to have others prosecuted for the same and or, similar infractions. 
How he feels about himself in inflaming and manipulating martial conflicts for the sake of his own self profit and moreover, to explain to us all in how he perceives himself to be ethical in any sense of the term. We await your reply Mr. Hannan and again, consumer you be the judge in regards to having this particular attorney representing you or not based on the information above.

										ROBERT SCOTT HANNAN limits his practice to Family Law and was formerly aState and County Child Support/Alimony Prosecutor -taken from his website description...... Well lets take a look at this guy, people have already reported that he doesn't pay his bills apparently according to Broward County Public Records, who also seems to have people prosecuted for late payments. Maybe he should be prosecuted or better yet maybe, just maybe an attorney will pick this up for a class action lawsuit.Bob, why is it you feel that you can not pay your bills like the rest of us, yet file motions to put others away or in jail for support payments?Bob Why is it that you have been ticketed for apparently no drivers license,yet we have to carry ours with us? I ask you Robert Hannan, it appears you may have fought this in court according to Broward County Public Search, did you?  And if so, do you have a problem with the Florida Highway Patrol? Does Robert Hannan feel that he does not have to abide by the laws like we do?. [continued below]....
									
										...............laws in which he practices as an attorney? I find nothing wrong with the Florida highway Patrol myself.I ask you also BOB, according to Broward County Public search you were apparently ticketed for hunting/fishing/trapping without a license? This seems to be a pattern, Did you take this to court and fight it?If you have taken any of your tickets to court, how much are you costing the Tax Payers BOB?One report claims they may have found you on Amzaon.com purchasing guns overseas, is this true? I did seen a Robert Hannan from Miami, post on Amazon and review some products in a negative manner, so I wonder are you the same Robert Hannan Attorney at law that also posts on Amazon.com? Robert, who is Tyler Benjamin Hannan? which we found on Broward County Public Search??? Is this your son? Apparently here is his ticket: 15341ZYIDisposition Entered06/04/2010316.1001Evasion/Fail To Pay Toll Office of Toll Operations, Now why did you represent this person? Surely you did not fight this ticket for Tylers EVASION/FAIL to PAY TOLL OFFICE..........like the rest of us have to pay right?I have to pay and get a sunpass, like the rest of us Floridan's that have lived here for years.This seems like a pattern Robert, Do you know someone in the courts at Broward, a Judge perhaps? like another person has hinted at? Why do you apparently make comments to Judge Hurly online through your Facebook account as another poster has reported????I think you need to be investigated, I am sure the readers would agree now wouldn't they?Search Robert Hannan Here: BROWARD COUNTY CLERKWith all the reports On Robert Scott Hannan I decided to upload all the complaints that someone is apparently trying to remove. I wonder who would try and remove a negative review on Robert Scott Hannan and replace it with a positive one ?One person claims he may have seemingly wrote his own positive review, if so isn't that deceitful?Here are reviews flagged on Robert Scott Hannan and removed on and I quote Yelp reviewer""Terrible attitude and quality. He didnt file a financial doc until after it was due and almost got me in hot water. He also basicly told me to shut up everytime I needed to discuss my case. He didnt even know his assistant had already collected key information. Almost seemed to be sabotaging my custody case. His who scene is very shady and he wants to be paid up front because he knows you wouldnt pay him after he screws up your case and tells you how hes gonna win.""Here is another one  ""This Robert Hannan  really sounds like a crap hole and should be reported for SCAMMING people and taking advantage of their emotions. I know this guy and have seen the way he operates, he sucks big time and is in it all for the cash. I certainly wouldn't recommend him to anyone because he's a opportunist from what I've heard who prays on woman.""These sound like women reviewing these, I find it interesting that according to avvo.com Robert is or was apparently somehow involved with Women in distress? does he take on many cases for women, and if so a reviewer accused him of preying on women, is this true Robert?Here is a review from 7-27- 2007 on Lawyerratingz.com this person writes"" While personable he is disorganized which hurts him in court. The biggest issue is this attorney leans towards encouraging litigation which he is not well equipped to handle.""This one is scary again from Lawyerratingz ""this joker is litterally on opiates. horrible would be a compliment Wow so this Robert Hannan apparently has been generating negative reviews since 2007, nearly 5 years? Taking into account that he moved address, according to google searches.People write complaints but not report him to the Bar, don't be afraid of this guy, and get your money back. I personally do not appreciate Bob's antics toward me, and I do not appreciate that apparent woman he basically told to shut up on the review on Yelp. When attorneys like this have bad conduct, they need to be reported to the Bar. Usually the Florida Bar will not take action unless, you have proof, Nowremember Robert Scott Hannan according to other reports documents multiple lies in letters to opposing counsel, as well as apparently with holds information to clients. When reporting to the Florida Bar this is what you need to do(Safety in Numbers) WE ALL CAN REPORT BOB Here is how we do it.1. Gather affidavits, the Florida Bar will take sworn statements seriously, even YOURS 2. Save all letters, dates and times that he has not sent you corresponding letters to opposing party and letters he may have with held from you or not given to you in a timely manner.  Did you know that Attorneys do in fact have to give you letters, emails and corresponding conversations etc in a timely manner from opposing counsel?

										Simply my main complaint aside from the overselling and overcharging which should be expected with these guys is that I paid for legal and paralegal services that they have yet to complete months later. I have worked with them for about 7 years. It's always been challenging. They are salesmen end of story. The product are things you can find elsewhere. I had opened one S corp , 1 C corp , 2 llc and 3 land trusts with them. I've used their tax service which  is the only good service they offer. I have used their virtual office and nominee services. I had referred people until 2 years go when thy started getting shady with me. Ive paid for many of their services and referred people.The only reason I mention the above is to convey that I have a long standing history and am not a one time client who maybe misunderstood the agreement. Nope I requested legal services knowing the difficulties and addressed them up front. I was promised and assured there would be no problems. In short I have been chasing them for months calling every day. I speak with Jolene the receptionist more than the people who are supposed to be doing the work. For a long time client to be on this forum think how they will treat you the new guy.NSCN is a used car lot. Like used car lots they have cars that work kinda. And depending on your negotiation skills you can pay more for than what is fair or realistic.  They WILL oversell you in price and services. It's what they are supposed to do. My first sales person was Kim. She was simply unprofessional and not too bright despite all the salesmen ship from everyone there saying she is a high volume top agent. SoI asked for another. They gave me Willis Paul McCravey. Nice guy but still a salesman. As long as you know that you will have a head start. He promised me Russ Tornby "" the lawyer"" would provide the services I needed with a problem. He conferred with Russ prior and then I purchased the services. Needless to say that I haven't received the work yet 6 months later. The work takes about 3 weeks tops for everything. 
The pecking order there is Mr. Zapper the owner. Don't expect to talk to him. I've tried for 3 months. His wife Susan I haven't bothered to contact.  Brent Carlson is the main manager. Sean Olson is another manager below brent. Then you've got our main points of contact the used car salesmen. You want a service you HAVE to go through them.  So in the past if something went wrong I just had to make some noise and complain to Sean or Brent. And things would eventually get worked out. Mind you i hate doing that. If you pay for a service it should get done without a fight. So troubles getting things done there is a norm. I could regale you with the stories of ineptness and incompetence that I have had to endure with  these guys for the last 7 years. Suffice it to say they hire from the bottom of the barrel. So yes I knew the issues here but it's is different evidently Russell Tornby was there during the inception of this company and despite my half year of complaining and calling and rarely being called back long with the many tiered assurances that things would change or go smoother nothing has. Why? Because Russ doesn't answer to none but Me. Zapper who is more difficult to get on the phone than God. Yes all the henchmen that work there chime on bout how he cares about customer service but it's all lip service. If he had he would have been able to find 10 minutes to talk to me in the last 4 months of waiting and calling.  There main goal is to get your money... Don't be fooled. Are they scam artists? Snake oil? No not from the services I mentioned I received bough I read a lot about people who didn't get the results thy wanted from the credit program they have. They are just poorly run, unprofessional, lack a service oriented philosophy and no commitment to doing a good job. If you want to chase them around like you would a child to pick his underwear up off the floor then these guys are for you. I would not hire them for our services as all their services can be had elsewhere.So as it stands I paid good money and they have breeched the contract by not performing it as promised with In a reasonable amount of time. I asked nothing extraordinary from them. Do not use them buyer beware. Hope this helps you.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										So last night I received a call from this number. They called 3 times, the first time they left a voice mail then the second and third time they called twice in a row. I answered the phone and this Pakistan accented man told me that I had accusations and charges against my name and my social security number. There were 3 total. I asked what for, he said because of an unpaid payday loan through Money Mutual (money mutual was not my lender but found me a lender). He said that I owed over $3000...which is bull crap because I borrowed a total of $300. He said the lender is taking the money as a loss and that I was being charged in the next few hours with 3 charges and one of them would be check fraud. He then preceded to say that he would ask his ""Head Attorney"" not to charge me with these crimes if I would just go ahead and pay over $700 right then. I said I dont have that kind of money so he said since I was not willing to pay $700 then they would be sending a Sheriff and an Investigating Officer to my workplace to inform my boss of my crime and I would be arrested on Friday. I asked if there was another way around this and he said that I would be put in prison for 6 months. I then asked to speak to the ""Head Attorney"" he kept talking about and ofcourse he said that he was the Head Attorney. I did research on the number and the name of the business and this website is what I found. Also, I called my lender and they were gracious enough to tell me not to ever speak to this man or give him any info.

consumer websites exist to allow folks to communicate to others and spread the word about the bad experiences and services they come across. There are some folks out there who are performing a public

They're buffoons. They're only interested in themselves, not their clients. They inflate their billable hours, I guess because they're tired of
being associated with a sandwich shop (their office is directly above one) and they're trying to raise enough money to move out. Maybe they're trying to avoid using their furniture as collateral again.  Perhaps they'd be better off joining forces with the shop below them and selling sandwiches instead of shoveling out subpoenas.

I attended this session and enjoyed it very much! I personally have been to Russia seven times and liked listening to the Ukrainian experience! After this session I told you that I would follow you to your office and you stated that you had more to do at the Church and would meet me there in a half hour! Okay, I parked outside your office and waited and all of sudden you show up at the back door! Thats
strange; I thought where did he park? Upon leaving I saw there was a ramp up the back of the empty parking lot which also had access from its level! Thats strange, why didnt he park where I told him where I would meet him in this empty parking lot? After we got inside one of the first conversations that we had was that you told me that my Mother had called you and wanted us to do mediation and that she didnt want to go to court and that she never hired her attorney Richard Behlmann. You also told me that she told you that she didnt want anyone to know that she had called you. You told me that you agreed not to do that! Well, my first question is, why are you telling me then? On later contemplation I realized that you had you had lied to my Mother!  You also told me that because of this promise you could not bring it up in Court! I told you clearly that honesty was the most important thing to me and that I despise dishonesty! Well, moving ahead a little bit, in Court in front of me and my sister you asked her in about question number three if she remembered the phone call and you stated the details of that conversation and your broken promise to her and me, thats saying it nicely, the truth of the matter you lied to her twice and me once!  Ok, back to our Sunday meeting, I saw all of the nice documents that I had diligently prepared for my case and I could tell that they were never looked because of the lack of a fold mark by the staples or any other marks or wrinkles! In fact every document was still neatly in order as I had sent them to you! You told me that you didnt want to spend the time looking at all the documentation unless you really needed to! That didnt sit right with me but you insured me that you had a strategy which we briefly went over. In retrospect I put together all of that information in anticipation of you reading it and being prepared for Court and I expected to pay you the 
professional for it.  After all, I gave you a $ 5,000.00 retainer and expected to have to pay more if necessary! I departed after about one hour and we agreed that we would meet about a half 
hour before the Court session the next day in the parking lot!  About 45 minutes before Court I called you on your Cell phone three times to tell you that I was in the parking lot waiting 
for you and each time you answered with I cant hear you, I am on my way to court and if you need to leave me a message and I will call you back! Shortly thereafter I say at a distance a rather unsightly old car pull up and park and it looks like you getting out but I just said no, it cant be, he would have called me to say where are you because we agreed to meet in the parking lot!  Several minutes later you call me and ask me where I am and I told you waiting for you in the parking lot as we had discussed.  You told me you were already inside waiting for me! Strange, very strange! At the end of our loss in Court, I said to you lets talk as we walked out to the parking lot. You saidno, I need to go talk to the clerk! It was obvious to me that you did not want me to see your vehicle! We parted and I went to the car to make some phone calls!  And what to my surprise, there
you go to your car, the one I saw you get out of earlier! So, lets recap, so far your office as represented by your web-site doesnt exist, your picture is very old, you didnt even look at the documentation (3 or 4 hundred pages) that I sent you over the previous months, you lied to me and my Mother despite the fact you teach discipleship classes, you lied about hearing me on the phone and you hide your car because you are embarrassed!
Now lets go back to us going inside the Court room! We file in together with the Attorneys for about 7 or 8 cases and they all sit in the Gallery with their clients but not you, you open the gate to the area in front of the Judge and sit at a desk leaving me, your employer behind!  All the rest of the Attorneys are sitting with their clients, I am sure discussing their cases! Then we get called up and 
the first issue was Attorney Behlmann representing both my Mother and Edasi, the issue where you had quoted so many State statutes which would disallow this, and within less than two minutes that motion was denied and the judge says that was a ridiculous and then you put my 86 year old Mother on the stand. Well the case was really about all of the self-serving issues with my sister who you never called to the stand! The case was a joke and your job was pathetic! I trusted you based on phone conversations and web site representations particularly your being a teacher of discipleship at your Church. If you had presented a good solid case with all of the facts that I had carefully and completely prepared for you and we still lost, there would be no question but that it is 
Gods will and I have to accept it!
Did you earn what I paid you? No way! Were you honest with me? No way! Were you honest to my Mother? No way! Were you well prepared for Court? No way! Did you live up to your mission statement? Not even close! As a Disciple of Christ in view of what you say you teach others were you and are you as a believer responding to the Holy Spirits prompting to examine your thoughts, words and actions and compare them with the Word of God. Something for you to ponder on and you know the right answer!
I spent a lot of Money for nothing!
God bless you Brother and I pray that you take this in the way it was intended. Be real Brother and act in Gods image as a teacher of his Word should!									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										The Brown Law Group is a bunch of scam artists.  I missed two, two HOA payments and did not receive any statements asking for payment and I get a letter asking for $650.00 and to call them in the next 30 days or further action would take place.  I called them three times and left messages from my cell phone so that I had record of the call and the length of time spent on each call.  After that I waited for a return call as they say that it will take 24-48 hours for them to return a call.  Nowhere in my phone records is there a return call. And today I get another letter stating that there is a lien placed on my house and that I owe them an astounding $921.10 and they will not accept partial payments.
What the heck???  I am a teacher and I don't even make that amount in one paycheck.  I called and left a message for them to call me back but I'm not holding my breath.  If I thought it would hold up in court I would try it but I feel as they know that they have me in the corner.  What else am I supposed to do - their next action is to sue me and I'm sure that balance will double.  I only hope that he gets his when he meets his maker.

										The holder of a law degree, Carol Longoria, J.D. works for the Office of the General Counsel of the University of Texas System, as well as in the University of Texas at Austins (UT) Office of the Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer, where her title is Open Records Coordinator. 
The purpose of Open Records laws generally  and of Texass Public Information Act, specifically -- is to provide the public with benefit of transparency into how tax-funded institutions operate. 
Mark Regnerus is a UT associate professor in sociology who took $785,000 from anti-gay-rights groups to produce a study booby-trapped against gays, known as The New Family Structures Study (NFSS).
Regnerus got the bulk of his money from The Witherspoon Institute, whose top authorities are
notorious anti-gay bigots with long and shameful histories of defaming gay people with distortions of the scientific record. [continued below]....
									
										.....
W. Bradford Wilcox is the director of the Witherspoon program through which Regnerus is chiefly funded. Wilcox is on the editorial board of the Elsevier journal that published Regnerus on June 10, 2012 without benefit of valid peer review; Social Science Research.
Regneruss study, published without benefit of valid peer review, features a methodology so inconsistent with minimum standards that a group of 8 professional associations including the American Medical Association filed an amicus brief
in which the Regnerus study is analyzed as methodologically unsound. The President of the American Sociological Association has signed a letter  along with over 200 Ph.D.s and M.D.s  to Social Science Research expressing concerns about the Regnerus studys lack of intellectual integrity and the sleazy process through which it was published.
The published study  besides being methodologically invalid  contains a whopping lie; Regnerus claims that the funding sources played no role at all in the design or conduct of the study, the analyses, the interpretations of the data, or in the preparation of this manuscript. Witherspoon is making that same false claim on a stand-alone website it created to promote the study. Both Regnerus and his Funders have engaged in a campaign of deception to hoodwink the public into believing that Regnerus did his study independently of influence from his gay-hating funders.
In truth, Regneruss Witherspoon funder Wilcox was issued a Regnerus study consulting contract  for data analysis  to which UT assigned the UT EID or Doc ID number ww2897.  The record shows that Wilcox was paid $2,000 for that one contract.
A Public Information Act request sent to UT asked for all Regnerus-study-related communications between Regnerus and his Witherspoon funder Brad Wilcox. In response to that request, UTs Carol Longoria sent a letter on university letterhead to the Texas Attorney General  the Republican Greg Abbott -- asking him for authorization not to disclose the requested communications. In that letter, UTs Carol Longoria wrote that Professors Regnerus and Wilcox collaborated on the data collection and analysis that formed the basis of Dr. Regneruss publication.
In other words, UT and Ms. Longoria acknowledge that UTs Mark Regnerus wrote a despicable and deliberately deceptive lie into his published study.
A university of integrity would not seek to shield a faculty member from accountability for publishing a deliberately misleading lie in a scientific journal.
I called Ms. Longoria and told her that at this point, if UT is interested in showing the world that it is more interested in upholding a public image of academic integrity than in shielding a lying-mouthed, gay-bashing professor, it will make a public acknowledgement that UTs Regnerus lied in a published study, and do everything it can to help the public to understand the inappropriate relationships that Regnerus has conducted with his studys funders.
Digging in her heels, UTs Longoria said that UT will do no such thing, and that it will wait for the Attorney Generals decision on whether to release the requested communications.
UTs and Ms. Longorias behavior subvert the mission of a university, as a university should above all be committed consistently to the highest achievable standards of academic integrity.
Ironically, Ms. Longoria wrote in her blog on 9/14/2012 about the difficulties that Hispanic female
professionals can face due to prejudices. Now here she is, taking money from UT to enable gay bashers to continue to use a scientifically invalid study as a weapon against innocent gay human beings in the courts, in politics, on TV, on radio and in magazines, newspapers and online venues.
UT and Ms. Longoria are not doing the academically honorable things. The academically honorable things would include, but not be limited to: 1) issuing press releases, acknowledging the fact that UTs Mark Regnerus published a willfully deceptive, documented lie in a hoax study he had published via inappropriate and corrupt procedures involving the funders of his study, and 2) committing -- to the public -- to fully investigating and disclosing all details of Regneruss inappropriate relationships with his studys funders.
Longoria is a horrid hypocrite, one minute deploring the impact of prejudice on one minority group, the next minute serving as an enforcer of prejudices against another minority group.
As of publication of this report, UT and its Open Records Coordinator Carol Longoria, J.D. are exploiting the laws pertaining to the Public Information Act in ways that violate the intent of that law. The Public Information Act is supposed to help keep tax-funded institutions honest by giving the public access to those institutions records. 
UT and Carol Longoria instead are abusing the laws in an attempt to shield UTs Mark Regnerus from accountability for having published a lie in a scientific journal. No respectable university would behave this way.
As a point of reference, UT professor Charles Groat conducted a study on fracking, concluding that fracking is safe, without disclosing that he is on the board of a fracking industry company and that he holds over $1 million of stock in that company. When watchdog groups brought Groats conflicts of interest to UTs attention, UT at first scoffed. The Public Accountability Initiative then brought extra pressure to bear, whereupon UT agreed to review Groats study.  
So the bottom line here is, that left to its own devices vis--vis academic integrity, the University of Texas at Austin can be counted on to do the wrong, morally bankrupt thing, and Carol Longoria, J.D. can be counted on to assist UT in doing the wrong, morally bankrupt thing.

Once the initial payment had been made Cdn$104.98, there were a couple of mails received and these were just saying that everything was in order and being processed. 
Then after 2 days nothing (for a service which claimed everything would be completed in less than 48hrs)
Since then I have tried to phone and only receive a robotic answering service claim all the staff are so busy leave my details and they will call me back . . . . Yeah right! Every email i send to them using the address they mailed me from is returned as is any other e address I have managed to find on line.
On further investigation the only tab that does work on the web site is the contact tab and that is useless as you still cannot get hold of them.

Please if you've had problems with this attorney file a complaint with the Idaho State Bar. This Attorney needs to be stopped before he hurts more people. I don't understand how he continues to keep practicing law and he is not suspended pending the outcome of the formal charges pending against him at the Idaho State Bar. He will make you do all the work and he doesn't leave a paper trail, so if you want to prove anything you need to get everything in writing or tape all conversations you have with him and his office staff.His office staff need to be investigated for multiple ethics violations. He works with another attorney who always bails him out of trouble. He has already turned on one attorney and blamed his wrongdoings on him and he soon will turn on the current attorney he works with, it is just a matter of time. He claims to have a brain tumor and blames all of his actions on the tumor he claims to have. Something may be fishy at the Idaho State Bar, he may have someone working on the inside for him, in 2010 he had 4 formal complaints pending against him and the bar wanted to disbar him and in 2011 an additional charge was added bringing the total complaints to 5 formal complaints (who know how many informal complaints he has against him) and the bar is looking to suspend him instead of disbar him. This doesn't sound right, something is going on with this complaint. How can an additional complaint be added to the formal charges brought on by the Idaho State Bar and instead of disbarring him they have changed their minds and only want to suspend him.This needs to go to the Attorney General of Idaho or to the Supreme court.

										These guys are scammers.  They have fraudulently charged my card now for $350.  On Jan 28th I called them by phone to ask about their service.  I was only calling for information.  Immediately the rep begins asking for my credit card info saying that he cannot proceed without entering that first.  This was the day my wife and I got into a huge argument and I was a bit distraught which this company preys on.  I should never have done so but I gave him my info.  He then explained that their service completes the paperwork for you.  I stopped him there and said well let me check you guys out and I will let you know.  He started getting snooty and arguing with me saying why did I call up if I didn't want their services.  I told him NOT to run my card before I did so.  I didn't know anything about these guys that I was to give some very personal info to.  He got very pushy and I told him forget ever doing anything for me and that I would never hire them at this point.  My last words before hanging up on this character was ""DO NOT RUN MY CARD, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO DO SO.""  Next day I see my card charged $100 and an email from a ""Lenny Johnson"" with a gmail account.  Yes, a gmail account.  I reply saying this was not authorized and to immediately refund my money.  I again stated I NEVER wanted their services.  I got no reply.  This was a Friday.  Monday I find my card is being charged two more times.  One for another $100 and one for $250.  I contacted this ""Lenny"" guy.  Originally the person that answered claimed he wasn't there and then goes to get him and amazingly the voice is exactly the same.  Red flags there immediately.  I explain the what happened on the phone expecting him to say, ""No problem, this was an obvious error.  We will refund your money immediately.""  Instead this guy argues with me and starts calling my integrity into question and threatening me with litigation.  This is an obvious scam.  He tried claiming he is providing a service I agreed to which I never did.  When I asked how he could provide any service without any of my information (they only got my credit card, no social security numbers, children, addresses, wife's name, etc.) he went into attack mode and hung up.  I check my account again after talking with this guy and cancelling my card and see that he has attempted to run it again for another $50 and then $100.  My next step is to contact the local police and the police in New York.  This company needs to be shut down.  They take advantage of distraught people and unwittingly attempt to make them pay for something they never authorize.  I have searched for more info about them but all I can find is a Facebook page that several people have posted about them being a scam.  I am not even sure this address is even a good address for these guys.  They apparently are not legitimate.  DO NOT USE them.  There are plenty of other good companies out there that don't operate like this.  I found one quite easily and am very pleased.  I wish I had looked into this company before ever calling and especially for being an idiot and giving them my card number.  I should have canceled that card immediately.  I learned a hard lesson here. 									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										These two guys had to go to a leasing company to free up some money just to open up their own office. Now, these are two attorneys who have had long careers in law -- decades -- and they had to go to a leasing company to borrow money against furniture to open their office? Let that sink in for a minute or two. Might give you a little bit of a clue about the competence of the principles in this firm.  Recently, a close personal friend came to me with concerns about the ability and the and stability of this Salt Lake City law firm made up of these two men -- Stanley J Preston and Bryan Michael Scott. And it made me weary listening to some of the things this person detailed -- the complaints of shady business practices and bullying. It seems these two guys are more interested in forcing their will on clients and steam-rolling them rather than listening to their clients' needs and working with them.  A word of warning to you: Do your due dilligence before hiring these two and entering into an agreement to allow them to represent you. And if you decide to use them, always check your bills in detail first before paying them. Just saying ... you never know when something might slip in there.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										This attorney handled my case with complete incompetence and disrespect. He was paid $4,000 (four thousand dollars) as a retainer for legal services and then did not provide legal services.  
He realized I was intelligent so he wouldn't answer any calls or have any conversations with me. He just ignored me and kept all of my money. He allowed one of his subordinate attorneys to talk to me, but as nice as the subordinate attorney was, he was as seemingly inept and aloof with legal matters as Steven Decastro was/is or more! 
Instead of giving back the money (which he seemingly couldn't do because he was apparently broke since he is now working out of an apartment in Queens), and being honest about not being capable of the legal work, he colluded with a previous attorney to get revenge on me (he alludes to this in writing to the disciplinary committee), so he kept all of my money and would just not perform legal services. [continued below]....
									
										..... 
Steven Decastro stated in writing to the attorney grievance committee that he called the previous attorney and then decided that he was not going to provide legal services to me. Even with his admission, he still didn't he return the money, then called me derogatory names in writing to the disciplinary committee.  
When I sued him in the Supreme Court for resolve, he never showed up to court, and the case is still sitting actively in the Supreme Court system.
Total FAIL on the legal profession!!! Based on my experience and in my opinion he is not a nice person and is dumb as h**l! 
The state of New York is responsible for any further abuses if Steven Decastro is allowed to continue scamming people out of money in the guise of lawyer-client relationships since they have been duly notified. 									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

If he is appointed as Minor's Counsel on your case - make an immediate motion to have him removed from your case.    He will lie and manipulate to get the outcome of the case that he wants - and I have yet to see where he wants to see a mother be in their child's life.   He may have in the past - but none that anyone locally has ever heard of.
He took custody of his own grandchildren because he disagreed with his son's religious training of the child!

										This complaint is a combination of two different letters sent to other places concern two businesses I am or have filed a complaint on. Sorry so lengthy.September 12, 2012


I am asking for assistance from your office. First I must apologize for the length of this letter, there is so much that has to be said. I am writing you because Pam Johnson @ the housing counseling resource center said you are a great resource. I never intended not to pay my debt. In 2009, I became underemployed when I lost one of the two jobs I worked. It happened to be the main source of my income. Meanwhile, my husbands business was slowly growing. This is where I fell behind on my mortage. I continued to send in payments until the mortage company wouldnt accept them any longer. I was also willing to send in partial payments but they said that was not allowed. I filled out a financial analysis form through the mortage company. I then completed counseling on the phone through the HOPE hotline with a company call Springboard who submitted their recommendations to my lender that stated I was able to do a repayment plan. From this information, in December 2011, Nationwide offered us a payment arrangement of $3,000 mthly for one year to get caught up. During this time I was researching a company called RMA legal network. I decided to go with RMA because I felt the $3,000 was a bit too high and I wanted to negotiate a little lower payment. I was advised to submit all correspondence from my lender to the company, and not to contact my lender on my own because that was the job of the negotiator. I paid this company to help us keep our home and in the end I feel like our case was not given the individual attention needed. The negotiator worked my case with the same cookie cutter plan she was accustomed to. I continuously called and emailed to get updates. Phone calls go unanswered or un-returned, I would have to resort to sending multiple faxes, emails, and/ or phone calls to get her attention. I often had to call the customer relations line for a reply and the Sr. Legal Asst. Hugo Rodriguez who enrolled me in the program. As disgusted I am with this company, I feel as equally wronged by my lender Nationwide. The entire time Ive thought we were headed in the right direction, there was no progress made. We were not offered a forbearance, deed in lieu, deed for lease, nor a short sale. The day before my sale date, DoriAnn Wright, the negotiator on my case, suddenly had an epiphany and so called figured out that my lender was only using my income and not my husbands. She also stated that my lender was not following Fannie Mae guidelines. THE DAY BEFORE MY SALE DATE! The plan all along was to show his income as well. She also indicated that the lender was not calculating the income correctly period. She then urged me to find an attorney to file a restraining order on my lender, it could cost upto $2,000. This was @ 4:00 pm on August 28, 2012, the day before my sale date. Eight months, and this was my end result. I feel that from January to now was more than ample time for any issues like these to have been figured out. During this process, I have had two sale dates on my property, one I was advised by the Sr. Atty. Hugo Rodrigez to advised me to file an emergency chapter 13. He referred me to a paralegal by the name of Jeffery Giordano, @ best debt consulting), who also charged me a fee to prepare the paperwork for me and gave me instructions on how to file it @ the court house. They explain that this will buy us a little more time to get a plan worked out with the lender. I communicated this with my negotiator, and now that Ive lost my home she doesnt acknowledge me ever stating this to her.  I would have advised you to stick with it because this is what would have saved your home. Now I am barred from filing any bankruptcy I am eligible for for the next six month. On September 5, 2012 I spoke with Lisa Nicholson, the head of loss mitigation @ Nationwide. She never gave me a break down of the income like I asked. She did state that it was not clear that my husbands income was to be considered as well and that they never received a financial form with his signature on it. When I spoke to another rep. in the loss mitigation dept. on August 28, 2012, by the name of Melinda, she said that she saw where another financial analysis form came through on August 27th, but nothing will be done with it because your sale date is tomorrow. I feel that once it was determined the income was not being processed correctly, this was grounds to postpone my sale date. Supposely Lisa made a request to Fannie Mae to do so and they declined. I was told this decision was reached in less than an hours time @ the end of the business day. However, when I asked her for Fannie Maes phone # during our conversation on September 5th, she had to look it up to give it to me, Ill give you a call back in a couple of minutes, again, 4:56pm. I never got a call back. I called the loss mitigation dept. on the 6th and asked Rory for the number. I had the # already, I wanted to see if they had a different one. Everytime I call Fannie Mae, I dont get straight answers. Lisa states that my home is back with the investor, Fannie Mae, there is nothing they can do @ this point. I am in a redemption stage. Ive been researching, and I see programs where people have been wronged during the foreclosure process and their loans were reinstated. I have definitely been wronged. I have filed complaints on both my lender and RMA with the Atty. General office. I have submitted proof for 8mths that we can afford to pay our note and for 8mths I have been given the run away by both my lender and third party. Congressman, I am not looking for a hand out.I feel in my gut that my case was not treated right. All anyone can tell me now is, think of this as a new start. What??? I have kids who love the schools they go to. My son just started middle school, this is a huge adjustment for him. We can pay our note and both parties have the proof. My lender chose not to extend any other option. Its sad, I got more action and feedback from the housing counsel in one week than I got from RMA or my lender in 8mths and it was free. I am so discouraged. Can you please let direct me in the right direction. I know this letter is long, but believe it or not I still have more to add but just cant put it into words. Please let me know what I can do, or how your office can help. Sincerely,Shannon ScottAugust 28, 2012



More to add:I didnt get the housing counsel involved until 8/13/12, I was in touch with the Chicago office. Michelle did my intake and I was forwarded on to Lidiette. Lidiette stated that I wouldnt be eligible for a MHA loan modification because one was done earlier on my and I didnt qualify for a fannie mae modification because I didnt reduction in payment did not meet the requirement. She is the one who argued me right away to contact a local housing counsel. This is when I found Pam Johnson who gave me a grocery list of this to do. Shes been very helpful. She told me to get on the phone and call Nationwide, ask if my acct. was assigned to someone, who, and to ask for my sale date to be postponed and let them know that I had an appt. to meet with a counselor from the housing counsel on Tuesday, 8/28/12. This was the sooniest she Pam could get me in.August 28th 10:00 amSpoke to Malinda@Nationwide. Asked her if they received the additional information I was asked by DoriAnn@rmalegal network to fax to her so she can fax over to Nationwide on 8/27/12( contribution letter from husband, proof of his residency, and bank statements), Malinda stated that she did see another financial form submitted on 8/27/12, but it was too late since the sale date is tomorrow 8/29/12, nothing can be done. I asked about forberrance, the repayment plan that we were originally offered before I started working with RMA and she said there was nothing available for retention. So @ that time I was denied without my husbands income being concerned when during the entire process I was told that we needed my husbands income to qualify.10:16 am In the meanwhile, I sent DoriAnn an email about what I just discussed with Miranda. DoriAnn then called me and explained to me that she is working with someone named Rory @ Nationwide. Malinda is a customer service rep. in the default dept. She also stated the additional items that she requested from me on 8/27/12, ( contribution letter from husband, proof of his residency, and bank statements), according to Rory were in review with the underwriter. I asked her when did she speak to Nationwide? She said this morning. I asked if there was a time line? She said no, unfortunately if she pushes too much, Nationwide would just push it aside.I spent the rest of my morning calling around to different attorneys for advice. Since all of this I was advised to file an emergency chapter 13 back in April by one of the senior advisors @ rma to buy time for them to get a modification done. So, because I look like a chronic filer, I am barred to file any bk I am eligible for for 6mths. I pondered not going to the appt. I had with Pam because I was so discouraged.1:00pm From the time I spoke with DoriAnn @ 10am, I hadnt heard anything new. I decided to keep my appt. with Pam. She took me through the intake process got everything entered into the HOPE portal. She called my lender to get info she needed to fill out one of the docs. She explained to them who she was and asked for a postponement on my behalf still no go. Around 3;30pm, Pam stepped out the room to make copies of my documents. I called DoriAnn and asked if she heard anything. She was hotter than a wet hen.she said that Nationwide denied me even with my husbands income. She also stated that Nationwide had not been following Fannie Mae guidelines nor have they been calulationing the income correctly. Remember, I was told from the beginning my husband income was going to be considered as well, and it wasnt. She stated that Nationwide is to get permission from Fannie Mae every step of the way and it was not done. She said she was told that she had to call Fannie Mae and get ask for an emergency stop sale, she then explained that it is the servicers responsibility to do so. She stated that as she was on the phone with Fannie Mae she had another associate on the phone with Alicia Nichols some manager @ Nationwide walking her through how to ask Fannie Mae for this emergency stop sale. I asked her what time all of this took place? She said since 3:30pm (NewYork time). So now it is 4:30pm her time and she is waiting to hear from Nationwide if the sale is postponed. I get a call from her about 20 mins later, and she said that Nationwide said Fannie Mae didnt approve it. DoriAnn stated that it is her belief they are lying because she has never gotten any answer back that quick from them. She stated she has voiced a compliant with the Kansas Attorney General office, she left a message for both Judge Vino and his Asst. Oh, DoriAnn said she spoke to a Jessica and a Christina @ Fannie Mae.
My compliant is against both Nationwide and Rma because:1. Nationwide already knew they were not going to do another modification2. Had RMA been on top of things they would have known if Nationwide was not following Fannie Mae guides.3. I took forever just to get an update, and everything I requested one the requested me to send in the same things no matter if theyve already asked for them or not.4. The advice I got from RMA always cost me money and is always a temporary fix. (Emergency chapter 13).5. Everytime Ive gotten correspondence from Nationwide, it has been after theyve requested RMA to have me send in more doc. EX: I got mail from Nationwide dated 8/13/12 stating they couldnt review my file because it was in complete but I just got a request from RMA on 8/21/12 to something else in but the envelope from Nationwide was stamped 8/23/12. 6. I generally feel like I was just sprung along. I started working with RMA in January 2012. DoriAnn stated today that shes been neogiating my case since April 2012. All this time, money, and no favorable result. I love how the mortage company is quick to say that theyve not received a payment since whatever date, but what they dont say is we stopped accepting her payment such and such date. Nor would they accept a partial payment.
I sorry this is so lengthy. Pam told me to makesure I documented everything. I dont know what the outcome will be, but this is my official compliant.Thank You Kindly,",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										This cooked attorney wanted $1800 up front for a simple reduction in child support, despite what i thought was a very high cost for maybe an hours work i was going to pay it anyway, but when i tried to give him a check, he wanted another $180 and said it would be $4600 if paid by check, and $2500 if paid by cash. They would only except your bank debit card. This is so they can tap your account for what ever inflated price they feel like charging you.

										This firm offers wills, estate planning and financial planning from $99, yet they have charged my friends estate thousands ....so far, as their fees are based on a percentage of the estate!
A dear personal friend Victor Spiegel, appointed  the Cassady law firm as his trustee while he was alive. He had a simple estate seven beneficiaries each to receive a specific percentage from the proceeds of his bank account and marketable securities.  And there was a home that was specifically willed to one beneficiary. A very simple estate.  
Victor passed away on May 26,2011. Such as simple estate should have been completed within one or tow days of the statutory waiting period. However no funds were distributed until Februruary 15, 2012. the accounting information was minimal and they firm still kept a hold back of proceeds.
I am a Director of a public charity who is one of the beneficiaries. During the process both myself and other beneficairies contoacted the Cassady law firm by telepnove, email and mail.  Rude clerical staff and  no information were the CONSTANT action of the firm.  In addtion I was a personal friendof Victor and had personal property in his home when he passed away. I called the Cassady law firm numerous times, sent email and registered letters to get back my property. No returned communication until january when I got 3 of the 7 items I own that were in the home!  To get this I had to file a compalint with the Nevada State Bar Association!
Another beneficiary has terminal cancer and needed funds for medical treatment. Same behavior! No response by the firm as to the estate progress so she could know when she could pay for her cancer treatment. 
My friend Victor would  ""roll over in his grave"" if he knew their service was poor and unprofessional!

I guess the Director is up to his old tricks of hiring whomever he wants regardless of their qualification or experience. I think it also has to do with individuals in leadership at WDVA that have graduated from Evergreen need to keep their friends employed because it so rough out there. 
This guy needs to be fired and he has no compassion or drive to help veterans like myself. Hey Director Lee why don't you fire this guy right now.  Wow what a joke of an agency to know that they really don't have any type of morals and hire the lamest person out there.

										THIS IS A COPY OF THE ACTUAL COMPLAINT LETTER TO THE NEW HAMPSHIRE SUPREME COURT, THE ATTORNEY DISCIPLINE DIVISION WHICH EXPLAINS EVERYTHING ! October 4, 2012New Hampshire Supreme CourtAttorney Discipline Office4 Chenell Drive, Suite 102Concord, Nh 03301Phone: (603) 224-5828      To whom this letter may concern,I am filing a complaint with your office regarding a recent and unethical treatment I received by an attorney named Edward  W. Stewart, Jr. with the law firm Shaheen & Gordon, P.A., 80 Merrimack street, Manchester, Nh 03103, phone number (603) 669-8080.To try and be brief, I was hurt at work on June 27th, 2012 and was given the run around by the insurance company who kept asking me to do leg work for them in order for them to pay worker's compensation while I was out of work. I fulfilled their wishes on two different occasions and after being led a wild goose chase getting the documents they needed over a two month period, they subsequently denied paying the claim without just cause. It was at this time I went online to inquire the help of an experienced attorney and found the site for Shaheen & Gordon and made an appointment to see Edward W. Stewart, Jr. to discuss the case. He and I met at his office. Mr. Stewart asked me to obtain all of my hospital records and bring them to him.I was advised by Edward Stewart Jr.,  I would need a better letter ( which he wrote for me to give to the my doctor) which stated the doctors opinion above and beyond what she already checked off on the workers compensation form stating my injury was due to my job function at work.I made another trip back to the doctor who wrote a letter on my behalf, explaining her position once again, describing my work being the cause or most likely the cause, as she was not there to see the injury take place.The same week I had been  referred to a surgeon for possible need of surgery and was asked by Ed Stewart Jr. to obtain a workers compensation form from the surgeon as well, showing his position and thoughts into the injury which I also brought to the attorney. This was on Friday , September 28th, 2012 .  I hand delivered the documents he needed to expedite the  situation due to being out of work without income for well over two months and facing possible eviction without a place to live.  The attorney was well aware of the dire situation I was facing because of a dishonest insurance company , only buying time hoping I would just go away.The attorney was not available at the time I delivered these documents, so I left a short letter with the two documents he needed, and asked in the letter to contact me on Monday when he was back in the office.To my dismay, I did not hear back from Mr. Stewart until Thursday, after leaving more messages by phone, asking for a return call.I finally heard from Mr. Stewart who was very monotone with me, after I answered the phone, as if a family member just died. I did not hear any type of reinforcement or support what so ever about the case at the start of our conversation and felt like everything he asked me to get for him for the case would have had a more positive response, especially after having to wait almost a week to even hear back from him.I asked him on the phone if I was correct in sensing there was a problem or something missing he needed before requesting a hearing at the labor board, to go forward. He told me the doctors letter  was not word for word like he wrote it and then he advised me to get an additional letter from the surgeon I went to see, in addition to the workers comp form he already filled out on my -2-behalf which I felt was out of line since considering  I could have got that while I was at the appointment. I had,  at that point,  asked why he was not being a little more positive about the case and he said,  insulting my intelligence, he thought I had a poor attitude , based on my concern,, about his lack of concern on the case.It was at this point, after I questioned his position, he told me, he was very busy and explained this is why it took him a week to get back to me and it was due to backed up cases from months prior and even if I requested an expedited hearing,  like we talked about,  after the first two meetings, he would be too busy to appear anyway, and most likely not be able to appear for at least 2 months !!This infuriated me,  after I had just got the run around from the insurance company, now I'm being misled by this attorney, who had to have known he was too busy to take the case from the start,  if he was claiming he had cases preventing him to representing me at a hearing at the labor board in Concord for more than 2 months !  I expressed my disappointment after just feeling better, having an attorney, who would be there for me, based on everything I already went through with the insurance company. Instead of being professional and understanding of my disappointment, he thought it would be better to try and insult me and told me there was never a written agreement and I should have never assumed he was even taking the case !I feel this was an extremely unprofessional and unethical treatment on the attorney's part and hope by this letter, especially if this has been a pattern of conduct  by this attorney, which may be on record somewhere, this will be added to an existing file where if his continues showing disregard for the public, disciplinary action may be taken by your division over seeing  these unprofessional attorneys.I am so distraught over this, as I am now back in the same position, still without representation,  still facing eviction.  I am forwarding a copy of this letter to the Better Business Bureau and to multiple consumer complaint  websites to inform the public of his thoughtless and unethical practices.Lastly, if you could give any advise as to an obtaining a reputable and professional attorney who specializes in cases such as my own, please  email me with an attorney's name is possible,  who I can contact about my case.  Thank you for your valued time and I appreciate your understanding in this matter.

										This is the worst company I have dealt with in my life. I do not recommend using them for anything, you're better off burning your money than giving it to them.First they were supposed to send us paper work to get the process started. Not sure what they were doing but we had to call three separate times before they actually sent us the mail after months of waiting. Still after this they had phone numbers listed wrong after we had told them three separate times over the phone and corrected their mistakes.Then they told us to go to the police station to get our finger prints. The police station told us they do not do this. So we called Express Pardons and they exclaimed that they do, and to go back. So we went to a different police station and they said the same thing. So we looked at the Calgary Police stations website and right on there it says you cannot get finger prints for pardons at a police station you have to use a third party firm.So after screwing everything up possible we requested a refund, and they kept $150 saying it was an administration cost. We sent them a time stamped fax saying we wanted a full refund for all their mistakes and wasting our time and they completely ignored us, and even went as far as to say we never requested a full refund even though we have proof of doing so. (time stamped fax)You don't need to take my word for it though, take a look at their rating on the BBB - who revoked them for numerous reasons. One being that over 30 people have filed claims against them in the last 12 months, that is a lot of unhappy customers being screwed around by a company who has no regard for their clients.http://www.bbb.org/mbc/business-reviews/pardon-services/express-pardons-in-vancouver-bc-1247042									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										This is the WORST law firm in Florida. They are your basic ambulance chasers. They were retained by contract to handle a VOP by and did not do anything for me but make my case worse and cost me money and stress. Once you pay them, they treat just like a legal aide lawyer would.  They don't call back.  They did not even show up for my hearing.  When I complained I was told ""we have done enough for you for what you paid us"". Refused to refund my money. I opened a BBB case which is pending.  The legal assistant Diane Moore is totally incompetent. Ran me around in circles for months with no results. They cost me MORE money. Told me my warrant was lifted and I booked a hotel, flight and rental car to appear in court. Before travel I found out the warrant was stilll active. These guys are the type of lawerys you want to stay away from. Don't get burned like I did. They costed me around 1800. [continued below]....

You'd be better off thowing yourself at the mercy of the court. Total incompetence, and they are nasty also. Be smart and heed my advise.

										This law practice failed and refused to answer critical questions which not only placed me at a severe and unfair disadvantage, it resulted in the loss of precious family heirlooms.  ""We are in receipt of your emails and Fred will get back to you as soon as he can.""  HA!  I'm still waiting and it's 3 years later.
This law practice charged me the full lawyer rate for letters written and mailed by the paralegal.  The contract I signed stated that paralegal rates were $175 LESS than the full rate for Fred's time.
Finally got a conference to talk with Fred so he can answer the email questions you never got answered?  Prepare to pay him the full rate while he texts on his phone to another client.  He will still charge you his full rate.  When I protested, he said he would drop the hours from his charges but he never did.
Fred led me to believe that a critical aspect of my case would be handled a certain way by the court.  15 Minutes before trial, during final negotiations with the other side, Fred let me know that the position was not true.  
Are you going to change your address?  I did.  It took Fred's office nearly a year to send mailings, including invoices, to my correct address.  My ex got all that mail and held it.  This caused me to miss an important court date because Fred never bothered to contact me by email as well.
That court date?  There was supposed to be a meeting 5 days prior to work out settlements/offers.  Fred never contacted me about that, either.  Nor did he contact me about the ""Pre Trial Agreement"" which was supposed to try and settle marital property split before trial.  I never saw, nor did I have any input in, the ""Pre Trial Agreement.""  I discovered it after the trial.
Want to make sure certain conditions are included in your settlement?  I did.  As it turns out Fred ignored those requests, costing me tens of thousands of dollars.  When he did not understand specifics of the conditions I was requesting, he simply ignored my request; he did not ask for clarification.
Fred failed and refused to follow simple instructions.  He never got QDRO's for the correct comparison of retirement accounts and he messed up a critical home appraisal by not following my directions.
You have been warned!  Hire this attorney at your peril.  In my opinion, there is no way he should be allowed to practice law.  I would have been able to attain a far more equitable settlement had I represented myself.  A rock would have done a better job than Fred L. Howe because a default settlement would have been more favorable.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										This lawyer was hired for a landlord/tenant matter where I am the tenant and Robert Pavelko charged me a $500 retainer to work on my case and he told me the cost shouldn't exceed $500 and whatever is not used would be refunded. I told him to call me before he made any charges above $500 and he did not. And so, I got billed for another $218. Then he asked for a second $500 retainer to work on drafting a settlement. I paid the $218 I owed plus an additional $141 to go toward the retainer for drafting a settlement. I told him I would send him the other portion of the $500 retainer if a settlement is reached and a settlement letter needs to be drafted. AGAIN, I told him to please contact me before making any future charges and he failed to contact me once again and now he says I owe $309! No settlement was reached! He charged me for the day of cancellation and AFTER! Got the bill today and told him I was going to file a complaint and he is threatening to put a lien on my property TODAY!Robert Pavelko is not trustworthy. I trusted that I could give him money in advance and that he wouldn't make any unauthorized charges, but he did.Robert Pavelko is not responsive. After I paid him the $218 plus $141 for the retainer for future services, he did not contact me for a full two weeks. Then all of a sudden I get a forwarded email that my landlord sent to him saying, ""Please call to discuss"" and then I also got a voicemail saying the same thing except he added, ""to discuss a settlement"". I called back his office phone, left a message. I called his cell phone, left a message. 48 hours goes by when he said he would get back to me in 24 hours. I got fed up with him and my landlord and said via voicemail and email that there will be no settlement and I am canceling my services.Instead of this garbage referral to Robert Pavelko that I got through a employee assistance program, I go see a professional lawyer for a $100 consultation. The consultation was free with Robert Pavelko as a benefit through my employer. His presentation during the consultation was poor, but I had trust that my employer would refer me to someone ethical and professional. Robert Pavelko upholds neither of those qualities, and is simply a licensed attorney that should have his license revoked.Robert Pavelko is not knowledgeable. He told my husband that my landlord could illegally evict because we were on a month to month lease. I relayed this information to a second professional attorney and she told me that was absolutely false!Please do not trust this attorney with your hard earned money. He will try to Rob you blind with unauthorized/inaccurate charges. He won't return your phone calls in a timely manner and will most definitely not keep you informed about your case.Robert Pavelko has a very rude and disrespectful demeanor as he will not let you finish when talking and will talk over you and every time he talks over you, he will raise his voice a notch to the point of yelling at you. This occurred during the consultation  as well but I trusted the services provided by my employer and overlooked his sour demeanor.On the contrary, Kara Noack, Denver, is a fantastic attorney for landlord/tenant cases. She truly listens to your entire story to understand the full picture and she demonstrates her knowledge through relaying the information back to you within her responses. Her fees were very reasonable. Robert Pavelko charged me $718 to write one letter to my landlord and Cara charges $200 for the same service...just one flat hourly based fee. Robert Pavelko charged for every phone call and every email...one email alone cost $75!!! Cara Noack does not charge people for talking to them through a 10 min phone call nor does she charge them for every email she sends.Robert Pavelko said it would cost me $7500 for his representation in a countersuit against my landlord. Cara Noack said it would be a flat $1500 fee for her representation.Stay Away from Robert Pavelko.  Innocent families, such as ours, are getting robbed blind and lied to by this attorney who is in a position of trust. I absolutely do not recommend this attorney. If you need a lawyer to represent you for landlord/tenant matters, I highly recommend Kara Noack. She actually truly cares about the livelihood of her clients and she makes sure her responses are accurate. The consultation was only supposed to be for an hour but Kara Noack spent an extra 30 mins with me just to make sure I had a clear path forward. I came out of the consultation with Kara Noack rejuvenated and refreshed. The feeling of doom that Robert Pavelko continuously pushed upon me really dragged me down physically and mentally over the span of 2 1/2 months and the darkness was finally lifted after talking over my case with Kara Noack.

										This Report is about the fraud Public defender turned lawyer by the name of Nathan Edward Carter. To Tell my side of the story. In Jacksonville FL, me and a Rouge crookett sheriff officer Name Rudy R Hathaway had been at it over a FAKE stop sign ticket that he gave me in April 2011 along with a illegal misdomeanor arrest. The Jacksonville Sheriff office covered up for this officers wrong doing following the incident, I went mad there after and Demanded something be done about this officers actions and also to have my original complaint given to me so i can at least take that to my assigned judge (Charles Cofer) and have my case heard sense the judge put a Withhold adjudication on it and had not converted to final judgement yet. 
Me and The Jso went at it all year, they refuse to turn over MY DOCUMENTS in december 2011 and had the nerve to ask me for $246 just to request it and thats not even processed the same day. [continued below]....
									
										..... I flew into a rage and threatened them on the December 29th 2011. Got arrested on Jan 4th 2012. I sat in Jail and WAS PASSED/SKIPPED on my Legal required FIRST APPEARANCE and placed in solitary confinement in a orange jump suit while all the murderes, rapist, pedophiles, arm robbers, got to WEAR A GREEN jumpsuit and see a judge on there first appearance which is the next day after arrest. I simply made threats and i cant see a judge??
Anyhow, i finally went to court on 1-26-2012 only to be told it was not my court date, there i meet NATHAN CARTER who was somewhat polite mainly to people not of Color or caucasion decent, one man had a folder with over 35 arrest and been to prison 7 times, nathan was very nice to this man. I ask nathan can he come to the jail and talk with me because he is my assigned lawyer HE SAID YES he would come and see me saturday, i asked him can i have his business card, he REFUSED!! i was very polite to him. Now 1-31-2012 gets here, and im scheduled for arraignment in judge Tyrie Boyers court. Nathan carter's did not come to see me over that past weekend, rather he was waiting for me in court. He frowned at me and said "" Those video's you were posting online about shooting cops"" and blah blah blah. I said its my free speech right to say that people should DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION and stand up for themselves agianst evil be it cops or anybody, not all COPS are good and they were not good to me in 2011 and i was mad at them the JSO. he started studdering and saying but but but this isnt about that, and turn to some pages and finally showed ME THE REAL LEGAL STUFF where i made THREATS to the JSO or Jacksonville Sheriff office by email. I ask why didnt you come to the jail like you were suppose to so we can discuss this. 
The judge and the prosecuter called my name up, we stood up and i tried to plea NO CONTEST, but carter said NOT GUILTY and the judge said okay let CARTER DO THE TALKING. Carter said i was crazy and needed a mental doctor. the judge said WHAT?? He want this case DISPOSED OF OR IN TRIAL BY MAY 2012. Me and Carter Argued, he claimed the judge can send me to prison TEN YEARS!! YEAH RIGHT!! No person in florida history has ever been sent to prison on a "" Threatening a public servant case!! EVER!!. Only bomb threats, stalking cases. Threatening the police is a silly charge and because of the nature of there job is expected. many of these cases are misdomeanors. But the DEMON SHERIFF paid off the STATE ATTORNEY and had mine listed as a felony for some odd reason with a $300,000 warrant bond. Keep in mind i HAD NO CRIMINAL RECORD!!!! 
Nathan Carter TOLD THE JUDGE TO PASS ME AT LEAST A MONTH so i can be seen by a doctor!! NATHAN CARTER LIED and never sheduled the doctor to come see me, rather my family called him and he hung up on them and said get a lawyer goodbye. They were forced to get a lawyer for no reason, as many people make threats to police everyday and get taken to jail and pay a fine and go home after no more then 30-90 days, police can protect there own selves!! 
My case was different, i made threats and EXPOSED THE EVIL JSO FOR WHAT THEY WERE, with over 50 officers arrested sense year 2000 for numerous crimes against the public, over 5 suicides sense 2001 from officer related misconduct when there caught in the wrong they take there life rather then face prison time and loose there careers. I REST MY CASE!! Me VS JSO you take your pick!! Its important to note that this DEMON officer Rudy R Hathway was FIRED from the St Johns Sheriff Office in 2002 for MISCONDUCT!!
I believe NATHAN CARTER reiceived payment from the Jacksonville Sheriff Office to not in anyway help me because nathan carter has defended people in MURDER TRIALS and WON!! he was also successful in fighting a CAPITAL attemped MURDER case and WON. Why in the world couldnt he just take my case and get me seen by a doctor and get me a plea, THATS ALL MY HIRED LAWYER DID (Donald B Mairs) and it was a waste of money sense i had to plead GUILTY ANYWAY as i had been telling carter all along. I ended up getting 161days TIME served with a conviction. SHAME ON JACKSONVILLE, CURSE THAT CITY!!
Nathan Carter is not a true LAWYER, only a basic certified lawyer. He attended some corner store Coastal law school rather then a respected 4 year university such as FL State Like Donald Mairs did. Carter is a BUM and a JOKE of a excuse wannabe trial lawyer who feeds off the Public defenders office with his $54,000 salary supplied by the tax payers for him to pick and choose what he wants. In reality he is a coward and is Afraid of Rutherford, IM NOT so why should he. Heck the prosecuter ( JAMES JOSEPH BOYLE) stepped down from the case after i wrote him countless letters telling him its a cover up and fraud criminal case against me.  Sheriff Rutherford Paid off Angela Corey and Richard Komando to send me to prison and Apparently paid Carter to do the same because i bet judge Boyer would have just gave me a FINE and sent me on my way after 30days in jail sense i HAD A CLEAN RECORD, but old smartty pants carter going to say im mentally ILL opening up a can of whole new worms forcing the judge to see if im even COMPETENT to stand trial or be released to the public.
After hiring Mairs my family had to pay SEPARATELY to the doctor ( Doctor NYADI) who was convince without a doubt i was competent and refuse to let the sheriff pay him off. He did however say i had a borderline personallity but that wasnt enough for the state to hold me. They(the courts) had me scheduled for releasing/plea deal after 110days but here comes EVIL JSO saying i shouldnt be out so early. forcing 41 more days. AFTER ALL THE EVIL THAT THEY DID TO ME. EVIL PIGS CAN BURN IN HELL!!
All carter had to do was take my stupid case, HECK the news didnt even know i was in jail??? why not?? Rutherford paid for that too!! My case can be looked up on Duval county's website its case number 2012-CF-000106.  i was the 106th felon taken to jail that day and i didnt see a judge?? its called a secret arrest!! And Nathan Edward Carter was apart of it. If you see this man ( see attach picture) stay away from him. Dont allow him to be your attorney. MAKE HIM EAT DIRT for his crimes against the community!!									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										ticket busters claims to have some special way of getting your traffic ticket dismissed by the court however they have nothing of the sort. The only thing they do is file court documents on your behalf. There is nothing special about their ""process""at all. They are like snake oil salesmen who are taking unfair advantage of people who are in trouble. They charge approximately $270.00 to file a single document which does not include any explanation or exculpatory facts on your behalf. Of course the court will find you guilty! After the court does find you guilty, ticketbusters wants you to go to the court in person ( like you probably should have done to begin with ), and be found guilty again. This is the only way they will consider refunding you roughly half of your money. When they are talking you into paying for their service they are friendly and sound so caring but after you've paid they are short and very uncaring, basically they don't give a damn about you or your ticket.

										Ticketbust.com is a complete and total scam.  If you don't read the full terms and conditions on their website you're in for some surprises.  First, they don't refund the full amount if the ticket doesn't get dismissed.  They just refund $100 of the $229 fee.  Second, in order to get that $100 refund you have to GO TO COURT; the one thing you're trying to avoid!!  Lastly, you have to pay the full amount of the ticket up front.  My ticket was $300, so I would've had to dish out over $500 upfront!I know you're probably saying that the writer of this report is a chump...he should have read the Terms & Conditions.  I feel the same way!  I went to their website, briefly looked around, and filled out their get started form.  The form states that ""no money is required today..."", so I filled it out.  After filling it out I received a call immediately.  I spoke with Kim about the service.  She explained that I had a really good chance of getting my ticket dismissed.  She said in order for her to send the documents I'd have to pay their fee first.  Kim never went over any of the terms of the agreement and she also neglected to explain I'd have to pay the ticket upfront.  So I paid.
After paying, I received an email with all the documents, including the terms and conditions.  I didn't review the documents for a few days, but when I did I saw all of the negatives I explained above.  I was disappointed and decided I'd request a refund.  I called Ticketbust.com and spoke with another girl who said that she would have someone call me back.  I waited a few days and heard nothing, so I called again.  This time I spoke with Nicole.  Nicole told me that she could waive the part of the agreement requiring me to go to court in order to receive a refund of their service fee.  At this point I told her that I still wanted a refund.  She refused to refund me the money.  
I tried to do reversal with my bank but the reversal was overturned by Visa because the terms and conditions are on the ticketbust.com website.  Please read the terms and conditions, even if you're just filling out an inquiry form.  I had to pay these ticketbust.com for a service they never provided.    ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

In my case(s) he failed to represent me terribly, he lied cheated and withdrew???? The fact also exists, believe it A process server, when I was at the Jay OK,  court house, served  me with  court order to appear for an Eviction hearing.
 As I glanced at it and my witnesses asked what in the world this was, Brandon Watkins snatched this document  from me and told me to Relax and he would take care of this. That the manager at The Grove Village Apartments was breaking the law. She could not have me evicted, a) no guilty verdict had been determined in my case. B) That I had to have admitted I committed a crime. I am innocent and remember sighing a sigh of relief and feeling good to be able to trust and have a good attorney. Then I asked  witnesses, what they remembered about this time in court and there response was, I (we)   saw Brandon Watkins, snatch the served papers out of your hands as you were reading over them for understanding. The date for appearing in court was set for April 30, 2012, and his exact words,, they stated, Brandon Said,Dont worry about it, I will take care of it. 
To date I have received no copy and nothing ever mailed to me. !
Even when he unethically failed to disclose why he was a mad embarrassed temper tantrum immature man about report of wrong doing and misconduct was reported by me, Watkins became more deceitful, harming in every way in court! Lawyers are to have diligence? Well,   his misconduct shone brightly he again made promises he failed to keep.!! He then in return withdrew from one case on July 25, 2012.  Yes he Withdrew 5 days, prior and I was devastated on grounds that my actions prevented him from representing me non bias!! Asking for direction here,,,,This really doesnt happen in the year of 2012.. DOES it? God help anyone that can look in the mirror, make up more slander and lies, and go to church and proclaim they are Christians!!! Lawyers have oaths and ethics and conduct guidelines..

When trying to communicate and get answers to my Life changing Questions!!! He failed over and over to return any emails nor phone calls and his lack of dedication and his opposition of being mad at me reporting him for a NO show to court, He turned tail and used offensive behavior. Lied on correspondences. and the lowest ethical action of all is LIED about the Billing history of our endeavor!! I need to protect people seeking competent representation...They will be abused, slandered, and spit on by a hand you feed Thousands and Thousands of dollars too!!!The bill he sent is a complete falsely documented bill. For example : January 27,2012 he billed me for consultation. I did not ever talk to an employee of or  Mr Watkins, until, Feb 2, 2012Then his phone calls to court house to change appearance date(s) charged me 400.00 and 600.00 dollars???  For 10 minutes?? Are his actions for Real???Complete over charge and some meetings that never took place. And the most awful lie of all was having the nerve to tell me he did not show up for apartment hearing because I needed to just move,, the landlord just did not like me and why would I want to stay there??When I expressed my concern and sadness of what an eviction would do to my ability to rent again!!! He responded with Oh just tell new landlord that you just didnt get along. I was in utter shock!! I had no just lost my home due to the negligence of an Attorney whom I trusted and took the appearance paper I was served from my hand minutes after I was served at the court house during an appearance for my custody case. He later had his secretary Lisa lie and state, I told her not to have Brandon Show up!!! Why?! I now was homeless!!!!!!  He withdrew with no ethical conduct and I had been misrepresented, Brandon was dishonest. Deceitful and non-professional. Brandon withheld a report from my daughters counselor written in approx March 2012, I received a copy of this after he withdrew around July 31, 2012. He told me I was considered a flight risk by the counselor, and she did not recommend shared parenting time at this time. The letter had not one mention of me being considered a flight risk!!! Please let justice and dignity bring this unworthy attorney to be disciplined and not devastate nor destroy another clients life!Brandon is also in fault of telling me  my visits with my daughter were suspended do to me missing one visit. There is nothing entered in the On demand court records that indicate and visits were canceled. What do I do now? 
I have no money to hire another attorney? For custody case?
Brandon withdrew because of me reporting him to you about the NO Show for April 30, 2012Help this is unbelievable.So now he never reported a hair follicle test I completed in Feb 2012 to the court and the court had a due date of March 6, 2012, to the court..... Never entered that I have had no visits with my daughter since April 2012, and they granted a 5 year protective order to my daughters father when I was sick in CO and had doctors report of not being able to travel.. He obtained this after raping me in Sept 2011, stealing all my court papers, belongings, and dignity and was not ever ordered to return anything!!! took all clothes I had purchased for our daughter, my prescription glasses and only returned half of each bathing suit and earrings I owned. Never gave back an appraised ring valued at 1,863.00. I resided in a Safe House in Grove Ok for 5 days  and then with Gods grace found my apartment in Oct 2011 and then I was evicted on May 2.2012 Brandon never set my case for TrialHe only waived the preliminary hearing, and mis-lead me on this as well.. I am innocent and will right letters, Have contacted the ACLU, the women rights advocates and am now corresponding with Media and will in near future contact Ms.  Glory Alred... This cant happen as I have done nothing wrong but be at the disposal of my daughters wealthy father who will pay any amount of money to anyone to try and keep me from my rights as a mother. I have to grown college graduate sons, wonderful Mom and Dad, and am done with the one sided even my attorney worked against meThis needs investigated and Brandon needs to refund 1,800.00 from my payment of 2,500.00.. We had one hearing for custody and Watkins appearance at preliminary took 12 minutes not over 3 hours as billed!!! proof is pulling the court minutes and showing his demoralized values!!.He also said above and beyond his ethical duties? Ask about his assistant running down the school bus when they forgot a visit? Ask why they just happened to make a  courtesy call to my land lord, days before hearing was scheduled?? Then lie and say, not handling case? I told him not to go!!!   By making a few calls that established my confidence of my attorney handling this.. I was never told at any time he could not be at that hearing?! I havent even gone to court again.   He is wrong and I can not rent now!! He needs to be held accountable   I am not a scholar nor can type completely correct.. But I need to help society by having Brandon Watkins answer to his Unethical, Misconduct and False billing practices. The thought of another church going, God fearing single mother, relocated from Colorado ..alone in Oct 2009, be treated like this.. The justice system in this case needs to look at Brandon Watkins and his highly fraudulent and unethical practicing of the LAW in Oklahoma .God Speed.

										to start, I hope ripoff does not try to remove this report. I have every document to back up this report. I believe the date is August 2011, have a contract that states pay $25000 and the rest will be on congentencie. Now he takes my case and is not licensed in Massachusetts. He tells me that he is hiring an attorney in Massachusetts to work with us. I would have court dates and I would have to chase him to call me back to let me know if he found an attorney for that day in court and after days of calling, emailing, he would finally call me back at anytime between 9:30 and 11:00 P.M. the night before and tell me what to say in court. (anyone else out there pay an attorney to not show up?) The one time he did show up he was not prepared for court. He was running around the court house trying to get an attorney to piggy back in court cause he was not licensed. He was not prepared for court. The judge allowed him to speak and the judge also hinted for him to defile my case in superior court. we even talked about him filing when he got back to his office. I would call the office several times to see if it was filed and finally got an answer, ""I was not to worry about it, he was taking care of it."" Wells Fargo attorney started sending any paper work was sent to Dale Wiley so on August 3, 2012 the sheriff comes to my door and says I have to be out in 3 days. I called Dale Wiley tell him what is going on and he says, ""well you got 6 months."" He never showed up for the court date and Wells Fargo won in court for no show or default. my husband was in the hospital with cancer and his social worker got me more time. My husband died in August. I would love to talk to anyone else that has had problems with this company.

										To whom it may concern;
My name is Donna Paxman. I am married with 4 children one of which is a special needs child whom has Autism. My husband and I ran into some issues last year with the IRS. They were sending letters stating they were going to garnish his wages. As a family of 6 we cant afford any sort of garnishing. We contacted Dana Ronald and his daughter Angelique in May of 2012. We went in for a meeting and liked what Angelique had to say. I came in a couple days later and gave her a $1000 dollar deposit and agreed to make payments while they worked on our case particuarly  our 2008 tax returns. Up until about a week ago we assumed they were hard at work. Boy were we wrong! My husband recieved a letter from the IRS stating they were going to go ahead and proceed with garnishing. We were shocked. My husband called the IRS to find out exactly what was going on. They informed us that Tax Crisis Institiute had done absolutly nothing but file saying they were our attorney and that was it! I of course fuming at this point called Angelique Ronald and very nicely let her know what was going on and told her we were going to go ahead and find a new attorney. I asked about getting a refund she said she would need to talk to her dad. I waited for about 4 days and heard nothing. So today I call and I actually get a hold of the man himself! Dana Ronald. As soon as I told him who I was his tone completly changed and he began to talk over me and informed me that he was going to send me a final bill! For what?!? He ended up hanging up on me when I asked him what the bill was for and that I needed to see what work was done that he is billing us for and had billed us for all these months. I of course call him back where we then began to have a screaming match. I lost... 
Can you please help me and my family get our money back? I wouldnt make such a fuss if they actually did work on our case but they did absolutly nothing. we cant afford to waste money like that. We recently had to do a $5000 title loan on our vehicle and I had to pawn my beautiful wedding ring to help pay our bills, buy groceries and pay for special Autism treatments for my 6 year old son. We arent trying to get rich or sue them we just want our money back. Please please please help us.

										To Whom It May Concern:
My name is Nancy Advincola and I reside at 1153 229th Drive South, Apt. 3D, Bronx, NY 10466, home phone 347-427-1329( available during 10:00-1:00 in the morning). The purpose of this email is because my family and I have been living at Edenwald Housing Complex for the past 12 years and as of the last 3 years we haven't been given a lease and we've handed in all the needed documents too. Now we don't owe the NYC Housing Authority a penny; but perhaps it's due to the fact that we continue to address this issue in an educated manner. Such as calling the media, having our story published in the newspapers, especially El Diario la Prensa numerous times and also having our story viewed on Telemundo Channel 47. Once the press started to investigate, the NYC Housing Authority denied that they were going to evict us.
Two months ago my family and I experienced the unpleasant encounter with Mr. Johnson, a Edenwald Housing Assist who had the nerve to start banging on our door and yelling at my Husband Carlos R. Advincola Sr. and I in front of our sons. Mr. Johnson was accompanied by another Edenwald Housing Assist and that gentlemen repeated to Mr. Johnson to calm down; but Mr. Johnson refused and at the end had to be dragged away from our apartment door. During all of this unnecessary incident, Mr. Johnson forced upon us documents hand made by Edenwald's Management Office stating that within 30 days we would be evicted. How can tenant be evicted if their paying their rent every month and on time. Instead of continuing to allow Mr. Edwin Rodriguez(Edenwald Manager and Mr. Johnson Housing Assist) bully us, we have continued to make this issue public, using every social website that we have access to ... Such as Facebook, twitter, Myspace, Blogger.com, Tumblr. and a great of others.
This menace of an individual called Mr. Johnson also came to pounding on our door on Monday, Nov. 18, 2012, at about 3:45. Since our building has strangers coming in and out of it, I always look out of my peep whole before opening the door. However, this inept individual named Mr. Johnson was covering his face with his hooded coat, pouncing the door with his fist and yelling his name in an angry way and he was also accompanied by a female whom didn't tell me her name. Due to my extremely serious health issues, I wasn't going to open the door. 
The Edenwald Management Office located at 1145 229th Drive North, Bronx NY 10466, phone number 718-882-6900, especially by the Housing Manager Mr. Edwin Rodriquez that continues to allow an uneducated, unprofessional and is misogynist, I say this because when my husband of 24 yrs. & 6 mos. and our 2 sons went to the Management Office in order to address this matter in an civilized manner; Mr. Johnson was extremely disrepectful to an elderly woman in a wheel chair and after he conducted himself as an animal this ignoramus totally ignored us. After waiting for more than an hour or more we left. The reason why I'm informing you about the going on at the Edenwald Management Office is because my family and I aren't the only tenants ongoings this type of abuse, we've had numerous residents ask what they should do; because Edenwald Management Office is constantly accusing them of not paying their rent, taking them to court and not carefully checking that their rent is PAID.
 
Is this the protocol of the NYC Housing Authority? Or is Mr. Rodriguez(Housing Manager) and Mr. Johnson(Housing Assist) abusing their power? With this I'm going to conclude, all through the past week we've had certified letters and found bogus court paper letters in our mailbox. Monday, Nov. 26, 2012 was the supposed court date; however the copy; because we NEVER received an original document stated that if we don't own housing any money disregard this letter. We feel that Edenwald Management Office has a personal vendetta against us because we're bringing attention to the schizo behavior that's going on at that office. 
 
Thank you for your time and cooperation, we hope & Pray that you find it in your hearts to come to the aid of not only my family; but the other silent tenants that don't wish to undergoing harassing tactics ... My husband and I have been calling your offices for more than a week; however the phones are ALWAYS busy ... We really need your organization's assistance! Can someone PLEASE get back to us RSAP? It will be greatly appreciated. Once again, here's our home phone number 347-427-1329 and our email too ... nancy.advincola@gmail.com									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										two years back, i hired a law firm, and was assigned to justin white, a junior lawyer there.  i filed a civil case.  he proceeded to do not a lot.  somewhere along the line, my pedophile uncle bought my lawyer.  a circus ensued.  .....and from that day on, my very tight criminal and civil case went to pieces.  i have paid about 12,000 thus far, and am still being billed for another almost 6,000.  the lawyer for the other side felt i had a good case.  but my lawyer justin white was hoping to make twice the money, by my own civil case and through the under the table purchasing by my uncle, james wilson cook jr.  of grand  haven michigan, also has a house in kalamazoo michigan, also keeps an address in nyc, also keeps property under his son's name, michael cook.  and probably a lot of others.   
i have documentation, film, everything that supported the criminal events and the civil lawsuit i filed.  but my uncle bought and paid for a new house for my lawyer, and bought the illegal manipulating of my case -- all of the above was through the for-hire services of a local ""political thug"" who is well known in this area and makes his entire living off of the actions of ferreting out secrets of the opponents and of manipulating no matter how illegally the end result of anything in this locale that you can imagine.  just pay david guidarini of 1060 new pear street enough money and you can have anything done ot your opponent, or your ex, or your neighbor, anything.  he is well known, well protected, and expensive.  my uncle has several million he inherited and retired from his government job in 2000.  buying the ""services"" of david guidarini or justin white or the woman leah togno who was part of the effort and was also well paid (she was overheard telling someone that she was paid 800 a month plus expenses and was given a house on 6 d'shibe street here in vineland as payment for her ""work"" and for keeping quiet.).  in addition, i hav esince acquired proof as word and proof in recordings and proof in email of my lawyer justin white breaching all manner of attorney client privilege and sharing many many things with the very persons i was suing.  as well as later allowing the other side to manage my evidence, depose me, and then he himself helped them to craft a pending potential or threatened ( i dont know what it is called) charge of pimping my then young teen daughters by allowing them to wear those workout/jogging.gym clothes style tops that are called ""sports bras"" inside the house in the kitchen on a 98 degree day with the curtains open to the back yard thereby enticing a strange man who was found videotaping my daughters..  the proof?  because i had video of HIM while i waited for the police.  justin white later fired me as a client claiming i was not cooperating with him.  no, i was not, and only a fool would have.  he also claimed i was not paying my bill.  but i have paid over 12.000 and still owe another 6000 and tha tis hardly NOT paying a bill.  he - justin white - was heard by another lawyer, vincent pancari, at a party telling every lawyer within earshot that i was a bad client, a liar, that i was trying to tap the system for free money, that any lawyer who would take me on after what ""he had been through"" would be just crazy, that i was crazy, that he gave me all the best legal advice in the world, that he had reached the settlement agreement o ftens of thousands of dollars and tha ti wa so greedy i refused to take it and demanded he ""get me more""......that i never paid him a penny (testa's accounting department will tell you otherwise)....oh god, it was awful.  i could not get a lwyer now in this town even if my life depended on it and i paid them triple.  yes, because of justin whites unfounded mouth.  he had ot cover up and protect what he was doing.  he was a new lawyer and he fell so fast and deep into corruption that i suppose he hoped that i was ""nobody"" - i am - and that it was ok, as long as he used his authority to refute any future attempts i might make to complain.   it is very convoluted, and much wrong was done in every way as well as emotionally, physically and reputation-wise in this little town to me and my daughters.  we never deserved it.  
through all of this, i have quietly continued to raise my now late-teen daughters and the severely autistic 6 year old daughter of my last marriage.  this is not a situation that developed suddenly, my uncle married my aunt and proceeded to, according to my mother, sexually assault me as a tot.  i do not remember.  but he was always hateful then to her.  i grew up with a safe distance from him, but my aunt was always blaming my mother for being ""mean"" to my aunt's ""hunny"".  and the same things that hav ebeen done to me, my husband, then my next one, my dad, my brothers, my daughters, and my son is the same as what was done at my mother and all involved when i was a child.  it is my wealthy socio and pedophile uncle.  he later accessed my daughters one day.  many many years later, after my mother, my grandfather, my grandmother, and my uncles father and then shortly later his father all met untimely unnatural ""accident"" deaths, where my uncle was always the last one to have any contact with the dead person, i wa sleft with virtually no family, and the same problems started happening to ME that had once been the bane of my mothers life.  the neighbors suddenly acting wierd, snooping in my windows, the flat tires, the shorted out new car batteries, husbands who suddenly claim a person close to the family who has known me since childhood assured them i was sleeping around and doing drugs and drinking (i do not) and causing those men to leave, leaving me alone with little girls....and out of hte blue comes my aunts husband waving the flag of money to help me.  all i had to do to stop all my troubles he said, over and over, was let him spend time with my little girls, so he could and i quote ""teach them how to be loved by a good man and so that they wont grow up afraid of big men who are kind to them.""  
then my grandmother begged me to come back up to michigan to be with her after she had been in the rest home for a good many years already (she was healthy and still drove and did her own shopping and cooking), as my uncle and aunt had secured some kind of legal claim and hold over my grandmother and they then used that legal thing to put her into a rest home  and allowed only 25 dollars a month and was in a rest home (NOT a nursing home)  for the next thirteen years.  while the aunt and uncle happily  spent her own millions left to her by my grandfather.  meanwhile, i did not then know all of this.  what i did know was that my own friends and husband in nc were taking a strange turn.  no matter what i did, they said i was doing all manner of impossible things otherwise.  i was left with no job, a landlord who accused me of ""being immoral"" and said she had a person ""close to the situation who knew""  that told her so she wanted me and my children out of there.  and my car was badly tampered with one night soon after that.  i had no where to go.  my aunt offered me ""help' if i came back up to michigan since my grandmother wanted me there anyway.  had i known then what i later realized, was that the pattern was not ""me a bad person"" but that of my uncle manipulating things to acquire opportunity to molest my little girls as he once did nto me, and i later heard from my aunt that he has been accused and in and out of many dismissed court cases of other poor, and single moms who claimed he molested their little girls.  my aunt called them golddiggers and was pleased thatteach time, her ""hunny"" was able to beat the charges and the (((REDACTED FOUL LANGUAGE))) didnt get a single dime for their lies.    but too late for me, i was back up there, with nothing in my favor, and every time i even made a friend, within a couple of weeks, that person would suddenly act strange or accuse me of being eveyrthing from a mobster to a slut to a druggie to a child abuser.  it was crazy, and i thought i was going crazy.  then one day, in the dead of winter, i had no hot water at my rental home again.  so my uncle wa ssuppsed to be out of town, and my aunt said i could bring the girls over to the house there and they could shower, and then i was going to take my grandmother  out to pizza hut for lunch.  my uncle came in from somewhere, whether outside or hiding in the house i dont know, and he locked himself in the bathroom where my daughters were - one was in the tub, one was on the toilet.  i was getting fresh towels from the dryer.  i heard them screaming and ran back, and the door was locked.  i heard nothing from him, but their screams and the locked door, i kicked the door in, and there he was in his goddam boxers and a tshirt, and laughing as he grabbed the one who was on the toilet and was reaching at the one in the tub who was dodging him.  i punched him and pushed him out, and he laughed and said that was the stupidest thing i had ever don eyet, and said at least i was ""more fun"" than my mothe r who always used to just cry and act like a victim.  dear god. i knew then, i knew so much tha ti had not relaized right then and htere.  and from that day on, james cook never even tried to hide the things he was doing to destroy me, not even a little bit.  no matter how insane his actions, he had and has the money and the sociopaths way of making it somehow believable to people around him and it is a living hell for me.  meanwhile, this lawyer justin white probably did more damage all by himself with his abuse o fhis license than even david guidarini and james cook together.  what can i do?  nothing.  i am no one.  i ma the poor, old, poverty stricken dumb woman who all these years refused to die by accident as every other member of my family has when they questions james wilson cook jr's behaviors or motives.  i am no one.  jus tthe dumb single mothe rwho refused to belive that i was ""crazy"", who refused to care anymore i fmy husbands were scared off, who refused to believe that i had to succumb to this sick man and hand over access to my daughters (and now of course, it iwll never end since i have a noverbal autistic 6 year old girl, god almighty, the irony of it), but not for any relief do i ever give in.  no matter WHAT he puts us through.  my dad knows. my son has witnessed enough.  we know it sounds paranoid, and james cook and yes, justin white, all get away with this, because they can hide behind the ""she is a paranoid woman alone who is frustrated by poverty and getting old and not having a man"" and on and on.  meet me, you will see that is not the case.  talk to my father in nc - he is terrified of james cook jr.  -  talk to my son - he is 30 years old in michigan with four kids o fhis own.  i wish you could ask the other women in my family, but they all died of unnatural causes.  accidents.  you do not suss out this uncle without some sort of reprisal.   find out how the actual home purchase occurred and how it was recommended to my lawyer justin white.  he will lie, and of course he iwll get away with it.  another lawyer whom i hired to assist me with another extremely illegitimate eviction (for about two years, the landlord here was assisting htis uncle, along with anthony cinotti of milmay nj....and i was subject to regular illegal and frivolous evictons that served no purpose except to harass and to cause me ot spend money), that other lawyer was bennett bardfeld.  a respected lawyer here.  and out of hte blue, he started doing things that were not right.  and out of the blue, as soon as he somehow mangled my court date for some other charge concerning rats and public health threats from the landlords property, i dont know, but i was not aware of a change of court date, and the lawyer bennet bardfeld i guess was aware, and he went in to court and told them he did not know where his client was so he was asking to be removed.  and a warrant for arrest for me wa sissued, for failure to appear for a date that had not even be set, near as anyone at the clerk knew, for a charge of ""feeding, harboring and entertaining wild rodents"" on the landlords proerty because she had a rat and squirrel problem here and somehow the city inspector, decided that the sewage leak in the basement pipe on the other tenants side was caused by me and that caused rats to want to come into the basement because the inspector ordered me to leave my side of the basement ope to the the outside for a period of weeks to ""dry out"" and then he ordered me to clean, disinfect, repair any mold damage and to ensure the health and safety of the other tenants and to repair and replace all faulty sewage piping in the building and to stop feeding, harboring and entertaining wild rodents in city limits and he ticketed me for this.  a ticket for a civil violation of the city code enforcement in this town is a thing tha tis to include a fee, and if you pay the fee, there is no court.  and no tenant can be charged by the city, only the landlord.  the landlord can then choose to sue the tenant.  whci is the oNLY thing the landlord never tried to evict me for.   i had already paid him three hundred .  again.  david guidarini literally bragged to my face when i confronted him tha ti could not do anything about any of this, ""sister - you better learn to play the game - even bennett is in my back pocket, haha, and my guy said do this dave, so i did this, and you better get used to it, this is the real world, sistahhh....hahahaha - see baby in this town and in this state, i am your biggest nightmare, so dont (((REDACTED FOUL LANGUAGE))) with me.""  
i have had cops come to the door,  and accuse me of writing email messages in hebrew and ordering me to stop because i am under a serious investigation concerning such behavior and they are just giving me a heads up.  that was officer cris scarpa. i have had pest control come to the door and order me to get the (((REDACTED FOUL LANGUAGE))) out of htis town because they dont like what they ""heard"" about me and my (((REDACTED FOUL LANGUAGE))) - jt pest control. ....i had a cop pull me over while i was stoppe dand my engine was off and i was on the cell phone outside the car at a tire airpump putting air in my tire at a gas station.  his excuse?  he wanted to know what i was doing.  he threatened me if i did not ""be careful"" while driving in his town.  the gas station owner was aghast.  the owner never ever called any police on me.  he tried to tell them, they told him leave it alone or....they said i was under investigation for ""things"", and they had a right to do whatever they wanted.  the name of that cop was warington.  two corrections officers from the south jersey state prison.  one was tomas togno.  the other was his buddy.  in full uniform.  with a stun or taze weapon or what appeared and was held LIKE a weapon, as they came ot my back basement door where my then 15 yr old daughter was down in the basement doing laundry.   they scared her half to death.  this is at the back of my house.  why?  driveways express.  came to my door, pounded on it, went over and examined the entire interior of my old car, then came back and cussed me out, ordered me ot move my car, said my landlord had sent him, but he didnt remember the landlords name.  i refused to unlock the door or come out.  he cussed me out and told my 15 yr old and 16 yr old daughters that their mother was a (((REDACTED FOUL LANGUAGE)))  i said what is the name of your company?  he said i did nto need ot know.  i yelled at him, he said it was driveways express and he was from kalamazoo michigan.  i later called that company and HE answered and he hung up on me every time.  as did the jt exterminator guy when i called that number when they were out here cussing me and my daughter.   there is the officer, sgt chris davis.  david guidarini is very verbal aroudn town about how chris davis is ""in his pocket"" and sgt davis came out one night and ordered me to make a statement, that i had to make a statement, oh -- anything at all that i thought i needed to tell him before they found something or another and came back to arrest me and leave my kids with the state to care for them.  he asked me for the name of my nearest ""responsible"" relative who could afford to take care of my pretty little girls.  there are more.  i have had each one of htese persons in court, and somewhere somehow it got dismissed.  by justin white,  justin said i had no right to bring those charges in , but the attornies justin white was the one, along with mike testa sr, who told me to do it in the first place.  they changed their minds later.  maybe after they were paid better, i dont know.  the situation goes on.  
does it sound crazy?  yes.  i know it is.  we have been livign it.  it has not stopped.  the uncle still has money is retired from his supervisor position at the muskegon social security office,  - he retired just after the estate was cleared after his mothers accidental death that year.  and all he has done since is harass me , because NO woman NONE shall keep their little girls from him, if he wants them, or they WILL pay a price.  he has not i dont think encountered one who simply will not give in or give up.  you can take everything from me and leave me in shreds, but my girls will never be handled again.  he more and more desperately wants the youngest as she is nonverbal and autistic, and he will no doubt be able to do anything with her and NO ONE would ever know.  how would they?  so if i cannot stop him, and apparently i cannot, then i will continue to advertise every scrap of information and events and names to every where that i can until there are nno more persons willing to do these ungodly things for james wilson cook jr's money.  if that is the only thing i can do, i will do it.  and justin white and bennett bardfeld and david guidarini and anthony cinotti and marie fisher and leah togno and tomas togno and mike testa sr and joan charlotte cook (who enabled and permitted her hunny all these years) -- these people all have the money, the ""community standing"", and the respect and the gift of glib lying, none of which i have, and i doubt i ever will.  this did not mean that htey were ""right"" by virtue of getting away with it.  this is a nightmare of a big huge james cook fantasy-sized 1-2-3 punch that was suppose dto be the ultimate.  or as david guidarini likes to say -- ""the kabash, and ripping a new asshole"", and such.   justin white loved to reiterate those vivid expressions with abandon too.  as if this were my preferred form of communication.  these are words i had heard too often from my uncle long before these men ever met him.  all i know is as a retired federal employee and a man with tons of money and community ""respect"" there is nothing i can do to him.  the lies and the damage to reputation and even my will to do more than get up each day and breathe has been too great.  but the other persons, and justin white, they can be made ot deal with their corruptions, their lies, their greed, their thievery, their utmost disregard for the lives and health and safety of these children of mine.  dear god.  that is why they needed me to move on out of here.  james cook KNEW if i stayed too long in one place, i would put it all together.  but this time, the very expensive ""kabash"" he tried to create around me here only made me hurt and confused and poor and alone.  i loved my husband.  but i will protect my children first.  i loved my friends.  but my children are first.  i had a sterling reputation.  but i will not sacrifice my children to preserve it.  i have no future, no real life.  but they DO.  and the littlest one iwll never get touched by that uncle, as her sisters were, whether or not anyone is ever able to do anything or whether or not anyone ever exposes the filth of justin whites behaviors or those others who helped james cook int his venture.  what a huge huge mess, all jsut to show ME that he WILL (((REDACTED FOUL LANGUAGE))) if he wants and NO ONE will get away with anything otherwise.  if it is true to form, it would not surprise me if i ma next on the list of women in the family to die of an accident.  not one in his family OR mine has died of natural causes or direct illness.  always an accident that occurs, sometimes in the course of an ""illness"" sort of....but as i have come ot expect, i will nto be hear din these matters either.  my word against his word, and my word against anyone he pays and PROTECTS will always be nothing.  but exercise great care with lawyers such as justin white.  they are easily bought, by YOUR enemy.  and hti sin spite of me having literally piles of real hard documentation, audio and visual, reports, transcripts.  dear god, justin white LET THE PERSON I WAS SUING DO THE TRANSCRIBING OF MY OWN VIDEO!!!  that was when i realized it was true, i was being played with in a manner so disgraceful i went home and cried for days.  dear god.  all these years, why me?  why mine?  because a pedophile who is rich and has ""connections"" and who lies with ease got away with everything he ever did????  so what ar ethese people going to do to me or mine that they have not done already?  really?  they could tell the truth.  do the right thing instead.  that would be amazing.  that would be the only thing not done yet.  my uncle could see abou tmy own death.  i am next.  my mother.  my grandfather.  his mother.  his father.  my grandmother.  not one was natural.  every one was accidents.  every time he was the last seen in the area.  and you think the justin white story of legal corruption i just wrote is too crazy to believe?  live the nightmare, that we have lived.  this will be the easiest part to understand.  the rest of our lives because of the man who paid justin white and all those others -- that is what is hard to believe.  									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										Walter Zornes is either lazy or extremely unorganized. I plead guilty to a traffic ticket (without a laywer) and then got a letter from DMV claiming I went over my points allowance and they were suspending my lisence. At this time I hired Mr. Zornes to reopen the case and get it plead down to something without points. Which we did, we went to court and I paid him after and said ""is there anything I have to do?"" he said everything was good. A week later I got pulled over and arrested for driving without a license. 
When I approached Mr Zornes to find out what happened, he didn't have an answer and was talking about more money to now fight the driving without a license ticket. I later found out that Mr Zornes never sent out the paper work to DMV. The courts and my next lawyer both said all he had to do was mail some paperwork, but Mr. Zornes wouldnt admit he did anything wrong.
 I basically paid Walter just to get me in a worst position. I hired a different laywer after this. I would not recommend Zornes to anyone! He doesn't care about anything except your money... Doesn't care what happens to you. 									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

By Gregory KarpPosted March 2 at 3:56 p.m. A Chicago-based debt-settlement company used lawyers as a front to illegally collect massive fees from financially struggling consumers who were seeking help, Attorney General Lisa Madigan alleged Wednesday.Madigan filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the national firm Legal Helpers Debt Resolution, based at 233 S. Wacker Drive in Chicago.The company, also known as the law firm Macey, Aleman, Hyslip & Searns, charged upfront fees for debt-consolidation services, which became illegal in Illinois last year, the suit alleges. The Debt Settlement Consumer Protection Act forbids debt-settlement companies from charging upfront fees and requires they only collect fees if a consumers debt is actually settled.Attorneys are exempted from the law, allowing them to charge upfront fees.Legal Helpers illegally charged fees upfront under a guise that attorneys were providing the debt-settlement service to consumers, according to the suit. Madigan said attorneys with Legal Helpers served only as a front to the business  that the actual debt-settlement service was contracted out to non-lawyer, third-party companies.They are essentially a referral source for a scavenger industry seeking to profit from peoples debt problems, Madigan said.The firm charges non-refundable fees that include a $500 retainer, $49 monthly charge and 15 percent of the total debt, according to the lawsuit.While the firm promised to make its customers debt free, it never lowered the debt and  often left them worse off financially, the attorney general said.Jason Searns, general counsel and managing partner with the Legal Helpers, said Wednesday his firm has done nothing wrong and is simply providing an alternative for clients who dont want to declare bankruptcy.Were a bona fide law firm providing legal services, he said. Our attorneys review every clients file to determine whats appropriate for them.Searns said Legal Helpers has a different business model than firms that simply rent a lawyer so they can take advantage of the upfront-fee exemption. His firm provides legal counsel to clients and has a strategic alliance with debt-settlement firms to provide debt-management services.
Its all under our supervision and our auditing control, Searns said. When the facts come out, it will show were perfectly fine in what were doing with our clients.Legal Helpers has a C-minus rating with the Better Business Bureau.

Law -""Chicago Debt-settlement firm to wind down business"" Ameet Sachdev's Chicago Law today has a long Chicago Tribune story headed ""Debt-settlement firm to wind down business: Companies taking advantage of exception for lawyers who provide debt counseling.""

Legal Helpers Debt Resolution LLC agreed to refund $2.1 million to its Illinois customers under a settlement announced this month after the attorney general had alleged the company was not living up to its name. Rather than providing legal help, the lawyers were a ""front"" to collect hefty fees from struggling consumers, Madigan said.Legal Helpers denied wrongdoing but also agreed to stop accepting more Illinois clients under the settlement.Jason Searns, the firm's general counsel, said publicity surrounding the lawsuit and settlement has made it hard for Legal Helpers to attract new customers outside Illinois, and the decision was made to cease operations after servicing its existing clients.

Sexual Harrassment and Sexual Assualt with the players at Macey & Legal Helpers
Sara Mobley v. Legal Helpers Debt Resolution
In this case which was moved to Federal Court on September 23, 2011, Mobley files suit against Legal Helpers Debt Resolution, Macy, Aleman, Hyslip & Searns and Jeffry Hyslip.

This is not the typical LHDR case. Here we have an case involving allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault. Mobley was an LHDR employee.

The complaint states Sara Mobley began working for Legal Helpers Debt Resolution and Macey, Aleman, Hyslip & Searns in December 2009. Mobley adequately performed her job and in August 2010 Ms. Mobley was sexually harassed by Defendant Jeffrey Hyslip and states that she was subsequently sexually harassed and sexually assaulted by Mark Mancino, and LHDR affiliate.

Mobley allegedly complained to supervisors and she was told she was a big girl and should handle the situation herself.
In addition, Ms. Mobley expressed concerns regarding the criminal activities of some LHDR partners and affiliates, resulting in further retaliation.

When Mobley was hired she was told she would earn approximately $30,000 a month. So Im assuming use must have been a sales representative.
In August 2010, Mobley traveled to Chicago to attend a debt settlement conference at the direction of LHDR. It is at that conference, or more specifically at the hotel bar, where Sara says Jeffrey Hyslip made aggressive sexual advances towards her. Mobley states Hyslip asked her what he could get for $500 or $1,000.

The complaint says Defendant Hyslip advised Ms. Mobley that she should add some worth to the firm and then grabbed her upper thigh, causing a bruise, and tol her that he wanted to f*k her ever since he had seen her that morning.
Later the same evening, Mark Mancino allegedly informed her that she was dangerous and that business and pleasure should not mix but that because they were going to work together for a long time, they were definitely going to mix pleasure into their business relationship.
The complaint states:

Mr. Mancino stated that he was going to bend [Ms. Mobley] over and f*k [her] right there. When Ms. Mobley rejected those advances, Mr. Mancino dragged her across the bar by the upper arm to the entrance of an employees only closet. Mr. Mancinos sexual assault of Ms. Mobley was interrupted by a hotel employee who saw what was happening and intervened. Mr. Mancinos tight grip on Ms. Mobleys upper arm while he dragged her across the room caused a large bruise around her arm.When Ms. Mobley returned to her office, she reported both of these incidents of unwanted sexual advances to Jason Searns, LHDRs General Counsel and Senior Partner.
Mobley states she email Searns and explained Mr. Hyslips sexual harassment and assault and Mr. Mancinos sexual harassment and sexual assault. Mr. Searns responded by email the same day and stated, I realize Mancino is a hound when he drinks, but you are a big girl. You either play it like one of the boys and ignore then, or tell them what they say or attempt to do is inappropriate.
The complaint says Mobley subsequently emailed Searns photos of the bruises and received an email that said, [a]s a woman, you always have the power to decide what is acceptable. Even if Jeffrey [Hyslip] or Mancino were intoxicated, as Im sure they were, you should contact them privately regarding their behavior and let them know what will happen if the behavior is repeated EVER.
During Ms. Mobleys employment at LHDR and MAHS, she became aware of the criminal associations of some of the people closely associated with, if not employed by, LHDR and MAHS, namely their prior mortgage fraud convictions and ties with organized crime families.  SourceMark Mancino is also named in another Legal Helpers Debt Resolution suit I wrote about recently. In this case Mancino and John Lembo were part of an alleged conspiracy to take income away from another LHDR affiliate, Safeguard, and direct that income to their own company, Nationwide Referral Services aka National Legal Referral Service. You can read more about Mark Mancino here.

										Was contacted by mail from litigation law group to modify my mortgage in Aug 2012. Called to find out more info, was told that i did not have to put any money up front to be approved for the modification. Of course i was approved.......so after a couple of days i was contacted and was told that i had to pay $3500.00 to go ahead and submit my file to my lender. Now again i was told i qualified for the modification......once i paid the money they would never return calls,until they needed me to sign a contract. when i finally would get a hold of some one i was told that some one else was working on my case blah blahblah. So i got the run around. so finally after i went on my own(october- 2 months later) and called my lender to find out if litigation law group actually submitted any files he told me that they did submit some files but not all to complete the file. so again i had to try and get a hold of some body to find out what was going on.  When i actually get a hold of someone i had to fax more of the ""same"" info in to try and get this going. In December I then started to contact my lender directly and come to find out that i was denied my modification! why do you ask, well I bought my house in April 2009.......one doesn't qualify for a modification if you bought your house after January 2009! I brout this to litigation law groups attention and demanded a refund! was told that i would only get 500 bucks back because i went through ""step 2"" what ever that is.....

										We are an Elderly adult day health care center who were victimized when we hired Harry Nelson of Fenton Nelson LLP, a law firm who falsely misrepresented his experience  causing extensive damage to us.
In the initial meeting between Harry Nelson and us, Harry Nelson advised us to set up a preliminary meeting with the state representatives in Sacramento. He assured us that is what would be required to have our issue resolved. He also said that we have the most defendable case he ever had and he falsely represented that he has extensive experience in dealing with our specific problem. In actuality he had zero experience in dealing with that specific problem.
We hired Harry  Nelson for $5,000.00 to represent us at the preliminary meeting with the state representatives. He assured us that is what it would cost to accomplish our goal and we would have further discussion if any additional work and fees would be required.
At the meeting with the state, Harry Nelson was not prepared, completely  misrepresented us by not having the right facts or names, and acted unprofessionally by arguing with the state doctor presenting the wrong facts. Our issues were not resolved at this meeting. 
This misrepresentation caused us to close down resulting in disastrous financial consequences in over a million dollars.
After that we fired Harry Nelson and hired a consultant who informed us that all the things that Harry Nelson had done were incorrect and that the meeting was not even necessary and the discussion with the state could taken place over the phone. With the advice of the consultant all the original problems as well as the additional problems that Harry Nelson caused which were much more extensive that the original problem were resolved.
The consultant informed us that the additional problems that Harry Nelson caused when he began arguing with the State representative would only lead to a stale mate. The consultant also had informed us that if Harry Nelson had the experience he claimed he had, Harry Nelson would have known that he shouldve tried to reach a settlement agreement as opposed to arguing the issue with the state which just wasted time and money.
As a direct result of Harry Nelsons misrepresentations and the subsequent financial hardship that we endured, we were not in a position to defend ourselves from Harry Nelsons law suit against us for an additional fee resulting from nowhere.
It is our strong belief that it is unethical for an attorney to be allowed to misrepresent their expertise and cause such extensive damage to their client. 
It is also unethical for an attorney to charge fees for a service which was never rendered.
His lack of expertise is still costing to this very day and some sort of compensation is in order, the lease of which is a judgment of $10,622.51 not only that but punitive measures for Harry Nelsons actions.",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										We are extremely disappointed in your firms inability to meet minimal expectations and your hands off approach to dealing with even the most toxic of situations regarding our case and from the members of your firm.  
We believe that if Mr. Mann would have taken a more hands on approach to our case, instead of just our payments, we would not be in this position we are in today. Were in a terrible, volatile situation and utter disarray, due to the lack of care and handling of our case and severe, corrosive immediate breakdown of communication regarding minimal facets of this urgent matter. The service has been beyond embarrassing, poor and entirely unacceptable by any means. 
Simple task such as returning a phone call, answering basic questions via email, supplying correct court appearance times and dates, omitting necessary documentation for the clients discovery process, a proper introduction to the associate attorney that would be representing, more than 1 line sentences from a blackberry to address our sincere concerns, a timely reply to our emails if any at all, respecting the time of the client and the court by at least appearing on time to a hearing, an invoice or description of services rendered, became non-existent. Please know that we did take the requested routes of contact per your policy, but after a week of unanswered emails and a rapidly approaching uncertain court date, we needed answers quickly.
It seems from the very beginning we have had to pry repeatedly to get any kind of update or status regarding our case. Please know that for the bulk of the time in which we employed your services, we were made unaware of the most CRUCIAL AND CRITICAL details until the end. 
Mr. Mann, we trusted you and your team to handle this crisis. You assured us, you were confident in handling our case and we trusted you. This may be true for you, but clearly not of your staff, with the exception of Nicole. After your assurance, we didnt hear from you again. I personally believe that you are a competent attorney and confident that YOU couldve easily handled this case, however, with the exception of 1 individual in your employ, your staff and associate attorney are beyond unprofessional. 
Throughout this entire experience we are still unsure to who would be our actual point of contact with your firm. We just know that you arent. 
Please try to imagine my absolute embarrassment when our representing attorney was over an hour late. Our hearing time was promptly at 9AM; we were notified between 8:45-8:50 that she would be 20 minutes late. She arrived at 10:05AM. Please see court records for proof. The judge was absolutely perturbed, shocked and furious as well as my ex-wifes attorney, W. XXXX Jr., who was actually more helpful to me regarding my case than anyone at your firm, including you, has ever been in the history of our relationship. The judge also gave an extreme voice of concern and assistance for me, as Ms. Dara Percely remained quiet- only voicing concerns for her injured finger. Ms. Dara Percely for the most part, said NOTHING. I, Attorney W. XXXX Jr. and the judge, spoke more on my behalf than my own attorney, while my attorney stood blankly by my side. 
Please keep in mind; I wasnt notified of my mandatory appearance by your staff until 12-14 hours before the time I was to appear in front of the judge.  Due to the fact that we live over 250 miles away, this was extremely stressful to arrange approved time off from work, lodging arrangements, pet and child care, adding extra unnecessary, unexpected expenses. 
My wife attempted to pose one question to Ms. Dara Percely the day before court. She simply wanted to know who would be our main point of contact at your firm since we have now dealt with 4 separate individuals. Before she could even complete her question Ms. Dara Percely immediately interjected defensively and rudely stating that your firm deals with multiple clients and that as much as she would like to sit here all night and talk its 6:30PM and she has to go. Ms. Dara Percelys defensive rant went on for 20 minutes. She never answered my wifes question. Whats so appalling about this, is given the chance in court for explanation, she didnt say anything- not one word for my benefit or welfare, but to clients or those I believe she thinks she can easily intimidate, she makes it a point to be outright defensive, rude, discourteous, stand-offish and cold when questions are asked, then smile and extend her hand for a handshake in person. We signed documents stating that we would remain courteous and not speak unkindly to any member of your staff. I did so once, and I immediately apologized, Ms. Percely absolutely belittled and spoke abrasively to my wife less than 12 hours before this meeting and made NO genuine apology to her. We were beyond disgusted as Ms. Dara Percely scurried quickly away to the lower level of the courthouse to send text messages.
At this point, immediately following the silent commentary of Attorney Ms. Dara Percely, we sincerely wished that Nicole was our attorney and not merely a paralegals assistant. At least Nicole, if nothing else, remained genuine and consistent. Unfortunately, I was not made aware of Nicoles activity regarding our case until less than 4 days before we were to appear. Her information delivery may have been inaccurate, but at least she made an effort to help, return calls, etc., but obviously too late. 
Mr. Mann, we would sincerely like to seek counsel from another attorney with this matter. I ask that YOU PLEASE DO NOT CANCEL OUR MEDIATION DATE AND PLEASE DO NOT DESTROY, NOR MISPLACE ANY OF MY CURRENT FILES OR RECORDS YOU MAY HAVE REGARDING MY CASE. I will be retaining new legal counsel that will be in need of all case files and any other documentation not communicated to me. 
There were only 2 occurrences where work was actually being performed on our case to our knowledge, once when you verbally berated your staff during the first 2 weeks of acquiring your services, due to them not properly delivering my documentation to you and the last 4 days prior to going to our embarrassing hearing as my wife was in correspondence with Nicole. I would like to believe I am a fair and just man, with ethics and values, but at no time, should a client ever be treated in the manner that my wife and I have had to suffer under your firms inability to meet minimal expectations. 
Im not sure exactly how much information was delivered to you or its accuracy of delivery. I am sure you were made aware of the results and the handlings of my case; however, I am not sure that you were made aware in this much detail of how poorly it was handled. 
Understandably, you may be in question of my explanations of the prior events that have transpired and may even believe that I am attempting to embellish my statements. For this reason and for your records, I am requesting a statement from the presiding HON. BRENDA XXXX and Attorney XXX Moore Jr., both of which aided me on the day of my hearing when your associate attorney could and would not; also a brief statement from a third party, non-biased attorney regarding the level of professionalism and handling of a similar situation.  Again, Id like to reiterate, that I do believe you are a good attorney, but I want to make sure you are fully aware of the inner workings and breakdowns within your firm, not only from my point of view, but from the views of your peers. 
I am requesting at this time, as you are also a man of ethics and values, that you find just cause to refund me a significant portion of the total monies that I have paid until this point, $1,950									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

										We contacted USPassportNow.com to get an expedited passport for my son.  His passport needed to be expedited because he was on a college graduation cruise in late June/early July and by the time he returned from that trip we had very little time to process his passport paperwork which was needed for an August 4th trip.
My son call once and I called twice to speak to ""our"" adviser to go thru the checklist and make sure we had all items and paperwork in order and completed correctly.  
We were told to take our August trip itinerary and forms and take them to the US Post Office because only the post office could legally seal the documents.  We had to wait 2 weeks for a post office appointment.
Once at the post office the postal officer told us that she could not process these documents because our August trip itinerary needed to be dated two weeks from the date of our visit to the post office.  So we would have had to wait another two weeks for an appointment and falsify our travel itineray dates for August.  We then just completed the necessary documents at the Post Office and the USPS processed our expedited passport and mailed that day.
When I called USPassportNow.com to ask for a refund and explain that we been give the wrong information and instructions after calling 3 times to make sure all was correct.  They told me they would not be able to process a refund.  They said we should have gone home and made another appointment with the post office and falsify our trip itinerary to state we were leaving exactly 2 weeks after our USPS appointment in order to have the documents officially sealed.  Net:  Our appointment at the USPS was on 7/2.  Our August Trip itinerary needed to state we were leaving on 7/16 in order for the USPS to officially seal these documents on 7/2.  Our itinerary was dated 8/4, the actual date of our trip.  We had no time to wait for two more weeks nor did we want to falsify our itinerary.
We called several times for two refunds since USPassportNow.com did nothing for us.  No matter where you pound out on their recording we got to the same person.  Who would not help us nor let us speak to a supervisor.

										we have filed a Florida Bar complaint against Jeffrey Hap- lawyer in Jupiter Florida.I will summarize what is in the complaint,  it is 23 pages including signed fraud docments by HAP, here is some of the highlights included in the Bar  Complaint report
1. during a bitter divorce procedure, and after HAP must admit that the pre-nup is real (costing thousands$$$$$)  he now sets up a conspiracy with my future ex-wife to put me in an unfavorable light with the judge2. HAP drafts a fraudulant document about my son driving after him ""DANGEROUSLY CLOSE, SHOUTING AND MAKING OBSCENE HAND GESTURES"", this is on a Thursday3. he makes two almost two indentical copies4. Monday he calls my ex-wife to have her sign the conspiracy document, and explains to her that this will help the case,  he is an officier of the court so the judge will believe it5. they also file a police report 4 days later, explaining they   are in fear, it takes 4 days, why they did not file right after the incident they said happened is odd, but again it adds to HAPs plan6. Hap signs the fraudulant document ""UNDER PENALITIES OF PERJURY""7. it is submitted to the divorce judge who reads it and explains to Attorney Hap that he turned it into the wrong court, and to file it in another court.8. Hap never files the document, the belief is that he accomplished his goal, BIAS my judge.9. they also ask the judge to have me confined (arrested) based on this document, again the judge refuses, but now she in aware and most likely believing HAP, why would an officier of the court submit such a fraud.  10. Hap did not know we requested the courthouse surveillance video of that day, which clearly show the cars leaving the parking lot.   (yes we got him)11.Hap did not also know that after they left the courthouse a deputy stood with my son and 3 others for over 15 minutes (we included the deputy statement in the bar complaint)12. we have Hap on several different lies and criminal perjury13. however, it does not stop there14. Hap reviewed my ex-wifes financial statement in court,  AND he personally signed her live-in boyfriends15. he should have seen that both reported that they paid rent for the same home, again, he modified the law to suit his goal16. HAP later in the case drops the boyfriend because he says ""NO MONEY""
because HAP has committed perjury, emortionally and  financially damaged me, tried to have me arrested based on the fradulant document we have asked the Florida bar to
1. DISBAR HIM
2. REIMBURSE ME FOR MY FIANCIAL LOSSES
3. REFER THIS CASE TO THE STATE ATTORNEY SO THEY CAN PROSECUTE HIM FOR PERJURY

										We hired James D. Keegan law firm in 2009 for a loan modification for our property , they started charging us $ 600.00 a month for their services and delayed the process with the courts for more then 2 years all this time we were paying the $600.00 plus court fees every time we would go to court and the attorney will ask the judge for an extension to our case during all this time Mr Keegan and his staff including attorney Alfonso Juarez assured us that everything was well and the process was moving along fine, we trusted his professional opinion and kept paying for their services. The deed to the property was in my name ,my wife and her sister. When we began the loan modification my sister in law had outstanding credit and we applied under her name, my sister in law died in 2011 after suffering a stroke and she did leave a will, the bank began to claim that they will not deal with us since we were not on the loan. Mr Keegan as well as Mr. Juarez never informed us of a motion tx hat could had been filed with the court called a Probate that will assign all her debt over to her closest relatives in this case her sister and the bank would had been obligated by law to deal with me and my wife. The bank did put up an ad searching for living relatives thru the publication Daily Business Review a publication that all attorneys receive weekly. This ad was supposed to be answer within 30 days so the proceedings could continue. The attorneys never answered to this ad and thus by default the bank went to the Judge and said that that my sister law did not have any relatives. The judge laid final judgment and we lost our property. For three years Mr. Keegan and Mr. Juarez  assured us that they will work out a deal with the bank and we will be able to keep our house of 15 years. A week before our court appearance before the judge we receive a call from Mr. Juarez telling us that we were going to lose our case and told us not to go to court because if we went to court the judge will have ordered us to vacate our house in 30 days and if we did not go to court the bank will give us 3 months to vacate the house. We reluctantly agreed to this since we have over 15 years of history and many things that make it impossible to move within 30 days. Now we have contacted other attorneys that have reviewed the case and have pointed out the mistakes that Mr Keegan and Mr Juarez did in our case, they also believe that they might have worked a deal with the bank for their own profit. So the final judgment is that they took over twenty one thousand dollars from us plus we lost our house because of their incompetence. Now we have no money and no home.

										We were forced to file a formal complaint against Greg Showers with the Florida Bar Association, which is currently under investigation. We may pursue a criminal complaint once we receive the findings from the Fl. Bar Ass'n. 
In my professional opinion you couldn't have a worse attorney represent you than Greg Showers. This man is everything that gave lawyers a bad reputation. As an individual, he has ZERO INTEGRITY, and is a spineless coward in the courtroom, and in person. He accomplished absolutely no legal defense for our fees. Obtaining the truth about anything from this man is nearly impossible. Lying is his first language.   
He was retained for several thousand dollars to represent my husband on a false accusation from a tenant who was being evicted. Mr.Showers bungled every issue with this case starting with his fee agreement. He began by giving us an agreement with another party's name on it and requested we sign it. Most of his filings were rejected by the court as incorrectly prepared. Greg Showers lied to both myself and my husband about almost everything we discussed. He missed court appearances, failed to provide any legal defense, and backed out minutes before the trial, leaving my husband to plead guilty or represent himself in his own trial after paying thousands of dollars.  
Hard To Believe, but this idiot tried to withdraw from the court case literally 5 minutes before trial, in an attempt to force a guilty plea from my husband. He lied to us, stating he and the judge agreed he could withdraw. This was a lie. The judge refused his lame unethical attempt. The judge later confirmed on the record that Greg Showers was lying.... What a low life. 
This unethical stunt was the last straw for us.  He literally forced our formal complaint with the Florida Bar to have his license to practice law revoked. This man should not be licensed to practice law. CONSUMERS BEWARE. If you hire this man to represent you legally, expect the worst. He will undoubtedly ruin your case, and turn a minor situation into the worst possible scenario. Be Forewarned!

I had to ask him several times to make phone calls or get things done. It seemed that the only time I found out any info was when he showed up for court.  He told me that he would get me out of several things and didn't. He also said many things and absolutely did not follow through with them when it came down to it.

Whatever was said by the prosecuting attorney, he went along with. This was a waste of money! He knew that I was good for my money and took full advantage of it.

										When I arrived at Cordell and Cordell I had already filed for divorce and also had my ex served. I was assured by my first lawyer Daniel Lambert that my case did not sound complicated given there was no property to divide and the only issue was support and placement. I was told my case would not exceed a few thousand dollars. From that point on I was raped by this lawyer on a regular basis. He assigned numerous legal aids to my case along with his fee and they ran through 3,000 in two weeks and we hadent even gone to court yet. At the point I hired Cordell my first court date had already happened. After a botched contempt of court charge my lawyer tried to bring to my ex I was almost 8,000 in the whole. After complaining to them about the ridiculous amount of money they were costing I threatened to leave and god I wish I did but they talked me into staying and gave me a new lawyer. I  made it clear to this lawyer Trisha Festerling I was running out of money and could not take the financial raping my first lawyer did to me. She reassured me she would not and gave me the impression she cared about my case. This was all a ploy as she went on to drain me of another 10,000 and the second I ran out of money she threatened me with a law suit and dropped me as a client. Not to mention the sub par job she did in my case where any other lawyer would have probably gotten me full placement and custody given the details involved. So this is Cordell and Cordell. If you do not have a lot of money they assign a sub par lawyer and a host of legal aids that will drain you of every penny you have and than dump you like you are a bum. My case is costing me over 20,000 and for what.

										When I decided to buy a Palm Tungsten E PDA the other day, I decided to buy it at Radio Shack, for I was told by the sales-droid that there was a $25 rebate on the Tungsten E.  Sure enough, right on their computerized receipt is the notation ""$25 MIR [Mail In Rebate] PDAS"", so I figure all is well.  I'm filing today when I notice that there is a notation that ""Qualifying PDA SKU's"" must be one of the following... one of which is NOT my Tungsten E. 
Alright, must be an oversight.  I call the store that I bought it from, they puzzle over the unlisted SKU, and tell me to call the 800 number (actually, it's an 888 number).  I do, the fellow that eventually answers (who is very nice, by the way) doesn't have any information about the rebate offer I have; asked to hold on, I do and he disappears for a bit.  He comes back to tell me that there's NO REBATE on this PDA for which I WAS PROMISED A REBATE.
Rebates really are a scam and a ripoff -- what do they think we are, stupid?  I'm going to try and return the Tungsten E tomorrow; if I don't get my money back, well, I used my credit card for a reason.

										When I filed my bankruptcy paperwork with the Merrillville offices of Peter Francis Geraci I told my attorney Mr. Higgenson that I had a pending law suit filed.  I gave him the paperwork from the then holder of that account.  He said that he would take care of it.  And, they indeed were notified of the pending bankruptcy.
An attorney at the time who worked for the firm that was taking me to court, J. Brian Steele, left that firm and took my file with him.  Subsequently he went to court even though his former employer had been informed of my bankruptcy.  They were awarded judgement against me and a lien placed on my home.
I didn't find out about the lien until I tried to sell my home some 5-6 years later.  At which time I tried to get the lien removed.  I provided copies of my bankruptcy paperwork but was informed that Mr. Higgenson did not file the proper paperwork in my bankruptcy to keep this from happening.  I even went to the trouble of taking my bankruptcy paperwork to the Porter County courthouse to present to the judge.  At which time he withdrew the judgement with prejudice.  This however did nothing to lift the lien against my property.
I contacted the law office in Merrillville of Mr. Geraci to talk to Attorney Higgenson.  I was told that he no longer worked there.  So I tried first to find where he went.  I was unable to find him, so I talked to the office manager and explained my problem to him.  After several calls he informed me that the proper paperwork had not been filed on my behalf and the only way to resolve the issue was to re-open my bankruptcy at additional costs.  
I feel that this was not my fault and that I provided the correct information for this not to happen.  After explaining this to the office manager, he stopped returning my calls.  I have been ripped off and my credit rating is suffering for it.  Not to mention that I am rapidly approaching retirement age and am unable to sell my home.  Or refinance it at this time because of the adverse effects of Mr. Geraci's inept attorney.

										When the FBI finally takes this guy down your case will crumble also and you will also be investigated. This is how he works: 1. Lesmez gives kick backs to tow truck drivers, body shops, restraunt owners, you name it, for car accident cases. 2. When your case settles, Lesmez has the insurance company write two checks, one he shows you and one he deposits on his own. Lesmez deflects suspicion by creating conflict between his clients and the other parties involved (the other driver, doctors, body shop, etc) and he becomes the hero by beating the crap out of these people and pretending to be on your side. But I can tell you right now, Lezmez is pocketing a huge chunk or your money. In the end, you are going to thank him and even refer him business, LOL. All his clients do, and everyone in the office laughs about it. Lezmez is a pro. 
He also pays YELP big money to keep bad reviews away.

										When I first came to their office ,Robert Eckley said that my case was easy to win because I took pictures and I properly documented everything in my case . I wanted to sue my landlord for negligence and inattention to the big sewer backup we experienced in a house we were renting. He said"" They are toast"". I paid the retainer deposit they requested but they assigned a less experienced lawyer to my case. The landlord gave us an offer but the offer was just the return of the deposit and they did not want to reimburse us with the hotel and lodging expenses we incurred for a month of being displaced. This younger, inexperienced lawyer wrote me a long narrative discouraging me on filing a lawsuit. He said he will negotiate. We disagreed on everything and he got stuck with the star rating of the hotel which I purchased from Priceline paying a 2 star cost for a 4 star cost. I told him the star rating is immaterial right then and to just go and give them a counter offer. Before we could finish our counter offer, the  law firm slapped with  an additional $4,000 on top of the $2,000 I already paid them. He said that the settlement we may get may be less than what I may have to pay them. That does not make sense. We hired a lawyer to get reimbursement and see some kind of justice. Why would I go ahead with something where I will end up spending more money on their legal fees than the money I will get back? And to top it all, this young attorney said that if I am not happy with a counter offer,then we could file a lawsuit which would cost me anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 and that they needed the $10,000 before they file. This $10,000  is on top of the $2,000 I paid and the additional $4,000 they wanted just by arguing about the star rating and small petty things we could not agree on. This is a delaying tactic and they did it to run charges like a taxi meter. I wanted $20,000 reimbursed for our expenses which are supported with documents and receipts but he said he could not do guarantee it and made me lose my confidence in getting us what we deserve . The younger lawyer was inexperienced and is unbecoming of a professional. I am a professional myself and I will file a complaint with the Bar.

										Yesterday I received a call from this company with a return number to call that had a recording that stated something that would tell the consumer they were a credit repair company.  I thought this was just a random call but they used my birth name that I have not used for YEARS.  So silly me called them back to ask them to remove me from their call list.  I do not know how they were able to get my phone number anyway as it is new and not listed in my name and is a cell number.  Weird.  When I eventually spoke to someone I find out it is a Law Firm calling to collect a debt from me under my birth name, again that I have not used for years.  They insisted that it was me and after I requested that they communicate with me in writing the next day I recieved a letter stating that their firm was retained to collect a debt owed by me to a company that was the purchaser of a debt from another company.  None of which I know anything about.  After reading these posts I am concerned.  I am sending the good ole DV letter but as we all know a DV letter really means nothing.  They are suppose to prove the debt belongs to me but we all know how that goes and it sounds like this company has done some very scary and fraudulent things.  So I am wanting to arm myself with information & knowledge as I deal with them.  I will expect to be treated inhumanly and I need to know how to fight them back from those of you who may have some information to share with me.  I live in Oregon and I see they are not licensed in Oregon as a Collection Agency and from what I read are not required to be since they are attorney's licensed in Oregon, Washington and Utah. They are found on the Oregon State Bar and state they are a debt collection law firm for companies in Oregon, Washington and Utah.I know this is not my debt however I do not have any proof or information other than my word and I will be damned if I pay something that is not mine.  They turn it around and want proof from me like documentation.  Well how the heck can I have documentation on a debt that I don't know anything about? If you have any information or recommendations to share please let me know, it appears I can use all the help I can get to deal with this company.  It's just beginning isn't it? 									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

RE: Bank of America Federal Home Re-Modification Loan
Dear Mr. Janian:
This letter is regarding the retainment of your services, beginning  in, 2010. 
During this period, up through  2011, your employees did not keep in touch, return calls, updating me regarding the
Federal Home Re-Modification Loan from Bank of America, the servicer of my loan.  
In fact, March,2011, I called and spoke directly to Sarah Heil, who works in the loan department.  Within that call, I found out that your employee(s) spoke to her ONE TIME IN THE ENTIRE PERIOD YOU WERE RETAINED.  She stated she left numerous messages and never received a call/fax/email in return. In March, 2011, my re-modification loan was terminated due to lack of information on YOUR PART.
No calls returned 
Did NOT have a working relationship w/B of A employee, Sarah Hale AS INFORMED
Only had ONE conversation with Sarah Hile during entire period
Continual statements about not receiving documentation
Continual requesting documentation every few weeks
Suspicious persons contact and calling
Continual changes in parties taking over case
Are ANY of THESE EMPLOYEES STILL EMPLOYED WITH YOUR COMPANY?  I ask, because, every few months, suddenly each disappeared.   I believe they are fraudulent as well.    I firmly believe you and your company are simply con artists disgusted as doinglegitimate business with desperate homeowners.2 During several conversations, my wife and I made it perfectly clear we wanted Mr.Janian, who, apparently is the head of your offices in Los Angeles County callus back.  Neither I, nor my wife ever received a call back to discuss our situation. 
Our file apparently was transferred to many people and our personalpaperwork was lost or couldnt find it was the habitual answer when we asked where the initial paperwork was. 
You LOST my social security number? 
You LOST my paycheck stubs  my private information THAT MANY TIMES?
You have now made my loan payments $28,000 in arrears. 
You continually advised me NOT TO MAKE ANY PAYMENTS because, if we did, quote,  it would look (to Bank of America) like we had the money to make the payments.   YOU cost me thousands of dollars, have now allowed my mortgage to be promoted up nearly $400 MORE a MONTH!  You did NOT assist me in a re-modification loan  rather something costing me more now than I can afford.   
You were entrusted in providing a service that you did not. 
You have now been caught lying while taking total advantage of a family that was barely making their payments  in fact you took money literally out of the mouths of our family:  the gas that heated our house, the needs of a family with a special needs child.
Due to your unscrupulous behaviors, I am demanding all our money be refunded immediately.  And, because you DID NOT
perform your job, I am expecting the additional sum of $10,000.  for all (of) the time you lied to us, lied to our lien holder, and stalling the re-modification process. Consider this a drop in the bucket, considering what you have cost us financially, as well as emotionally. We all but lost our home due to your neglect, intentional deceit as well as not returning our calls immediately, after you have had all our money.  
If not, we are confident of a positive win in a court against you, your company and employees for such neglect.  I have
already spoken with our lien holder on many occasions and can assure you that ONLY ONE TIME did your employee, Candace, ever speak with the bank, and she was told to submit paperwork that never was submitted, one year later.

I hurt my back in a car accident a few years ago and had to undergo therapy, injections and even back surgery."" Mr. Sobel went on to say that he knows “…how frustrating it is to be effected at work and limited in my regular daily activities, so I am happy to be able to help guide my injured clients through their recoveries.”Eric Pintaluga, one of the founding partners, echoed Mr. Sobel’s enthusiasm, stating, “I have a responsibility and a duty to make sure the clients’ rights are protected when they’re injured in an accident.”The information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Louis Mosca during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..Kanner & Pintaluga is an accident injury law firm with offices in multiple states. “We provide aggressive legal representation for people injured in an accident.

I, myself, am licensed to practice in GA, FL, MA and MN. We have no bar issues and thousands of satisfied customers,” he explains.

The law firm is also entirely paperless, which allows them the opportunity to work with their clients from anywhere. “The phones are open 24/7. I answer e-mails any time I’m awake. We really try to help our clients get through a difficult time,” states Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. Client Care & Complaint Resolution At times, clients may not feel satisfied with the services they received. “The frequent complaint we get from clients is either they didn’t get enough money, or didn’t get money quick enough. Unfortunately, this is going to happen through no fault of our own,” explains Mr. Sobel. He further explains that this can be caused by a federal or state law that is impacting the case, the amount of medical damages they may have, or simply the facts of the case itself. To try and avoid these issues in the first place, Mr. Sobel and his team strive to educate the clients up-front with regard to what they should expect, what types of damages are covered, and what documentation is needed.

I was in a car accident they recommended I go to therapy because I have some neck & upper back pain after I started going to therapy I had to call them at least once a month to get an update on my case. They NEVER called me. Most of the time the girls that answer the phone would just transfer me to a voice mail. I had not heard from them in a over 3 months. Im A busy Full-Time student & I work a 40 Plus hour job overnight to support myself so my time is very limited. I hadn't had time to call them & even if I did I would just get transferred to a voice mail anyways. (They would never return my calls) I had to call over 3 times to be able to speak with an actual ""HUMAN"" He then informed me that they are not taking my case! I was very upset to say the least not that they did not take my case after the investigation they did. What I was really upset about was the fact that they didn't have the decency to call me, email me, or get in contact with and informed me they couldn't take my case. I asked them repeatedly when did they find out that they could not take my case? Nobody had an answer... simply they told me that they would send me a letter in the mail explaining why. I asked them why did nobody inform me by phone or email or even send me a letter before? they once again had noooooooo... answer for me. I was very polite and nice even though i was fuming and it didn't help that nobody really spoke english. so i had to speak spanish to them they could understand me. They declined to inform me when they knew that I was not going to be an eligible client to them. They should have called me as soon as they found out.Like i said I am upset about the lack of professionalism.Best part is now im stuck with a huge bill  Ripoff Report Verified™ REVIEW:EDitor’s Positive rating and recognition has been given to Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. for its commitment to excellence in customer service.Ripoff Report’s review of Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. revealed a full staff of attorneys, case managers, and specialists with unparalleled commitment to their clients; Kanner & Pintaluga clients can expect aggressive, ethical, and effective legal representation from the attorneys and knowledgeable staff members who are available to answer the phone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week whenever you call any of their offices.

											...... part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..The information provided in this report is based on comments made by Andy Klein and other Department Managers for U.S. Tax Shield in an interview held by a third party verification company with no biases toward U.S. Tax Shield. U.S Tax Shield is a tax resolution service located in Woodland Hills, CA. According to their staff, their main service is “to obtain valid payment agreements with the IRS and other tax authorities for our clients, as well as file any missing tax return documents for them in our efforts to resolve their outstanding tax issues.” When asked about U.S. Tax Shield’s relationship with Intercard Payments, Inc., the representative replied that Intercard Payments is dba U.S. Tax Shield, meaning they are the same company. The representative for U.S. Tax Shield states that their dedication to service sets them apart from their competition. “We go the extra mile to communicate directly with the IRS with the prospective client on the phone, so they can hear from the IRS about the specific problem.”  The representative says this approach is different because most companies only rely on what the client says, whereas U.S. Tax Shield (USTS) verifies all relevant details in the beginning with the client and the IRS. This helps them avoid issues with both parties, since they are aware of multiple situations where the IRS has not provided their prospective client with comprehensive information about their specific tax issues. “Having the prospective client on the phone when we obtain the full story from the IRS helps to enhance our credibility in demonstrating to the prospective client that we intend to work for their best interests 100% of the time.” The company acquires leads for services through standard advertising, such as television, radio, and internet/search engine ads. When potential clients call in, the phone operators are responsible for confirming that the prospect has a situation where the services of USTS would be appropriate, and if the initial screening is successful, the prospect is transferred to one of the salespeople who gathers information.The client will most likely speak with several experts in the office throughout the life of their case, but USTS tries to maintain a single point-of-contact throughout the life of the case, while it is in their office. “Additionally, we start out with having a second call with the IRS and the client to again confirm the specific situation we need to resolve for our client; this helps us because the IRS, and many state-level tax authorities, are notorious for incorrectly documenting taxpayer issues.” USTS continues by obtaining power of attorney from the client so they can speak directly with tax authorities on the issues. If the client has an issue, they are encouraged to call their point-of-contact anytime throughout the process, and the USTS representative says they try to ensure calls never go to voicemail and the client always speaks with someone, even if they have to leave a message.When questioned about their process for dealing with a complaint, the USTS representative stated, “We have a client services department which focuses solely on issues related to customer dissatisfaction. Their objective is to find out what went wrong, and to promptly fix the problem.”  However, the representative made it clear that a primary challenge in their industry is working with customers who are typically ineffective at dealing with paperwork (such as not opening their mail, waiting for problems to go away, etc.) Because of this, the USTS representative states that many of the people who reach out to their firm believe they will not have to pay any taxes or penalties, and they are selective in what they hear. Most people are dissatisfied because they believe USTS will make the situation disappear without required payments to the tax authorities. “Most times, clients do not understand that our ability to resolve their tax issues is directly related to their financial ability to pay monies to the tax authorities.”One such situation involved a client living in an upscale area of Manhattan; he had a high income that he supplemented with global speaking engagements.  While the appropriate W2 deductions were made by his employer, he was not making personal quarterly tax payments on the significant income his speaking engagements brought in. “Once we were able to effectively communicate this necessary financial responsibility to our client, he was able to understand that our services are valuable to him and his family in many ways.”To resolve such issues, USTS sets aside additional time to review the situation with the client again, discuss the communication they have had with the tax authorities, and help them understand the solution that has been applied to their situation. The USTS representative says that they typically resolve such complaints. To ensure better customer service, USTS began a training program for all customer service representatives (which includes a reference handbook); each representative must complete this training before they are allowed to speak with their first client. There have been specific complaints on Ripoff Report by customers who claimed there was no progress on their case, despite their financial commitment to the services of USTS. When the USTS representative was asked about these complaints and what they were doing to resolve them, they replied that these instances have to do with gaps in communication. This difficulty is being resolved by the implementation of a policy requiring that every call is answered, instead of allowing it to go to voicemail. Then the issue is investigated by the appropriate point-of-contact, who follows up with the client. The USTS representative gave an example of a current client who has successfully fulfilled all their obligations, USTS has fulfilled everything, as well, and it is simply a matter of waiting on the IRS to respond so a payment plan can be implemented.The USTS representative believes that they “do whatever it takes” to make things right for the consumer because, unlike their competitors, they do not require full payment before they address client issues; they simply begin working with the client and the IRS as soon as the client is approved for services. They often end up waiting to be paid long after the resolution. “We lead and manage the business with a hands-on approach.

											...... part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..The information provided in this report is based on comments made by Andy Klein and other Department Managers for U.S. Tax Shield in an interview held by a third party verification company with no biases toward U.S. Tax Shield. U.S Tax Shield is a tax resolution service located in Woodland Hills, CA. According to their staff, their main service is “to obtain valid payment agreements with the IRS and other tax authorities for our clients, as well as file any missing tax return documents for them in our efforts to resolve their outstanding tax issues.” When asked about U.S. Tax Shield’s relationship with Intercard Payments, Inc., the representative replied that Intercard Payments is dba U.S. Tax Shield, meaning they are the same company. The representative for U.S. Tax Shield states that their dedication to service sets them apart from their competition. “We go the extra mile to communicate directly with the IRS with the prospective client on the phone, so they can hear from the IRS about the specific problem.”  The representative says this approach is different because most companies only rely on what the client says, whereas U.S. Tax Shield (USTS) verifies all relevant details in the beginning with the client and the IRS. This helps them avoid issues with both parties, since they are aware of multiple situations where the IRS has not provided their prospective client with comprehensive information about their specific tax issues. “Having the prospective client on the phone when we obtain the full story from the IRS helps to enhance our credibility in demonstrating to the prospective client that we intend to work for their best interests 100% of the time.” The company acquires leads for services through standard advertising, such as television, radio, and internet/search engine ads. When potential clients call in, the phone operators are responsible for confirming that the prospect has a situation where the services of USTS would be appropriate, and if the initial screening is successful, the prospect is transferred to one of the salespeople who gathers information.The client will most likely speak with several experts in the office throughout the life of their case, but USTS tries to maintain a single point-of-contact throughout the life of the case, while it is in their office. “Additionally, we start out with having a second call with the IRS and the client to again confirm the specific situation we need to resolve for our client; this helps us because the IRS, and many state-level tax authorities, are notorious for incorrectly documenting taxpayer issues.” USTS continues by obtaining power of attorney from the client so they can speak directly with tax authorities on the issues. If the client has an issue, they are encouraged to call their point-of-contact anytime throughout the process, and the USTS representative says they try to ensure calls never go to voicemail and the client always speaks with someone, even if they have to leave a message.When questioned about their process for dealing with a complaint, the USTS representative stated, “We have a client services department which focuses solely on issues related to customer dissatisfaction. Their objective is to find out what went wrong, and to promptly fix the problem.”  However, the representative made it clear that a primary challenge in their industry is working with customers who are typically ineffective at dealing with paperwork (such as not opening their mail, waiting for problems to go away, etc.) Because of this, the USTS representative states that many of the people who reach out to their firm believe they will not have to pay any taxes or penalties, and they are selective in what they hear. Most people are dissatisfied because they believe USTS will make the situation disappear without required payments to the tax authorities. “Most times, clients do not understand that our ability to resolve their tax issues is directly related to their financial ability to pay monies to the tax authorities.”One such situation involved a client living in an upscale area of Manhattan; he had a high income that he supplemented with global speaking engagements.  While the appropriate W2 deductions were made by his employer, he was not making personal quarterly tax payments on the significant income his speaking engagements brought in. “Once we were able to effectively communicate this necessary financial responsibility to our client, he was able to understand that our services are valuable to him and his family in many ways.”To resolve such issues, USTS sets aside additional time to review the situation with the client again, discuss the communication they have had with the tax authorities, and help them understand the solution that has been applied to their situation. The USTS representative says that they typically resolve such complaints. To ensure better customer service, USTS began a training program for all customer service representatives (which includes a reference handbook); each representative must complete this training before they are allowed to speak with their first client. There have been specific complaints on Ripoff Report by customers who claimed there was no progress on their case, despite their financial commitment to the services of USTS. When the USTS representative was asked about these complaints and what they were doing to resolve them, they replied that these instances have to do with gaps in communication. This difficulty is being resolved by the implementation of a policy requiring that every call is answered, instead of allowing it to go to voicemail. Then the issue is investigated by the appropriate point-of-contact, who follows up with the client. The USTS representative gave an example of a current client who has successfully fulfilled all their obligations, USTS has fulfilled everything, as well, and it is simply a matter of waiting on the IRS to respond so a payment plan can be implemented.The USTS representative believes that they “do whatever it takes” to make things right for the consumer because, unlike their competitors, they do not require full payment before they address client issues; they simply begin working with the client and the IRS as soon as the client is approved for services.

You have been WARNED... My mother was in need of a family/divorce attorney to settle assets from a marriage and Denise Oxley was recommended.. and boy do I wish I went against the advice because this lady will keep a case going as long as she possibly can to secure as much $$$ as she can. My mother doesn't speak English all too well and Miss Oxley knowing this, took full advantage of the situation. [continued below]....
									
										..... After growing concern, my mom asked me if I could be involved and be present at her meetings alongside Oxley after she had been going to the attorney's office for some time alone. She wanted me there to ensure that everything was being communicated properly because of her poor English and to take notes. Which son wouldn't? After returning from my first meeting with Oxley and my mom present, mom told me on the drive home that Oxley's attitude had completely changed, for the better this time, simply because I showed up. She was right. I kept thinking to myself in that office that Oxley appeared nervous for no apparent reason. Interesting. I made no issue of it, and brushed it off because I wanted further confirmation, and because I wanted to give Oxley a fair shot and to further investigate. I then met with Oxley and my mom for just the second time ever in her office, and the FIRST thing that came out of Oxley's mouth after the handshake was her concern for ME being present at these meetings. I wonder why??.. She claimed that I was a threat to the case because I could be subjected into the case from the opposing attorney's side. I almost laughed upon hearing this because at that moment, I knew the only THREAT I became to anything at all was HER bank account! I called her out on her B.S. politely and told her that I felt it was important for me to be there for my mom regardless of her opinion. It was hard, but you could see her blushing through her black skin. Her reaction was all we needed to know. We were deceived, and there was nothing we could do about it or the thousands and thousands of dollars we invested in this worthless, incapable, ""attorney"". DON'T be fooled by her secretary Yolanda Meija either. She's the secretary up front who's 60+ years old and pathetically tries to dress like she's still in her 20's.. There isn't enough clothing to conceal that kind of sag. Yolanda, the secretary was for some strange reason allowed to take notes during their meetings.. but I the son wasn't?? It didn't pass the smell test. They are both in it together for the sake of profiteering off of vulnerable people, and I saw it first hand. My recommendation for you is to find an attorney who is actually qualified, who will fight for you, not with you. An attorney who studied in America. She got her degree from who knows from where, in England. Don't be taken like we were. Invest the TIME to find someone who is capable before paying ANY attorney ANY fee. That was my mistake. Let it not be yours.  Good luck to you and your case. - No need to say it.. You are welcome! ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

April 15, 2013Reference:
Mr. Hillgardner
Mr. Mehmet, As per our conversation on 4/10/13 when I emailed you about seeking another lawyer, I am stating my case briefly to you so can help me.On June 14, 2010 I was in Civil Court for a Travis Hearing to be reinstated back to my home of 29years, when I was called in for the hearing was first when I came across Mr. Hillgardner. Before I went into the hearing Mr. Hillgardner approached me and asked me could he sit in on my hearing and that he was an Attorney. At the time I was
very distressed, confused and did not think twice about Mr. Hillgardner sitting in on my hearing since he presented himself to me as an Attorney. After the hearing I had to return after lunch for the decision. After I won the decision he asked me could he represent me as his client. I had agreed to him being my Attorney because I did not know any better at the time.
Since June 14, 2010 he became my Attorney and I thought that he was going to represent me in a professional manner. During the first year I had many problems with getting in contact with him, and when I did he seemed to be very disrespectful most of the time. He talked very nasty to me and my son on numerous of occasion. I lived at the time from one family relative to another until March 2011. Due to the seriousness of me being homeless I was unable to deal with anyone especially my Attorney that made me feel worse than I did. By May of 2011 he pushed me to the limit and I decided not to call him for awhile. I stopped calling October 2011 up until December 2012 a little over a year later. I have not heard anything from him for nothing. The last time I heard from him was when I was waiting to hear from an Appeal from Supreme Applet Courts.
When I called him December 2012 he stated, Ms. Porter I was just thinking of you, I just got the decision for your Civil Court Case and you won the decision. He also stated, That something was wrong with his phone back in July of 20112 and he could not contact me. I did not understand because I still have the same number and I never received a call from him nor did I get a missed called neither. OK, I felt that all was water under the bridge something good is about to happen with my case. Still his attitude was rude and unbearable to deal with for me and my son. So when he hung up the phone on me this time I decided to GOOGLE him to find out what kind of Attorney record he has and only then I realized that I made the biggest mistake by signing a retainer with him. I also found out on March 28, 2013 that my Supreme Court case was removed of the calendar because when I was called to appear in Court sometime in July of 2012 he (when I decided because of his disrespectful manner not to call him) never contact me until I called him in December 2012.
He stated to me that he was putting a motion into the court and I was to wait for his call the week of April 8. 2013 and he did not called me. When I called him April 10, 2013 he was very disrespectful to me and told me, you are not paying me any money. I stated, Why would you say that when I signed a retainer so you would get paid. He stated, I can not call him when ever I wanted to and expect him to talk to me, and if I do not like what he is saying then I can find another Attorney. Besides you get more from a person being sweet as honey bees, than sour like vinegar. He then hung up the phone and I have not heard anything from him since then. I only called him because he never returned my call and it is important to speak with him ASAP to get my case back on the calendar.PLEASE HELP me I have a case in Civil Court with Judge Badio for NYCH to restore me back into a place. I am currently living in a family shelter for 2 years and need to get out.. I also have a Supreme Court case for damages that I need to be restored back to the calendar. I can be reached anytime at 347 617 1187. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sparks, NV     I went to arbitration regarding the fee dispute that I'd filed with the bar.  Ken was only willing to refund $750 of the $2,500 fee.  I settled just because I didn't want to drag it out any further.  He had no time records with him to substantiate his position that he spent more time on the case than the $2,500 fee, so that was not a real surprise.  Was nice to finally meet the man who ""spent so much time on my case"" that I never even met him in person.  Just remember, you get what you pay for - or in some cases ... not.   1 Previous Review: Hide »    I hired Ken back in December of last year to wrap up a few items from my divorce.  I paid a $2,500 flat fee to resolve two issues:  1) to determine how the balance in our client trust account with my ex would be distributed, and 2) how to ensure my liability tied to my former business connection with the ex might be limited thus providing me more protection.  He accomplished neither - but I did get an accounting spreadsheet from my ex's former attorney finally at the end of July (took eight months to get one half-page spreadsheet).  This is when Ken dropped me as a client citing that I was abusive to his staff.  While it is true that I communicated primarily with his staff never having the opportunity to meet him face-to-face, I never raised my voice and never used language inapprorpiate in a business climate.  For the $2,500, he filed one motion not correctly identifying the issue which resulting in my ex's attorney interpreting the order to their benefit and my receiving no funds from the community trust account (the ex received nearly $10k - the balance remaining).   I have since filed a bar complaint and request for refund based on a number of infractions including RPC (Rules of Professional Conduct) 1.4 for Communication or lack thereof, RPC 5.3 regarding Non-Lawyer Assistants, and SCR (Supreme Court Ruling) Rule 1.16 regarding the Termination of Relationship.   Every single person I've spoken with since having this negative experience, including other attorneys, said ""I wish you would have asked me about him before you hired him.""  I'm understanding that while the flat rate seems very attractive to the budget-conscious litigant, the services are limited at best, and most likely all you will get is the assistance of a paralegal or legal assistant handling a majority of your case.  You may even get to meet this attorney whose trial experience includes the famed Judas Priest case - whereas he lost, but still rides on this infamous and unfortunate personal tragedy.   I would recommend that before hiring Ken McKenna - ask around and you'll likely get the same response I did.  No wonder he didn't win political office - this is a small town and people do talk! I have since had a good experience with ""We the People"" on South Virginia.  I would recommend them for low-cost solutions pertaining to divorce and trusts.  They are considered a document preparation service and have an attorney on staff for legal issues for only $125/hour, half of the average hourly rate of any other legal firm. I have additionally settled the fee dispute in arbitration whereas Ken provided a $750 refund - not enough - but not worth the trouble of going further as he kept no time records to substantiate his position that he spent more than $2,500 in time on my case.   ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

These individuals have been sending me threatening emails for months now about filing a case against me if I didn't send them money. When I first started receiving the emails in April 2014, I would entertain it with the same questions or concerns any person would have (who are you contacting me on behalf of? How much do I owe? etc). They said they were representing Advance Cash Services for a loan in the amount of $300 which has gone up to $847 and I could settle the debt for $500. I contacted Advance Cash America and they advised they have never heard of NCS nor the individuals representing NCS. They advised they only use one specific collector and NCS is not it and that I should keep record of this fraudulent entity. I also noticed that when I responded to NCS email, I started receiving several random emails from other entities claiming to also be collecting debt for a payday loan. But I will stick to this one company on this report since they are the only ones I still hear from after 5 months and are still claiming to be filing some sort of lawsuit againt me. Below are some of the messages I received from them. If you notice below, they use several different email addresses. That alone should raise alarm. All legit company emails are standardized.

I employed 2 lawyers to help me sue the pill Co., (Joe Flores/Joe Flores Law Firm and Lizzy Santiago/ Matthews and Associates Law Firm) who had me thinking and were telling me I was going to a court room for 2 years to fight for an award but I later found out they were dipping into a pot set aside for victims of the pill and was never going to a court room, then he didn’t pay me.  Along with me writing to the Texas Lawyers Bar for help about the lawyers not paying me and they refused and I wrote to the Houston and Corpus Christie D.A. for help and they never really got back with me So I wrote to the Gov. and Texas Attorney Gen. to look into the Bar and Lawyers but they did not respond at all. Then I wrote to the U.S. Attorney Gen. and the President of the U.S. to look into the actions of the state of Texas, but no response at all. So I am coming to the real leaders of the U.S., “The People” “The Public”. This will also help Americans understand people more and the after effects of a failing Gov. as “We the People” should act now and swiftly as we must show American attorneys they cannot steal from victims of physical impairment from mishap by pills that were supposed to help me, but instead crippled me. I have all and any evidence you need, 2 years of e-mail between the attorneys and I, phone records, witness's, and a recording (MP3) of the Matthews Law Firm even calling me and asking me for more work from their (past clients list) and you can hear me say ""What about the money you never paid me for the first lawsuit?” and then she hangs up on me.  Along with the consent form with the % of money they were taking from me. One of my biggest complaint is he took up my time and strung me along until the statute of limits to file a case for me ran out to sue the pill Co. Please help, these lawyers stole my award money.

Glendale, California USA ",,818 502-2020,,"  A few months after my son passed in 2008 I sat down with Justin Martin and one of his glaring associates. Mr. Martin held my hand and promised an investigation that will result in asnwers after I explained to him the events leading up to and following my sons unexplained death. He was 4 months and 19 days old, died at his care givers home according to the statemtns I got frm EMS and their report he had been gone for at least 3 hours. She never called 911, untill a family memer of hers stopped my the home no one had called 911 or performed CPR. Even the Dr. explained he was long gone before arriving to the hospital. I couldn't enter the room at the ER, they said ""family only and theres already too many people in there) I responded with I'M THE ONLY FAMILY HERE, THAT'S MY SON! Come to find out she called her siblings before even calling me to leave work & see about him. The only one who questioned her was the Medical Examiner, no law enforcement. Needless to say once the funneral passed & I came to some sort of normalcy and had a sense of what was going on, I started asking EVERYONE questions. Once she found this out she fled the state, leaving a fully furnished appartment and a few of her 5 children behind.   There was also the situation with his Dr. Joselita Rodriguez, he was only 4 months old and you see this could never be a SIDS case becuase I had taken him to the hospital 5 times in the last month of him living and complained about his breathing. She gave him medicine for astmah (later found out he never had astmah) also for Bronchitis and I demanded exrays and he didn't have that either. Unfortunatly then I was a single mother at 21 and he was on Medicaid; so this is the care you get. Though the Dr. came on the list from the nursery when he was born as one of the top docs in that area, she had prescribed him a total on 9 drugs to take simuntaniosuly up untill the day before he died. YES, I had taken hiim to her the afteroon befor he dies & she told me ""It's just something in that air, it will pass"". But when the medical Examiner called her for his records, her office repeatedly told her he was never a patient there & they had no info on him. My mother in her state of shock had to walk in ther & demand them herself!   So weeks turned into months, and months turned into years....no phone calls form these attourneys...I was only ever allowed to leave messages. They were also working on a case for a car accident that involved my mother and when they called her to suggest more treatment for her back she told them she wouldn't do antoher thing for them untill they gave me some information on my case. They confeessed that my file (including all the info I provided them) was lost in storage when they got their new building...that I should just ""write the care giver a letter & that should provide closure"" and that there could never be a case against the Dr. because she works for the state (accepts medicaid) so its not just a case against her that I am building but against the state too and ""way too much to go against"".   Later in my mothers suit she was only offered $10k for the hit and run from a drunk driver that totaled her Jaguar and left her in pain....so like I said, NO justice, NO answers, JUST SETTLERS (whether they settle for money, lies or their do nothing approach).

A case that was 4 1/2 yrs old. A letter that was urgently needed to file my husbands U.S citizenship. He charged us for the amount of $500 dollars to make phone calls and request that letter from Utah. It never happened. When my husband decided to allow this unethical attorney to take his case, he made him sign paperwork which my husband took the time to read and scan! because attorney promised us to mail it out to us but he never did. Thanks to technology we scan it just to be safe. These days you can't trust anyone. We should have listen to our guts about coming to this person who we found out, doesn't even have his own office. He just rents a room for an hour to talk to new customers and possible to convince he is a good attorney but he is definitely not. To make story short, I did file a complain with the state of attorney in Florida. But I knew I would not get too far since they are all gov agencies. They can't do much. Attorney responded but never got us the certified letter or exact date husband was allow to file for his U.S Citizenship. I know $500 wasn't a big number. But when you pay for a service, you expect results. I'm saving you time and money. He is not a good lawyer. Do your research. We did our research and couldn't find good or bad reviews from this individual. But he easily took $500 from us. However, He will pay that back in another way. He was paid in a form of check.

I couldnt get people to return my calls for weeks on end, went threw 3 parralegals (if thats what you want to call them), never once did i ever speak to or hear from the so called lawyer drew alia (still havnt heard from him). For over a month now i have been asking for my papers back and money  and have gotten nothing. They would tell me not to talk to my lender because they were working with them. Good thing i did call my lender because it was not the case. The only thing this compnay did was sent papers over to my lender other then that they did nothing. I fired this company over a month ago, i have also found out that they have a law suit against them in Connecticut, that they use other lawyers names that are not even with this company, and that mr alia is under a administrative suspension in PA (per a letter that i got in the mail). This company is after one thing and one thing only money. If you look at there site and comments (the ones that are good..lol) they are from people that work for the company or people they know. It's all the same people just using differnet names, but all the comments are the same. I am filing compliants against them here in maryland also in pa and plan on taking them to court if i have to.

He began failing to communicate with me within 3 months after retaining him, but he never failed to bill me.  A one paragraph email sent to him, begging for information on my case, would cost me an outrageous sum of money for him to read, but never respond to.  Within 6 months of retaining him, I had lost complete confidence, due to lack of communication, lack of response on his and his firm's behalf, and being charged thousands of dollars for my pleas for updates on what he was doing to resolve a divorce that had lingered on for over 2 years.  I was charged for roughly $5,000 for a second deposition (which was NEVER discussed with me prior), which NEVER occurred because his court reporter failed to show up at the opposing counsel's office.  Then Mr. Wuertz and his paralegal, (he always has to have someone with him), met in private with my husband, and my husbands attorney, while I had to sit outside the conference room for over an hour and a half.  It was never revealed to me what they discussed.  The lack of communication continued, except for insulting emails and what could only be conceived as threats from Wuertz and his legal team, if I failed to cooperate with my husband's demands.  I never received copies of correspondence he sent or received from opposing counsel.  Then, he demanded a meeting to discuss a settlement proposal be set IMMEDIATELY.  When I arrived for the meeting, he and his staff were so rude and insultng to me and my family that accompanied me, it was embarrassing.  Then he simply QUIT on me.  And is filing a $10k plus lien on my divorce.  I pity anyone unfortunate enough to encounter this pit viper, and expect a positive outcome.  This firm is a prime example of what gives lawyers a bad reputation!  I will be pursuing justice with this firm, I assure anyone reading this.  Some things, you just don't let pass by.  Mr. Wuertz hasn't displayed worthiness of the responsibility of the title he wears.

You will find that you will owe them alot of money (billing you each month) and you will NOT be getting any quality service in exchange.  All they do is family law, which they try to use to pronounce that they are the best firm on the island because of that, but they are all about volume and not one-on-one attention to the client(s).  You are better off with a smaller law firm that will charge you more reasonable fees AND give you the attention you deserve!!!  The attorney Paul Soenksen who works there is the absolute worst!!!  He will want to fight over everything in court, just so you have to pay more legal fees!!! Again, its all about how much money they can make off you!!!  The more money he charges you, the more he is recognized as a high biller for the firm and he gets rewarded!!!

I called the company 1st as there is no email address on the website. I told her exactly what I wanted a divorce with a mobile home that was in both our names to change to his name only so I wasn't responsible for the rent. Angela quoted me a price of $150 for her services. She drew me up the draft and I looked at it and it never said anything regarding the property of the mobile home so I asked her about that and she said it would be an additional $35.00 and never about an additional $4.00 for paying through paypal so I just paid the $35.00 and got no results from her when I was sick and wasn't aware of the $4.00 so I thought she was just giving me a hard time. I told her if she didn't want to help me then I was going to hire an attorney. Well she felt threatened and got an attitude with me and said I was giving her a hard time about the $4.00 which I wasn't. She then reimbursed me 30.00 out of the $35.00 and kept my $150.00. She never drew up the final papers and kept my money. I believe she scams people out of their money and that's no way to run a business. If she doesn't know how to resolve property issues with a divorce she shouldn't be doing business on the net like this. I want my money back as a consumer that felt scammed and had to hire an attorney for $2400 because after this I didn't trust anyone else online. Please respond as quickly as possible.

Professional at taking money from poor females in need of help! Internet,"  I paid a total of $683.00 to Attorney Barry M. Kaufman’s office on 10/04/2012 for him to handle a case in Broward County Florida. I had a total of four (4) court dates Mr. Kaufman had one of his associates show up to one out of the four. That was my first appearance in front of Judge Mardi Levey Cohen on the 21st of February 2013 were they asked for a defense continuance which was granted for the 21st of March 2013. On March 21, 2013 I arrived to the court and after several attempts to contact Mr. Kaufman to no avail I was called in front of the judge with no representation Judge Cohen did give me some time to try contacting Mr. Kaufman and after several calls to his office none of his office officials had no idea where he was. After relaying this to the Judge she granted me with a final continuance. Once I left the court I called Mr. Kaufman’s office one last time and then his secretary stated that he was ill and that is why he did not show so I informed them of the new court date that was issued by the judge and was told that someone will be there to provide representation on the new date of April 25, 2013. On the 25th of April again I showed up for court and again no Attorney and no explanation on why he is not there my court appearance was set for 9 am and the judge gave me until 2pm to get in contact with Mr. Kaufman again none of his office officials had no idea where he was or if he was going to show up. By this time the Judge as well as I was getting aggravated at the lack of communication from Mr. Kaufman so the Judge set a status date for the 17th of May 2013. On May 17, 2013 again no attorney and no explanation on were Mr. Kaufman is, so I requested that the Judge remove Mr. Kaufman from my case which she granted(exhibit A) as well as I had to settle my case that day. After contacting Mr. Kaufman’s office and letting them know that I would like to have my money refunded due to lack of representation I was told that Mr. Kaufman was the only one that can authorize a refund. I made many attempts to contact Mr. Kaufman still with no return communication. I have a contract (exhibit B) with Mr. Kaufman that states “There is a $250.00 fee if a client fails to appear in court when noticed and court date has to be reset.” I feel that this should also apply to the attorney as well.  Altogether I am filing this complaint due to the lack of representation I received from Mr. Kaufman as well as him now pirating my funds and refusing to refund my money for the work he did not do.

The company told me that this was a civil matter and that since my family member acknowledged the debt and was making payments and that they owned the debt that there was no fraud involved.  And that a company can not use tactics like that to collect a debt,  as long as the debt is being repaid in good faith.   The company also indicated that Seneca Asset Management did not read me the mini miranda act and that they should have not been discussing the matter with me under any circumstances. I have contacted my bank to try and get the money back, Yes, I am naive and very stupid, and thank God for the educationand exposure of the so called ""Les Michaels"" who also went by ""Mr. Sullivan""  he state he practices from 16 states and loves to use the word adjudicate and tells you if he is not in the office ""contact his secretary""  which is the same number and it is a cellphone  (with no name attached to it).   I definitely was ripped off hear and am very embarrassed.

I had an injury in September 2010 for my lower back which was treated trough my company Nordstrom for 3 months. In February 2011 I had herniated disk in the same body part which was related to September 2010 injury. I called HR to report the injury they denied me because this happened at home. I call Perona,Langer, Beck, Serbin and Mendoza they excepted my case. I have told them that this injury was related to September 2010 injury (seems like they ignored) and filed as a new injury. They sent me to doctor for treatment I tried to call their office so many times to speak to the Attorney who represented me Jonatan Brian never had a chance to discuss my concerns. INSTEAD THE STAFF IS VERY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL .O nly chance I had to speak with him or others attorneys from the same firm was in a court. They did not send me to QME doctors for long period of time, with demand of Defense attorney (Nordstrom) I finally seen QME doctor which was from my point of view recommended to them by Defense Attorney(Nordstrom) and not on mutual agreement. For February 2011 case we’ve lost the trial due not correct representation of my Attorney because the fact that my injury was accumulative injury. After we lost the case I received the letter from my Attorney office saying that they do not do an appeal I can do on my own, so I did it. After we lost the trial they filed another injury case for September 2010 which I was telling them in the beginning(they ignored) . They sent me to doctors again to rum more medical bills. Doctors got confused why  they did everything upside down. During the treatment for September 2010 injury from my Attorney, doctor discovered that I also have a neck injury and I needed the treatment. I contacted my Attorney Office for more than 8 months to get an approval and put neck injury for September 2010 case to give an approval for doctor to treat me NO RESPOND.  They screwed up my case. The run all the bills. Then we had Mandatory Settlement Day on October 22,2013 for September 2010 injury  and in Court they Served me with the discharge letter from there service I checked with Court Clerk and find out that my Attorney filed Petition to Dismiss me ,and I never get any letter from them to inform me I found out in the Court.  I demand the explanation from the Attorney he said “Because I filed the Appeal” I told him it was stated in the letter from your Firm that you do not Do An Appeal I can do myself. He ignored and made me sign the Discharge form. Then I found out they also want to collect the fees if I get reward.  PS: NOT the Attorney who represented me the other Attorney from that Firm informed about dismissal. Now because of the Statue of Limitation for filing so late  for September 2010 injury I may loose  this case. Now I am stuck.  Defense Attorney helped me file paper for the Trial. Now I am stocked with more injuries and no treatment I do not know if any Attorneys take this case in this stage. This is my complain. Please advise me what should I do.

When I entered her office, she seemed to be very friendly and knowledgeable, and she was eager to take my case, saying to me that it was an easy one and that she knew how to present it before the judge so I could win the argument. I followed her instructions and spent a lot of money on this case, hoping that things would look up. First of all, she gave me an astronomical bill in the end. She charged me for any little thing she claimed she´d done for me. However, when we had our conversations, I always had the impression that she hadn´t even taken the time to read the documents that I had given her. It turned out that she was very wrong on my case, and of course I lost in the worst possible way...in court the judge scolded her!!! There is nothing wrong in losing a case, what I want to point out here is that she is a very dishonest person. I trusted her since the very beginning, and knowing my financial situation she did not hesitate to present me an astronomical bill. I´m 100 % sure that she didn´t even spent 10 hours working on my case, but guess what...the bill was much higher than that.

I paid my $70.00 then met with Craig C. (Owner). He assured me he could help me no problem and had the perfect lawyer for the case, he called her the ""Bull dog"" because she was a Pitt bull in court, his contempt queen who supposedly specializes in contempt cases. He told me we could get her on contempt and purgery. I said whatever it takes to get her to stop all this and let me be with my daughter again because this has to be destroying her. Craig then told me we could do this for $3250.00, I agreed then walked downstairs with him to meet Lisa Berg aka ""bull dog"" . We talked about my case, I gave her all my court papers, she told me we had a good contempt case and valid purgery charges, she then asked me if I could handle it or be alright with the fact that she will be going for the jugular! I responded ""this is my daughter's mother, I normally wouldn't do this but this time she went too far but if this is what it takes to make her stop doing this to me and my daughter then cool! Let's do it. Lisa then went on to discuss her rate of $295.00 an hour her paralegals rate of $125.00 he etc.. and assured me we could get it done for the $3250.00 . She had me sign the paper work hiring her as my attorney. My court hearing was in two in a half weeks and I asked if that would be a problem and she said no not at all but we may not be going to court on that day because she was going to be getting it extended. I felt so relieved and comforted so I gave them a check for $3250.00 and didn't hear anything back from them until the day before court which I found kind of odd since I had so much more to tell them and give to them and that was only because I had left messages asking if we would be going. Lisa called me and told me we did in fact have court and what time I should be there. We showed up for court the next day only for me to find out she had not even looked at my file nor even knew anything at all about my case. In the courthouse she was just making a complete idiot out of herself, didn't know what questions to ask, studdering, etc.. I was trying to help her out by giving her evidence and telling her what happens and what to ask but she kept telling me to shut up! I started to become agitated and I think it began to show. I thought my head was going to explode. She caused me more harm in that case because I was not allowed to talk. We lost the case. There was never any mention of contempt or purgery. Without her I would have won. I had all the evidence, everything prepared. I had this. She is trying to Bill me the full amount. I expect a little more out of a $295.00 hr. attorney.

Was promised it would take no longer than 4-6 months, insisted we were perfect candidates and that they could guarantee we could save at least $700 a month on our mortgage. We paid them $3,500 and we're told that was the fee for the entire process. Well all was going well during the time we were making monthly payments for the $3,500 to retain their services. In June of 2012 the last payment was made and all phone calls stopped. The person we were dealing with no longer for the company, They assigned 2 other ""account reps"" who of course didn't know what was going on. They lost our paper work. We needed to send all the documents several times. No contact for over 2 months. Then after calling daily and threatening to come to the offices to discuss the situation ( we live 10 miles away) miraculously a new representive for us appears and is requesting all the original documents we filled out over 5 times due to the fact that our file was mistakeningly closed. But informing us maybe we would get $200-300 of our payment, can't guarentee etc. That is when we received the first ""maintenance fee"" of $150 which if wasn't paid our account would be closed.  We of course disputed it due to the fact that our file was closed in June and not reopened until September.  Why are we being charged for a maintenence fee when no maintenance on our case was done!!!! This is where is gets even more ridiculous. These ""professionals"" all the while are telling us that citimortage is holding up the process, it's the bank asking for all the paper work over and over again etc.. While we are being told this we get a letter from Fannie Mae offering us a trial modification and stating to us that our mortagage was sold to them nearly 6 months ago. I called the law office who had no idea what I was talking about and that they don't understand how we got the offer. They had no idea that Fannie Mae was involved, which of course would have changed the whole dynamic. They asked for all the letters from the bank and kept attempting to contact telling us we still need to have them be the go between the bank and us because they have ""seen to many times how the homeowner is mislead.""  We never needed to deal with them again. Long story short we got our modification through Sallie Mae. These unethical, unprofesssional scammers continued to threaten us that we had to pay maintenance fees because they did all the work!!! In fact we got our modification in April 2013, told them ( in march) we no longer needed them and reminded tham that they did nothing of us since November 2012 and to close our file. We got a charge on our credit care for $150 in June!! Of course we are disputing it and are ready and willing to go directly to the office and demand it back.

My step-daughter is going through a divorce at the moment after nine years of marriage, and needless-to-say it's a very rough time for her. After a consultation, Moskowitz seemed like a compassionate fellow that is only willing to help a broken family. We got sucked in: hook, line, and sinker. Moskowitz gave me a brief summary of how he charged his clients. Promising my step-daughter justice and what he described as ""everything she deserves"", Moskowitz charged us an up-front fee of almost $11,000. It took about six weeks before we got a phone call from Moskowitz saying that he needed another $4,000. Confused and shocked, I demanded to know what the $4,000 was for. To make a long story short, he essentially said that we had depleted the initial $11,000 due to court appearances, making phone calls to him, etc. [continued below]....
									
										..... I'm not going to give any details away regarding our daughter's case, but let's just say we were disappointed. Moskowitz was literally embarassed in the courtroom, as we were shocked with the judgment. My daughter made a phone call to Moskowitz afterward in obvious emotional distress. Moskowitz, as arrogant as ever, acted like he's Tom Cruise in ""A Few Good Men"", convinced my daughter into making an appeal. Helpless, she agreed to his instructions that would cost me yet another $6,000. Now $20,000 in the hole, nothing to this point had been accomplished. Phone calls to Moskowitz remained rare, as he charges up to $150 per phone call! These phones calls, might I add, in which he was RUDE and arrogant the entire time, as if he didn't have the time to deal with us. Phone calls in which that we were only left with even more questions! Finally, I got on the phone with him myself to get things straight. We had several lingering questions, no clue in which direction the case was headed, and I personally wanted to know just exactly my money had gone towards thus far. Once again, acting like Tom Cruise from ""A Few Good Men"", however sounding more like Rick Moranis from ""Ghostbusters 2"", (I had even wondered at this point if he was drunk even though it was noon), I had decided to part ways with this clown. He advised it's a ""mistake"" to part ways with him at this time. However, that just ensured that I was making the right decision. Brian Moskowitz is a CROOK. Thief, degenerate, and con-artist can all be used to describe this low-life. It cost me over $20,000 to find that out. His self-proclaimed ""Best Catch"" on his website is an absolute joke. His name should be Saul Goodman from ""Breaking Bad"". I'm hoping this post will help other struggling families' decisions when hiring an attorney. It's hard to find the help and care you need in this time of struggle, and I promise Brian Moskowitz is NOT the man for the job. Good luck. ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

HUBER  SCAM, DECEITFUL, LIAR, DESPERATE FOR MONEY, BIG ZERO IN COURT SUGAR LAND, Texas","  It appears that Saharie L. Reed Esq. operates out of the state of Texas under the Mortgage Law Group. She also allows her name to be used in conjunction as an associate of the Foreclosure Law Center, headquartered in Philadelphia, PA. I was client of The Foreclosure Law Center beginning in February of 2013 and up until  early May 2013 when I fired them. I was never contacted by Ms. Reed nor did I have any communication iniated by her, even though the documents I received from FLC listed her as a Texas Bar Member. I foolishly assumed that she would be my attorney of record representing me in the loan modification process. I was told by FLC not to speak to my lender, and not to answer any phone calls from them, during the loan modification process, which could take up to 10 months. I finally did speak with my lender and told them that I was being represented by an attorney. They told me that I should ask for a refund since they had no record of any attorney acting on my behalf. They also told me that an attorney could not do anything for me that I could not do myself. All an attorney might be able to do is submit modification request. I knew at that point that I had been scammed. See MARS Rule for attorney's ( below). As I see it, Ms. reed engaged in deceptive practices by allowing her name to be used in conjunction with this loan mod scam law firm. She also, and apparently, is involved with a Texas Law firm know as The Mortgage Law Group who operates in a similar manner.  "" Attorneys are generally exempt from the rule if they provide mortgage assistance relief services as part of the practice of law, are licensed in the state where the consumer or dwelling is located, and comply with state laws and regulations governing attorney conduct related to the rule. To be exempt from the advance fee ban, attorneys must also place any advance fees they collect in a client trust account and abide by state laws and regulations covering such accounts."" At this point all I can do is continue to report the unprofessional practices of Ms. Reed to the FTC ( Federal Trade Commission) and other reporting agency's. I, of course, was denied a refund by FLC( Foreclosure Law Center). And quite frankly, I felt like I was dealing with gangsters rather than professional attorney's. ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

I am also told that he is using an alias name of AKA Paul Graff of Lessburg and filing false complaints all over the internet involving us and a distinguished doctor by the name of Dr. Brady. Although the AKA cannot be proven at this time, we will be able to establish the connection, very soon. It should be mentioned we have only had one complaint , no court actions of any kind and no fines in 20 years of operation here in Central Florida with more than 10,000 happy students to date, so our reputation is almost impeccable and we are more than willing to compare ours with any educational organization in the country. This one complaint involved a crazy man in Indonesia who we refused to certify due to his being crazy. He filed more than one dozen complaints, (told you he was crazy) including several with the State of Florida, all were closed out in our favor within 6 months. The State of Florida in the end commended us for not doing business with this crazy man. So you see our reputation is very important to us here at the National Board… and we are VERY protective of it. It should be said that we have not done any business with him or as far as we know anybody he knows.  There is NO truth to any of his allegations in his emails or blogs that he has presented as facts. We have been told by former clients of his that this lying/slandering man who holds himself out as a cheap Lawyer is a very bad lawyer to say the least, to the point that he is scamming people of their hard earned money with improper representation. Yes we we have been told he is that bad of a Lawyer. We have this day filed a Bar Association complaint against this Lawyer for his actions. We have also been informed that others have filed recent Bar Complaints as well. ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

When I asked them to fax the information to me they hung up. I knew it was a scam as my daughter was only 15 at the time they claim she owed and was not working.  The lady, who would not give a name, stated I should pay since I was working that way she could stop the warrent for my daughters arrest and keep them from picking her up today.  My fear is that if my daughter had the money she would have paid it instead of coming to me.

Boulder, Colorado United States of America ",,720.260.4716,"Dr Kevin Kelly  The Dr is a fraud!! Do not hire this Dr! Boulder, Colorado","  Para mediados del año 2012 teníamos ciertos gastos misceláneos que nos sacaban del “Budget”.  Ejemplo; gastos universidad de nuestra hija,  auto, gastos médicos, entre otros.  Además, teníamos un % de interés alto en nuestra hipoteca y se oía mucha promoción sobre HARP, nuevo programa de modificación de Obama, el cual ayudaba a personas con los pagos al día.  Por lo cual mi esposo y yo comenzamos a pedir precualificaciones para el refinanciamiento de nuestra hipoteca.  Luego de obtener dos precualificaciones de banco, muy buenas, oímos el anuncio radial de Home Defense Law Group donde dice: “te ayudamos no importa estés al día o no en tus pagos” y  de John Mussa que dice “HDLG te dará paz mental”.  Decidimos ir a orientarnos. Fuimos a orientación en octubre 2012, HDLG  dijo que sí podían ayudarnos, que teníamos un buen caso, “todos teníamos derecho no importa los ingresos”, por que las casas habían bajado de valor y los prestamos eran altos. Dijeron que eran los mejores negociadores y podian conseguir bajar el pago, bajar el interés y no pagar gastos de cierre.  Muy bueno, como dicen para ser cierto, pero tienen una amabilidad al principio que te derrites y le crees. Nos convencieron y firmamos contrato.  En todo momento en la orientación y durante el proceso le hicimos saber a HDLG que: ambos teníamos crédito excelente, que NO queriamos se nos afectara el crédito  . no queriamos subir los años de préstamo a más de 30 años. que queriamos bajar algo nuestro pago mensual y el interés. que no íbamos de dejar de pagar el mortgage, a lo cual estuvieron claros, porque de lo contrario tenían que cobrar otros honorarios. Se acordó hacer el pago en tres plazos, el 1er pago al momento y los otros 2 por mes. Desde ese momento empezaron a fallar, porque en el 2do pago lo cobraron todo, cobraron noviembre y diciembre en el mes de noviembre; todo sin decirnos nada y su escusa fue falla del sistema de cobro. Luego de e-mails enviados a HDLG  sin ninguna contestación, la Sra. Carmen de la Torre en llamada telefónica nos solicita que para lograr una buena modificación  no pagaramos el mortgage dos meses. Le insistimos que no queríamos hacer eso por el peligro de dañar el crédito,  pero ella insistió y ya habían cobrado sus honorarios completos yyy se supone ellos sabían lo que hacían.  El peor error de nuestras vidas fue haberle hecho caso y confiar en esa mujer.   Durante el proceso lo único que hizo fue pedir los mismos documentos: prueba de ingresos, bank statement, y utility bills. Ella no pedía evidencias de los pagos misceláneos que nos hacían salir del “Budget”. ¿Cómo entonces ella podía demostrar al lender la situación económica  por los gastos extras que teníamos en ese momento? En una ocasión, tuvimos que ir en persona para asegurarnos la Sra. De la Torre llamara a nuestro lender para que nos enviaran la forma 1098, ante las gestiones infructuosas que hicimos directamente con el lender. Ellos nos decía que no podían hablar con nosotros, que nuestros abogados tenían que pedirla.  ¿Cómo, que no podíamos solicitar esta forma  que es para llenar los taxes y solicitar las becas de nuestra hija? En ese momento supimos que HDLG  te hace firmar una hoja, que no te explican que es para que no puedas en lo absoluto hablar con tu lender.  De la Torre sólo hizo  gestión de llamar y darnos  un pedazo de papel de libreta con la información para llenar los taxes, y ahí quedó. Saben que, después del tiempo, nuestro lender nos dijo que todo documento que ellos nos enviaban a la dirección de HDLG, HDLG NO la recibían porque no había quien lo firmara como recibido, incluyendo la 1098. Dejamos de recibir cartas con información importante relacionada a taxes, a “flood insurance” que luego nos causaron muchos problemas, por cuenta de HDLG no haberla recibido y haberla entregado a nosotros. Se imaginan cuando empezaron a llegar cartas con la palabra FORECLOSURE, mi esposo fue en persona, sin cita y el Sr. Matos dice, que no nos preocuparamos, que era normal, parte del proceso.  Si de algo, o lo único que tienen HDLG es amabilidad, que te deja atónito.  Mi esposo le comentó, sobre la falta de profesionalismo de la Sra. De la Torre, y al día siguiente ella llama para decirnos: “Sr. Morales usted se desesperó  ayer viniendo a las oficinas y sabe que, la desesperación es sinónimo de fracaso”.  ¿Que se puede interpretar con esto? Continuabamos enviando E-mails pidiendo contestación a preguntas. Les recalcábamos en los e-mails, no queríamos subieran los años.  Llamamos en muchas ocasiones, sonaba y sonaba   y no contestaban el teléfono para nada (claro, veían nuestros números de célular y las pobres recepcionistas no sabían que hacer). Hicimos un prueba: una compañera  llamó al mismo tiempo como nueva cliente desde su celular y sí le contestaron. Viendo HDLG en su caller ID un numero de tel. diferente/nuevo lo contestan inmediatamente por si es una nueva víctima. Miren la falta de profesionalismo por parte de la Sra. De la Torre, que le envíabamos documentos solicitados por ella por e-mail y, siempre le pedíamos muy amablemente nos dejara saber si los recibió, solo eso.  Nunca nos contestaba y cuando ya cansados de llamar y preguntar por e-mail si los recibió, ella mandaba a la recepcionista a indicarnos que no los había recibido.  Helloooo, con que documentos ella estaba trabajando?  O,  ¿cómo le daba seguimiento?. Nos  gustaría saber hasta qué punto HDLG tenía el derecho, privilegio, o legalidad de solicitar a una tercera entidad un préstamo a nuestro nombre, sin previo aviso de nuestra parte. Según el contrato firmado no creemos hable o se mencione sobre este particular. Luego de meses pasados, y sólo oyendo (muy pocas veces)  de Sra. De La Torre: “el caso está en proceso”, el 17 de mayo, en reunión me explica sobre el proceso final “Trial Period” de hacer tres pagos por la misma y exacta cantidad por tres meses consecutivos. Me indico que tenía que firmar la aplicación “Uniform Borrower Assistance Form”, forma que estaba en blanco. Le reclamé y ella en tono molesto dijo que estaba en su computadora llena, pero no me la permitió ver.  La firmé, porque me iba a dar copia. Cuando en casa me percato, la copia que me dio estaba en blanco.  Tan pronto como pude me cominiqué con la Sra. Isabel Pael, Office Manager, para exigirle le ordenara a la Sra. De la Torre nos enviara copia  de la forma que firmé y que nos diga si recibe o no los documentos. Todavía estamos esperando esa copia. En Agosto 2013, nos llaman para firmar la modificacion;  para sorpresa  40 AñOS,  con unos término de pagos rídiculos que hasta un niño sabría que sumando y restando esto no le conviene. Y con la anotación: tu credito de affectaría si firmas la modificacón. Cuando exigimos a HDLG terminara con el proceso y nos enviara el  “reinstatement letter”   para volver a los términos originales del préstamo, por equivocación el Sr. Matos nos envía carta que HDLG le habían enviado previamente  a nuestro lender como que ya no son nuestros abogados. ¿Como?, cobraron su dinero, no hicieron su trabajo y ni siguiera tuvieron el respeto de decirnos.  A lo cual el Sr. Matos nos dice por teléfono que cometió el error de NO darnos a firmar el “conclusion contract” y nos dice que cuando la modificación baja ellos cierran el caso.  Al día de hoy no hemos recibido el “conclusion contract”. Por falta de profesionalismo, comunicación y sensibilidad de estas personas de HDLG tuvimos que pagar sobre $10,000 al lender para evitar perder nuestra casa, mas perdimos 1,895.00  pagado a HDLG,  solo por darnos problemas, disgustos, hacernos perder tiempo y dañarnos el crédito. HDLG nos daño el crédito, es lo mas que nos duele.  Estamos luchando con las tres compañías de crédito, EQUIFAX, TRANSUNION Y EXPERIAN, para poder arreglar este asunto. Estamos seguros que hay muchos más clientes que pasaron por lo mismo o lo están pasando actualmente.  Pasen la voz.  No crean en el anuncio de radio; donde John Musa decía “HDLG te dará paz mental”  él no sabe que lo que le puede dar al cliente es un derrame cerebral con tantos problemas.   By mid -2012 we had certain miscellaneous expenses that drew us to the ""Budget"" . Example , our daughter's college expenses , auto, medical expenses, among others. In addition , we had a high % interest in our mortgage and a lot of promotion on HARP , new Obama modification program , which helped people with daily payments could be heard. Therefore my husband and I began to ask precualificaciones to refinance our mortgage. After obtaining two precualificaciones bank , very good, heard the radio ad for Home Defense Law Group where he says : ""I do not mind helping you up to date on your payments or not "" and John Mussa says "" HDLG will give peace of mind"" . We decided to get our bearings. Went to orientation in October 2012, we said yes HDLG could help us, we had a good case, "" all had right no matter the income,"" that the houses had fallen in value and the loans were high. They said they were the best negotiators and could get lower payments , lower interest and pay no closing costs. Very good , as they say to be true, but they have a kindness at first that you melt and you believe him . We convinced and signed contract. At all times in the direction and in the process we made HDLG know that : both had excellent credit, we did not want it to affect us credit .years did not want to raise loan over 30 years.we wanted something lower our monthly payment and interest.that not going to stop paying the mortgage , to which were clear , because otherwise had to charge other fees.It was agreed to make the payment in three installments , the 1st payment at the time and the other 2 per month . From that moment began to fail , because the 2nd payment is charged all charged in November and December November , all without saying anything and his excuse was system failure recovery . After e- mails sent to HDLG no reply , Ms. Carmen de la Torre on phone call asking us to get a good mortgage modification fail to pay the two months. We urge you not to want to do that because of the danger of damaging the credit , but she insisted and had already paid their full fee yyy is assumed they knew what they were doing. The biggest mistake of our lives was have listened and trust that woman. During all I did was ask for the same documents : proof of income, bank statement and utility bills . She did not ask for evidence of miscellaneous payments made ​​us leave the ""Budget"" . How then could she show the lender the economic situation for the extra expenses we had at that time? On one occasion , we had to go in person to make sure Ms. De la Torre called our lender sent us to 1098 , to the fruitless efforts we made directly with the lender . They told us we could not talk to us, our attorneys had to ask. How, we could not apply this way is to fill taxes and apply for grants of our daughter ? At that point we knew we HDLG makes you sign a sheet , you do not explain it so you can not talk at all with your lender . De la Torre was managing a call and give us a piece of notebook paper with information for filing taxes , and there I was . They know that after time, our lender told us that any document they sent us in the direction of HDLG , HDLG NOT received because there was no one signed him as received , including 1098. We stopped receiving letters with important information related to taxes , to "" flood insurance"" which then caused us many problems, not having realized HDLG having received and delivered to us . Imagine when they began to get letters with the word FORECLOSURE , my husband was in person without an appointment and Mr. Matos says , not to worry , that it was normal , part of the process . If something, or they just have HDLG is kindness , that leaves you stunned. My husband commented on the lack of professionalism of Ms. De la Torre, and the next day she called to tell us , ""Mr. Morales despaired you coming to the office yesterday and know that despair is synonymous with failure. "" What can we interpret this? We continued sending e -mails asking to answer questions. Les we emphasized in the e- mails did not want to go up year. Often called , rang and rang and did not answer the phone at all (of course, saw our cell numbers and poor receptionists who do not know ) . We did a test : a companion drew the same time as a new client from his cell phone and he answered yes . Displaying HDLG on your caller ID a number of tel . different / new the answer immediately if a new victim. Look at the lack of professionalism by Ms. De la Torre , who requested we sent for her by e- mail and documents , whenever we asked very kindly let us know if you received them , just that. We never answered and when I tired to call and ask if the e-mail received , sent her to tell the receptionist that he had not received . Helloooo , that she was working papers ? Or , how you followed up ? . We want to know how HDLG had the right , privilege, or legality of asking a third party for a loan on our behalf , without notice from us. According to the signed contract or not we talk about this particular mention . After months old, and only heard ( rarely ) Ms. De La Torre : "" the case is in process,"" May 17 , at a meeting I explained about the final process ""Trial Period"" making three payments the exact same amount for three consecutive months . I indicated that I had to sign the "" Uniform Borrower Assistance Form "" application form was blank. I complained and she said in an annoyed tone in his computer was full, but not allowed to see me . I signed it because I was going to give back . When at home I realize , the copy he gave me was blank. As soon as I could she communicates with Ms. Isabel Pael , Office Manager , to require him to order Ms. De la Torre sent us a copy of the form I signed and to tell us whether or not you receive the documents. Still waiting for that copy. In August 2013 , we are called to sign the amendment , to the surprise 40 YEARS , with payment term flouted that even a child would know that adding and subtracting this does not suit you . And with the note: your credit for if you sign the modificacón affectaría . When we demand HDLG finished with the process and send us the "" reinstatement letter "" to return to the original terms of the loan, Mr. Matos inadvertently sent us a letter that he had previously sent HDLG our lender as they are no longer our lawyers . How? , Took their money , they did their job and did not even tell us respect . To which Mr. Matos tells us over the phone that made ​​the mistake of giving us NOT to sign the "" finding contract"" and tells us that when they close down the case modification . To date we have not received the "" finding contract"" . For lack of professionalism , communication and sensitivity of these people HDLG we had to pay over $ 10,000 a lender to avoid losing our home , but we lost 1,895.00 we paid HDLG , just give us problems , dislikes, wasting our time and harm us credit. HDLG harm us credit , but that is what hurts us . We are fighting with the three credit companies, Equifax , TransUnion and Experian , to solve this issue. We are sure there are many more customers who went through the same thing or are currently going through. Spread the word . Do not believe the radio ad , where John Musa said "" HDLG give you peace of mind"" that he does not know what he can give the customer a stroke with so many problems . ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

I do not recommend her!  We hired her to represent us for a lease/option matter on our home. We had two seperate issues going on. 1)  all the repairs and money spent on the home that the landlord was supposed to reimburse us for  should have been a personal complaint. Tammy Parkin  filed this complaint all bulked together under our business name which leads to number... 2)We own a storm restoration company, when we looked at the home to consider purchase,  realized it had storm damage to the roof. We were advised by the owner of the home to deal with her insurance company and meet with them to see if her adjuster agreed with our company to replace the roof. They did in fact give the home owner 26k to replace the roof and gutters. The home owner diecided to pocket the insurance money. Since we were buying the home and moving in, the home owner (Tracy Begue) waited for us to move in, make several repairs to the home and then told us if we wanted a new roof she would only spend 14k for the roof replacement. (this means she was trying to pocket over 10k) of insurance proceeds. Tammy filed the whole suit under our business name and come to find out should have been filed under us personally. We gave her a $1500 retainer and she never gave us a bill to show where any of that money was spent. When we went to court to get reimbursed for the repairs made to the house Tammy showed up empty handed. She did not submit any of the receipts I had given her. Now claims she never received them. And, she kept the little bit of money that was refunded to us (under $300) without our knowledge. I had to contact the court to see why we never received it. Did I mention she showeed up to court with a blue hair dye job, and open toe shoes displaying all her tatoos on her feet/ankles?????????? unreal!!!!!

Jean will reel you in with a lower amount (versus other laywer firms cost) for your case and feed you a bunch of lies in the initial consultation. She gives you a big story about how she can help you, but then she dissapears after she convinces you to hire her. You will never see her again. After that, Lisette who I would label as an admin at best (she collects the offices fees, and has no useful information ever, but acts like she knows what the hell is going on in cases and the office) will call you, and mail letters to your home stating that new fees are due, or else they will not show up in court for you, or do what the hell they are supposed to be doing, which isn't much either. They will charge you for ridiculous things, even if they don't have to lift a finger. And to top it off she will tell you the usual price is much higher, but that she is giving you a discount. She is such a joke, and I feel sorry for her. People like her and Jean need to be prayed for. Jean never went to court for me, she gave me a inexperienced ditzy ""lawyer"" named Rachel who didn't even know how the hell to fight back, or even what to say to opposing counsel. She looked liek she was freaking 20 years old. I was the one giving her ideas, in court I might add because she never prepared or actually went over any of the paperwork I gave to help prove my case. WOW right. Then we were switched to another layer (""Rohit"" who actually seemed like he knew a bit more about the law to call himself a lawyer) a week before my case was up for the final hearing, so he had no time to prepare. Don't invest in this firm thinking they are great because they are cheaper in cost. You will get exactly what you paid for. Nothing. They did absolutley nothing to help me in my case, and I walked away with nothing because of this firm, and would have been better off representing myself, and saved money in the process.

Then this is the attorney for you. He was supposed to ""represent"" me for a modification on my children's custody arrangement with my ex-husband. $4k and 10 months later, nothing had been filed, not one thing. I have primary custody, and I am not a a drug offender, or sleeze bag, I am and have been the primary ""parent"" for the last 15 years while my ex gets to be fair weather father. Craig did show up in court 2 times (Late) in response to actions my ex-husband filed, however, nothing happened. When I finally got so frustrated that I fired him, it took 2 months (and only then my citing him with the ethical code of conduct regulations in the state of CA) to get him to agree to hand over my complete file. The day I picked up my file from his office, his accounting for his time/services, was $75 more per hour than was on our original signed fee agreement. Then he tried to make me feel better about it by telling me he'd ""waive"" the outstanding balance. When I asked him what happened, for some reasonable explination, he made sure to first close the door on his confrence room that opened to the lobby and then,  his response was that he'd had a lot of staffing changes in his office and some of his cases had fallen through the cracks, mine included.No apologies not accountability, just plain you're SOL and thanks for the $4k attitude that I didn't earn.

I called RAB Performance, Mary Elliott's collection agency,  explained that they had processed someones paperwork, incorrectly entering the social security number of that person (this is exactly what the Treasury Dept. told me - even gave me her phone number) probably transposing numbers AND TURNED IT INTO MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER!!  Hence the State of Michigan was holding my tax refund until the mistake was corrected. Their response was ' sorry, unless you disclose your full social security number to us we can do nothing about this ' !! Even hung up one me. I'm 65, disabled, living on a fixed income.  I have paid my own way through my entire life, have never missed a payment nor been late with one,  and now, because of an inept collection agency/attorney, I am going to pay for someone who chose to live their life differently than I did.  I could give them my SS number but I am not comfortable doing that, nor do I think that I HAVE to.  It would probably cost me a whole lot more in the end than my tax refund.   ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

He interviewed well and i paid him $5000 to retain his services. we discussed things and made plans.  as time went on, he flaked out on us for a couple of meetings, and then after a few of those continuances had passed , he dropped out of communication altogether.  and i had serious court stuff to deal with. so his at the time  associate Aaron Rasmussen  apologized for Jeremies drop of communication ,and excused his associates behavior based on a family illness. but the receptionist said jeremy had been hospitalized.  i knew somebody was being deceitful right then.  but  Aaron Rasmussen , offered to  handle my case and if it went to trial he wouldnt charge us anymore to make up for jeremies conduct.   it turns out, to make the story short,  that jeremy was  being investigated at that time for misconduct unknown to me, but had then been  immediately  afterwards been put on disciplinary suspension by the WSBA . [continued below]....

So my fiancee and I RTO (rent to own) a home through a lender. Mr Hartwell is our lenders lawyer. Now our lender is an awesome man. We owe about $1,500 of our initial deposit still. Our lender told us we could pay it back over time just as long as we payed the principle there would be no problems with the title agency. Well turns out they were applying all of our money paid to the deposit and not our monthly mortgage. So now it looks like we are a couple months behind on rent. No big deal our lender said not to worry about it. I told our lender I would pay all of the past due balance with my tax return.  So I got my tax return feb 10th 2014. I was ready to pay and found out Albert put a freeze on my account. Now my lender did not tell Albert to do this. Nor did he tell Albert to put our account into a trustees auction. I called Alberts office to get this snobby woman on the phone. I asked to speak with Mr. Hartwell and then she gave me the drill of totally private questions leading me to believe that if I did not answer them I could not talk to the lawyer. Then I found out he wasn't even there and she was just being nosy digging through my personal business.  When I confronted her on it she said ""these are things the lawyer will want to know and ask you"". Upset now that I divulged confidential information to a secretary who is not held to an attorney client confidentiality contract. So now trying to find out how much the past due is so we can pay it ( remember i have cash in hand) my fiancee calls Albert and requests a breakdown of all past due charges. We obviously want something on paper showing what we owe now instead of just a verbal number over the phone. Albert responded ""I'll think about it"" and hung up on my fiancee.  So we called our lender and he said he has no clue what albert thinks he is doing but to call the title agency and get the past due from them. So we try but now they wont talk to anyone but Albert. So a few minutes later we get a phone call from Albert, he says I heard you called the title agency, they will mail you a statement. then again hung up on my fiancee before she could even say anything.

I was not a shooter, but was right in the middle of this critical incident. We were sequestered to the station where would await our interviews.  The shooting officer, and another witness officer, contacted FOP.  I had CPPA. I have a ""gold"" membership (i.e., covers criminal, civil, and adminstrative) and have been a member for over a decade, always paying my legal defense fees by automatic withdrawal every month.   I went to the Colorado Police Protective Association web-site to obtain contact phone numbers to get legal counsel. I called the local number and the 800 number. On each occasion, the message stated that if I was having a critical incident to hit ""7"".  I did so, and it rolled over to a CPPA message that asked me to leave a message. I even tried e-mailing them in desperation, but could not reach anyone.  It was supposed to roll over to their legal defense phone number, but apparently there was some kind of a problem with it.  As a result, when I needed assistance the most, during this one time in my career, I received absolutely no assistance.  I ended up doing my interview on my own. I was eventually contacted by the CPPA manager who basically accused me of lying. She admitted the web-site was confusing. If you go to it now, they've added a red link to the correct phone.  I asked for my money back, since I'd paid for service from them, and didn't receive it.  The president said she presented it to the board, and they refused to refund the money. They then strongly encouraged me to drop out of CPPA?? This puts me in a precarious position now because if I do drop them I won't have civil and administrative coverage for the rest of this incident. In essence, they really screwed up from the beginning, and now are trying to make me go away and cover the whole thing up.   I strongly encourage all police officers to NOT use CPPA.  When I needed them most they were not there for me.  When you've been involved in a critical incident, and you're afraid of legal, civil, and administrative ramifications, you CANNOT trust CPPA to take care of you.  I paid them a whole lot of money for absolutely nothing, and I encourage you not to make this same mistake.

Varner Sr. - and we do mean SENIOR in the largest sense of the word - has never met a catastrophic loss he wouldn't belly up to.  When he shows up, you know that professional negligence and catastrophic loss are about to go down. And go down hard. Sometimes it's just the threat of it all. You know how that works, right? ""Super lawyer"" James Varner Sr. shows up, and all of a sudden deals are being made, stories are suddenly more or less credible, depending on which side you're on, and suddenly Big Jimbo is walking out with a big, fat settlement. Keep your eyes on him and your hand on your wallet. This man truly is a master illusionist. This southern-fried catastrophic loss thief is big on superlawyers.com. He's the best - just ask his legal buddies who ""weigh"" in on that for him, giving him glowing marks. Some great back-slapping going on there. On superlawyers.com,  lawyers just can't say enough good things about each other. Five-star experience? Absolutely! (By the way, have you ever seen a one-star rating on superlawyers.com?) Every profession should have one of these, don't you think? Why stop at super lawyers? Why not super accountants, super morticians, super truckers, super checkers, super tellers, super barbers? And they can all rate themselves five stars and be at the top of their professions. Makes sense, right?  Give me a break. Trust me, you're better off without Varner Sr. in your life. Your wallet will thank you. ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

Portland, Oregon United States of America ",,503-228-8448,"Charles J. Pruitt Attorney Portland  Wyse Kadish Wyse Kadish LLP Discrimination  Portland , Oregon"," Attorney James N. Riley? More like comedic actor John C. Reilly. James N. Riley of the Clarksburg, West Virginia law firm of McNeer, Highland, McMunn & Varner LC seems to think he can get away with the same, inappropriate twisting and misrepresentation of facts that he's always done simply because he's been doing it for so long. Same as John C. Reilly, he of the inappropriate and uncomfortably twisted roles in movies like ""Talledega Nights,"" ""Step Brothers"" and ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" - among others. Reilly the actor is often uncomfortably funny. Riley the attorney is uncomfortably annoying. He takes great relish in taking facts out of context and blowing up insignificant details trying to make them seem crucial. But what really gets annoyingly uncomfortable is when he takes ordinary, everyday behavior and twists it to seem somehow wrong. Come to think of it, Riley the attorney kind of morphs into Reilly the actor when you imagine how he does his job. Imagine Riley the attorney questioning someone about an everyday, ordinary thing, like brushing teeth. Imagine the questioning at a deposition or at a trial where he's trying to twist and turn and question every nuance about brushing teeth:  ""Tell me, how many times a day do you brush? Really? Why only twice? Do you think that's enough? Shouldn't you brush after every meal? And how many brush strokes? Well why don't you know how many? How long does it take you? You don't know that, either? Why not? Don't you think that's important to know these kinds of things? What kind of toothpaste do you use? Why? Are you getting a kickback on that? (Do you use coupons?) Do you think that's an ethical thing to do?"" Could sound like a dialogue John C. Reilly would have in a movie. But you can see how it would go. Under a lawyer like Big Jim Riley's accusatory questioning, almost any ordinary thing can be made to seem criminal. And that's the crux of it. Stretching the truth is not lawyering' it's stretching the truth. And misrepresenting facts is not lawyering; it's misrepresentation of facts. It's malpractice.  Sound familiar Big Jim?

In fact, she will do more damage to a case and to her unfortunate cleints( victims) than anything else--not withstanding other corrupt lawyers in her circle of co-defendants. Karen Rose is a despicable, lying, detestable woman and should give up her joke of a law degree. Here is an excerpt from a complaint by another one of her many miserable former clients: Attorney Karen Rose, You have showed yourself up by coming to one of the most public sites (this same site, but on a different page) and popular forums and, by your own hands, have committed career suicide. You have got to be one of the stupidest human beings EVER. You, YOURSELF, had the gall to come here and publicly reveal case info about a client! From all that I (and the rest of the world) have read here, alone, I can tell that that client was and is a very decent, good person who, like so many other women in a bad relationship, got caught up with a loser biyfriend and the loser biyfriend then hired a filthy, crooked lawyer (Arthir Corona) who whored himself out for the money and has tried to make this (former) client of your miserable.

But I'm sure she hasn't let it get her down and that she's intelligent enough to do much better. I hope that that client writes a FORMAL COMPLAINT to the BAR Association about you--in fact, I will take it upon myself to locate and inform this former client of yours about the horrendously unethical and illegal move that you pulled here and I will advise her to file the complaint. You are a low-down, disgusting ""lawyer,"" as you like to be referred to. To call you a pig is charitable. After this, I cannot imagine any one who would want to hire you in any capacity--or will you be spewing some lies to a potential client, in order to get him/her to hire you IN PITY? Additionally, from the testimonies of so many other unhappy people, about you, it is evident that you are a lonely divorcee, a miserable old alcoholic and a LOSER. So many losers running around in this world, and you're just another one of them. A law degree can be bought--that never made anyone a lawyer. It's integrity and dignity and hard work and at least trying to play by the rules that makes someone an attorney--something that you'll never be. Karen Rose, a crooked attorney and a corrupt shmuck.   As you can see, this is the type of horrible attorney Karen Rose (aka Karen Ilene Rose, of Los Angeles) is.

I think he goes by the nickname of “Slick.” Check him out with a Google search and check him in linkedin also and see who his buddies are, crooks like Chad Pratt and other scammers at the real estate law center pc, also check his face book page. It is obvious now since Pratt was busted and is on trial by the Ca State Bar on NUMEROUS CHARGES of misconduct and a lot more. These Pirates have been scamming people out of millions of dollars for several years with other firms they worked for with no track record of doing anything but take peoples money. It looks like the Pirate Ship is manned by a bunch of Lame Duck Lawyers who’s Cannons Are Getting Limpy. They all are going to go down with the Pirate Ship and hopefully there will be some money refunded to us by the State Bar which has a fund for that against crooked lawyers. There Pirate Booty consists of BMW’s, Mercedes, property in North Hollywood and other cities along with other numerous toys! Do some research, they have a toy trail, just poke around, it’s all public record. When the California State Bar is done with these frauds I am going to sue each and every one of them for whatever I can and for whatever punitive damages I will be awarded. They don’t deserve fancy automobiles, property or toys bought with the money they stole from us. If any of you folks want to see justice served and make sure they get what they deserve, SUE THEM, SUE THEM RIGHT OUT ONTO THE STREET, destitute without so much as a back seat from a Mercedes to sleep on and let them eat out of the dumpsters behind the all you can eat buffet’s. They certainly don’t have any problem with people they stole money from having to do that very same thing. While they are living “High On The Hog” the people they stole from are “living in the gutter.” I am a disabled Vet and when I get kicked out of my house I’m heading down to Southern California in my walker followed by the News Media, “Tweeting All The Way” to Yervand Arzakanyan’s house to squat in his front yard.

My son's car was T-boned at an intersection having no stop signs, he was there first, and proceeded through.   And then was hit on his passenger side door.  He entered the intersection first thereby giving him the right-of-way.  That is the law. Christie Krupp never interviewed my son to get the facts.   According to the Internet (I googled her) she claims to have worked for 4 states attorneys so she understand plea bargaining.  What she didn't understand was we didn't want our son our son being blamed by our insurance company for the accident, and getting the court case dropped would be a good first step.  So entering a guilty plea is how she ""defends"" cases???   She got bullied by the states attorney and buckled at the knees.   Or maybe she was just helping him (possibly a friend?) to get a high conviction rate at the expense of my son.   We hired her to win, we can lose by ourselves without hiring a lawyer. AAA Motor Club ONLY  reimburses members for attorney fees IF you win the case, so thanks to Christie we cannot get reimbursed for legal defence.  Bargaining with the states attorney with a guilty plea is NOT my idea of how a lawyer should represent a simple traffic case. DO NOT hire Christie Krupp unless your objective is to have her enter a guilty plea, and you pay fines and court costs, and you pay her too.   Hire a shark, not a wimp.  Hire an established law firm, not someone working out of their home. On the other hand if you just hit the lottery and want to throw around some money then hire Christie Krupp.  Perhaps instead just throw the money in the garbage because if you hire Christie Krupp that is where its going.  ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

McQuarrie Hunter LLP
Mr. Bettencourt was retained by our family for a simple legal matter.
Mr. Bettencourt manipulated specific line items related to the transaction he was retained to represent in our best interest when Mr. Bettencourt noted that his fees were not likely to be covered in the normal course of the transaction due to what appeared to be a shortfall of funds in what could only be described as a challenged transaction.
When questioned specifically about the line items during the execution of the legal documents specific to the transaction Mr. Bettencourt chose to scapegoat the attorney acting for the other party which later proved to be false.
Mr. Bettencourt coerced us to execute our acceptance of the terms, stating that we would likely be sued by the other party if we refused to do so in a timely fashion. [continued below]....
									
										.....
What makes this such a violation of trust and ethics is when questioned about specific details leading up to the closing of the deal, Mr. Bettencourt became cross and stated that he had no time for such minutia, essentially dismissing our concerns as trivial and not deserving of his time or effort.
His petulant behavior persisted when challenged post closing as he became evasively abrupt and terminated the conversation.
Despite several attempts to correct the disparity related to our transaction Mr. Bettencourt has closed our file dismissing us and our losses.
He has hurt our family tremendously and has demonstrated NO REMORSE for his actions despite his informed knowledge of how greatly this has affected our family.
It was shortly after determined that there was indeed no shortfall related to the transaction and that Mr. Bettencourt had miscalculated items already accounted for by the other party, adding incompetence to his character profile.
Mr. Bettencourt has made no effort to correct these matters despite several requests to do so by all parties involved.
He presents as a professional but is anything but. Mr. Bettencourt cannot be trusted and should be 
held up for examination by his peers for this gross misconduct and breach of his responsibility to his clients.
Be extremely cautious when dealing with Mr. Bettencourt as he clearly only cares about the color that lines his pockets.
While I am certain that this matter will never be righted, I am hopeful that this post will serve as a warning to others when given the opportunity to chose whether or not to do business with Mr. Christopher J. Bettencourt or his firm as they clearly do not stand for what is just.									",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"," Codilis & Associates, P.C., and their attorneys Ernest Codilis, Adam Codilis, and other associates represent several banks in Illinois, filing hundreds, perhaps thousands of Foreclosure actions against homeowners in the Cook County Circuit Court.  These attorneys are ruthless, careless and casuse damages to helpless homeowners that come up against them and their principals.  I have seen where they did not follow foreclosure rules, public notices in accordance to the rules,laws.   When the court orders a Sheriff Sale, they make arrangements outside of court and have their agents, Judicial Sales Inc., a private company hold the Foreclosure Sale, and they are not licensed in Real Estate or hold an Auctioneer license.  Therefore, they are not licensed to hold foreclosure sells, or auctions on behalf of third parties, but they do thanks to their principals. Codilis & Associates, P.C.,contracts, hire rogue agents, like Meeker Real Estate Inc., that registered their corporation with the state of Illinois, however, they did not obtain a business license since the date they opened their doorsin the Village of Lansing a few years ago.  Then there is Team Reo Inc., also a registered Illinois corporation, however, they too, did not obtain a business license from the Village of lansing. Both companies are owned by Steve Miller, a Indiana resident. Codilis & Associates, P.C., have the hook up on rogue agents, that aid them in wrongfully evicting tenants, home owners from residential properties, done specifically by their eviction agents, Team Reo, Inc., incognito. They wear no uniforms, carry no employee identifiication, have no business cards, give no names and drive personal vehicles.  No one knows who they are, or where they come from, they do a quick job and quickly disapear.  They need no license to do evictions! The agents of Codilis & Associates, P.C., come in different disguises aiding/abetting them in their ruthless, reckless deeds.  They do business with a foreign Texas Corporation, National Mortgage Association Inc,, that has not registered their business in Illinois.  Through the works of Codilis & Associates, P.C., some foreclosed real estate is deeded to this unregistered foreign corporation through agents, Judicial Sales Inc..  Real Estate attorneys very well know that a corporation has to be registered with the Secretary of State in Illinois in order to do business in this state, file foreclosures and own real estate.  They think they are invisible and above the law and are exempt, when in fact they are not.  They have been exposed to the light, the truth!  Codilis & Associiates, P.C., will stop at nothing to make a buck seperating some wrongfully foreclosed real estate owners from their property and rights.  They are also known act through their above named agents to hire illegal Mexican immigrants and pay them to baby sit vacant foreclosed houses when they see that they have a problem foreclosed owner on their tails.   They recorded a deed to Mr Sanchez, did not state that he is married and may have taken $39,000 in untraceable cash from him for the Phoenix property:  841  E 152nd Street, Phoenix, IL  60426, There is no mortgage lien recorded and they neglected to pay off my $100,000 lien, through their other agents Attorneys' Title Guarranty Fund Inc, in Illinois.  This title company and Judicial Sales Corporation Inc., are both owned by Illinois attorney Augusta Butera.   I hope some day soon, the court will enter an order forcing banks through their agents named herein, to turn over possession of all wrongfully foreclosed homes back to it's owners due to fraud and harassment.  Perhaps a class action might be put on the table for damages, loss, grief, etc., they caused to others.                                                               No Justice, No Peace!

In 2002 I hired the law firm Margolis , Friedman & Moses LLP, to represent me in a WC case.   Attorney Mitchell R. Friedman from this law firm handled my case, and did nothing until 2010  when I fired him( no insurance, no medicine). In 2003, I did a huge mistake to hire the same law firm for another personal injury case with a broken left ankle and left hip due to the landlord’s negligence. Mr. friedman was not fighting for my justice; he was working for my adversary, the insurance’s carrier-Risk Management Planning Group and his illegal interests. He hate me. I was afraid to go in his office when he invited me. Always he yelled at me, screamed at me, verbally and sexually abused me.  Once a young lawyer from his office tried to stop him. No way.             Mr.  Friedman did not respect the Courts’ Orders, betrayed me, manipulated the deposition of Dr. Kosovich ( now fugitive), Dr. Head and Portnow at his mercy. Refused to submit my Reply Affidavit at Dr. Head, Dr. Portnow false affirmation in their medical reports and deposition done under oath.               My lawyer was very active to destroy my case, to humiliate me, to harass me, to insulted me, to put me down every time. He never was happy when I brought evidences. Now I understand very well why he was so unprofessional with me.  He invited me many times in his office only to verbally and sexually to harass me. I have to survive with the doctors sympathy, sample for medicine, and later with the Governmental help.  He invited me in his office in 2009, and told me if I want to win the case , I must to come in his office “ afternoons   to work at my case”.  I refused. Than  Mr. Friedman  started to terrorize me  with his vocabulary, screaming at me, with his threatening that  all my doctors will betrayed me, that  the judge did not like me .  He told me Dr.  Kosovich will betrayed me, and many doctors also because they lost my  file. Additionally, he mentioned from my money provided from settlement I have to pay him and the lawyer who started the case on 1997. On December 7, 2009, I wrote to my lawyer, Mr. Friedman a letter because he did not stop the harass me, to abuse me, where I said:             “ …Please handle professional my case. As I wrote I refuse any   settlement. The insurances wants now settlement. Where was the  insurance in all this years? What knows the insurances about my                 disparate depression, about my pain, humiliation, nightmares, and insomnia? I am broken and broke. The emotional and physical scars and traumas of stigma as a person with veteran history in antidepressant ……. , are the fabric on my bad life.              Once energetic and confident, I have become unsure, and a battle apathy, full of disparate thoughts. Please do not insult my sad situation. To be more familiar with my reality,  send you in exhibit a very clear situation( Exhibit 1,2,3,4,5,6). I want to know why Dr. Portnow and Dr. Head saw in me a“ wealthy woman, wealthy“? …… be aggressive with the insurance who sent me in this miserable situation.             Do you have any idea what means to be accepted by doctors (some) only by sympathy for years? Where was the insurance? You really hurt me with this insistent settlement. Are you on my side? I want the judge‘s Decision!....“. ( Claimant‘s EXHIBIT R- Pg. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10). Mr. Friedman continued to call me , to scream at me , to harass me and to threaten me  that I will lose my case. On December 28, 2009, I wrote to Mr. Friedman:                         “ I received your letter dated December 21, 2009. I am very ill, and I do  not have sincere energy to talk with you, or met you. You only scream at     me, tried to intimidate , to threaten, and put me down in front of your   staff.                          I apologies, but for third time when I wrote you, I refuse any settlement(  first $ 30, 000, and after $ 5, 000). I want judge’s justice, and  if you feel    malpractice( as Dr. Portnow at all., ) .....                       It is enough to be very sick and with a lot of personal  problems. I do   not have power to faith with my lawyer  for my rights. After my court  deposition , you are changed 180 grade…..         I did not understand why Dr.   Caronna did not give deposition? If some doctors lost the file is not a   crime, you have their reports which I provided you.   .... ( Claimant EXHIBIT R, Pg. 1B). And Mr. Friedman started aggressively to sabotage my case. Only a few example: In 2002 the Risk Managing Planning Group ( The  Respondent, The adversary)  , paid Dr. Miskin to evaluate me for two times. The doctor  filed a report in my favor. My lawyer,  in retaliation because I did not answer at his sexual advances,  after 7 years in cross examination precluded my adversary   insurance ‘doctor’s report which was in my favor as: Questions did by Mr. Friedman[ my lawyer, my adversary]:  Q:        Doctor, when you took your history from the claimant, did you    take into account her presentation to you regarding her mental  status?  A:        Yes. Q.        Okay. And did you believe her. A:        Yes. Mr. Friedman:             “ Okay. I have no more questions of the doctor, except that  we’re reserving our right to   have the doctor’s reports and his   testimony stricken.  I believe that based the  filling    dates at the          board for both reports, that they were not filed within ten    business days of the date of the examination required by Section   137 of the Worker’s Compensation Board. Under the  circumstances we reserve our right to have those reports stricken  as a matter of right and the doctor’s testimony”.              (WC -Deposition Document ID # 159851567- Pg. 10.  L. 2 to 10. And Pg. 11. L9 to 23).  The Insurance’s Carrier lawyer said:    “At the request of claimant’s counsel to cross examine Dr. Miskin, the doctor was scheduled to be deposed on 11/30/09. It is noteworthy that Mr. Friedman questioned the doctor solely on the filling of his reports. He has requested the preclusion of his reports“. Gorman& Rankin PC- Rebuttal Application-  Page ,  Paragraph , April 2, 2010.    My ex- lawyer instead to fight for my justice, he was fighting to destroy    my case.  In this way he  corrupted my 7 years doctor, Dr. Kosovich ( now fugitive) to do false affirmations under oath inclusive with self-incrimination.   The Insurance’s Carrier lawyer said:    “ The facts already in evidence are in direct conflict with his testimony” Gorman& Rankin PC- Rebuttal Application- Page 7 ,  Fifth  Paragraph , April 2, 2010.         “Dr. Kosovich was deposed on 12/2/09. ….After deposition of this witness, we were able to secure his office notes“. Gorman& Rankin PC- Rebuttal Application-  Page 6, Seventh Paragraph , April 2, 2010.                                      Why this conflict? Who paid for this false testimony?   Why Dr. Kosovich assumed so much risk? Who is interested in this “conflict with his testimony?” This conflict  of testimony confirm the Dr. Kosovich diagnosis.  After  the decision was done, I went in court and I read the deposition. I was petrified. After, in the same day I saw Dr. Kosovich and Mr. Friedman and secretly I recorded the conversation. Mr. Friedman accused Dr. Kosovich by  killing my case, and Dr. Kosovich accused Mr. Friedman to be a bad lawyer, and because did false affirmation under oath, inclusive with self incrimination , now is fugitive from United States. I did an Appeal as Pro Se, and I submitted documents ignored, or not filed by Mr. Friedman. The Insurance’s Carrier lawyer said:        “ We further respectfully submit that as this claimant has submitted 587 pages of documentation to the Board, any new evidence she has submitted should not be considered………that she and her lawyer attorney had ample opportunity to do so and that no good reason having been shown for said evidence not being produced earlier;…  Gorman& Rankin PC- Rebuttal Application-  Page 3, Fourth Paragraph , April 2, 2010.     I pledged the evidence to be accepted, and I asked that Mr. Friedman  to explain why he orchestrate this charade with my case, why he ignored the court’s orders, why he did not submitted all my evidences ?, why he was protective with the doctors false affirmation,  as Dr. Head, Dr. Portnov, Dr. Kosovich who falsifieed bthe truth under oath?, Why he gave to the insurances carrier possibility to say: “was offered in a complete vacuum”.               Mr. Friedman did not represented me, he asked me to work for his interests, otherwise no make sense why he did not use and filed my Reply Affidavit at doctors false affirmations, why did not filed my  Affidavit with work search, my résumé, per court order, or the Dr. Mooney medical report ? WHY? And as intentional obstruction of justice, ex-lawyer refused to submit Dr. Mooney medical reports sent him by fax and brought also personally in his office. He was so full of anger, hate, discrimination, malpractice, unprofessionally when he saw because Dr. Mooney treated me before 2003. Also, Doctor Cocioba sent me in 2002 at his friend Mr. Friedman to take my case.  Now Mr. Freidman together with the insurances carrier precluded and Dr. Cocioba’s medical reports to ruined my case, and who refused to give deposition. The insurances carrier said:    “ Dr. Cocioba was scheduled to be deposes on 1/8/10.…….The claimant’s attorney has disputed the method of service on the doctor……A formal record had been made seeking the doctor’s preclusion and requesting that all of his reports on file be stricken from record”…..  Gorman& Rankin PC- Rebuttal Application- Page  9 , Third, Fourth, Fifth  Paragraph , April 2, 2010”        My lawyer, together with the Insurances lawyer tendentiously, and illegally,  ignored my robust evidence to destroy my case:     The Insurance’s Carrier lawyer said:    “We submit the doctor’s opinion on casual relationship was offered in a complete vacuum… Gorman& Rankin PC- Rebuttal Application- Page 7, Sixth  Paragraph , April 2, 2010.    The vacuum was created by my lawyer and the insurance lawyer who refused to see the evidences filed a few years ago, and refused to take deposition from my doctors who treated me for years, but took deposition from one who saw me once , and did not have any medical record, and my lawyer did not provided a copy from the file. The Insurance’s Carrier lawyer said:        “ …..The claimant also indicated that she received psychiatric treatment at North General Hospital. Those  records have never been produced. …… Gorman& Rankin PC- Rebuttal Application-  Page 5, Fifth Paragraph , April 2, 2010.    The Insurance’s  Carrier lawyer  must to have a huge courage to  insult the  court with false affirmations.  How the insurances lawyer can afford to say: ”Those  records have never been produced.”?, and must be punished for her acts.             The North General Hospital’s document was submitted in Board’s file on September 5, 2006 under Document  ID # 118755300), Dr Scott Ira and Dr. Komissarowa Document ID  # 118755299, 118770148 content 68 pages.             How was possible the insurances‘ lawyer did not see this evidences on file, ( over 100 pages), instead they[ Mr. Friedman and  Gorman& Rankin PC ]saw Dr. Konecky’s  report, only 3 pages ? This doctor saw me only one time on 2001. Unfortunately , as I said before, I am not a celebrity, or a beauty. How was possible this doctor (who shredded     already the medical evidence from 2001) to remember me in 2010?   Why my lawyer did not fax him his report for recollection since the WC paid him $400 for deposition? Why did not ask the doctor about his report? Why? From Deposition:       Q:        Doctor in the course of your profession practice did you have occasion to see the   claimant ………? A:        I don’t recall. Q:        Do you have any record with respect to this lady? A:        No. Q:        Do you have something possible under the name ……..? A:        No. Q:        Do you have recollection of ever treating such a person? A:        No. Q:        Okay. A:                    Mr. Friedman: I don’t think I have any…..  Dr. Knoecky Deposition Pg. 6, L 14 to 25 and Pg. 7, L. 1 to 3.  WCB # 161104…)               Maybe the Insurance’s lawyers consider to be above the law, to falsify so visible  the truth,  and has a “special and hyper nerves“  to lie about the North General Hospital medical reports.              Mr. Friedman  was not fighting for my justice, he was working for the Insurance’s Carrier and his illegal interests. He hate me. I was afraid to go in his office when he invited me. Always he yelled at me, screamed at me, verbally abused me. Once a young lawyer from his office tried to stop him. No way.                                 My lawyer was very active to destroy my case, to humiliate me, to harass  me, to insulted me, to put me down every time. He never was happy when I brought evidences. Now is light in my brain why he was so unprofessional with me. My WC lawyer Mr. Mitchell R. Friedman sabotaged totally unprofessionally my case. He precluded the insurances’ doctor who was in my favor.  He ignored the court’s orders  to bring my Work Search ( I sent him as Affidavit). He refused to file my Reply Affidavit at Dr. Head.ad and Dr. Portnow false medical report. He  manipulated Dr. Kosovich ( now fugitive) who falsified his deposition inclusive with self-incrimination . Same with Dr. Portnow, Dr. Head. Attorney Mitchell Friedman verbally and sexually harassed me.  He used me as a credit card, as his asset. For this from a proposal settlement of $30, 000.00 in final I got nothing due my lawyer and the insurances's lawyer. Supplementary, after I fired my  lawyer, the insurances lawyer  had  the courage under oath to falsify the truth by saying  they served me a true copy  of Rebuttal  WCB Document ID  # 207822299. I was NEVER served with any Rebuttal from the Law Office Gorman & Rankin as I mentioned in my Letter  sent to Office of Appeal on April 12, 2013 .                           REGARDING 2003 ACCIDENT.    I felt on the steers my building in 2003,  due the negligence of the constructor’s  company. I have broken left ankle and hip since. The Lenox Hill hospital under Mr. Friedman direction falsified the medical report.   Later the neighbors told me another women fail a week before me.  Both of us had Mr. Michael Friedman as lawyer. After, a year and ½ . Mr. Friedman,  “ miraculously” breached the contract with me and keep only the WC . I do not know about another woman because she left the building immediately.              The case was taken by another lawyer who again “ miraculously” lost the statute of limitation. Maybe they have any knowledge I must to die , and for this reason  did not file evidence as affidavits in court, and my landlord continue to intoxicate me.   In 2011 after MRI , the doctors asked me to bring my 2003 X Ray at left ankle, and they saw broken ankle. I contacted the hospital who gave me their insurances The RISK MANAGEMENT PLANING GROPUP, same with my WC  carrier  insurances.  I was contacted by the RISK MANAGEMENT PLANING GROPUP’s  lawyer, who told me that she will help me if I will bring my X Rays. I said “ no problem” and I went at TD Bank , at my safe deposit box to take my X rays. BAD SURPRIZE ! WAS STOLEN!.  ( I have an open complaint with Consumer Financial product).  After repeated violations at  my Safe Deposit Box at TD Bank I closed the account. After a while, “ good people “ put  part of the stolen evidences from my safe deposit box in storage.  I called the RISK MANAGEMENT PLANING GROPUP’ s  lawyer and I told her  that I found the X Ray. And she told me : “ Sorry, is too late.  The statute of limitation from when you discovered the malpractice is over”. I anticipated this answer, because all my evidences with broken ankle and hip disappeared by being  stolen by interested people.  Mr. Friedman, the RISK MANAGEMENT PLANING GROPUP’s  lawyer, and the landlord ( GLENCORD BUILDING CORP who poisoned me with Carbon Monoxide and toxic gases), are not strangers in all these illegal acts.  At this time I still have medical bill for physical therapy  l unpaid. Otherwise my ex- lawyers could provide the building’s  insurance for  treatment. But they  did not, also Mr. Friedman  did not for my WC case .             Attorney Mitchell R. Friedman  pushed me in bankruptcy, eviction, collection, and now again in collection.  He did not care about my broken ankle and hip about my heath problems. He cared about his subjective and illegal interests. He  orchestrates all my lawyers to do illegal acts ( inclusive 3 lawsuit with forgery in my name, a life insurances and assets for half millions also with forgery in my name- what I know at this time). I decribed it before in Ripoff reports about GLENCORD and MERCK. He was sure I will pass away (I will died ) with the GLENCORD BUILDING CORPORATION criminal acts to poison me with Carbon Monoxide and Toxic gases. He calculate everything to fraud American Government. Nor my WC case is took by SpECIAL FOUND, who filed also an appeal  because was an mistrial at Mr. Friedman and Gorman& Rankin PC MERCY.   Because of the deliberate, unjustifiable, unethical, without integrity, and bad intentional nature ( criminal),  in conspiracy I pledge for Justice and People with Power to set appropriate punitive damages in an amount sufficient to punish Attorney Mitchell R. Friedman, the Gorman& Rankin PC and the doctors who falsified the truth under oath ( in my WC  case) for theirs  conduct , and to establish an example to deter others attorneys, doctors, insurances from similar conduct.    Sincerely,   ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

He missed court deadlines for filing paperwork, blamed his paralegal for not knowing about a hearing date, and admittedly had suspicious billing that he eventually deducted from out balance. His excuse for why this was ok: ""I gave you 30% off.""

Los Angeles, California United States of America ",www.fentonnelson.com,(310) 444-5244,"Harry Nelson of Fenton Nelson LLP Harry Nelson and the disastrous financial consequences from his misrepresentations Los Angeles, California"," Disreputable attorney, David E. Bamberger of the firm Brickman & Bamberger, 317 Madison Avenue, New York, NY, persists in engaging in deceit, dishonesty, misrepresentation and deception in his practice of law despite being advised that it is a misdemeanor punishable by a year incarceration as well as the imposition of treble civil penalties to the injured party pursuant to Judiciary Law 487 for an attorney to engage in deceit with the intention to deceive the court or a party to a judicial action. David Bamberger doesn't get it and commits deceit and outright prevarication in his Memo's of Law with abandon in order to prevail in a case he should lose. For example, he bolds entire passages and sentences of his adversaries emails and letters which he includes in his papers without adding ""emphasis added"" to deceive the court into the erroneous believe that these boldings are in the original with the intent of sullying his adversary by making him look indecent with the intent of prejudicing the court against him. He also cites an erroneous decision of a judge in another case which he knows is wrong to prejudice the court against his adversary as well as falsely claiming that the case before the court which is a simple contract dispute is a ""revenge case"" falsely calling the plaintiff a ""Master of Revenge"" and that ""revenge"" is ""a leading vocation of his"" in yet further effort to prejudice the court against his adversary. David Bamberger knows full well that he has a losing case where his client is in the wrong so he engages in this conduct such as described above to seek to win at any cost despite being warned that this will bring him a Judiciary Law 487 action against him. This is very stupid of him. However David is a very stupid attorney. He complained to the court in his Memo of Law that his adversary told his client, wine educator Harriet Lembeck, that he is the stupidest lawyer he had ever encountered in his forty years of litigation for his putting her last name as his last name in the RJI, among other things. Even more stupid and proving this is that in his motion to dismiss, he stupidly neglected to include the Complaint rendering his motion defective making a denial a virtual certainty. David Bamberger is a pettifogger who is pure evil incarnate. His adversary is an well-known author of nine books, one of which David has read himself and highly regards, yet David calls him ""once respected"" in his Memo of Law. Then when this was complained of he admitted that he is wrong and says that he will amend his papers to fix this yet with more than a week going by he has done nothing with his Memo of Law e-filed on the Internet with the potential of it going viral with this evil statement in it. Shame on him. David Bamberger knows full well that his evil manner of lawyering has potential repercussions on his client but he does not seem to care. Slamming his adversary with derogatory stuff in his papers is more important to him than the concerns of his client, wine educator Harriet Lembeck David Bamberger is a very bad man. Harriet Lembeck is a lawless, common criminal (albeit uncharged or convicted) who has broken the liquor laws for some thirty years by serving wine at her Wine & Spirits Program wine school at 203 E 29th Street New York City without a liquor license committing upwards of thirty criminal misdemeanors a year for which she can be arrested and go to jail. She conducts her commercial enterprise out of a building owned by her husband, William Lembeck, which is a residential townhouse which they falsely registered as residential some thirty years ago when they should have obtained a Commercial Certificate of Occupancy as they intended to use it for her wine school. Harriet and her husband, William, have little regard for the laws, rules and regulations of our civilized society, so it seems. Harriet Lembeck has been asked numerous times if she intends to obey the law and relocate her wine school to a licensed premises and still has not answered the question despite these numerous requests. The conclusion is inescapable that she intends to conduct the classes she lists on her Internet web site, www.wineandspiritsprogram.com as scheduled starting on September 9, 2013 serving wine without a license as has been her practice for some thirty years. Readers of this posting are urged to determine if she will be conducting the class by calling Harriet at the number listed below and if she is they should contact the 17th precinct of the New York Police Department at 7 p.m. on September 9, 2013 and demand that a police officer be sent to the location and that Harriet Lembeck be arrested and taken away in handcuffs for liquor law violations.

Attorney Joe Young has treated me and my case unethically and it's sad that an attorney, who has the ability to make money honestly in the second largest city in the US, has resorted to ripping off clients to fatten up his bank account. READ THE ONLINE REVIEWS! Joe Young has numerous negative online reviews that elaborate on his unethical and immoral behavior reuslting in the loss of his cleints retainer with absolutely no progress in their cases. I did not read his reviews before opening my checkbook to Mr. Young and I'm sorry I didn't. That falls entirely on my own shoulders and have no one to blame except myself! I hired Joe young 12 months ago to handle a simple Wage and Penalties claim with my former employer. I found Joe Young through Bill Handel's ""Handel on the Law"" website advertised on radio station KFI in Los Angeles. I mistakenly believed that Bill Handel's team would have vetted this attorney before allowing him to advertise on his site, however I was very wrong.  In my personal opinion Joe Young is nothing more than a shark on the prowl constantly looking for unsuspecting prey to chew up and spit out. I was treated with the utmost disrespect and was cursed at and told to shut up on the phone by this joker. I was actually hung up on twice by Young when I confronted him about the lies he was perpetuating with regards to my case . Since my case required action on the part of the Labor Commissioner's Office in Los Angeles, I finally contacted the Commissioner's office myself to get an update on my case. I could never get a straight answer from Young and was always told by his minions that they were waiting for a response from the Commissioner's office. When I finally got a hold of the Labor Commissioner I was told that a response to my case had been submitted to my attorney over two months ago. Yet neither Joe Young or any of his staff ever called to provide me that information. They skirted the issue constantly and continuously lied to me telling me that they were still waiting for a rsponse from the Commissioner's office. The reason he never informed me was obvious. The Labor Commissioner had no jurisdiction over my case and the letter clearly illustrated that. Because Young DID NOT KNOW THE LAW, he had no recdourse but to lie his way through it constantly telling me that they were waiting for a response from the Labor Commissioner's office. The Commissioner actually told me the following; ""And you said your lawyer practiced labor law? Wow, you would have thought he would have known the law and explained that to you before he filed the claim""! At best his ignorance on cases his firm is handling is a travesty of justice, at worst he his a liar and his staff has been trained to follow in his footsteps. I must reiterate the fact that this review is based on my personal opinion and experince with Young, I don't know if there are others who have experienced the same. Here I am a year later with absolutely no progress or resolution on my ""slam dunk"" Wage and Penalties claim, as Young put it. I have never heard of an attorney that tells his clents in an email that ""things are moving slowly at his law firm because he's going through a divorce which is occupying much of his time"". Seriously Mr. Young, are you frikken kidding me? Who gives a rats ass about your divorce? I went through a divorce too but never used that as an excuse for poor service or unethical behavior toward my clients. Like I told Mr. Young, I am now on a mission. I asked that he return my unused portion of my retainer but he just laughed that off. That's fine Mr. Young, no problem. I will use every legal resource avaialble to me to make sre not one more person falls prey to your ploys. I am a honest, hard working individual that doesn't have an enemy in the world!

LEXINGTON LAW FIRM,"  LEXINGTON LAW FIRM   360 North Cutler Drive 
North Salt Lake, Utah United States of America ",,800-341-8441,"LEXINGTON LAW FIRM  SCAMMED ME TOO North Salt Lake , Utah"," FOLLOWING THE PIRATE TRAIL Following the Trail of Pirates from the Real Estate Law Center PC, I found their Secret and how they are attempting to hide to avoid responsibility and prosecution! They are Yervand Arzakanyan, Chad Pratt, Deepak Sadashiv Parwatikar & others like them from this establishment. Here you go folks I am exposing the Pirates Lair if your are looking for information on any of the above keep on reading. The Pirates have plundered and pillaged for years and stolen countless amounts of money from consumers. I tuned-up my “Pirate Tracking Software” which does a specific search criteria for tracking Pirates and where and how they hide their names and booty. Real Estate Law Center PC in Los AngelesCalifornia is a registered corporation in California and is active and was registered on 8/18/2011. You can verify this and search for them at the California  Secretary of State website here: http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/ with their Entity Number of C3406727 make sure you select entity number for your search or search by their business name. OK. Here is where it gets interesting on the trail for the Pirates. After I locked the radar on to the Pirate Ship I traced the SS Crook’s stealthy Course I found their Agent For Service of Process is C.T. Corporation System with their jurisdiction in the State of Delaware and they have an address in New York City, Eighth Ave on the 13th floor. They are registered in the State of California, Secretary of State and their Entity Number is: C0168406 and is active. Here are some interesting facts; their incorporation date was 9/11/1936 and the listed Type is Foreign Stock. What is really interesting is there are 206 Companies with the same address in that building! Read further, it’s only the beginning! As we unlock the stealthy course of the SS Crook we find we have to go all the way back to Sacramento California. Why? I found their Agent For Service of Process for C.T. Corporation System from New York City is The Corporation Company, 555 Capitol Mall in Sacramento California, however they also show an address of 1232 Q Street first floor, Sacramento, CA 95814. As I was tracking the Pirates the radar blips were lighting up the entire screen! Alarm Bells were sounding with no less than 107,342 Entities Registered to The Corporation Company and most of those have a different Agent For Service of Process with a status mixture of Suspended, Surrendered, Dissolved, Forfeited, Merged Out and some showing Active. One name finally pops up, Richard F. Flynn, President, CEO, Director, Chairman/CEO, and Head Guy of aprox 300 Corporations. With addresses listed for C.T. Corporate System on Eighth Ave, 13 Floor in New York City. Richard F. Flynn also is listed in other addresses for other Corporations. It seems as though Mr. Flynn is some sort of a Broker to register Corporations and is most likely not responsible for the Real Estate Law Center PC. So who is? Good question, read on. That’s how they burry themselves check this next website and they tell you basically how to hide and not be responsible for your corporation. The Corporation Company has this website here at incorporate dot com. https://www.incorporate.com/?iq_id=46208064&utm_medium=ppc&utm_term=46208064&utm_source=msn&cid=46208064&campaign=ppc Now lets talk about Yervand Arzakanyan the new General Manager of the Real Estate Law Center PC. As I stated in a previous posting Yervand Arzakanyan is not a Lawyer, not a Real Estate Agent or Broker but a used car salesman from North Hollywood! Yervand Arzakanyans name pops up several places, a bogus website at yamg.com and another at autohighway.com where he is listed as President & CEO. The big problem is he has an association with the following: http://www.balancedlegalgroup.com/ which is another loan modification law group. Sounds fishy to me and here is why. They are not a corporation and nothing has been filed with the State of California. They are located in Los AngelesCalifornia. What is really interesting is the fact that Deepak Parwatikar is listed as the contact attorney. Deepak Parwatikar has had extensive disciplinary action by the State Bar of California starting in 2004, he has been suspended from practicing law at one point. Deepak Sadashiv Parwatikar State Bar #187683, was the principal with the Real Estate Law Center along with Chad Pratt, both fellow Pirates. There are 51 complaints against Deepak Sadashiv Parwatikar, Chad Pratt and the Real Estate Law Center PC for fraud against consumers that you can view at the rip off report dot com. They have a record of fraud complaints they have a history of taking peoples money and doing nothing. There are also numerous reports from other complaint sites on the Internet. Check the rip off report here….. http://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/search?body=deepak%20parwatikar. http://www.businessconsumeralliance.org/complaints/the-balanced-legal-group-13079386 more complaints here also. Oh yea, Mr. Arzakanyan,  is a member of the Rolls Royce Bentley Club Owners! Is that a perk for being a used car salesman? He’s styling with our money! Check back here as I dig more dirt on these Pirates I will post it and you can use the information to help sink their Pirate Ship the SS Crook!   ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

RA Law Group,"  RA Law Group  801 North Brand Blvd, Ste 250 
Glendale, California United States of America ",,818-230-3200,"RA Law Group  Ripoff Glendale, California"," Get involved with the law firm ""Cullen Weston Pines & Bach"" at your own expense. Timothy D. Edwards of Cullen Weston Pines & Bach is dirty, immoral, incompetent, and brainless lawyer which is actually turning out to work in my favor because someone who has sued me is being represented by him. It almost seems as though they work against their own clients.  A UW-Whitewater teacher is suing me over $900 because get this... she doesn't like that I described her as ""condescending,"" ""demeaning,"" ""degrading,"" ""insulting,"" ""verbally attacking"" in my Internet reviews of her, which I did because of her glaring behaviors towards me all spring semester 2013. Apparently, lawyer Timothy Edwards of Cullen Weston Pines & Bach thinks this is an actionable case and has taken it on for the teacher.  In taking on this lawsuit, Timothy Edward's first act of incompetence was incriminating himself and his client. In late November 2013, Edwards falsely accused me of ""threatening the teacher's life"" through an online review that I made of this teacher and that for this reason I needed to take all my reviews offline. I called the lawyer on his nonsense, stating that the review in and of itself would be hard evidence that he and the teacher are lying as all my review does is recount specified instances of misconduct from this teacher. Mr. Edwards was very quick to apologize, urging me to consider it an understandable mistake. Mind you, this entire correspondence was through e-mail so unfortunately for this law firm it's all verifiable. Boy, that's sure going to make the law firm, Timothy Edwards, and this teacher look really good when I present this all this to the courts.  I accepted Timothy Edward's apology for the false reports and slander--despite the fact that the lawyer never stated anything about going back to authorities and correcting these false reports he made against me (that the teacher was also in on according to him, who also never corrected the false reports). And despite my accepting his apology, Edwards wasn't done there. He took a new approach to get me to take down my online reviews of the teacher, focusing on how my reviews still needed to come down because they're ""disparaging,"" otherwise legal action would follow. When I refused, Timothy Edwards and the teacher went ahead with their lawsuit to be handled in September 2014 for a ludicrous $900 included with an expectation that I pay all their legal fees.  Since filing the lawsuit, Mr. Edwards has been harassing me, sending letters to my place of residence, demanding that I give him all the evidence that I will be using against them in court; demanding that I release a bunch of irrelevant information on my background, nothing to even do with the case; demanding that I release personal information (home addresses, numbers, etc.) of ""every single person"" who I've ever spoken to about the teacher and without their consent; etc. Friends and family who I've complained about this teacher to have gladly agreed to report this lawyer over to law enforcement for harassment and violation of their privacy. I've found all this harassment from Timothy Edwards to be shocking considering I have an actionable case against him for false reports and slander with evidence of this through e-mails. Because of all the harassment from Mr. Edwards following his apology, I have now informed Cullen Weston Pines & Bach that if they do not redress his false reports, slander, harassment and malicious prosecution that I will be pursuing their entire firm with a lawsuit. I am now awaiting a reply from this law firm. Thanks to the law firm incriminating their client, I now also have a claim against the teacher for slander as well that I will be reporting to her with.  At the end of the day, I am glad that the teacher/plaintiff chose this firm since it seems to be working against her rather than for her. The lawyer has not only incriminated himself but his client as well by stating that she was in on these false reports made to authorities. Again, best of all, this correspondence was all through e-mail so I have proof against Cullen Weston Pines & Bach and a case against them and the teacher.

They are LIARS. Redwood City, California"," Henry P. Wasserstein's mishandling of his client Harriet Lembeck's representation led to devastation of her wine school business and her career. He is a former long time partner and now of counsel of the prestigious ""fearsome foursome"" law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP law firm. A partner in a Wall Street law firm is of the view that his may constitute legal malpractice. See for yourself from the letter below. Henry has not given Harriet consent to enter into a friendly lawsuit against him and his firm nor has he cut her a check from his personal bank account as of this posting. ""Your former colleague, David Bamberger, called me the other day to inform me that he was representing the Lembeck's. We established an immediate rapport and amicable relationship and had an hour long conversation which I believe will lead to an amicable out-of-court resolution of all the issues concluding once and for all the forty year old saga between the parties if only the Lembeck's follow David's advice. He said that he didn't mind being tape recorded. Its a shame that you did not learn from David when he worked for you and behaved similarly as you could have spared the Lembeck's the considerable pain and heartbreak that stemmed from your representation. I suggested to David that as part of our settlement, that the Lembeck's assign to me their legal claims against you and the Skadden firm for legal malpractice. I conferred with a well respected Wall Street law firm over my theory of legal malpractice against you and your firm and was informed that there may very well be a colorable claim. The claim is as follows: You thoroughly researched my background on the Internet and in the Court records and were fully aware of everything about me, who I was and what I was capable of. You saw the Internet posting that I was the ""High priest of revenge."" That not withstanding, you proceeded to irk, irritate, disparage and annoy me by ignoring my communications with the consequence of demeaning and disparaging me and furthermore unfairly cited the Lewis Brisbois case after being warned not to do so after it was demonstrated to you that the ruling was unwarranted. The consequence of your behavior was extremely adverse and devastating to the Lembeck's as you were advised it would be. Your persistence in your egoistic behavior toward me constituted legal malpractice. Your failure to advise Harriet to revise her book constituted legal malpractice. Your refusal to respond to my communications to the detriment of your client constituted legal malpractice. The consequences of the foregoing to the Lembeck's included the following: Following your refusal to inform me as to whether or not Harriet Lembeck would revise her manuscript including answering the ""yes"" or ""no"" questions, a solicitation was sent to more than 300 wine writers including the membership of the Wine Media Guild requesting a quote to revise the manuscript. The solicitation included for the writers' analysis the story of the Smart Guide Publication's episode, the Pen and Pencil Publication's episode, a copy of Harriet's manuscript, a copy of the Smart Guide editor's reader report, the sale of the contract to me and my becoming Harriet's savior discontinuing the book's publication on the Internet as ""the worst wine book ever written"" and my deciding to publish it as a good book, hence the solicitation for a ghostwriter. I was able to find a ghostwriter who would create a Second Edition of the book for $29,000. You should have advised Harriet to revise the book and avoid this expense. Thus, you are guilty of legal malpractice on two fronts. Harriet's damage in this regard is $29,000. Your inappropriate citation of the Lewis Brisbois case prompted me to explore the legality of Harriet's wine and spirits school with the following consequences. Harriet has been illegally serving wine and spirits at her school without a wine license at her building at 203 E. 29th Street which is a residential apartment for twenty-three years. She can not obtain a wine or spirits license for that location. Consequently, she will have to discontinue her classes at that location and move them to a licensed facility such as a hotel or restaurant at significant expense. The cost of such a facility might make conducting her classes economically unfeasible and she may have to discontinue her courses. A complaint was lodged with the New York State Liquor Authority. She may be fined or imprisoned. This is all your fault. Similarly, the Certificate of Occupancy for the building is for a two family residence. This precludes business use. As such, she can not conduct her school from the premises at 203 E 29th Street. Furthermore, William will owe some twenty-three years in back taxes for the difference between residential tax assessment and commercial tax assessment for the building for which there will probably be a significant penalty. A complaint was made to the New York City Building Department as a consequence of your behavior. This is all your fault. A complaint was filed with the New York City Fire Department for fire code violations at 203 E. 29th Street. This is all you fault. David tells me that you and the Lembeck's go back a long way and that they will never sue you because they care about you. It you care about them like they care about you and give a damn about the fact that you have cost them a large amount of money, damages in the significant six figures, you should care enough to volunteer your firm's legal malpractice insurance to cover their losses by telling them that they have your approval to sue you and the firm in a friendly legal malpractice lawsuit. Alternatively, you can just write the Lembeck's a check from your personal bank account. You are a very wealthy attorney, having been a partner at Skadden since its early days. The several hundred thousand dollars involved should be considered well spent considering the enormous satisfaction you received in irking, irritating, diminishing, belittling and disparaging me in your efforts to make me your supplicant, albeit unsuccessfully. One way or another, you need to make it up to the Lembeck's for bringing all this upon them with your untoward behavior. Don't arrogantly write to me that this is not all your fault. It was. I was there and know it for a fact. But for you, none of this would have occured. ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

I am writing this, even though years have passed since this incident occurred, because I want others to be aware of how this firm misrepresents how they counsel clients, just to make a buck.  It all began when I was told to come in their office and meet in person with what I assumed would be a BK attorney. That did not happen, and never did happen throughout the course of my dealings with them, not ever even a phone call from an attorney. I was sat down by a Salesman who proceeded to present himself as a 'counselor'. (This behavior should be considered fraud since Attorneys are also known as Counselors, but I'm not an Attorney so what do I know) At this point not knowing that he wasn’t an Attorney, I proceeded to give him my story regarding finances in the past, current, and immediate future forecast. I looked upon him as someone who knew what he was talking about and that he would be COUNSELING me on the best options given the details of my specific situation. He advised BK and took a fee of just over $2000. Before I left that day, he inadvertently exposed to me that he had a quota to meet in BK 'sign-ups' just like he did for loans 'back in the mortgage days'. I was shocked to hear this and even told him I wasn't comfortable with his advice now knowing he wasn’t an Attorney. He said to me something along the lines of ""This is just the initial consultation, (more Attorney lingo) I will give your info to our attorneys and they will then make sure WE have made the right decision for you"" Although I wasn't comfortable with him I figured I would hear something from the Attorney to go over all the information I had given, that never happened. I was told I would not get to speak with an Attorney until I had all my paperwork together needed for filing. Really? I wasn't even sure if I wanted to go BK at this point, let alone try and get mortgage deeds from the banks (banks fined for forging docs and robo-signing) and every other financial institution to which I owed money.  I made multiple attempts to reach an Attorney but kept getting blocked by the front desk. I asked for a refund since I never received a legitimate consultation, and that is when I received the only Attorney communication I was going to get....a form email from Kristin Lamar stating laws on how they can keep the fee, EVEN though I never met with an attorney and the only real communication I had was about 4 emails (for refund) and numerous calls to try to speak with an actual attorney about my situation. I guess they have that form email due to continuously having to ‘explain’ how you are not going to see and attorney, and not get your money back when that is not acceptable to you. Lesson learned to not do business with someone in it for the numbers, they don’t care about you, just your successful filing and fee so they can boast how much business they do.  In case you’re wondering why it took so long to post this: I recently received advertising email from Doan and it opened up an ""old wound"", then I Googled them to see if others had issues with them and I saw how they (Doan) tried to dismiss the other complaints on here as being from 'their competition', I knew I had to write something. Those other complaints are almost exactly the scenario I went through, so I know how it feels to be cheated and mislead by Doan.  Did I ever get a call from an Attorney, or an apology, or my money back? NO, and I didn't have the money or resources to fight it because I was considering BK.  Good luck in your search, I hope you find a firm who cares, these people clearly don’t.   ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

I asked him to confirm if its doable to file the H1b petition as its our first time filing the petition. He said its doable and asked my to make the payment. After he received the payment his attitude and behavior completely changed he did not answer calls, he did not respond to my emails he made me go to his office and wait. He did not give me a plan/schedule with timeline for different steps that need to be completed before filing H1B petition. He did not set a deadline for me complete any tasks that I had to perform. He did not follow up with me if I was delaying the process to meet the deadline. All of a sudden he started rushing when he realized that H1b quota is going to get filled up within the first week of April 2013. I told him if we had a plan to file the petition on April 1st, 2013 we don't have to worry whether the visa number are getting filled up faster or not. Due to improper planning our LCA was not approved when we filed our petition. Two days before we filed our H1b petition, I even pointed it out to him from USCIS website has mentioned that we file the H1b petition along with the approved LCA. He told me USCIS website is for general purpose only and does cover all specific situations. He told me to trust him. So we went ahead and filed the H1b petition. USCIS rejected our h1b petition for the reason that we did not submit a copy of the approved LCA. After USCIS rejected our H1b petition he failed to follow up with USCIS with our case specifics why USCIS rejected our petition instead of giving us an RFE based on the a specific rule or earlier case that made him to take that path.Peter does not have knowledge, understanding of USCIS procedures, policies and document requirements.

He promised he would personally handle my case and it would be finalized in 90 days or less. This was 11/12. Once he had my money I never heard from him again until about 3 weeks ago when he wanted another $4500. In the mean time there was supposedly a Marissa working on my file. I could never reach her, did not know her last name. I asked the receptionist if she even worked there or was a real person. She laughed and said she certainly was. Well, this went on for months. They had all of my documents to finish this up the first week. Finally I was contacted by Meghan. my new attorney from his office. She actually was good and did some work. We were ready for arbitration when all this blew up. I received an email this week that his office was closing. I finally got ahold of one of the staff there. He said the doors were chained by the landlord for nonpayment of rent, the staff had not been paid for 6 weeks, the financial person was nowhere to be found and trust accounts are empty. He stated Joe was in the hospital and would not be able to continue his practice. He also told me there was never a Marissa in the office. I found this firm on Handel on the Law. One would think these attorneys would have been properly vetted and checked on continuously. I emailed Bill Handel after hearing him state he would personally handle any issues with the attorneys for you. My first email was a month ago. No answer.

Anyone can request a tourist visa without signing any contracts and wasting their hard-earned money. [continued below]....
									
										.....  The client pays an additional 60 Euros to the Italian Embassy and $160.00 to the U.S. Embassy, in addition to what they have already paid Delavari. Most clients are not given a tourist visa to the U.S.!!!  In short, Delavari gets $8000/person and the client may or may not be given a Visa to the U.S.  If they don't get a Visa, too bad. Delavari does not return any portion of the money (even though it is clearly stated in the contract) and he blocks all future phone calls from this client. He also threatens these clients with physical harm if they complain about him. If the client obtains a Visa, Delavari asks for the remainder of the money ($5000/person) and the client is responsible for all travel costs to the U.S. In short, the client pays more than $13,000/person to Delavari while also paying for all travel costs.   He also promises his clients that once they get to the U.S. on their tourist's visa, he will ask for a green card for them by requesting assylum status. This is completely illegal.  And because it is illegal, he can't make good on this promise.  Clients must then pay for a real attorney to do their case. He has many complaints filed against him for his fraudulent work practices and repeatedly changes his phone number and employees in order to keep himself in business. He says he has a license to do this type work, but good luck getting a copy of his license.  His license number on contracts keeps changing.  He says he has been in this line of work for 15 years, but this is a lie.   In short, he eats people's money and doesn't have the right credentials to help people with their immigration problems.

I had a sale Date scheduled for the middle of April. Mr. Perdue guaranteed me HE could get my sale date stopped. He portrayed himself as one of the lead attorney's of the firm. It wasn't until after I paid him his retainer fee of $1500 that he informed me that he was in-fact not a lawyer (coincidence he didn't tell me until AFTER he got my money?? I doubt it). Well anyway,prior to signing up, Mr. Perdue guaranteed me that I would not lose my home, He said he might be able to get my payment reduced, but getting HSBC (my  bank) to re-instate my the loan and cancel the sale would be easy for him to accomplish as long as I paid him his SAP. He spoke very confidently, but told me I had to do something immediately Or I'd be living in the streets. So, unfortunately I chose to use his services. Well, his company did get the sale date cancelled BY FILING FOR CHAPTER 13 BANKRUPTCY FOR AN EXTRA $500. He never once mentioned this charge to me beforehand. But the sale was cancelled so I was happy. Next thing I know Mr. Perdue and his military (those who work for him) start debiting $695 a month from my account. I KNOW WE NEVER WENT OVER THIS MONTHLY FEE BEFORE I SIGNED UP!!!!!!!!  HE claims we did. No WAY! but after going back and reading the contract, i realized it was in the agreement - HE JUST NEVER BOTHERED TO TELL ME. So what Mr. Perdue told me was a $1500 fee had now cost me $2700 and I had only been a client for 40 days!!!. Well another sale date came up, and Mr. Pedrue (the Attorney who wasn't) and his military weren't able to stop this one. BUT THAT DIDNT STOP FROM TAKING MY $695 even after the house was SOLD. All told I was a client for less than four months, and despite all the promises and Guarantees from MR. JIM/JAMES PERDUE, I PAID $4,290 TO LOSE MY HOUSE. Im still here in my home because I hired a real attorney, with a real law degree, to dn appeal. Despite his big talk, big promises and endless guarantees - Perdue was a hack. Nothing more than a fraud who takes advantage of people struggling to survive. He preys on the desperate. Sadly, looking back on my notes of what he said he would do prior to me signing up - it was one big lie. He never answered my call after being paid, my mortgage company has never even heard of him. There's nothing I can do except warn others.  I must say that everyone else I dealt with was nice and considerate AND HONEST. If he would've told the truth from the start, there'd be no problem.

She said maybe we can refer you to one other Doctor they have who was on vacation. SHE PRACTICALLY SWORE TO GOD that she would call me back the next day. That never happened. So two days later she calls me back giving some excuse of how she was in meetings etc. I told her that if you don't have time to handle the Clients that you have then you should stop taking Clients until you get it together over there. She sighed. When she called me back, she daid that they will not refer me to another Doctor. That I will have to see Dr. Rabbani, (just to drum up medical expenses for the claim against the city more than getting me ethical treatment) I will be contacting the local and state bar associations to file claims of unethical service from this Attorney. If you want to be called back when promised and you want to be sent to a Doctor for anything more than a toothache then I would sure say that I certainly would not be able to recommend this Lawyer.

Denver, Colorado United States of America ",www.jansenlegal.com,3038325400,"Molly Jansen Jansen & Associates, P.C. Legal Misrepresentation Denver, Colorado"," I had gone to see Debra on Aug 19th at her Irvine office everything i express in this message is my sole opinon based on meeting Debra personally myself. This is not an attempt to slander anyone but warn others from blunders such as these.   As I usually do before I go on using any type of outside service I attempt to screen there background & reputation just to get a better feel for the persons practice & area of expertise.  I had gone on to see that Debra had what looked like were "" people Issues"" being reported against her in the past, I didnt think TOO much of it as she seemed to respond to complaints & ultimatley resolve the matter.  I also went on Yelp & saw that she had a few poor remarks, but after speaking to her I thought I should at least speak to her face to face to determine this for myself, & if all went well to see about possibly retaining her since she was readily available.  Debra stated she was free that afternoon & schecduled to see me that same day. She seemed very eager to see but I just figured she was high energy or something. After waiting in the lobby for at least 20 minutes she comes out & brings me to her 8x8 office (room) way in the back of the hall; that should of been a red light right away to me to get away as it could harldly be called an office & more like a bedroom.  We had gone on to discuss what I thought was a ""Free Consulation"" where later in the conversation she had stated (after I had driven to her office)  ""that I will have to pay her $300 no matter what since my consulation is taking so much time""  I had questioned this at first and then she states ""but you were going to hire me anyway right.? So no big deal"".  I go on to explain my situation & we devise not only a final retainer price which I had conferenced in a third party as they were sharing the costs of the retainer with me (which he heard everything)  but also devised a strategy, expectations & a time frame that Debra would execute this strategy for us. She had agreed with us that the parties at hand would recieve custom specific letters within 24-48 hours, and she was going to charge us $300 per letter.  After talking Debra down from 7 letters to 4 letters as she was very insistent on sending a letter to EVERYONE, she then goes on to tell me that I need to give her at least 500-800 more worth of extra funds for her to return calls speak to the parites recieving letters etc. I agreed & paid her $2k to write 4 letters,& resolve a final resolution with the party we were having the problem with & to ensure the matter ulitmalty is closed with no one unscaved.  Keep in mind this was Monday afternoon, by the next day at 3 pm I had sent what she had asked me for regarding licensing to her email within 24 hours & had not heard any type of response or conformation at all that day.  Generally a response such as "" recieved "" is apprecaited.    I had called Wed Afternoon 8-21 and followed up & left a message around 11 am, no response back ALL DAY, I even emailed her as well still NO response.  I finallly sent another email on Thursday 8-22 regarding speaking to her & called her office & again left a message.  Finally she calls me back around Noon and goes on to tell me she had a deposition & it was time sensitive & she is very sorry she had not returned my calls but YES she did get my email.  I explained to her the time sesitivie nature of this situation & how I was expecting these letters to be in the mail already, especially since I paid her for this.  Which she insisted I Pay Cash, & after asking her why she does not accept credit card she remarks & I quote"" FYI, I do not take credit cards, because the world is filled with people like you who like to get something for nothing""..  This was hrt response, this is the type of attitude & position she had the entire time she was more like a relative staying at my house more then an attorney advising me, she even likes to make her point by dropping the occasional "" F "" bomb, for an older lady this again is something I am not use to, escpeially by an attorney. From here it was all down hill, she called me back an hour later or so & tells me she typed up a formal response & that she emailed this to me for my review. After reading the letter I had gone on to share with Debie a few points that needed to be revised & how I did not want to sound so FORTHCOMING in the letter, but moreover that I must be crazy to pay $300 x 4, for the same letter.  Debra then becomes upset & starts talking over me & shouting & hollering, about I dont know what I'm saying & that I told her only to write one letter, & that the agency recieveng the letter is going to know its ME by my lic # if i remove my lic. # in the letter as a reference no one will figure out its regarding my specific matter.  I go on to tell her I am certain someone will see "" MY NAME"" & put too & too together.  She then becomes more upset & states that maybe this is not working out & that she shouldn't be my attorney anymore.  All this is taken place within a matter of 2-3 minutes of our conversation the first day after my consulation.  I go on to tell her if she feels this way that maybe we shouldnt work together & she goes on to say immediatly there after almost like she had it planned "" I WILL send you an invoice & refund any monies that I deem unused. "" Keep in mind I never even spoke to this lady before today other then our orginal cousulation 3 days ago, never recieved any letter, never recieved any coorespondence, never even had her send THE ACTUAL PARTY AT HANDa mailed LETTER, I never even recieved a response via email until TODAY...  This lady did nothing for me, I spoke to her twice today 8-22 for a combined time of 7 minutes and she chargs me $180.00 for this alone & goes on to justify her fee saying ""its in the contract"".  She even charges me $90.00 to type up the final invoice, she is really hurting for money or just a really dishonest person. This lady is really someone you need to consider twice before using, she is not relaible & in 3 days she did NOTHING for me and charged me over $1700.00, of course she will go on to attempt to justify her fees but saying she did this & did that & spoke to me for 2 hours when we just met, but again this is just an attempt to say she earned these bogus fees. How is she going to charge me $750 for a consulation when I never agreed to this.   She is unprofessinonal & goes on to tell me her husband is leaving her & that she needs to get 'PAID"".  Debra is out for herself & has casused me a huge amount of stress & worry, all she wasted valuable time for me & cost me alot of money I dont have.  I dont have any reason to spend over an hour writing this complaint trying to warn others unless my grievance has merit & truth.  I will formally seek a greivance with the state bar regarding this matter & I encourage others to step forward if you share an experience like mine.

Denver, Colorado United States of America ",www.jansenlegal.com,3038325400,"Molley Jansen Jansen & Associates, P.C. Legal Misrepresentation Denver, Colorado"," I had to leave my home due to going through a ten year marriage that turned very mentally abusive over his alcohol and addictions. Went to CODA cause he moved to his mothers house prior to this so i could keep me and my boys mentally stable and in school and seeking counseling for these issues. While in process of this my exhusband made a courtdate in sullivan county,in in superior court and lied to the judge to get my children from me.Being in CODA i was never served with paperwork about this courtdate they say i missed twice. So when i became aware of this situation in divorce court in Terre Haute when i met residency that he filed in Sullivan. I was told that jurisdiction lied in Sullivan Superior court even though he resided in Greene county with his mother since feburary of 2010. Im a diabled mother of two due to going through an arson fire in 2001,having lost my son and niece in that fire while trying to get them out.I live on a fixed income and still made ends meet for my children without any help from their father. I left CODA and rented a house in Terre Haute on south 17th street. Children were in school and we were recieving counseling in school as well as getting prepared to start counseling through hamilton center for our well being through this divorce. I wanted stability for my children and I as their mom that their father couldn't interfere with. We were doing really well and i still met in public places for our children to see him cause they didnt understand why they couldnt see daddy. only for short periods where no fighting could occur or him trying to take my children in a drunken rage or anything.They had their own bedrooms and so did i. No cps was involved or anything. I was told to appear in court Dec.15th,2011, just ten days before christmas so i did and could not afford counsel so i went anyway. Without any investigations or anything the judge ordered for me to give my children to their father at 4pm that day. I then was just heartbroken cause i know the abuse we had been through but he had a lawyer and i didnt. So then in February of 2011 hired Rowdy Williams Law Firm with the help of my mother and made a down payment and started making payments in order to go through divorce and regain my custody of my children. I was appointed Matthew Dailey from the lawfirm.He was keeping my children away from me because he said it was because of a past history of a friend. not a child molester/ sex offender just a friend who i met and our children went to church together(also friends with the mother of this child). This friend and I were not living together. However,somehow it was held against me in court for some reason and he kept my children from me for five weeks pror to final courtdate in Sept 2012 and nothing was done about that and because they say my children said they seen my friend i was in contempt of court and went to jail for 30 days. in that time i did not hear from my attorney nor did they file an appeal on the decisions or anything. Upon my release from sullivan county jail Oct 2012 i was allowed visitations for five weeks on saturdays 10am-5pm with supervision of my mother. I contacted Matthew Dailey and we spoke in his office and we were looking forward to going back to court in Dec2012. However,i went to contact Mr.Dailey again only to find out he was no longer at this firm. I then asked to speak to Rowdy Williams himself and he would not speak to me at all. I was not notified prior to Matthew Dailey leaving his office nor would anyone in that firm willing to listen to me and defend me. their father is a prior drug felon and has tried multiple times to commit suicide and no one wants to listen.I feel like if they did this to a mom like me then they would do this to anyone. After paying them 3,500.00 in payments when it should've only been around that and no more than 5,000. The lawfirm is trying to collect a remainder of 10,442.00. That is ridiculous and i dont feel anyone should be treated in that manner of disrespect. Im still going back to court to fight for my children. im just praying for good to come of this for the sake of my children. I don't have much money and am trying to find pro-bono services in indiana.                                                                        ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

New york, New York"," I have been fighting for my condominium title for 3 years since the developer decided to not sign titles and try to take over the development. The attorney that most of the persons fighting for their title hired is Mr Raul Ruiz. He failed to deliver a single title after 3 years yet he has continued to bill everybody. A few months ago somebody informed us that we did not have to pay Mr Ruiz anymore as the Notary 13 of tepic was going to take care of the matter for homeowners and fix the situation. Ruiz continues to bill people even though these people have no need of using him. I am much more calm knowing that my case is now in the hands of a notary public and not of a scammer theif lawyer. He has not had any progress whatsoever on the case and they claim that they are coming to an end. He claims the developer is coming close to settling the matter with us but the story sounds fishy. They say that he is going to sign all titles and give up all common properties that currently belong to him, including parking, pools, restaurants and commercial units. This doesnt seem like something a scammer is going to do so I think they are lying and since I stopped paying him my money I feel less robbed and way more calm.

John Mahoney and his very shitty attitude he argued with me during my entire consult, refused to listen to my case, and stated to me: ""Management could do whatever the hell they wanted and nothing I could do about it...so what.""  (Thanks John for your ""uplifting"" motivation trying to ""SELL"" (market) yourself to a prospective Client (""Boss"") that was going to hire you.  All he cared about was his Consult Fee to entertain him for the hour.  He made comments, ""Congressman are worthless and Office of Special Council is a waste of time...you should've filed an EEO complaint.""  Given the fact I filed an OSC Complaint and OSC was supposed to investigate my matter....OSC referred my case to MSPB under Individual Right of Action on Whistleblower's Complaint and he's well aware Employees can only file (1) claim with (1) Agency (not both).  Atty. John Mahoney was just plain nasty, rude, condescending and made wise-crack comment, ""Oh, that's right...I'm only an Atty...I've been there before.""  You MAY HAVE ""Johnny"" but guess what...NOT every case is the SAME as what you commented to me and since his attitude was just totally shitty...he made very sure he not only was disqualified for my case but he was a REFLECTION on his entire Law Firm (DUH!).  There's a big difference between ""cocky"" and ""confident"" and how Atty ""I know it all"" Mahoney came across was ""Don't question me, I know more than you"" attitude.I filed my complaint to Mallory Faulkner (who originally scheduled my Consult) and she then forwarded my complaint to Atty. Derrick Hogan (who had NO experience with my case and upon reviewing his profile appeared he was a ""greenhorn"" and not much experience to even evaluate my case.  I disqualified his comments because his letter implied ""his word"" was the ""entire Firm's decision"" when he came across as a ""rookie"" stating in his letter ""After careful consideration, the firm has determined not to accept my case and we will not be representing you in that manner"".  Where does a (considerably younger Atty. (half my age) come across that HE speaks for the ""entire firm"" because his word is ""gospel""?  Then I sent another email and it was forwarded to Graig Cortelyou (Chief Marketing Officer) and he stated he was going to refund my Consult Fee.  *Which is an honorable/professional gesture and after my (horrible) Consult with Atty. (""I know it All"") Mahoney I felt my Consult Fee should be refunded + pain and suffering added to my Consult Fee for the barrage of ignorance and shear rudeness he gave me.  *** Graig Cortelyou was highly professional and understood my concerns and he addressed he wanted his Firm in the best posi+ive light because they don't want negative publicity (of course not...who does?).   I stated my Concerns to Greig why my case was ""bounced"" to Inexperienced Atty's who ""thought"" they knew my case to...""not having a clue about my case"" and I needed a specialized Atty. to fix the problem like finding a ""specialized"" Dentist you could TRUST.  Greg understood my concerns to a ""T"" as we both laughed from my comment.  The problem with this Firm is finding someone highly experienced who CAN help you and as BIG as this Firm is (and advertise)...there's NO excuse why ANY of the Fed. Atty's couldn't represent my case (and WIN).  Upon Reviewing this Firm's Website ... they're ""founded"" on VETERANS experience.  I'm a NAVY VETERAN and the HRO Director did some very crooked-shady-unethical shit against me and because I've had Navy Administrative (and Police) Experience I found the HRO Director in violation of many Laws/Rules/Regulations she violated...she became intimidated of me addressing my Privacy Act rights and accused me of not completing my Security (Confidential) Documents and terminated me.  (40) days after the HRO Director terminated me...she sent me an email stating she had all my documents and nothing was lost.  REALLY?????  The HRO Director intentionally caused habitual delays to my Privacy Act questions....terminates me for not completing the Security documents...and THEN tells me she had my documents the entire time?  How can you say...Gross Mismanagement, Harassment and INCOMPETENT in the same breath?  The HRO Director did this to a NAVY VETERAN????  This Firm is founded on Veterans and if they allow a VETERAN to be SHIT on by ABUSE of AUTHORITY in the Fed. Gov't System....the HRO Director (Jane Ackiss, Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth, VA) needs to be answering to someone for what she did.  Had I did to her (or anyone else) what she did to me....I'd have my Security Clearance REVOKED and terminated on the spot!  So....why was this allowed to happen?So...my complaint gets forwarded to Atty. Steve Herrick (D.C. Managing Partner).  Same letter stated, ""Even IF you were to succeed in obtaining a hearing...the probability that the Court would disagree with the Findings made by the Federal Circuit's (3) Judge panel is remote""  Here's the biggest problem...the ATTY. needs to put himself in the Client's position and understand the full story and stop ""guessing"" on a case.  These Atty's are paid to FIGHT....and as political as this may sound....this is what they're paid to do is FIGHT for their (VETERAN) Clients.  Their website advertises ""brags"" they're the best...they stand up for their clients (blah, blah, blah) but the experience of my (1st) Consult with Atty. (""I know all"") Mahoney to now (2) Letters received by Atty's in this firm (1) inexperienced Atty. who I would NEVER hire because he lacks the experience I needed so WHY did he even send me a letter ""on behalf of the Firm"" ???  Then the (2nd) Atty. (Steve Herrick) tells me ""Even IF you were to succeed...."" aren't these Atty's paid to have their Client's Succeed?  What does this Firm post on their website? Their subliminal messages on every video you watch (see Atty. Mahoney's Video) and you'll get the subliminal message, ""I fight for you to win...I'm the best...I won't take any shit...I'm on your side""  Then I spoke with this Atty. and discovered....he has NO IDEA what he's talking about and spent more time ""blowing smoke"" for his Firm.   Secondly....Atty. (I know all) Mahoney is NOT even a Veteran so he even claimed, ""Congressman are worthless"".  I think Atty. Mahoney seems to forget that our Senate/Cabinet are made up of former Atty's themselves....so, what's that say about you John (I know it all) Mahoney????From my personal experience...I can't understand why when you call this Firm....you're forwarded to Atty's that don't match your case as in...you get the feeling....""OK John...it's your turn to get a ""new fish"" for a Consult I'm scheduling you for.  John said, ""Oh...it would cost about $15,000 and if you want to contact the Agency to see if they would get you resignation...I can do that for $3,500.""  REALLY JOHN???  Are you serious?  I could get Homer Simpson to do that and get the SAME result so why would I waste my money on you to ""cheap shot"" me when I DID NOTHING WRONG .... Do you reallllllly get it ""Johnny"" (Mahoney)?  You fight for WHO?  I think you need to take down your video....better yet...I think you need to LEAVE T&R because I believe Atty's Tully and Rinckey would just be ""thrilled"" from my experiences with Johnny.I sent a letter to Graig Cortelyou with my case and identified where the errors were from MSPB to Fed. Circuit Court and gave Atty. Steve Herrick the entire script of my case identifying all the errors.  If Law is never supposed to ""prejudge"" someone....then the facts are to be presented at ALL costs in every case.  I cited relevant case law and presented documents supporting my case and heard nothing (yet).  Being former Navy Administrator and Navy Police...""documentation beats conversation"" but WHY IN HELL does this FIRM state they were FOUNDED by VETERANS if their ""INTERNAL"" Atty's I've spoke with were NOT Veterans and didn't give a shit about my case but expect ME (""Boss"") to hire THEM (""Employee"") to work for me on my case?  Finding a good Atty. is worse than a migraine headache but if you're going to hire an Atty for what you need....make sure the person you speak with at Tully Rinckey understands your case...has a good grasp on your case....and IF you're NOT satisfied with the results....FIND a qualified Atty. IN this Firm....and keep talking with someone that KNOWS your case....and will take it personal to FIGHT for you.  REMEMBER......a Client is always the ""Boss"" who HIRES a ""qualified Professional"" Atty as their ""Employee"".  The Client pays the Atty. Fees just like a Boss pays their employees is NO different.  Only difference is ... Atty's are held to higher standards on professional ethics.I cannot speak for the ""ENTIRE"" Firm on my negative experience.  I DO KNOW there is maybe (3) Atty's IN their Firm that would be HIGHLY IRATE what happened to me ""IF"" it happened to them but I cannot (and will not) Prejudge this entire firm on just (3) Atty's I've encountered.  IF this Firm prides themselves on ""experience"" and ""bull's eye"" quality....then PROVE it and get rid of the Atty's who've provided me poor customer service by not listening.  The other problem is...when (1) Atty doesn't have a clue on your case....it would be bad publicity for the Atty. if another Atty. in their Firm proved him wrong.  It's awfully hard to get a reasonable Atty. who will listen because you know MORE about your case and what happened to you than the Atty's do but if ANY Atty treats you like John Mahoney treated me....quickly slam the door/hang up on him and FIND an Atty. that will not be ""cocky-arrogant"" with a shitty attitude.  You're right...you're looking to hire an Atty (Employee) but you wan't an Atty (employee) that will take direction from you (but...allow the Atty. to give you advice and give you direction in your case).  As of today (o4 Jan '12) Greig Cortelyou hasn't returned my calls regarding our detailed phone conversation but I will be happy to provide any ""updates"" on this matter and I expect posi+ive results from this FIRM....otherwise....I would hate to think they've grossly misled a (potential) Client (VETERAN) by false advertising not abiding what they said.   Stay Tuned for any updates with my experience with this Firm......VETERANS will not be disrespected by anyone.  Period!

At that point Ms. Leonard said she had done everything I had paid her to do. So I contacted her boss, with a copy of the email from Ms. Leonard stating she would handle the custody issue, then the boss had Ms. Leonard call me and she ""promised"" she would ""try"" to help.  During her trying to help me, she would tell me ""she didn't hear from my ex"" or she ""had been in contact with my ex several times"" ?? I was very confused.  When I asked Ms. Leonard what my ex wanted from me to return my child, she didn't know.  I  ""feel"" Ms. Leonard was not trying to help me at all and was actually retaliating against me for calling her boss.   When  I finally insisted on a answer, miracuallsouslly my ex who wouldn't call her back, called within a few minutes. After all of this, Ms. Leonard actually said she would get the agreement signed by a judge if I paid her more money -- mone I had already paid her to do this same thing 3 weeks earlier.  Of course I was not about the pay her any more money. I ""felt"" I was in a bait and switch scam since she promised to do something, then wanted more money to do it.  She definately was not prepared when we went to court, and although I paid her 3 times what all other attorneys wanted for just the 50B and I had it in writing that she was suppose to handle the custody issue, she said I didn't pay her to handle that.  I lost 2 weeks waiting for Ms. Leonard to get my child back and I could say alot more about all the things that happened, but I hope this is enought for others to see what kind of lawyer she is.  I definately would never recommend her to anyone.     ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

The PDJ approved a conditional admission of misconduct submitted by the parties and suspended Andrew Steven Nimtz, attorney registration number 30081, from the practice of law for one year and one day, with sixty days to be served and the remainder to be stayed pending completion of a one-year period of probation with conditions. The suspension was effective August 1, 2013. Nimtz represented a client whom Nimtz knew to be prohibited from obtaining a license to operate a medical marijuana dispensary due to a pending tax lien. For his client to continue operating the dispensary, Nimtz applied for the license in his own name, even though the client, not Nimtz, owned the dispensary in question. The State of Colorado granted Nimtz a license. After a police search of the dispensary, Nimtz was charged in Adams County with two class 4 felonies. On July 26, 2012, he pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, a class 1 misdemeanor. Nimtz was sentenced to serve one year of probation, to pay fines and costs, and to complete forty hours of public service. His probation terminated early on January 9, 2013. Nimtz’s misconduct constituted grounds for the imposition of discipline pursuant to CRCP 251.5, and violated Colo. RPC 1.2(d), 4.1(a), and 8.4(b).   At this point I am challenging Mr. Nimtz and Complete Family Care P.C., in Northglenn, CO in court and will update this report with the outcome.

On June 13, I arranged to travel 4 hours to Meet her to discuss the case and see if I wanted to retain her and pay her the 5k.   We met for about an hour. The cousin who recommended her was there as well as my mother.  I explained my son's case to her informimg her that he was currently on probation. She asked if it was for a felony and I explained that it was for a misdemeanor.  Her Response to me was ""that's nothing"" which i understood this to mean that she could handle all the charges pending against my son.  Still reluctant because of her personslity was a little too cool for Me and not forth coming with how this all work being my first time dealing with an attorney which I informed her.   I had to ask her what was next after we had paid her 4,300 and made arrangements to pay for the other 700 on Friday which I believe was June  20. We sign an agreement but nothing explained to me about what to expect from her. No mention of things she did not do On this initial visit which I thought was the time to tell me so I get some one else if needed.  I asked when are u visiting my so who was in jail in Valdosta. She said sometime next week. Which she visited him on Sunday June 15.    After our initial visit and her one visit to my son who explained all his charging informing her Of the probation as we'll. A week or so goes by no word from her so I decided to call see what was going on with npmy son's case my first attempt was I left  a message with no return call. I called again and spoke with Lauren who I found out was working on the case as the paralegal, and she informed me could assist me. I expressed my frustration that we were not being communicated with and Lauren expressed to me if I let mrs copeland do her job and we do our job  everything would be ok To shorten this. We were hardly communicated with she did not visit my son again she arraneed 2 court cases the first a disaster. I will cont tomorrow          ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

"," I recieved a letter in the mail from this firm marked ""personal and confidential"" sent from Wall & Associates, Inc from 4801 Woodway Drive in Houston Texas.  The letter began by informing me that there is some public record that indicates a federal, state and/or local tax lien being filed against me.  Then it goes on to explain how I should consult them about this problem before the IRS comes knocking at my door.  By the time I got to the end of the letter and was able to breathe and calm my heart palpitations, I realized that this was only an advertisement and not an official letter as it is made to appear at first glance.  I called the office phone number included in the letterhead to ask to speak to the actual attorney whose name is signed E. Kenneth Wall at the bottom of the letter.  A very snarky young woman answered the phone and when I asked to speak with this Mr. E. Kenneth Wall about this supposed tax lien, she would not transfer me to anyone but instead began to give me a spiel about ""being a matter of public record"" etc etc and so on.   When I told her that I did not wish to speak with anyone other than the so called attorney himself, then I was transferred to another sales agent, a smooth talking young man who also began a spiel about accessing my information through public records and that I needed to get legal help through this company immediately.  I asked him to transfer me to the actual attorney who supposedly drafted the letter to me ""personally"" with his name signed ""sincerely"" at the bottom.  But to no avail.  The person just kept trying to deliver his sales pitch and was talking over me as I protested.  It appears that this company, if it is a legitimate law firm, is engaging in a type of guerrilla marketing tactic which uses fear mongering, a practice which is reprehensible and perhaps even illegal.  I am not an expert, but this certainly does not seem legal.  In any case, I will never under ANY circumstances EVER consult this law firm if I ever happen to need this kind of service.  Wall & Associates, Inc will never get my business.  ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

I began investigating the firm and learned that many people are posting statements on Yelp.com about being scammed by the firm.  The words ""Class Action"" come to mind, but I want to be sure to get what I paid into it and something extra for the damages I incurred.  I turned in everything they requested and they have not done a single thing.  It's a scam, and someone should represent ""the people"" in this matter. To date, I have tried to contact them to officially discharge them from representing me in the matter, but they don't answer the phone don't return calls apparently no longer have employees don't respond to faxes don't respond to emails apparently are no longer at their last address because even the US Postal Service hasn't reached them for a signature on my package I sent. I filed an official complaint with the California State Bar this week.  I just left a telephone message for someone who may be an FBI agent investigting the practices of the firm.  One of the most disheartening things is that he is still an ""active"" attorney in the state of California. If the State Bar can't assist with returning my fees, I will ignore the clauses in my contract that bind me to ""mediation and arbitration"" because you can't do either without the other party.  I will follow up with the State Bar next week before I file in Small Claims court.  I just pray my work is not futile.  I can only imagine how many people are standing in line to be reimbursed by this Ripoff Attorney.

I had an injury in September 2010 for my lower back which was treated trough my company Nordstrom for 3 months. In February 2011 I had herniated disk in the same body part which was related to September 2010 injury. I called HR to report the injury they denied me because this happened at home. I call Perona,Langer, Beck, Serbin and Mendoza they excepted my case. I have told them that this injury was related to September 2010 injury (seems like they ignored) and filed as a new injury. They sent me to doctor for treatment I tried to call their office so many times to speak to the Attorney who represented me Jonatan Brian never had a chance to discuss my concerns. INSTEAD THE STAFF IS VERY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL . Only chance I had to speak with him or others attorneys from the same firm was in a court. They did not send me to QME doctors for long period of time, with demand of Defense attorney (Nordstrom) I finally seen QME doctor which was from my point of view recommended to them by Defense Attorney(Nordstrom) and not on mutual agreement. For February 2011 case we’ve lost the trial due not correct representation of my Attorney because the fact that my injury was accumulative injury. After we lost the case I received the letter from my Attorney office saying that they do not do an appeal I can do on my own, so I did it. After we lost the trial they filed another injury case for September 2010 which I was telling them in the beginning(they ignored) . They sent me to doctors again to rum more medical bills. Doctors got confused why  they did everything upside down. During the treatment for September 2010 injury from my Attorney, doctor discovered that I also have a neck injury and I needed the treatment. I contacted my Attorney Office for more than 8 months to get an approval and put neck injury for September 2010 case to give an approval for doctor to treat me NO RESPOND.  They screwed up my case. The run all the bills. Then we had Mandatory Settlement Day on October 22,2013 for September 2010 injury  and in Court they Served me with the discharge letter from there service I checked with Court Clerk and find out that my Attorney filed Petition to Dismiss me ,and I never get any letter from them to inform me I found out in the Court.  I demand the explanation from the Attorney he said “Because I filed the Appeal” I told him it was stated in the letter from your Firm that you do not Do An Appeal I can do myself. He ignored and made me sign the Discharge form. Then I found out they also want to collect the fees if I get reward.  PS: NOT the Attorney who represented me the other Attorney from that Firm informed about dismissal. Now because of the Statue of Limitation for filing so late  for September 2010 injury I may loose  this case. Now I am stuck.  Defense Attorney helped me file paper for the Trial. Now I am stocked with more injuries and no treatment I do not know if any Attorneys take this case in this stage. This is my complain. Please advise me what should I do.

In fact, he like most collection agencies just look up liens and try to get business by acting like they have a case pending already and they have attorneys and/or private investigators involved etc when really it is all a line of b.s.!What Mr. David Pitt did not realize when he contacted me is that I had already resolved my issue pertaining to the lien I had filed a while back and naturally I was completely aware of what was going on with that particular job as I was the ONLY person who had done work there. Not to mention, the work was done for my brother in-law. I played along with Mr. Pitt's call to see what he would say and from there I discovered just how much of a hill-billy moron this guy was.First of all, he is extremely unproffesional and has a tendency to not only stutter but say ""uhhh"" and ""umm"" after every other word that comes out of his mouth. He sounds like he has been raised in the back woods of North Carolina or perhaps a family member of the hillbillys on the movie ""The Deliverance"".Secondly, he made up all this b.s. about having other clients that did work on the same property as I had (my brother in-laws) etc and have not yet got paid hence why his Firm was involved. Like I said, B.S.!! No one ever did any work at my in-laws accept for me wich my in-law can validate as truth as well.Lastly, Mr. Pitt will come off as an attorney when he contacts you. FALSE!!

I also asked for a agreement which would be signed by his law firm, Roanoke Insurance Group and our Company that stated that when the three payements were made this matter was resolved permanently. Bob Labuda stated he would send it and never did. I didn't think I was being unreasonable.

The woman on the other end of the phone was helpful with my cancelation, but when I mentioned ""refund"" she said I would have to email refundrequest@rocketlawyer   and ask them.  Ok really? I did as I was told on a Monday.  On Thursday I received an email stating that my request was denied because the fine print said the free trial was for a week and that they can charge me after that.  Blah, blah, blah. I'm a big girl, so I obviously recognize my mistake.  But what pisses me off are these companies that try to screw you out of money for something you don't want.  I could buy that document from several other sites for a couple bucks.  My bad, now I just paid $40 for it.  I just want to warn others that this is NOT one of those companies that wants future business from people like me.  I've dealt with several other companies over the years that gladly refund things they know you mistakenly signed up for, or clearly didn't want.  I will go back to those companies repeatedly for other things I DO want, because they are good companies to deal with.  Rocket Lawyer is definitely NOT one of these companies!!    ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

Furthermore, your case is not uncontested, no matter how much you protest that it is. I can see that we are getting nowhere here and you have no intention of paying your bill.  Unfortunately, you leave us no choice but to withdraw.Sincerely,Benjamin J. Heimerl""Now, who in their right mind would sign up for an option that ended up costing over $10,000.00 when a $1,750.00 flat-fee was available?!?  In my opinion, this firm baited and switched on me, having me sign papers that were completely different from what I had been quoted.I sent an email to the other partner Katie Lammers explaining my displeasure with in my opinion being scammed by their firm and baited and switched and I received this response: ""Hi AfraidOfRetaliationFromUnethicalFirm,Per our conversation today, here is a copy of your retainer agreement.  Please note that this agreement clearly lays out how you will be billed and how the fee agreement works.  I have also included a signed copy of our retainer policy. To recap, I understand that you feel that Kelsey told you that the divorce would be handled as a flat fee of $1,750.  She recalls the meeting differently.  While you and Kelsey did discuss the possibility of a flat-fee uncontested divorce, you ultimately chose the $3,000 hourly option and that is the retainer agreement that you signed. It's unfortunate that you seem to have a different understanding of the agreement than what I have in writing.  Kelsey and I will take a look at the invoices this afternoon.  I will have an answer for you today about your options for proceeding. You, of course, retain the right to terminate representation at any time.  I hope we can work something out, but I have to honor the signed agreement which states that yours was an hourly case.Please direct any questions regarding your matter to me. Thanks,Katie Lammers""In other words - they are claiming that I happily signed a FAR more expensive hourly option when a far cheaper flat rate option was talked about and presented to me.  In my opinion, this is simple bait and switch - I will also be filing a claim with the Minnesota Bar association and also the Attorney General of Minnesota for their activities.Since I was desperate and in the middle of a divorce (and since I again made in my opinion the mistake of trusting Heimerl and Lammers) I maxed out my credit card to pay the amount current.  At the end of the case, I received ANOTHER bill from them for ANOTHER balance over $5,900.00!!!  (Now remember Katie's written word in her response that I had chosen the ""$3,000.00 Hourly Option"" - and that this was an uncontested divorce).Needless to say, now being totally broke I could not afford this additional amount that they in my opinion were trying to milk from me.  Seeing no other choice, I have to file a bankruptcy.  I  received a call from an attorney at Heimerl and Lammers named Maxim Zawojski.  He was attempting to collect the debt for the amount owed.  I informed him that I was declaring Bankruptcy (a chapter 7 to be specific).  He said ok and that the collection efforts would stop (as is required by Federal Bankruptcy Law).Today (July 27th) I was just served papers filed by Heimerl and Lammers and signed by Maxim Zawojski to appear in court next month.  They are suing me in small claims court for the $5,719.50 of additional fees from the ""$3,000.00 hourly option"".  I am still doing the Bankruptcy and needless to say they won't be receiving the money - because I don't have it.  I am also looking into legal violations I feel that they have committed by filing suit while they had been informed of the Bankruptcy.  SO, IN SUMMARY...In my opinion one would never EVER use Heimerl and Lammers.  The lack of ethics shown in my opinion in the bait and switch they did to me as well as - in my opinion - the unprofessional treatment, in my opinion EXCESSIVE billing (I actually have a record of where I was billed for 6 emails that happened over a period of 35 minutes... I was billed at 10 minutes EACH for the emails - who would have guessed that Heimerl and Lammers had a time machine and could shove 60 minutes into only 35!!!!!  That is the only way that could happen, right?) and in my opinion the harassment after being forced by their actions into a bankruptcy and financial ruin are something that no one should EVER have to suffer.  Hopefully the Bar association and the Attorney General can help me with this.So to sum my opinion of my experience with the firm up in one word: AVOID!

Blue Ridge, Georgia United States of America ",www.mikewinscases.com,1-706-632-0550,"The Law Offices of Michael Birchmore  Failed Promises Blue Ridge, Georgia"," I was totally taken advantage of, and ripped off!!! Douglas Wilder represented me in a DWI case in 2008. I was naive about how the court system worked and just assumed I was handling the situation right by paying an attorney $5000, especially one who claimed to be the best, and that he felt he could handle the case. I tried many times prior to the trial to discuss the case with him, but he continued to put me off, and never took notes regarding my scenario. I was only able to speak with his receptionist, who always seemed put out when I would have a question or want to just discuss an issue which I felt may be important to the case. He never got my messages, never returned the calls, and came to court totally unprepared!In turn, on the day of court, I was supposed to be seen at 8 am. He asked I be there promptly so we could discuss the case. In effect, he did not show up until after 10 am. [continued below]....
									
										..... He said this was because he had another trail to attend to. I paid Mr. Wilder $5000 to handle my case; the least I could expect is that he would be at my trial on time. After 10 am, he came out of the court room having made a totally unsatisfactory settlement with the judge without my presence. Why, because he did not even know all the facts. When he came out the first time and told me the decision he had made with the judge, I asked him if he even mention some important facts regarding the case. He forgot! He then went back in by himself, only to come back out with a verdict that still was not satisfactory. Finally, I asked if I could go in and talk with the judge as well. When I went in, I explained to the judge that, I was not even driving, my vehicle was parked, it was turned off, the flashers were on, the keys were in my pocket, and the officer pulled on to the street before I had even gotten back in my vehicle. When he did approach my vehicle I still had the vehicle turned off, and was just eating a taco to get something in my stomach.  In turn, when I had a chance to speak with the judge, and explain my version of everything, he decided to drop most all charges.However, being the expert that Doug Wilder claimed to be, you would think he would have requested I get a PI rather than a DWI at that time since it was understood that I was not operating a vehicle, or even had the vehicle turned on. He did not think to do it. In fact, he didnt even attempt to do anything to assist in my favor. He just accepted the first sentence the judge first proclaimed, because he had better things to do, and he was not aware of the existing facts; WHY? Because
he never even reviewed my case in the first place. This was just another slice of pie ($5,000) for him to rob another person that was naive of how to handle being charged with an offense in court. I definitely should have shopped around
before hiring him. He just painted a picture of himself as being the best in the field, and that he has handled much more difficult charges then mine.Furthermore, he tells me he is in a hurry to present on another case, and told me to just sign two documents and was out of there.  I was just initially excited about getting most of the fine, and charges dropped; I assumed it was safe to sign what he
had presented to me. It was not explained to me what I was signing because he said he had to hurry for a court appointment in Denton.. What he had me sign was a plea that I was guilty of a DWI (which is contrary to what I had hired him for), and that I cannot appeal the case ever. Why would I pay him $5000 to have me sign a document stating that I was guilty of DWI? What was the $5,000 for.I thought he would have at least had some kind of defense arranged. That is what I hired him for in the first place was to convey what exactly happened, and attempt have the DWI charge removed, or to at least have arranged to be have
the charges lessened to a PI. The reason being for all this devastation to my rights was because Doug Wilder never even prepared for the case in advance. He showed up, and did not even have any the facts until I started to explain them again on the day of court. I basically went in, did his job, and got a majority of the initial restitutions taken off, but was still charged. JUST FOREWARNING:If you want an attorney who rides on his ego rather than properly serving his clients, this is your man. If you go to his office and he claims to be Texas Best DWI Attorney, he is only claiming that because he paid Texas Monthly to publish that. If you want an attorney who will listen to you, and work for you, especially after you pay them $5000, do yourself a favor, be smart and go elsewhere besides Doug Wilder!

The paperwork was confusing and there was no one available to help. As it was I was limited on my financial resources. All i had left to my name after losing my job was $2500. On Christmas eve morning, I received a packet in my mail about how to move out of my house from my bank. I was devistated and got online and located this company. I never expected to hear from them on Christmas Eve. Day morning but an attorney actually called me back. His name was Gilber Borman. WoW, I was so impressed that he actually called me on Christmas Eve Day, I thought wow this guy is truely invested in helping other, Little did I know that a simple phone call that day would ripp me off of the last $2500.00 that I had. He put me in touch with Micheal Rountree and they set me up for a meeting appointment on Dec. 26th, 2011 the day after Christmas. Mr. Borman told me, ""enjoy your Christmas, we will see you Monday and fix everythign"". At that meeting I was an emotional basket case and would have done anything they needed me to do to save my house keeping me from becoming homeless. The process went like this, they asked me to sign so many documents i cant even tell you a number. I read them but knew that I had to sign them in order for these people to help me. I provided them with any information they asked me for. I was assigned a ""case manager' who only complained about how overwhelmed she was to the point that I was intimidated about contacting her. Each and every time she told me "" you dont need to contact me, if I need anything from you or if anything changes I will email you or you will receive a letter in the mail"". They told me if you find a job and /or get the money to make your house payments ""don't do it"". I was instructed not to make any house payments even if I can because I needed to be 2 house payments behind to stay in the modification process and 3 or more to be forclosed. i was lucky enough to find a job and i kept calling them about the forgiveness program because all i wanted to do was get back on track, make my house payments and move on. However they insisted I would mess everything up if I started paying for my house. Finally, one day when i arrived home from my job i received a letter in the mail that my loan modification has been denied. It was not from Ms. Franklin, it was from my mortgage company. I was devistated. The decision had been made several months before and this letter was informing me that i was going to recieve forclosure documents. I tried to call Ms. Franklin she never was available, I finally sent her an email and she called me telling me she sent me a letter in the mail. I never received anythign from her. I never received a letter that my mortgage modification was denied. How can that happen? I asked her to send me a copy, she promptlyl stated, ""  your case has been closed and I dont even have your file its in the basement"". In the basement? I asked her to send me a copy, I deserve that I never received another letter, a copy of her letter. Nothing. I called to discuss the money I paid to them because I wanted it back to use it to pay a portion of my house payments and keep my house. No one ever returned my call. This was by far the worst experience I have ever had and I am suppose to believe that an attorney is suppose to help me? IF anyone has ever received any help from them I owuld be shocked. I doubt they will ever do the right thing and return my money to me. However, i can only hope that anyone who is considering using this company or any other company like them will go online to the State of Michigan website and look up mortgage help. The State of Michigan has a program where they help people who are in my situation. Unfortuantely for me because this entire process with this company took so long (almost like they know if they run out the time, it works to thier advantage) that it made me not eligible for the State of Michigan to help me either.

(Meanwhile the moving company was successfully sued by another party for the same reason).   In my frustration, I contacted the State Bar of Reviews and not only did they barely respond to my letters, I discovered that Mr Pinaud was ON the board of reviews.  Interesting.  After weeks of demands, he FINALLY provided one letter that he supposedly sent to CA, with no proof of any contact with the moving company.  He suspiciously never had that letter or mentioned it prior the the Bar Review.     It has been a few years, but I hope this helps anyone interested in utilizing this particular attorney.  I am sure they do some reponsible actions for others, but he was a terrible, irresponsible attorney for me.  I finally got my items from the moving company by paying over $1500 extra, but half was missing or distroyed.  Because of this attorney, I had no options for justice and took a huge loss, losing priceless family momentoes, losing so much money and feeling like I got ripped off twice. We tried to utilize other attorneys but Mr Pinaud mysteriously had lost the evidence and tried to say that I never gave him any.   If there is a rebuttal to this posting by Mr Pinaud, he certainly will have put more energy and effort into a public report than he did into my valid case.  I wish I had read other's reports that are now on the internet before I retained him.  I can only let karma take care of injustice, but glad I can help it along with warning others.   ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

Having an attorney should help you but it caused more stress. If you owe money there staff will not work with you on payment plans but want thousands of dollars right away and if you can't afford it they don't help you but they send there accountant Daniel stone to go after you and treat you very rude with no respect after they rack up your bill by doing nothing to benefit you because they are incompetent.

Fort Myers, Florida"," IARDC.Org Complaint Response. www.ScholzSucks.Com C. Richard Wray                No. 2013IN03999 3161 W White Oaks Dr. Suite 301 Springfield, IL 62704 In my response to the letter marked September 18, 2013 by Mr. Richard F. Scholz III, I am sorry to say that I not only disagree on his claims that he met with us for at least an hour and twenty minutes, but by analyzing Mr. Scholz’ statements in the way he claims things happened and presenting one key piece of evidence, I can prove we left BEFORE 5:00pm. THIS PARAGRAGH IS TO DESGRIBE WHY I BELIEVE MR SHOLZ IS LYING ABOUT HIS TIME The first reason I say this, is if his secretary does get off at 5:00pm like he claims she does, and if we were truly there for the hour and twenty minutes Mr. Scholz claims he spent with us; then it wouldn’t be his receptionist’s signature on our 500$ receipt. In Exhibit A, it’s highlighted where Mr. Scholz makes specific claims that don’t fit the puzzle. (HOW I KNOW IT’S HIS RECEPTIONIST’S SIGNATURE ON OUR RECIEPT): The first and foremost reason I know it’s her signature on our receipt is I watched her write the receipt out myself. However, Exhibit F bears the same signature as the receipt dated 7-23-2013 (exhibit D).  Exhibit F is a written message FOR “Riff” (aka Mr. Scholz), written by Mr. Scholz’ secretary…meaning that his secretary is the only person who bears this signature. This signature is on BOTH Exhibit F and Exhibit D. THE WAY THINGS HAPPENED: During the consultation, what I was hearing is that he would extend the time and we’d pay him the amount of money out of that retainer for how much work he did. We paid Riff AFTER we explained our situation to him for the fifteen minutes we spent with him. We went out of the consultation room and paid the 500$ in cash to Mr. Scholz’ receptionist. Mrs. Stutheit gave us a receipt (See Exhibit D). (PLEASE CONSIDER WITNESS RELIABILITY) Please note that Mr. Scholz is Mrs. (Ms.) Stutheit’s superior, and there are consequences pertaining her job should she not agree with Mr. Scholz, this is why Mrs. Stutheit is not a reliable witness. The only reason I mentioned her was because I have written confirmation that she was there when we left. HOW I KNOW I DID NOT PAY MR. SCHOLZ BEFORE OR DURING THE CONSULTATION Let’s say that Mr. Scholz’ claims are true in all content (even though they are not), if we were to re-enact the day, consider these observations. If I paid $500 BEFORE the consultation, he wouldn’t have known enough to accept the case. Just in case he tries to claim we paid him before he would talk with us, keep in mind Mr. Scholz makes his statement in exhibit B, “I made that clear AT the conference on July 23rd…” of a non-refundable retainer. He makes it very clear that it was proclaimed DURING the consultation inside his own response; which would mean if I DID pay the 500$ before consultation, he would have still stolen my money by saying it was ‘non-refundable’. And if we ever did agree to a “non-refundable” retainer, it would have been WAY LESS than 500$. And if Mr. Scholz’ claims were accurate, by saying his receptionist only entered the room (according to him, see exhibit A) only to inform him she was leaving, it would insinuate that she left the building without further interaction. If Mr. Scholz’ statements are in any way consistent, it would be HIS signature on our receipt, not his receptionist’s. BUT being that Mr. Scholz’ statements are not accurate, being as I paid his receptionist AFTER the consultation, the receipt acknowledges that his secretary was STILL there. She was there to the very end of our fifteen minutes, to write and sign the receipt. This not only means we got out BEFORE 5:00pm, but also that Mr. Scholz’ claim of his secretary only interacting to inform him that she was leaving is false as well. Meaning that Mr. Scholz is lying about his timing and who was there. This gives his other statements less validity as well. THE REASON I KNOW I DID NOT AGREE TO A ‘NON-REFUNDABLE’ RETAINER We would not have paid 500$ BEFORE we understood what he could do for us. IF I knew that I wasn’t going to be able to get at least SOME of my money back, I would have never asked for his legal representation. He DID say that ALL he COULD do was extend the time line. Sure, I wouldn’t mind extending the timeline, but if I knew his demands were going to be NON-refundable (which he NEVER said) I would have KEPT my money. I would not pay someone $500 non-refundable when they tell me there’s not much I can do and the job is the NEXT day. Plus, why would anybody pay 500$ non-refundable to a person BEFORE they did the job without contract, no matter what their profession? That would be stupid; there would be no warranty that they would accurately DO their job after they got paid. I would NEVER pay ANYONE a non-refundable payment without a letter of engagement, in writing, BEFORE I paid them. Neither would Mr. Heeger. A statement PROMISING that they would do their job. And since we never made that agreement, since I have common sense enough to not waste money like that, the retainer was nothing MORE THAN a regular retainer. THE REASON I KNOW MR. HEEGER WOULD HAVE NEVER AGREED TO A ‘NON-REFUNDABLE’ RETAINER Being that Mr. Heeger is a tougher negotiator than I am and requires everything in writing (not to mention I was right next to him confirmed by Mr. Scholz in Exhibit A). A good example of him requesting things in writing is his request for an itemized statement, talking to Mr. Scholz through email only, and getting receipts of all messages/money given to Mr. Scholz. He would not have agreed to a non-refundable payment either. As Mr. Scholz gives in his exhibit E, Mr. Heeger has obviously done his research on how to get everything in writing. Why would a person who reads books such as this agree to a non-refundable form of payment and NOT get it in writing? Since, Mr. Scholz said that there was not much he could do for us, why would we agree to a non-refundable payment if he couldn’t do much more than we could ourselves? To accuse someone of having a grudge against the system, showing that they’re educating themselves about the system and then trying to make a claim that they made a non-refundable payment agreement without having it in writing (an ignorant move). However Mr. Scholz shows that he is not an ignorant person when pertaining to these matters. That’s an inconsistent and non-realistic statement by Mr. Scholz. IT WASN’T AN EVICTION                 Also another thing I would like to acknowledge is that this case wasn’t an eviction case, it was a demand for possession of property. We didn’t have a rental agreement with the petitioner. This detail shows the lack of effort/time Mr. Scholz put into our representation, meaning that he doesn’t deserve all $500. TRYING TO PAINT A NEGATIVE PICTURE ON ME WITH MR. HEEGER’S DEEDS DOESN’T SOLVE ANYTHING FOR MR. SCHOLZ May I also say that I, Cora Newbold, have NEVER filed any complaints against ANY lawyers until now. Nor have I put up ANY sites of any negative content about the opposing parties OR of Mr. Scholz. Exhibit E features books that I, Cora Newbold, have NEVER read. The only reason I know that those books exist is Mr. Heeger showed me what he used to inform himself during his Mercantile lawsuit in 2007. All of the things Mr. Scholz is using to put ‘us’ in a ‘bad light’ were results of Mr. Heeger’s actions. However, even WITH these actions it DOES NOT give Mr. Scholz an excuse for taking our Money. As he CLEARLY states he represented BOTH of us meaning that I have every right to file this complaint.                 AN EXPLAINATION ON ‘PSYCHOLOGICAL’ PROBLEMS As it states in the paper, I was very scared about the thought of being homeless. However, that does NOT mean that I carry ANY grudge against the legal system. The only ‘problem’ that I psychologically had, had NOTHING to do with the legal system, they had MORE to do with the fact that I had a 10month old, about to get kicked out of a house with nowhere to go. This would make ANYONE in that position anxious. Or as Mr. Heeger likes to colorfully describe it as in Exhibit F “...having a mental break down…”. For Mr. Scholz to take the words ‘psychological problems’, harness them, and use them to create a stereotypical picture, that I am out to harm him in some way due to some mythical ‘grudge’, is unprofessional. Not only is Mr. Scholz not authorized to make that assessment; but to take people merely having a difficult time and blowing it up to insinuate that they’re crazy, (when it’s not their category of expertise) is defaming and discriminatory. Not only that but this subject was brought up to do nothing more than for you to form a negative opinion about me and to avoid the REAL problem. AGAIN MR. HEEGER’S ACTIONS The website, www.ScholzSucks.com, was put up by Mr. Heeger AFTER we found out that Mr. Scholz was wrongfully keeping our money. I admit that Mr. Heeger’s ways of expression are eccentric, but they are nothing more than him expressing his disappointment of Mr. Scholz’ unjust enrichment. Mr. Heeger does have a right to be disappointed, had this not happened in the first place there wouldn’t be a “Scholzsucks.com”. Had Mr. Scholz performed his responsibilities professionally, there would have been no conflict. Sean and I had actually agreed at the time after the court date to give Mr. Scholz $200 out of the original 500$ retainer we paid, out of gratitude for his short-notice representation. However, since Mr. Scholz has created a conflict, drug the conflict out, and has treated us with disrespect, we have changed our minds.                 NO MATTER WHAT THE EXCUSE IT’S AN EXCUSE NONE THE LESS Psychological problems, “grudge against the system”, either way it’s NOT an excuse for Mr. Scholz to take the attention off of his wrong doing and to place it on me. The thing is MOST of these things Mr. Scholz is trying to point a finger at, were all done by Mr. Heeger. I, Cora Newbold, am the one filing the complaint. Not because of ANY ‘grudge’, spite, or ‘psychological’ problem but because I DID NOT AGREE (nor did Mr. Heeger) to a NON-Refundable form of payment! Mr. Scholz has still not proven, if anything he’s disproven, his statements in saying the retainer was non-refundable. He still has neglected to show any way in which the money was used, or PROOF of his work besides in-court representation. Even with his in-court representation, Mr. Scholz was within the court house prior to our hearing anyways, so it wasn’t a big effort to get there. He’s not even on the public court records AS representing us. I still believe that Mr. Scholz owes us at the VERY LEAST $350 in refund.                 I believe that Mr. Scholz’ response is nothing more than an act to take the attention off of himself and place Mr. Heeger and myself in a bad light. I sincerely believe that this response of his was more an aggressive defense than a factual response. I am a VERY LOGICAL, analytical and realistic person. I do NOT impulsively run on emotions like Mr. Scholz is trying to paint me as. I have no conflict with any other lawyer, including Ms. Lannerd, except for Mr. Scholz. You will come to find that everything that Mr. Scholz has said about me pertaining Ms. Lannerd is also another conflict of Mr. Heeger’s. I just want what’s rightfully mine. And since Mr. Scholz so openly tried to put myself in a bad light, let it be known that this is NOT the FIRST time Mr. Scholz has been accused of stealing large sums of money. I will say that these statements come from reports from the media. The comments from another former “client” show how displeased she was with him (Exhibit H), notice how the date is December 21, 2011 showing that it was not recently posted to ‘conspire’ against Mr. Scholz. Then a report from KHQA (a local news group on channel 7) reports on their web site Mr. Scholz being accused of not cashing checks for his client’s estate (see exhibit G). Exhibit I are the comments that are connected to the KHQA report and they too were posted on January-September of 2012 as to again not be accused of any ‘conspiracy’. There IS one positive comment, but that was an interpretation based upon what the rest of his family has done, obviously without knowing him personally. The rest of them are negative, agreeing with ‘Riff’ being a thief.   Thank you, 09/23/2013 ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

Not because of ANY ‘grudge’, spite, or ‘psychological’ problem but because I DID NOT AGREE (nor did Mr. Heeger) to a NON-Refundable form of payment! Mr. Scholz has still not proven, if anything he’s disproven, his statements in saying the retainer was non-refundable. He still has neglected to show any way in which the money was used, or PROOF of his work besides in-court representation. Even with his in-court representation, Mr. Scholz was within the court house prior to our hearing anyways, so it wasn’t a big effort to get there. He’s not even on the public court records AS representing us. I still believe that Mr. Scholz owes us at the VERY LEAST $350 in refund.                 I believe that Mr. Scholz’ response is nothing more than an act to take the attention off of himself and place Mr. Heeger and myself in a bad light. I sincerely believe that this response of his was more an aggressive defense than a factual response. I am a VERY LOGICAL, analytical and realistic person. I do NOT impulsively run on emotions like Mr. Scholz is trying to paint me as. I have no conflict with any other lawyer, including Ms. Lannerd, except for Mr. Scholz. You will come to find that everything that Mr. Scholz has said about me pertaining Ms. Lannerd is also another conflict of Mr. Heeger’s. I just want what’s rightfully mine. And since Mr. Scholz so openly tried to put myself in a bad light, let it be known that this is NOT the FIRST time Mr. Scholz has been accused of stealing large sums of money. I will say that these statements come from reports from the media. The comments from another former “client” show how displeased she was with him (Exhibit H), notice how the date is December 21, 2011 showing that it was not recently posted to ‘conspire’ against Mr. Scholz. Then a report from KHQA (a local news group on channel 7) reports on their web site Mr. Scholz being accused of not cashing checks for his client’s estate (see exhibit G). Exhibit I are the comments that are connected to the KHQA report and they too were posted on January-September of 2012 as to again not be accused of any ‘conspiracy’. There IS one positive comment, but that was an interpretation based upon what the rest of his family has done, obviously without knowing him personally. The rest of them are negative, agreeing with ‘Riff’ being a thief.   Thank you, 09/23/2013 ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

Orlando, Florida"," IARDC.Org Complaint Response. www.ScholzSucks.Com C. Richard Wray                No. 2013IN03999 3161 W White Oaks Dr. Suite 301 Springfield, IL 62704 In my response to the letter marked September 18, 2013 by Mr. Richard F. Scholz III, I am sorry to say that I not only disagree on his claims that he met with us for at least an hour and twenty minutes, but by analyzing Mr. Scholz’ statements in the way he claims things happened and presenting one key piece of evidence, I can prove we left BEFORE 5:00pm. THIS PARAGRAGH IS TO DESGRIBE WHY I BELIEVE MR SHOLZ IS LYING ABOUT HIS TIME The first reason I say this, is if his secretary does get off at 5:00pm like he claims she does, and if we were truly there for the hour and twenty minutes Mr. Scholz claims he spent with us; then it wouldn’t be his receptionist’s signature on our 500$ receipt. In Exhibit A, it’s highlighted where Mr. Scholz makes specific claims that don’t fit the puzzle. (HOW I KNOW IT’S HIS RECEPTIONIST’S SIGNATURE ON OUR RECIEPT): The first and foremost reason I know it’s her signature on our receipt is I watched her write the receipt out myself. However, Exhibit F bears the same signature as the receipt dated 7-23-2013 (exhibit D).  Exhibit F is a written message FOR “Riff” (aka Mr. Scholz), written by Mr. Scholz’ secretary…meaning that his secretary is the only person who bears this signature. This signature is on BOTH Exhibit F and Exhibit D. THE WAY THINGS HAPPENED: During the consultation, what I was hearing is that he would extend the time and we’d pay him the amount of money out of that retainer for how much work he did. We paid Riff AFTER we explained our situation to him for the fifteen minutes we spent with him. We went out of the consultation room and paid the 500$ in cash to Mr. Scholz’ receptionist. Mrs. Stutheit gave us a receipt (See Exhibit D). (PLEASE CONSIDER WITNESS RELIABILITY) Please note that Mr. Scholz is Mrs. (Ms.) Stutheit’s superior, and there are consequences pertaining her job should she not agree with Mr. Scholz, this is why Mrs. Stutheit is not a reliable witness. The only reason I mentioned her was because I have written confirmation that she was there when we left. HOW I KNOW I DID NOT PAY MR. SCHOLZ BEFORE OR DURING THE CONSULTATION Let’s say that Mr. Scholz’ claims are true in all content (even though they are not), if we were to re-enact the day, consider these observations. If I paid $500 BEFORE the consultation, he wouldn’t have known enough to accept the case. Just in case he tries to claim we paid him before he would talk with us, keep in mind Mr. Scholz makes his statement in exhibit B, “I made that clear AT the conference on July 23rd…” of a non-refundable retainer. He makes it very clear that it was proclaimed DURING the consultation inside his own response; which would mean if I DID pay the 500$ before consultation, he would have still stolen my money by saying it was ‘non-refundable’. And if we ever did agree to a “non-refundable” retainer, it would have been WAY LESS than 500$. And if Mr. Scholz’ claims were accurate, by saying his receptionist only entered the room (according to him, see exhibit A) only to inform him she was leaving, it would insinuate that she left the building without further interaction. If Mr. Scholz’ statements are in any way consistent, it would be HIS signature on our receipt, not his receptionist’s. BUT being that Mr. Scholz’ statements are not accurate, being as I paid his receptionist AFTER the consultation, the receipt acknowledges that his secretary was STILL there. She was there to the very end of our fifteen minutes, to write and sign the receipt. This not only means we got out BEFORE 5:00pm, but also that Mr. Scholz’ claim of his secretary only interacting to inform him that she was leaving is false as well. Meaning that Mr. Scholz is lying about his timing and who was there. This gives his other statements less validity as well. THE REASON I KNOW I DID NOT AGREE TO A ‘NON-REFUNDABLE’ RETAINER We would not have paid 500$ BEFORE we understood what he could do for us. IF I knew that I wasn’t going to be able to get at least SOME of my money back, I would have never asked for his legal representation. He DID say that ALL he COULD do was extend the time line. Sure, I wouldn’t mind extending the timeline, but if I knew his demands were going to be NON-refundable (which he NEVER said) I would have KEPT my money. I would not pay someone $500 non-refundable when they tell me there’s not much I can do and the job is the NEXT day. Plus, why would anybody pay 500$ non-refundable to a person BEFORE they did the job without contract, no matter what their profession? That would be stupid; there would be no warranty that they would accurately DO their job after they got paid. I would NEVER pay ANYONE a non-refundable payment without a letter of engagement, in writing, BEFORE I paid them. Neither would Mr. Heeger. A statement PROMISING that they would do their job. And since we never made that agreement, since I have common sense enough to not waste money like that, the retainer was nothing MORE THAN a regular retainer. THE REASON I KNOW MR. HEEGER WOULD HAVE NEVER AGREED TO A ‘NON-REFUNDABLE’ RETAINER Being that Mr. Heeger is a tougher negotiator than I am and requires everything in writing (not to mention I was right next to him confirmed by Mr. Scholz in Exhibit A). A good example of him requesting things in writing is his request for an itemized statement, talking to Mr. Scholz through email only, and getting receipts of all messages/money given to Mr. Scholz. He would not have agreed to a non-refundable payment either. As Mr. Scholz gives in his exhibit E, Mr. Heeger has obviously done his research on how to get everything in writing. Why would a person who reads books such as this agree to a non-refundable form of payment and NOT get it in writing? Since, Mr. Scholz said that there was not much he could do for us, why would we agree to a non-refundable payment if he couldn’t do much more than we could ourselves? To accuse someone of having a grudge against the system, showing that they’re educating themselves about the system and then trying to make a claim that they made a non-refundable payment agreement without having it in writing (an ignorant move). However Mr. Scholz shows that he is not an ignorant person when pertaining to these matters. That’s an inconsistent and non-realistic statement by Mr. Scholz. IT WASN’T AN EVICTION                 Also another thing I would like to acknowledge is that this case wasn’t an eviction case, it was a demand for possession of property. We didn’t have a rental agreement with the petitioner. This detail shows the lack of effort/time Mr. Scholz put into our representation, meaning that he doesn’t deserve all $500. TRYING TO PAINT A NEGATIVE PICTURE ON ME WITH MR. HEEGER’S DEEDS DOESN’T SOLVE ANYTHING FOR MR. SCHOLZ May I also say that I, Cora Newbold, have NEVER filed any complaints against ANY lawyers until now. Nor have I put up ANY sites of any negative content about the opposing parties OR of Mr. Scholz. Exhibit E features books that I, Cora Newbold, have NEVER read. The only reason I know that those books exist is Mr. Heeger showed me what he used to inform himself during his Mercantile lawsuit in 2007. All of the things Mr. Scholz is using to put ‘us’ in a ‘bad light’ were results of Mr. Heeger’s actions. However, even WITH these actions it DOES NOT give Mr. Scholz an excuse for taking our Money. As he CLEARLY states he represented BOTH of us meaning that I have every right to file this complaint.                 AN EXPLAINATION ON ‘PSYCHOLOGICAL’ PROBLEMS As it states in the paper, I was very scared about the thought of being homeless. However, that does NOT mean that I carry ANY grudge against the legal system. The only ‘problem’ that I psychologically had, had NOTHING to do with the legal system, they had MORE to do with the fact that I had a 10month old, about to get kicked out of a house with nowhere to go. This would make ANYONE in that position anxious. Or as Mr. Heeger likes to colorfully describe it as in Exhibit F “...having a mental break down…”. For Mr. Scholz to take the words ‘psychological problems’, harness them, and use them to create a stereotypical picture, that I am out to harm him in some way due to some mythical ‘grudge’, is unprofessional. Not only is Mr. Scholz not authorized to make that assessment; but to take people merely having a difficult time and blowing it up to insinuate that they’re crazy, (when it’s not their category of expertise) is defaming and discriminatory. Not only that but this subject was brought up to do nothing more than for you to form a negative opinion about me and to avoid the REAL problem. AGAIN MR. HEEGER’S ACTIONS The website, www.ScholzSucks.com, was put up by Mr. Heeger AFTER we found out that Mr. Scholz was wrongfully keeping our money. I admit that Mr. Heeger’s ways of expression are eccentric, but they are nothing more than him expressing his disappointment of Mr. Scholz’ unjust enrichment. Mr. Heeger does have a right to be disappointed, had this not happened in the first place there wouldn’t be a “Scholzsucks.com”. Had Mr. Scholz performed his responsibilities professionally, there would have been no conflict. Sean and I had actually agreed at the time after the court date to give Mr. Scholz $200 out of the original 500$ retainer we paid, out of gratitude for his short-notice representation. However, since Mr. Scholz has created a conflict, drug the conflict out, and has treated us with disrespect, we have changed our minds.                 NO MATTER WHAT THE EXCUSE IT’S AN EXCUSE NONE THE LESS Psychological problems, “grudge against the system”, either way it’s NOT an excuse for Mr. Scholz to take the attention off of his wrong doing and to place it on me.

Because of the money, TN took his deal.  My niece went back to him because of his promised that he will do all paperwork for Eviction us and get the house for TN with no charges at all and he will pay to TN big money.  I knew that because during we argued with them, Huan said that he will take care for TN include to clear his credit history and if we did not take $20,000.00 to move out and took of the name on title, then later we will get nothing even money or house.  We did not want money.  We wanted our house.  Moreover, how can we believe those people because the amount of $20,000.00 was just on verbal with no signed paperwork (Maybe illegal money?) Also I was an owner to make all payments before and I also cost a lot of money to build the House.  I also cost more money to go with another Agent to keep the House; so, how could I walk away.  Therefore, Huan & TN cooperate to Eviction and steal our House.  They signed my name to transfer the Title without my authorization.  They also evicted us without sending us “summon”; therefore, on the day sheriff evicted us, I still had an appointment going to the court for extension.  We had kids; we need more time to move out.  However, we still lost the House because we have no more money to hire a lawyer.  Although, we already reported to the police for the signature on the title did not my signature, but I believe the police or judge cannot do anything to help us?  Now, we lost everything and we still have to pay all debts that we paid to Agent for helping us keep the House.  Now Huan & TN took over our house and letting another family rents out the house.  What do you think? So, be carefully, don’t trust anybody; because of money, they can turn their back any time on you.  In this world is nothing fairly if you have no money. DHTK Garden Grove, CA.

Two months later I receive a notice that her license will be revoked next month for failure to appear. We call Shannon who apologizes and says he will take care of it that week. My wife calls at the end of the week and he says that he hasn't gotten around to it, but we have plenty of time before her license is revoked. I call him back and tell him we have found another attorney. He changes his story and says that he DID take care of the ticket and that it just takes time to go to the DMV.

So if your thinking about using FRT, go with one of the many other attorneys that will actually show up at your court date, or at least fix things when they make a mistake.

A quick Google search shows that Shannon has been disciplined by the state bar in the past for doing the same thing, and he now has another complaint in the works from me.

Jim Black refused to investigate the State's only alleged Witness-Victim, an Impersonator, who falsely accused me of Assault, and of using “The N Word” when I donated two items to a still-unknown employee at Goodwill Industries. She was serving a community service sentence at GW for a drug conviction. She was intoxicated on hard, illegal narcotics, and didn't feel like doing any work. The Impersonator is a manager at GW. This case was all about the Black Mafia and Black politics. GW appears to traffic in drugs, and to bribe officials. GW submitted a fake, re-enacted video of the Scene to the Court, and destroyed the official surveillance video. GW stonewalled me, all the way, as did the corrupt Apex, NC cops. The Apex Police Chief retired early, soon afterward. He repeatedly refused to resign when I fired him. It took me three 130-mile trips to Court to fire him. He argued against me each time, stating that I was a crazy conspiracy theorist because I had fired three preceding Attorneys, none of whom would investigate the Impersonator-Perjuror. Such delayed my Case by about six months. I stayed in NC only to defend myself in this Case. The Case took two years, sixteen trips to court, and 20 trips to Raleigh, total. I moved out of the State, soon afterward. He ordered a psychological evaluation of me, even though three preceding Attorneys, fourteen Judges, and two ADAs did not see such a need. He lied to me by stating that the ADA wanted it. He made the Order to curry favor with the ADA. It took me nine days to write a nine-page description of facts and arguments for the shrink, plus another 138-mile trip to Raleigh. Jim never stated a reason for such an evaluation. A negative evaluation could have hurt my Case. If the shrink had concluded that I was not fit to stand trial, I would never be able to get a job, apartment, gun permit, or insurance, etc. And I would have been sent to a mental hospital, and forced to take drugs. The shrink found me sane, and fit to stand trial. He did a background check on me to find dirt on me that the Court couldn't find. Any dirt would escalate any sentence I would get. He talked to me about traffic tickets he found. He accepted my Case from the Public Defender's Office, even though his specialty was, and is, DUI cases. Therefore, he had a conflict of interest, never mind the inappropriate assignment, both of which he failed to disclose to me. He used me to curry favor with the ADA in my Assault Case to get brownie points for his DUI cases, his bread and butter. He even smirked at the ADA every time he handed my thick, 250-page file (95% written by me, between Attorneys, because my Attorneys failed to defend me) to the ADA. The smirk underscored his Allegation in Court that I was a crazy conspiracy theorist. He failed to reply to about 75% of the questions I wrote to him. He pretended that he never received some of my e-mail. How does an Attorney receive only some of a client's e-mail? Apparently, he doesn't know the laws about archiving e-mail. My next Attorney succeeded in having my Case Dismissed, overturning my Conviction in the lower Court.  ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

Colorado Springs, Colorado"," Jeffery Clark Walker is an attorney with Brock and Stout, here in Alabama, Georga, and Florida. His representation of my wife and I was a total and compleat failure. He cost us around $24,000.00 in cash, time and property. But for his actions, or the lack thereof. Due to his negligence, and incompentence, cost my wife her employment of 15+ years, retirment, health coverage, now for the past two years, she has needed cancer surgery on a tumer located in her neck. He keep trying to get us to break a Federal Court Order. He broke around Rules of Professional Conduct. We have tried to sue him for Malpratice but, comes to find out, lawyers, judges, and D.A. are imuned from law suits. We have been told one can sue an attorney for malpratice but, we have learned that they protect each other in the most harden defences know to man, this is with lies, streach the laws to fit what they need. We were told in that we must prove what we are saying, we said; we can because, all conversations have been recorded, and yet no one wants to hear them. We went to court 05/08/2014, Enterprise, Alabama, with judge kelly, the judge allowed the defence attorney far reaching laditude, while allowing us the (Plaintiffs) NONE. Suck things as allowing the defendant attorney 12 days extra over the allowed 30 days, allowed him to place several motions on the same sheet, with just one cover sheet. We had to with all motions, make each one seperate, with a seperate cover sheet, he is a professional, and we were (PRO-SE), defending our self. We paid for a Jeuy trial, and had to pay extra, with the judge throwing it out, Question, Do we get part of the payment back?, because we did not get a Jury Trial. The attorney refused to contact the Federal Judge and get permission to buy a different car other than the $5,407.07, this is what our insurence paid, and Jeffery said; you have to buy a car for that exact amount because the Judge will not allow for you to keep the difference and would not allow the finance company to keep the difference. After six (6)months trying to get him to get permission and he would just refuse, and would say the Judge will not allow this, around the (7th.) seventh month, guess what? the Judge said this would have been allowed.  He withheld eveidence, he manipulated eveidence, he even distroyed eveidence, and we can prove all of this, and he still walks around with a smile on his face. We aked for documentation on the 16th of May, 2013, giving him until the 28th day of May, 2013, he told a Federal Judge on the (5th) day of June 2013, in that he all ready gave us all requested information, he did not complie information untill the (3rd) day of July, and did not send untill the (9th) ninth day of July, 2013, we did not recieve it untill the (28th) twienty eight day of August, 2013.

Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania"," Las Vegas attorney Tom Pitaro knows the law, and is well-known in Las Vegas legal circles, but his tactics are always the same: delay, delay, delay. And you know the saying: Justice delayed is justice denied. These continuous delaying tactics have a major impact on the victims’ lives and mental well-being. Consider the case of the State of Nevada v. Robert Jackson, Case No. C274436. The state is bringing a case against Jackson, who has been accused of shooting four people on the Strip on Aug. 19, 2007. It was an apparent gang fight, except only bystanders were hit with bullets. Again, that was 2007. It’s now 2013. Jackson avoided capture for four years, but even factoring that in, he still hasn’t come to trial. It’s been two years. And Tom Pitaro has engineered almost every delay, using every legal stalling tactic - in short, every trick in the book - to keep his client out of the courtroom to face the charges. You name it - calendar oversights, Jackson present in court without representation (by Pitaro), bail battles ... This trial has been continued six times from July 2011 to now. Five of these continuances have been at the hands of Pitaro. And now the new trial date has been set for June 16, 2014. This crime occurred in 2007 and the defendant has yet to be tried.Yeah, thanks for all that, Tom Pitaro. How can guy like Jackson – who has a supposed startup photo/video business and can’t meet with clients because of his house-arrest restrictions, who has to take care of his elderly incontinent grandparents, and who has fathered another child since returning to Las Vegas – how on earth can he afford representation from the likes of Tom Pitaro, who is known to command substantial legal fees? After all, he was one of the attorneys who was on O.J. Simpson’s defense team. That’s a question the prosecutors should ask. Is Tom Pitaro still smart enough to pull the wool over Clark County D.A.

I contacted this firm to help me re-build my credit after a divorce and have found that they intentionall mislead you to think that their services are fairly priced and easy to discontinue.

However, since I cancelled, I have no access to my account information...and cannot see any actions that are taken on my behalf. So, my question is: why am I being billed an addtional $99.95?  I called their representative and got a merrry chase about they only bill after services are rendered. Okay, I get that...so, I cancelled 2 days after that months services were rendered...why am I being billed for an addtional month of services when no services will be performed? Buyer beware!

Internet," Mr. Chris Karlen was the most incompetent lawyer we have ever had to deal with.  We have personally worked in the Federal Court system for 30 years and throughout those years have worked with countless attorneys and law firms, both good and bad.  He fails horribly to communicate with his clients and to provide information and updates concerning case status,.  He is self-absorbed with his own grandiose opinion of himself.  It was impossible to get Mr. Karlen to keep us informed about our case.  He never provided letters with updates, case status, outcome of defendant conversations, results of actions pursued, etc.  When he did speak with us he will only speak on the phone so that there is no paper trail.  He will promise everything but not follow through.  He incorrectly completed and failed to file documents.  We had to correct and sometimes generate documents he needed to file and also had to remind him of impending deadlines.  When he does talk to clients he is extremely arrogant and talks down to his clients.  In our entire one year experience he never performed the single, most important objective of our case, the purpose for which he was hired, to request discovery of documents.  When we finally dumped Karlen, and began using another attorney (at 1/3rd the cost), we realized, even more so, what a pathetic job he had done and how refreshing it is to work with a professional attorney.  Not an arrogant, jack leg.  With our new attorney within weeks we had discovery documents filed, full written communication about what was being done and what was going on with our case.  It was        Be very careful doing business with this firm.  As a client, we found many instances of incompetence and false promises.  Demand all communication be done via email/in writing, the attorney makes many false promises and wishes to avoid any type of paper trail.  The law firm has no concern for their client’s best interests.      The client has been a Paralegal / Legal Secretary in legal offices for over 30 years.  With that being said, this law firm, and specifically our attorney Chris Karlen, did not provided a trace of competent legal counsel or client representation.  Had the client not been an experienced legal professional, things would have been more catastrophic.    If a future client of this attorney is not familiar with the law and does not monitor this law firm closely, I fear they will be terribly exploited.   Our overall experience with this attorney and the other firm partners is that they were unprofessional, rude, arrogant, and insulting.   Manipulated charges:  1.1.  Did not perform the services he said he would for the estimated cost.  Within months he was billing additional monies.  1.1.1.     Excerpt from email: “In our initial phone conversation when we discussed retainer fees, you stated you believed the $*k should be enough to get us to the point of having trust documents and financial information to review and that, ‘barring unforeseen complications or issues’, would allow us to make an informed decision about moving forward.  We provided all the necessary information and we relied on your knowledge and experience to estimate what steps and procedures would be involved in this process.  At this point, there have been no unforeseen complications or issues since our initial conversation.  You were even able to outsource your first court trip to a local attorney which saved us quite a bit of money and which we appreciated.  Since we provided you with all the information up front for you to make an informed estimate, we find it difficult to understand how your estimate was so far off that you now require an additional $*k – and we still have no new information.”    Although multiple attempts were made, the attorney never replied to, or even acknowledged, our concerns and questions.   Inflating billing hours: 2.1.  Excerpt from email:  “We hoped that the original $*k retainer would have at least taken us through getting additional documentation to review.   We’re disappointed that the subpoenas were not prepared earlier since they were actually issued before the motion for contempt was served; however, no action was taken on the subpoenas for over 4 months.  This puts us in the position of spending additional money without the benefit of reviewing the documentation and making an informed decision on whether or not to proceed.”     Incompetence - Some examples include: 3.1.  Most baffling is the fact that after 14 months the attorney had still not requested written discovery (request for production of documents) which was our primary objective and always the very first step to be taken. 3.2.  Consistently sent emails to an invalid email addresses. 3.3.  Repeatedly failed to provide us with our copies of documents, subpoenas, etc. 3.4.  Failed to follow our wishes on actions to be taken.  3.5.  Failed to file written discovery. 3.6.  Consistently dropped the ball through the following actions:  3.6.1.     Failure to file subpoenas in the time sensitive manner 3.6.2.     Incorrectly completed subpoenas 3.6.3.     At one point the plaintiff prepared a Motion and provided to attorney for submittal.  However, it was still not filed in time. 3.6.4.     The plaintiff, being a legal secretary, repeatedly had to monitor, follow through, and remind the attorney of deadlines and documents.  Luckily, plaintiff was knowledgeable enough to monitor the situation and catch many errors and delays.  However, that should never have been necessary; especially at the hourly rates we were being charged.      The client, being a paralegal, had to constantly stay on top of the attorney to make sure things got done on time and correctly.  Work done FOR the attorney because he was dropping-the-ball included:  {performed the following tasks and provided to our attorney} 4.1.  Edited and corrected Subpoenas 4.2.  Created Motion (was provided well in advance but still wasn’t filed in time) 4.3.  Researched case law 4.4.  Researched Burden of Proof laws 4.5.  Researched family trust and farm subsidy regulations 4.6.  Reminded attorney of deadlines 4.7.  Constantly monitored attorney’s progress and responsibilities through the courts public information (because we normally did not get any information from the attorney) 4.8.  After extended periods of no activity plaintiff constantly had to remind attorney of what he need to be pursuing and what documents we were trying to accomplish. 4.9.  Researched and provided pertinent County Assessor information                                         Communication: 5.1.  More often than not, attorney would never reply.  When motions were submitted, phone calls made to the defendant, courts, etc. attorney failed to follow-up and tell us what had transpired.   We did not receive copies of documents and attorney was uncooperative answering questions and responding to emails.       5.2.  Every few months we would have to send the attorney emails to get him “back on track”.  We would have no idea what was going.  We had to send attorney detailed emails refocusing him on the original, primary objective.         Phone conversations & questionable honesty: 6.1.  We had an impossible time staying informed and had horrible experiences trying to get any information about what was occurring or had transpired.   We could not get answers to specific questions/issues via phone but instead had some unnecessarily long winded and unproductive discussions. 6.2.  Things that were said and agreed upon over the phone were not carried out at all, or in the manner plaintiff had requested.  Attorney consistently failed to do what he promised, or would sometimes do the opposite of what was requested.  6.3.  We had an impossible time getting attorney to answer questions, we got inconsistent stories, could never get updates, were unable to find out was going on with the case, or get answers about the outcome of a meeting, phone call, or other task, etc. 6.4.  Attorney stated in the first meeting that he preferred telephone communications.  We though this odd in this day and age, but we complied.  We then finally realized this was the attorney’s way of avoiding a paper trail and not getting pinned down on anything he had said or promised.  At that point, we requested all communications be done via email.  After that request, attorney’s communication became almost non-existent.  6.5.  Very, very seldom did attorney follow-up and get back with us as promised.    The Law Firm’s attitude, ethics, and manner: 7.1.  Plaintiff was forced to send multiple emails to the other partners of the firm with complaints.  Nothing was done and no one ever even responded.  Every few months we would have to send attorney emails to get him “back on track”.  We would have no idea what was going.  We would have to send attorney detailed emails refocusing him on the original, primary objective.        I assume attorney had way too much on his plate, didn’t care, or both.  Obviously, it cannot be said that the attorney did no work on the case over the 14 month period.  After prodding and reminding him, he did do some things.  Like filing the same subpoena 3 times, although nothing had changed in the case.  They had just done it wrong the first 2 times.  What we can say is attorney did nothing to represent our best interests, only his billing interests.   As mentioned previously, throughout the year we voiced concerns and complaints, both to the attorney and to the other firm partners, in the event they may have been unaware of the problems and issues.  All complaint communications were completely ignored and never replied to.     Finally, the attorney botched the filing of a Motion and we complained again.  It was blatant incompetence, and attorney couldn’t even attempt to concoct an excuse this time.  There was also no apology…only arrogance.  Attorney then immediately terminated our attorney-client relationship, ceased to be our council.

She overwhelmingly hurt our long drawn-out case and my brother ended up taking a plea bargain to end the case because my dad was going through cancer and was too stressful on him. My dad and myself were loaning my brother money to pay this crooked lawyer and she took all of my 87 year old dads life savings. We all were appalled at her performance, especially the amount she kept on charging us and always showed up unprepared. The judge even asked her  where she got her education as she seemed to always upset him. When my brother finally decided to take the plea bargain, we thought that would be the end of the night mare. A day later, my dad received a final bill from this crook that almost sent us all into cardiac arrest. It was outrageous and we realized that this couldn't be normal. It lead my brother to the only thing he could do to save his house and filed bankruptcy as she was threatening to take it. After the bankruptcy, she even had the nerve to take my brothers inheritance that has been handed down since my ancestors came over on a ship. Now, I can't even believe this, she is going for my dad. Two weeks ago she issued my 87 yr old dad a summons for a ridiculous amount of money. We have no more to give. My dad, myself and my brother have given all our money, my dads life savings and she has milked and robbed us enough. She is lying about my dad giving a verbal agreement that he would pay her ridiculous ending balance. She does not have any written agreement from my dad. My dad has never gave her any verbal agreement, has never signed anything to this matter. This is not my dads bill. Both my dad and I have only tried to help my brother out in loaning him the money to pay these outrageous amounts for her service that we all were all terribly unsatisfied with. She literally hurt my brothers case. I did try to file a complaint during the court case but to no avail. I helped my dad file an answer to her summons 2 days ago so this case is pending. When will this stop. In my opinion she is using her position to take advantage and blatantly steel from us. We have no more for her to steel and she still wants more? Where can I go to stop this madness? What a greedy person taking advantage of her position. She is making her profession look really bad. She needs to stop harassing my dad and to give back my brothers ancestral inheritance and give my dads life savings back. This would leave her with a fair amount of money we have paid her on a very unsatisfactory service she didn't perform.

Elam requires you pay his entire fee upfront which should have been my first big red flag. Once that fee was paid Mr. Elam would take days to return emails and texts.

We hadn't heard from him in awhile and we wanted an update. I waited patiently for 24 hours and never heard back. I sent Brett A. Elam a second email on 6/28/13 telling him this was not acceptable and that I was going to be writing a review about his services. I would say towards the end of the day I got a very troubling email back which included this:  ""First, I was on vacation and returned last night.   I have just now returned to my office. Second, this is absolutely the last email you will send me like this, am I crystal clear?   I will respond when I get to my office and get tomorrow this matter."" -Brett A.

We hired The Law Offices of Brett A. Elam not the other way around. And most importantly, if Brett A. Elam was on vacation why wasn't there an autoreponder letting people know at the very least or a secretary managing his account during his absence?

Law office of Carey Ann Harper,"  Law office of Carey Ann Harper  468 north camden drive 
Beverly Hills, California United States of America ",,(626)394-3998,"Law office of Carey Ann Harper Attorney Carey Ann Harper Attorney Carey Ann Harper Is a Very IMMORAL and DISHONEST lawyer Beverly Hills, California"," On or about 2009 the Summit Principals filed bankruptcy after they had hired Obsidian Finance Group, David Aman’s client to help them restructure debt. David Aman was involved to protect Tonkon Torp Law Firm and Leon Simson of Tonkon Torp who had previously worked with Kevin Padrick and with Dept. of Justice Trustee Pamela Griffith. This enabled attorney and co-owner of Obsidian Finance Group, Kevin Padrick to get the Trustee job and make millions a year over 5 years. Also his prior work with Perkins Coie attorney Steven Hedberg at Miller Nash helped him as Hedberg was the Creditors attorney. Also then attorney Michael Simon was a creditor attorney and worked with Kevin Padrick on the 30 million dollar plus, Umpqua Bank Settlements. Perkins Coie attorney Michael Simon then became Judge Michael Simon and was put into office the same time as Judge Michael Simon, Cox alleges they are friends. Perkins Coie hosted the event that welcomed Judge Hernandez into office. It is important to note that Judge Marco Hernandez was not a Federal Judge in Portland until AFTER David Aman filed a 10 million dollar lawsuit against a penniless, homeless blogger who was exposing the inside dealing of the Summit Bankruptcy. Together David Aman and his client Kevin Padrick sued, and bullied any Summit insider who objected to their fees, video taped public meetings, filed court documents they did not approve of, and well, anyone that did not do exactly as they wanted was harassed, sued, set up, got criminal charges for fake acts, and even forced into mental institutes. On December 23, 2010 David Aman, Tonkon Torp Law Firm sent me a cease and desist requesting I, Crystal Cox, remove content online about  his client Kevin Padrick and Obsidian Finance. I had been reporting on the Summit Bankruptcy for 3 years by this time as David Aman clearly knew as he deposed Summit Insider Stephanie DeYoung and asked her Crystal Cox’s motive for posting, of which she answered in video at a deposition in August of 2009. David Aman gave me no blog post that he wanted removed, or had issue with and I literally had thousands by that time. With no way to know what he was requesting to be removed, therefore I did not remove any. David Aman filed a 10 million dollar lawsuit against me, just weeks after this, on January 14th 2011 saying the same generic information and stating No Blog post and requesting NO JURY Trial. According to Oregon’s Retraction Laws, Aman is required to ask for a retraction and then wait 2 weeks before he sues, otherwise he has no defamation claim. This law was completely ignored in this case and Defendant Crystal Cox, my, rights were completely violated. About Dec. 2010 or earlier David Aman began conspiring with a man named Sean Boushie, whom he knew there was a clear record that this man had threatened to kill me. David Aman worked with this man to harass me, bully me, keep me in constant fear and he was to come to the trial and bully me. I filed a motion to Exclude, Judge Hernandez granted this and claimed, as the record shows, that he was contacting the FBI on these matters in a hearing on Nov. 18th 2011. This FBI involvement never happened. Aman continued to conspire with this man. Throughout 2011 Aman contacted me by phone and email, lied to me, bullied me, offered me settlement offers that would incriminate others and discriminated against me as a pro se litigant as well as constantly threatened me and lied to me. As a top Oregon Law Firm, Judge Marco Herndandez protected David Aman over the rights of pro se litigant Crystal Cox, me. I allege they had many private communications of which I, Crystal Cox, pro se was not privy to and in this communications they discussed my alleged guilt of extortion and how they would paint me out as a criminal extortionist to the world, of which they have now successfully done. And has caused ire On Nov. 29th 2011, David Aman forced me to be deposed and questioned my on topics unrelated to the blog post I was on trial for, one of which was my internet marketing business that I had tried to do but never made a living at. I refused, Judge Hernandez came into the room, the video camera and court reporter were shut off and Judge Marco Hernandez ordered me tell Aman about this business. Aman’s motive was to set me up for the crime of extortion, of which violated my 14th amendment and 5th amendment rights and forced me to essentially incriminate myself. Mid Nov. 2011 Cox filed a motion asking Aman to again to stop accusing her of extortion. It was proper to file a criminal complaint if he thought Cox guilty of a crime and not use a civil court, connections with a Judge and manipulation of a Jury of which Cox never agreed to have. On Nov. 28th 2011, At the hearing before this deposition, Cox asked Judge Hernandez if Aman was allowed to bring in that one email into evidence, the Judge said he was not unless I testify, so Aman and Judge Hernandez tricked me into not testifying in my own defense, and then they let the email in anyway into the closing statement. Having asked the next day and told it was not coming in, I was not prepared with my easy defense of the 4 other emails of the email thread that David Aman willfully, neglectfully, deliberately left out to paint me as a criminal in a civil trial and cover up the crimes of elite portland Oregon law firms, DOJ Trustees, Bankruptcy Judges, utility and finance companies. The other 4 emails show that I was not saying what he painted to the world that I had said. And this email was an attorney to attorney email, as I was my own attorney. It was privileged and it was sent after I was sued for 10 Million dollars, yet David Aman made it the center of attention to put up a smoke screen and hide the corrupt and illegal actions of his law firm and his client in the Summit Bankruptcy proceeding. His client Kevin Padrick was under contract with Summit to help them restructure debt, he took a 100,000 from them and they had a signed contract. Under contract law this cannot be interfered with and under bankruptcy law Kevin Padrick was an insider and unable to be a Trustee then working on the opposite side of his cilent and essentially bankrupting them, setting them up for jail time, liquidating them and only when he got a 15% fee on everything that he SOLD. Before this time he simply seized and froze assets. Kevin Padrick did not declare in his trustee statement that he had prior contracts with Summit and clear conflicts of interest in working for the debtor and was therefore legally an insider, and in bankruptcy code, an “insider” is not allowed to be a Trustee. And in the Tax Code, in a 1031 Exchange Company a legally defined “insider” is not a “qualified intermediary”. Thus Cox claimed and still claims Tax Fraud and Bankruptcy Code Violations, as well as violations of Contract Law per contracts that Obsidian had with Summit. This court knows enough to order an investigation in the Summit Bankruptcy yet has not, Cox alleges this is to protect corruption in Portland Oregon. The court cannot interfere with contract law, yet Judge Randall Dunn ruled that Kevin Padrick be appointed Trustee which was in clear opposition to the best interest of the Creditors and violated contract law. Judge Marco Hernandez and David Aman knows that Kevin Padrick broke the LAW, alleges COX. And Cox alleges that he is protecting Perkins Coie mainly, and Judge Michael Simon. David Aman was Kevin Padrick’s attorney in the Summit Bankruptcy and involved in the corruption that Cox was and is alleging in the behind the scenes of that Bankruptcy. The TRUTH is Kevin Padrick was not LEGALLY able to be the TRUSTEE as a MATTER OF LAW. Therefore the Summit Bankruptcy should be VOID, started over and Kevin Padrick and all his co-conspirators such as Judge Randall Dunn, DOJ Trustee Pamela Griffith, Tonkon Torp’s Leon Simpson, and Perkins Coie Steven Hedberg SHOULD all go to JAIL. It is a BLATANT Fact that Kevin Padrick did not declare in his trustee statement that he had prior contracts with Summit and clear conflicts of interest in working for the debtor and was therefore legally an insider, and in bankruptcy code, an “insider” is not allowed to be a Trustee. And a fact per the record that a TRUSTEE was NOT in the best interest of the creditors PERIOD. David Aman blocked and prevented me from testifying at my trial in my own defense with lies about evidence, tricks and deceit. David Aman maliciously used an email I had sent him as a settlement offer to make the Jury think I was a criminal and that my motive, my “malice” was to post online about him and his client then 3 years later ask for the money to remove the content. When the whole email thread, including 5 emails showed that I was not intending “extortion”, it is clear. Yet Aman, desperate to discredit me to the world and keep the eyes off the criminal activity of Tonkon Torp and Kevin Padrick, he painted to the Jury and later to the world that I, Crystal Cox was a Felony Extortionist. Cox had a 1 day trial on Nov. 29th, 2011, the Jury loathed Cox so much they gave the Plaintiff $500,000 more then they asked for, for a total of $2.5 million. Cox would have had a smaller judgement if she had simply not attended the trial. Cox was bullied, denied due process, the Judge and Aman conspired, she was set up, discriminated against and her life made the collateral damage to protect Portland Oregon’s Elite. December 2011 after getting a $2.5 Million Judgement against Cox, attorney David took a private settlement negotiation, one email out of a 5 email thread and gave it to the Seattle Weekly, maliciously, deliberately, with malice, neglectfully and willfully telling them that I, Crystal Cox had extorted him and his client. The whole world then believed Cox a criminal as he and his client spread the email and the allegations to Forbes, the New York Times, the OS Bar magazine, the AP press, and many other big and small media and legal publications world wide. This has deliberately caused Crystal Cox, me, irreparable damage and my wish of the Oregon Bar is to ensure this does not happen to anyone else and to STOP Aman from doing this to me again in my new trial. On or about December 10th 2011, David Aman negotiated a deal with attorney Marc Randazza, it was some sort of deal to STOP me, Cox from appealing my ruling to the Ninth Circuit. I was made aware of this by attorney, UCLA professor Eugene Volokh. Marc Randazza was acting as my attorney to negotiate a deal that would benefit his big money clients in the Porn Industry, such as Liberty Media. Randazza posed as my attorney with no contract no agreement with me, and David Aman simply negotiated a deal and they moved forward with out my, the client, a pro se litigant’s knowledge or approval. Once I found out I made sure Randazza knew he did not represent me, as I wanted Professor Eugene Volokh to represent me on appeal and NOT Marc Randazza. It was unethical, and I allege, unlawful for David Aman to be negotiate a deal without my knowledge, knowing full well I was pro se and had been in court with him as my own attorney 2 weeks prior and filing motions for the prior year as my own attorney. After my firing attorney Marc Randazza, who did not have my permission to be negotiating for me, he got very angry and retaliated. Oregon attorney David Aman participated in this retaliation, willfully and with knowledge of it being unethical and unlawful. Marc Randazza contacted Aman and they made a plan to set me up for the crime of extortion. Randazza agreed that he would testify that I extorted him. But that Aman would have to Subpoena him in order to make it look legit, as Randazza had acted as my attorney, thought he did not have my permission and things could get sticky. So Aman subpoenaed Randazza. I was pro se so I got a copy of this subpoena so I began to blog the story and fight for my life as it was already shown that Judge Hernandez believed I was guilty of extortion and had taken a pot shot at that accusation in a ruling denying a new tria. So we had 2 attorneys and a Judge setting me up for extortion without due process, and in violation of my rights, my only hope was to start a blog and expose the situation of which I did, and for some reason Randazza never testified. Later he claimed to a court that I had intimidated him. Thing is I had questions ready to ask him and planned to be at the deposition. Aman then conspired with Randazza to hire “receiver” Laura Pearson who had worked with Randazza before in the Righthaven cases to seize blogs and get assets from litigants. Aman conspired with Randazza to SEIZE Cox’s right to appeal. On or about December 2012 David Aman conspired with Marc Randazza of Randazza Legal Group and Steven Wilker of Tonkon Torp law firm to seize my right to appeal a $2.5 million Judgement, see document, 144 and 145 of Obsidian v. Cox, Motion to Stay, the attached documents show the planned sheriff sale. At this time I represented myself on my assets. Randazza knowing his trick well, as a Florida attorney, coached, counseled Aman on how to file documents in the county where I live and in Multnomah County Oregon, to have a sheriff’s sale and auction of my “right to appeal” the $2.5 Million Judgment in Obsidian v. Cox, in order to satisfy the debt. At this time I was well into my Ninth Circuit Appeal. Aman, Tonkon Torp Lawyer, having powerful connections in Oregon, got a sheriff to issue this documents and set this auction. Just before Christmas vacation I contacted my appeal attorney Eugene Volokh, he wrote up an addition to our contract so he could represent me on this matter, filed a motion to stay, then flew to a hearing in Portland to block David Aman’s unconstitutional, unethical actons against Cox. Aman and Randazza continued for years to bully, threaten, harass and sue Cox, me, in order to STOP me from my Ninth circuit appeal or get me to “deal”, to settle. I won my ninth circuit appeal, fighting and clawing all the way to stay in it. And now I face a new trial where David Aman is again representing Obsidian. I have filed a motion to remove him as there is no way to get a fair trial with Judge Marco Hernandez as the Judge again and attorney David Aman involved. Crystal Cox, me, alleges that David Aman violated my constitutional rights, human rights, civil rights, rules of procedure and broke the law in his dealings with me in the Obsidian Finance Group v. Crystal Cox case. I allege that he acted willfully, deliberately negligent, unethically and relentless attacked me completely outside of law and in violation of my due process rights and all to retaliate against a whistleblower, an investigative reporter writing on the Summit Bankruptcy of which he was involved in.  Posted Proudly by Blogger Crystal L.

CUOMO,I, James S. R, swear that everything I said in this letter true: 1.  I am writing this letter to report the ongoing fraud committed by my attorney,  Frederic M. Gold and Philip Dinhofer,  and the defense attorney's James M. Woolsey and Andrew P. Keaveney.  These attorney's are dishonest and they have to be brought to justice for their crimes that were committed against me and our justice system.  I already notified the Bar Association,  the New york City District Attorney's office, and the F.B.I.'s office in Melville, New york.  All of them said, that they don't handle these types of  crimes committed by Attorney's.  I have clearly been defrauded by these Attorney's and I am asking you to do a full investigation involving Fraud, Perjury, Misconduct, Payoff's, and Conspiracy.  With all evidence I collected for the last year you will clearly see the ongoing fraud that has been going on for over six years now! Because of my disability, theseAttorney's involved took full advantage of me and destroyed my life! 2. Because of an accident I had while working in the Track Department for the Long Island Railroad on August 1, 2003,  I retained Mr. Frederic M. Gold to file a Personal injury lawsuit (FELA) for the damages I sustained that left me with 2 rods and 6 screws in my lower back. The defense attorney for the Long Island Railroad was an outside contractor named Andrew p. Keaveney who is one of the attorney's for the firm, Landman, Corsi, Ballaine, and Ford.  The Federal Judge who was assigned to the case was visiting Federal Judge named Judge Gregory W. Carman held in the Federal courthouse in Central Islip, New York.  ( R v's LIRR, case # 04-CV-1820.)3.  Before trial was held in July of 2006 their were many pretrial hearings that took place. I was at the pretrial conference at Judge Carman's chambers in Brooklyn, New York on May 24, 2006.  Andrew P. Keaveney offically offered another job on the LIRR as a Ticket Information Clerk because of my ongoing back problem that payed $4 dollars less an hour. On July 12, 2006, my attorney excepted the position in my behalf and Judge Carman Stipulated our agreement. At trial the jury was instructed by Judge Carman, and by the attorney's that the LIRR gave me another job that I was able to do because of my disability that paid $4 dollars less an hour. The Jury was instructed and believed that the LIRR was taking care of me with another position and awarded me the $4 dollar difference for one job to the other for my work life expectancy. After the trial was over Ireported to work and I was sent home without pay.  Three days later I get a letter in the mail for the Long Island Railroad telling me I was TERMINATED.4. I then called my Attorney, Frederic M. Gold, and told him that I was Terminated and that the Railroad broke our Stipulated Agreement. Then Mr. Gold told me that he was going to call Judge Carman to reopen the case. About a week later Mr. Gold called me back and told me that Judge Carman said No,  he will not open the case and that he said to move on to a Breach of Contract lawsuit in state court. After that Mr. Frederic M. Gold sends me a check from the FELA case about a month and a half later. He said this money should hold you over until we get back to court for the Breach of Contract lawsuit.  It took about four and a half years to get back to court.  By then I lost everything.5. Mr. Frederic M. Gold filed a Complaint letter ( Plaintiff Demands Trial By Jury) on September 29, 2006 to the Supreme courts in New York. In paragraph # 8 Mr. Gold explains that we had a Stipulated Agreement that I was going to start a new position as a travel information clerk. The Stipulated agreement was made on July 12, 2006 by both attorney's and Judge Gregory W Carman. It was entered into evidence by my attorney, Frederic M. Gold, as Exhibit # 2 during the FELA trial. Because someone Sealed the Stipulated Agreement,  I am unable to get it at this time.6. Mr Frederic M. Gold filed a sworn affidavit on November 6, 2008, that was notarized by Theresa Mahlstadt esq, for the Breach Of Contract Lawsuit.  In this affidavit Mr. Gold explains in paragraph's3, 4, 5, that Mr. Andrew P. Keaveney offer the new TIC position at the pretrial hearing dated on May 24, 2006, Memorialized Letter, which would minimize his claim for future damages. Mr. gold explains that Andrew P. Keaveney told Judge Carman that the offer was in fact made at the pretrial meeting.  Mr. Gold explains that they both agreed on my future lost earnings in his affidavit and that Andrew P. Keaveney has to testify against his own client, the Long Island Railroad, to be my witness at the Breach of Contract trial.  Mr Gold also said, Judge Carman, in an effort to streamline the lost future earnings figuares and calculation, encouraged Defendent's attorney, Andrew P. Keaveney and I to agree on Mr. Rxxxxs future lost earnings. Then they came to an Agreement. He also explains that the calculation of these number was reached with the assistance of Judge Carman. In this affidavit, Mr Gold admitseverything except the date of the Stipulation Agreement that was made on July 12, 2006 that was in fact Sealed to coverup this Fraud. 7. A week before the Breach Of Contract (case #603453/06),held in the New york Supreme Courthouse, N.Y. ,Held by Judge Shirley Werner Kornreich.  I was told by Mr Frederic M. Gold that he was going to take the witness stand to explain the Stipulated agreement to the Jury. Mr Gold informed me the Mr. Philip Dinhofer was going to be my trial attorney.  I met with Mr. Dinhofer a few days beforetrial and explained to him that we had a Stipulated agreement and that the jury was instructed by Judge Carman that I was starting the TIC position following trial.  The jury relied on the new position less $4 dollars an hour to come up with there verdict at the personal injury trial.                                                        8. A few hours before the Breach of Contract trial started Mr. Gold told me that he Subpoenaed Judge Gregery W. Carman to take the witness stand as my witness. Mr. Gold told me that Judge Carman was going to explain that we had a Stipulated Agreement in detail to the Jury.  The Defense attorney in this case was James M. Woolsey who works in the same law firm as Andrew P. Keaveney from the FELA trial.  Mr. Gold said that he knew Mr. Woolsey for 28 year and they have worked together in many other cases.9. When the Breach of Contract trial started,  my trial attorney, Philip Dinhofer had me go on the witness stand.  He didn't ask me any questions about the Stipulated Agreement that we discussed in his office before trial.  When I came off the witness stand,  I asked him why didn't you ask me any questions about the stipulated agreement.  He told me that Mr. Gold and Judge Carman will explain that part of the case to the jury.10.When Mr. Frederic M. Gold took the witness stand he was questioned first by Philip Dinhofer. Mr. Dinhofer never asked him about the offer from Andrew P. Keaveney or about the Stipulated agreement. Mr. Dinhofer avoided it again.  Next,  Mr. James M. Woolsey questioned Mr. Gold and asked him if the TIC postion was ever offered or talked about at any pretrial hearing for the FELA case and Mr Frederic M.Gold said,  NO,  IT WAS NEVER OFFERED OR DISCUSSED AT ANY PRETRIAL HEARING,  AND THAT HE ASSUMED  I HAD THE TIC POSITION.  I could not believe Mr. Frederic Gold just  lied like that on the witness standunder oath.  When Mr. Gold can off the witness stand I asked him why did you lie.  He said that I was confused and that the TIC position was never offered or documented at any pretrial meeting. I told Mr. Philip Dinhofer that Mr. Gold was lying undre oath.  He didn't do anything about it and went on like nothing happened.  It was obvious that they were in on this fraud together. My hands were tied at that point.11. When Mr. Andrew P. Keaveney took the witness stand he was questioned by Mr. James M. Woolsey, and he said the same thing as Mr.Gold.  Mr. Keaveney also denied that he ever offer the TIC position to me and that they never had any Stipulated Agreement.  Also Mr.Keaveney said that the letters T.I.C was never brought up at any pretrial hearing from the FELA case.  Next, Philip Dinhofer questioned Mr. Keaveney and he again denied everything and then told the jury that he swore an oath when he became a Lawyer to always tell the truth.  Both  Frederic M. Gold and  Andrew P. Keaveney  committed a Federal crime when they took  the oath and then lied on the witness stand to cover up this Fraud. 12. After Mr. Andrew P. Keaveney lied on the witness stand,  I told Mr Dinhofer that I wanted a mistrial because everyone was lying on thewitness stand.  He said he will ask Judge Kornreich and then get back to me.  When Mr Dinhofer came back to me he said that she said, NO. Then I tood up and asked her myself and she said  DON'T TALK TO ME,  TALK TO YOUATTORNEY.  I was trapped and couldn't do anything about the lying that was going on!  It was obvious that all four ofthese attorney's were involved in the Fraud.  The court would only listen to the attorney's and my hands were tied.13. Next thing that happened was Judge Gregory W. Carman was suppose to talk the witness stand and he never showed up.  Mr. Frederic M.Gold said that he called the Judge to come and take the witness stand, but now he refused to come. So Judge Kornreich said,  IfJudge Carman doesn't want to take the witness stand,  he doesn't have to.  I'm not going to sent the Sheriff's after him.  Judge Carman was my last hope for the truth to come out,  and now I knew I was going to lose this case, because everyone was in on this CORRUPTION SCAM.  Of course the jury came back with a not Guity verdict in behalf of the LIRR.14. After court was over I got into a cab with Mr. Gold and Mr.Dinhofer and I was very upset about the Scam that happened at trial. When we got out of the cab Mr. Frederic M. Gold told me not to worry and that there was problem.  Mr. Frederic Gold told to me that Mr.Andrew P. Keaveney's Law firm was in a lot of trouble because of this Breach of Contract Lawsuit.  He said that Mr. Keaveney never had permission for the Railroad to offer the TIC position at the Pretrial hearing!  Then Mr. Gold said he has a lot of money for me from  Mr.James Woolsey and Mr. Dinhofer said he was going to appeal this case.I responded by saying,  YOU CORRUPTED MY CASE. Then Mr.Frederic Gold and Mr. Philip Dinhofer walked away from me.  I stood there in shock and couldn't believe this was going on!  The next Monday after court I tried calling Mr. Gold and he would not respondor call me back. 15. After a few weeks I went to the Federal Courthouse in central Islip, New york and also went to the Supreme Courthouse, N.Y., NewYork and copied all the paperwork that was on file from the Personal Injury case and the Breach of Contract trials.  I found the evidence to prove that both Frederic M. Gold and Andrew P. Keaveney  both lied and Committed Perjury on the witness stand,  because they wereworking together to coverup a Fraud.  Also, someone put a SEAL on all the EXHIBIT'S from the Personal Injury case to cover up our Stipulated Agreement so knowone can get it.  If you look at the History of case number ( 04-CV-1820 ) in the Central Islip, New York,Federal Courthouse,  you will see that(HISTORY #47  is sealed) andall Exhibits were sealed.  When they are UNSEALED you will see the Stipulated Agreement that both attorney's lied about!16. I also contacted the Supreme Courthouse in N.Y. New York and found out the Philip Dinhofer did file the notice of an Appeal on December 22, 2010.  Then I wrote Mr. Dinhofer and asked him what was going on with the Appeal.  Mr Philip Dinhofer wrote me back and said he never filed any Appeal.  I sent him 3 letters asking him about the Appeal and he sent me 3 letters back and denied that he filed any Appeal in my behalf.  The problem is that I have 2 letters that Mr. Dinhofer did file an Appeal,  but he denies that he ever did.  The Notice of Appeal letters are signed and dated with his name( Mr. Philip Dinhofer) and his address is on the notice of Appeal.  Then I get a letter from Mr. Frederic M. Gold telling me that Mr. Philip Dinhoferwent to the Supreme Courthouse and had himself removed from the Appeal.  Like I said,  Mr Dinhofer denied in 3 different letter's that he filed an Appeal in my behalf.  Now I have Mr. Gold telling me Mr Dinhoper had himself removed from the case somehow in which I was never notified by the court of this. LIE AFTER LIE AFTER LIE!!! Now the Appeal has expired because of their actions. This has been an Ongoing Fraud for the last 6 years now and these Attorney's have to be stopped.  How many other people have they done this to and how many people are they going to do this to?17. Because of my own attorney that I retained to represent me,  Mr.Frederic M. Gold was involved in this fraud my family and I have been suffering very badly! I am disabled with no job now and millions of dollars was stolen from me because of this Scam.  I have the evidence to prove that Mr. Frederic M. Gold,  Mr. Philip Dinhofer,  Mr. James M. Woolsey,  and Mr. Andrew P. Keaveney were all involved in this Conspiracy.  I have been going through this ongoing fraud for over 6 years now and until I get justice, I will not stop. These attorney's involved are destroying our justice system with there dishonest ways.Trust me, they think there gonna get away with it. 18. I am asking you to do a full investigation in this matter so I can get justice from these Attorney's that are abusing thereLicense's. There has to be someone overseeing the corruption that goes on in the court's between these attorney's. They are abusing there license's to profit in a dishonest way and need to be stopped. I already have a lot of the evidence you will need to conduct your investigation against these attorney's.  I am sending you the evidence that will clearly prove that what I told you is true. Please Help Me! Everyday is getting harder to deal with this Corruption that destroyed my life!  All I'm asking is for the truth to come out.  You will see that everything I said is true. 19. When I was in court for the  Personal injury trial or theBreach of contract trial everything was in my attorney's hands.I am relying on my attorney to represent me in the best of his ability's, and to find out that Mr. Frederic M. Gold was working for the defense attorney's all along.  Mr. Frederic M. Gold and Andrew P.Keaveney clearly lied on the witness stand to misinform the jury at the Breach Of Contract trial. All the Attorney's involved in this Fraud are trying to cover it up, but I have the evidence in Mr. Frederic Gold's own words that he did have a Stipulated Agreement .  20. Because of my disability, I am suffering everyday with cronic back pain because of the rods and screws in my back.  Now I have to deal with these corrupt attorney's that took advantage of my situation!  I cannot live with what they have done to me!  I will gladly sent you the evidence I have to prove that what I am telling you is true. I desperately need help.  To much time has gone by and my life is destroyed. I can't live with what these attorney's did to me.

Had an approved return July 2012 but when we did not receive it - we contacted them and was told that their accounts were ""frozen"" from other customers wanting returns and getting their credit card companies involved. We were asked to work with them to get us paid back. THEY proposed paying $500/month + finance charges on our credit card until the full amount was paid back. They did as they promised for a few months and then stopped. When we called asking what happened, we were told that funds were short and some accounts were still frozen but they were expecting to pay the next month. We continued to hear the same excuse month after month. We called our credit card company to see if they could help. We submitted all the written emails, the approved return paperwork and proposal they suggested to the credit card company. (Yes all in writing.) However,the credit card company said too much time had now passed especially since we were NOT calling it fraud - we just wanted the credit card company to apply pressure on Legally Mine to do the right thing. Legally Mine indicated to the credit card company that they intend to pay, but we continue to NOT receive any payment. I finally reached out again on 2/14/14 to Dave Gibb (who has been the main contact)to find out what the status of the return was. I heard the same excuses. I explained that this ""return"" of my money had turned into an involuntary loan with the best possible terms for THEM (0% interest, pay whenever you want - or maybe never?) I suggested that even a small $100-200/month payment plan would help to restore the broken trust in this relationship and would help to reassure me that they intend to pay as promised. Dave said he understood and would speak with the owners (I assume the McNeffs') at a meeting last friday(2/21). I finally hear today by email the SAME   EXCUSE!!!! They don't have the funds but will put me on some ""priority payment"" list so I should ""hopefully"" receive a payment by the end of April! I am beyond disappointed and frustrated with this company. They just keep telling me to ""be patient"". I believe I have been very patient and have given them more than a reasonable amount of time to simply do what they promised. It amazes me that they are in a service industry - I would assume they are going out and drumming up business which includes a ""no risk"" return policy similar to what I signed up for and yet they continue to show me through their actions that they do not value their clients! They have made it clear to me that I am not the only one in this situation, so if everyone else who had a return processed by them is having the same experience as I am than how is it possible for them to have an ""A"" rating with the BBB? I also contacted the BBB about this.  I have requested through the BBB that Legally Mine honor their promise to refund our money. I would like the FULL amount of $3000.00. I'm being VERY generous about ""forgetting"" the promise to pay the finance charges even though our credit card company does not take us being ""short on funds"" as a viable excuse not to pay this month! I was being patient by agreeing to a payment plan, but due to the lack of integrity they have demonstrated I no longer believe them. I will update this report accordingly.

I called the number to check it out cause I was having hard time keeping up with payments since I got disabled from work since Nobber of last year and not getting money from workman's comp. So I am desperate. When I called they said I need to pay upfront amount $3500, told me to not pay my monthly mortgage payments for 2 months only which I mistakenly did, Alex Noble didn't explain to me what's the impact of this action to my credit And didn't warm me that I will be receiving foreclosure notices because of this. She also assured me that it takes a couple of months to process and will get a full refund if I fell i don't want to continue, so it seemed to me that time it's worth a try for I have nothing to lose. I have submitted all required documents and several times they keep on asking for the same documents that I already faxed. Their so hard to rich after they got all my payments already. I waited for 4 months to get an update but nothing came out until I got letter in the mail from my mortgage lender stating that they are removing Richey Law's Authorization over my mortgage negotiation. So I was alarmed and kept calling them for days until I said I am reporting your company finally I got a response and said they need to restart the application etc... So I said this is taking too long, this is not what was discussed to me, no updates, too have to reach your processing department, I am very disappointed in this firm. I was asking for my full refund but they are giving me all excuses that it's not gonna be full. So analyn Delgado filed the request for refund more than a week ago and still didn't here about my refund, which is contradictory to what they told me that it takes a week to process.  ALL I ASK IS TO GIVE ALL MY MONEY BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE PLEASE. I trusted you to deliver what was assured me off  and paid the $3500 deposited in the account number you have provided me (I have copies of this 2 deposits) But didn't so why should I suffer for this?

As a Part of the Corporate Advocacy Program the member business allows Ripoff Report to send an email to all of those who filed a complaint in the past, letting the customer know, the member business wanted to make things right with them, whatever it takes to do so. Ripoff Report always monitors these emails to insure the member business does what they agreed to. The people at Glen Lerner Injury did just that. This national law firm for injured people has gone through great lengths to make sure they try and resolve any and all customer issues. They joined the Corporate Advocacy Program because they want customers to know they will resolve any and all customer issues. They never want their customers to feel like they weren’t taken care of.

Our personal injury attorneys and support staff work together to help ensure that are client's best interests are maintained, in and out of the courtroom. We are not out to make a quick buck, but to get the most compensation available, when possible, to cover our clients expenses, damages, future medical requirements and pain and suffering.” WHY THIS LAW FIRM FOR INJURED PEOPLE IS BETTER THAN THEIR COMPETITORS  The attorneys of this national personal injury law firm have built a reputation of aggressively negotiating settlements for clients and getting them the most amount of money possible to cover medical expenses, damages, and ongoing financial obligations. This national law firm handles personal injury cases of all sizes. What makes this law firm better is that their attorneys and support staff are easily accessible 24/7 and they are more willing to take on cases that other personal injury law firms have declined to handle. Another quality that makes this national law firm better is that their affiliated network of lawyers are also skilled at representing clients with military injury claims (TSGLI) and mass tort claims against dangerous drug and defective product liability manufacturers. Glen Lerner Injury Attorneys / Statements from the Owner.  My name is ”Glen Lerner and I am the owner and founding attorney of Glen Lerner Injury Attorneys. I would like to thank you for taking the time to review our national law firm for injured people. I would also like to thank the Rip-off Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program for the opportunity to address and rectify any grievances of past clients. We understand that personal injury accidents not only impact the lives and livelihood of the injured, but also those of their loved ones. We also understand that on occasion there are specific circumstances that may result in a client feeling less than satisfied with the outcome of their case. That is why we work hard to help ensure that our clients fully understand the possible outcomes and payouts of a claim prior to settling. We invite you to read other client reviews posted that describe their experience with our firm too. We also invite you to schedule a free initial consultation today to decide whether or not Glen Lerner Injury Attorneys is the law firm for you.” QUALITY REPRESENTATION  ”At Glen Lerner Injury Attorneys we pride ourselves in providing our clients with the highest quality representation possible. We have skilled personal injury and accident attorneys who are ready to assist personal injury accident victims.” ANY BUSINESS THAT CAN ADMIT THEY MADE MISTAKES AND CORRECTS THOSE MISTAKES IS A BUSINESS YOU CAN TRUST AND WORTH DOING BUSINESS WITH.  As stated above, this national law firm for injured people is committed to providing the best possible representation to their clients and has made every possible effort to ensure that all customers have a positive experience while working with their business.

The law firm suggests that anyone who is in need of legal representation make sure that they go with a firm that is respectable, has experienced attorneys on staff, and who is known for aggressively representing those in need. This national law firm for injured people knows that not every law firm will provide the same level of representation at all times, but a person should feel comfortable enough and fully understand what they are getting into before they sign any contracts.

Signature Tax Service provides resolutions for clients with tax debt situations. They have an in-house attorney with 42 years of experience, as well as a team that is focused on integrity and customer service. Their company does not accept a client unless a resolution can be reached. In order to acquire leads for services, their company uses Google Ad words campaigns where Search Engine Optimization and Search Engine Marketing target people who are looking for tax relief or tax help. They also run radio ads and are in the process of developing a television commercial. Their company has a standard process for turning leads into clients. First, when a call is received, the prospect is briefly interviewed or qualified for assistance. Then, if the individual is qualified or can be assisted, they are forwarded to a tax consultant. Lastly, if the caller does not qualify for assistance from Signature Tax, they are given a referral.  ”When asked to describe the typical experience a client might expect when working with Signature Tax, their marketing director Gina Maura explained, “After the initial qualification interview, a client’s file is then handled by a tax consultant. After consultation with the IRS and the client, the file moves to the tax attorney and becomes a case. Throughout the process, clients are provided various means of communication such as email, text messaging, and phone access to a live representative 24 hours a day.” Signature tTax offers a website where clients can submit a form, send an email, or locate a contact number if they have a complaint. Their top management is hands on and oversees the culture of the organization through communication, critique, and motivation. Their company is also working to improve some of their current internal processes. Signature Tax prides itself on maintaining communication with their clients. As a result, their avenues of communication, i.e. phone access, messaging etc. are constantly evolving. They are also working on their tracking of advertising campaigns. During the onsite interview, Mrs. Maura was asked to explain what types of changes she has personally seen the company make in an effort to honor their commitment to “do whatever it takes” to make things right with the consumer: “Signature Tax prides itself on communication with the client. Top management is engaged with clients and staff in order to maintain a comfortable working relationship between Signature Tax and their clients. Signature Tax has superior customer service and an exceptionally experienced staff. In an effort to meet client needs, Signature Tax conducts client service surveys on the phone.” Their upper management team makes it clear to their staff that clients are the priority and they come first.

KEVIN SOBEL & ASSISTANT SAMANTHA PENTEGRAST ARE UNCARING UNPROFESSIONAL P*****. Duluth Georgia The words that best describe the Kanner & Pintaluga Accident Attorneys are INSOLENT and UNPROFESSIONAL. They will RIP YOU OFF they are LIARS do not use their representation I’m WARNING you THEY WILL LEAVE YOU WITH NOTHING and will leave you will bills to pay. I have been very disgusted with their customer service and representation that at one point I wanted to change attorneys I regret the decision to continue using their services the reason why I chose to stay with them is because they promised me results and they FAILED to do that. It has been over a year and my case is still on going, the way I came across Kanner & Pintaluga was through 411-Pain law referral service with the very catchy ads “big mistake”.  Problem 1) the amount of time it took them to get my medical bills together even after I faxed them to them and the extra outrageous fees they are charging me to retrieved other medical bills 2) when I called to check on the status of my case my case representative was very disrespectful and very reluctant to give me any information, they would only tell me that they are still negotiation and call back in three or four weeks this went on for about 11 months. I would have to basically beg them for information when I asked them how much my bills were in total I was only told that it was an amount that was outrageous when in fact I knew it was not as much as they said it was the amount actually included additional FEES THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO HIDE very unprofessional. I would ask my attorneys for a list of my medical bills and total they were not willing the only time I received answers was after giving them a hard time. Now that I received a final amount for my settlement that amount does not even cover all my bills nor does it leave me with any pain and suffering compensation they purposely left out a bill that they didn’t want to pay because they couldn’t negotiate enough money to pay my bills the only thing they are concerned with are their lawyer fees and additional lawyer cost. 3) The only time I was able to speak with my attorney was after threating to drop them from my case or after giving them a hard time after not wanting to give me any information on my case I would have to DEMAND information over and over again. 4) Their Georgia office is a front it’s basically office space that they are renting out to say that they are located in Georgia.  I requested to set an appointment in the Georgia office to speak with someone face to face (this was before I found out that the office was really nonexistent) I was told that they will call me back with an appointment time.  They never gave me an appointment time I would call and call for an appointment and after calling back after the forth or fifth time they would hang up in my face, purposely not answer my calls, or send me to the voice mail very unprofessional. I decided to go up to the Georgia office one day to discover that it was just a front. 5) THEY CASHED MY SETTLEMENT CHECK WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDE, Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT USE KANNER & PINTALUGA FOR ANY SERVICE.

Delray Beach Florida  I went through this law firm after my serious car accident because of a damn 800-411-pain commercial on the radio.  That was one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made.  Last year I was involved in a serious accident where I became permenantly disabled.  I cannot work and being a single mother of three children money is very tight.  I was excited when last year December I was told that my case settled and I would be receiving my settlement by February or March.  I gave it until April before I started calling to find out where my case was.  The woman who was handling my case told me that she was working on it and when she settles she will give me a call back.  I informed her that I would give it another month before calling her back.  She immediately caught an attitude and told me that she will call me and there was no need to continue to follow back up. May came and I called back as I promised I would.  She avoided my phone calls until I threatened to take my case to another law firm.  When I did speak with her she was very nasty and told me that these things takes time but she's working hard on it.  I told her that due to unforseen circumstances and my upcoming 7th surgery since the accident that I didn't care about the accident and I would need the funds to be released ASAP.  She assured me that she would do so by the end of May. Two weeks later I call back and get the run around.  Finally I got fed up and demanded to speak with the lawyer.  I got all kinds of excuses of why I couldn't be transfered to him.  He was busy, he was in court, he was on a phone call, etc.  All of that is fine but I just wanted to leave a voicemail.  Finally after some more threatening to leave to go to another law firm I get through to someone who claims to be my attorney.  Within a week I find out that the woman 'quit' and my file was transferred to someone new.  5 months later and I'm still battling to get my settlement.  I'm totally getting ready to lose everything and have been without water for over a month, and pretty soon I will be evicted and will lose my car.  I have $100 to my name and that's to last for 3 more weeks.  We don't have much food in our fridge and I have a disabled child.  Choosing this law firm for it's catchy jingle instead of doing my research is the biggest mistake that I could've possibly made.  Please understand that I wouldn't be sitting here taking the time out to let people know if it wasn't fact.  Research your law office before you go along and sign anything.  They are getting over 33% and haven't worked much to earn it.  In fact I have done more to get my bills reduced and settled than they have.  And of course they aren't willing to reduce the amount of their fee!

Lerner and Rowe recognized by Ripoff Report Verified™ as a safe business service "," Roy Lustig is a attorney found guilty by the court of appeals in Dade County of fraud on the court and repeatedly lying under oath.  The court stated that ""Lustig's correspondence immediately before and after the June 19th closing date refutes his sworn testimony. The trial court concluded that both XXXX and Lustig lied under oath at their respective depositions on the subject of who XXx represented in the sale of the liquor store. The court also found hm guilty of making false statements  The court stated:  ""The record reveals that the corporation's President xxxxx and its director Roy Lustig engaged in a pattern of purposeful evasion and obfuscation of facts  We conclude that the trial judge's thoughtful and complete analysis of the facts presented in support of defendants' motion to dismiss for fraud upon the court is amply supported by the record and does not constitute an abuse of discretion. The conclusion is inescapable that both XXXX and Lustig, agents of the corporate plaintiff, repeatedly lied under oath  concerning issues material to the prosecution of plaintiff's claim and defendants' affirmative defenses, in an effort to conceal the truth and have consequently forfeited plaintiff's right to proceed with this action. The appellate court affrimed the trial court's order dismissing this action with prejudice upon a showing that all defendants have demonstrated clearly and convincingly that the deposition testimony of Messrs. XXXX and Lustig ""set in motion [an] unconscionable scheme calculated to interfere with the judicial system's ability impartially to adjudicate"" this law suit. Cox v.

Her words were that if i chose to go to trial that the state would give me some crazy panel of people and then i'd loose and then i wouldn't see my family until they got out of college ( my children) and of course not being  privvy to florida's law system i took the time coercively, and the whole time i looked up my case and lo and behold it was a general intent if there was no violence, then the second clue is the statute that the state wanted to charge me with did not apply yet Ms. Hilliard kept her mouth shut, within less than 60 days, and no defense in sight  .Again this is this accredited lawyer with all her accomplishments (success by stepping over people) who allowed the judge to call me all sorts of names and things that should be done to me. Now after myself and sending her rebuttal to the florida BAR they just stated they saw no wrongs even after I still sent this same rebuttal to other attornies who said she most likely chose to let this happen. I other words I got stiffed.

I then proceded to file for joint physical custody at the Van Buren County Friend of the court.  Big Mistake...

Needless to Say things did not go well.  Smith said all I did by returning to Michigan was ""return things back to the Status Quo""  Also since my ex was in treatment for her DUI's that it would not be in my daughters best intrest to change the custody agreement. Hey Scott!!!   Didnt she ""change the Status Quo"" when she got 2 DUI's in 13 Months??  Or didnt she change the Status quo when she moved 4 times in 2 years because she wont pay her bills??  Didnt she ""Change the Status Quo"" when my ex sat on the witness stand and called teachers that testified Liers?? Scott Smith you discust me.  You and Judge Hamre are the reason part of the reason that this country is going to shit...You reward Bad Behavior!!  You consort with Attorneys like Kelly Page and the corrution runs rampant. I have spoken with many attorneys and showed them the facts of the case and how it was decided and they are stunned.  This would never happen in my court is what i keep hearing.  Some even say that I wouldnt even need an attorney to get custody changed in other courts for something like this.

In the meantime I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown.  In speaking with my accountant, I realized they were not acting in my best interest and that I had lost all confidence in them.   I finally called the IRS agent directly and learned that the Tax Resolution Services Agent had been lying to me about the status of the case.  I also learned that despite their representations they never contacted the State Franchise Board re state collection actions. Due to their material misrepresetations and deceptive acts and practices, I terminated them in writing, demanded that they transfer my file to my accountant, and demanded a refund.  Although I have now sent multiple letters, they have failed and have refused to comply, notwithstanding their statutory obligation to provide me with my records and files and to return all unearned fees.

Dr. John Talmadge and Mr. Don Nicolini convinced me to put my daughter Piper first and taught me how to do it. Mr. Kelly explained the “addiction defense” in terms of George Bush. He spoke about recovery and redemption and how we would make a clear, convincing case for Judge Mary Brown (Dallas County Family Court 303rd). We agreed on two goals. 1)      Get out of supervised visitation 2)      Remove the protective order against me declaring I committed domestic violence. I requested a Representation Agreement and Mr. Kelly agreed to provide one. Today is Friday 6/13/2014 and I still do not have a Representation Agreement despite multiple requests. A hearing was scheduled for 12/2/2013. My witnesses, including Dr. John Talmadge and Mr. Don Nicolini, were at the Dallas County Family Court 303rd, sitting waiting in the hall for four hours. The hearing that was scheduled never happened. I expressed my disappointment with Mr. Kelly again when I met with him in person on 12/4/2013. I asked “Have you done your best?” Mr. Kelly said “No” and “I commit to take control”. On 12/19/2013 I scheduled an appointment with Mr. Kelly for 12/20/2013. On 12/20/2013 Mr. Kelly stood me up for our appointment. He was a no-call, no-show. Later on the day of 12/19/2013 Mr. Kelly rescheduled an appointment for 12/24/2013. Again, on 12/24/2013 Mr. Kelly stood me up for our appointment. Again, he was a no-call, no-show. On 12/24/2013 I mailed Mr. Kelly a Demand for Refund. Again, on 5/30/2014 I requested a copy of my Representation Agreement by phone and email. A representation Agreement has never been provided. Finally, Mr. Kelly scheduled a hearing with the Dallas County Family Court 303rd for Tuesday 6/17/2014. I asked Mr. Kelly “Did you communicate with the witnesses regarding their ability? Especially Dr. John Talmadge?” Mr. Kelly replied “No, I and I will subpoena him if I need to.” I replied “That does not sound professional.” I believe, in my heart-of- hearts, that I met my obligation as a Client and a Father. Mr. Jerry Kelly is clearly neglecting my case and that directly influences my relationship with Piper in a negative way.

And you know the saying: Justice delayed is justice denied. These continuous delaying tactics have a major impact on the victims’ lives and mental well-being. Consider the case of the State of Nevada v. Robert Jackson, Case No. C274436. The state is bringing a case against Jackson, who has been accused of shooting four people on the Strip on Aug. 19, 2007. It was an apparent gang fight, except only bystanders were hit with bullets. That was 2007. It’s now 2013. Jackson avoided capture for four years, but even factoring that in, he still hasn’t come to trial. It’s been two years. And Tom Pitaro has engineered almost every delay, using every legal stalling tactic -- in short, every trick in the book -- to keep his client out of the courtroom to face the charges. You name it -- calendar oversights, Jackson present in court without Pitaro, his lawyer, bail battles ... This trial has been continued six times from July 2011 to now. Five of these continuances have been at the hands of Pitaro. And now the new trial date has been set for June 16, 2014. This crime occurred in 2007 and the defendant has yet to be tried.Yeah, thanks for all that, Tom Pitaro. How can guy like Jackson – who has a supposed start-up photo/video business and can’t meet with clients because of his house-arrest restrictions, who has to take care of his elderly incontinent grandparents, and who has fathered another child since returning to Las Vegas – how on earth can he afford representation from the likes of Tom Pitaro, who is known to command substantial legal fees? After all, he was one of the attorneys who was on O.J. Simpson’s defense team. That’s a question the prosecutors should ask. Is Tom Pitaro still smart enough to pull the wool over Clark County D.A.

Seriously?Hitting a woman is never OK, no matter what the situation or what the context of the disagreement -- especially when it involves a Justice of the Peace, like Tony ‘tangelo was. At least he’s no longer that – a Justice of the Peace. He lost a bid for a third term after the conviction. He’s also remarried – to Henderson dentist Tina Brandon – and is trying to put this whole domestic violence thing behind him. Let’s hope the counseling took hold, for his new wife’s sake.

Orlando, Florida United States of America ",mensdivorcelaw.com,407-644-1896,"Jeffrey Feulner Men's Divorce Law Firm the incompetent, dishonest and money hungry lawyer in this country. Jeffrey Feulner cares about one thing and one thing only, your money. He couldn't care less whether he wins your case or not.  Orlando, Florida"," Two days ago the comptroller at my wife’s work received a court order for wage garnishment from a default judgment to a lawsuit from Forster, Garbus & Garbus.  There are multiple problems with this.  First we were unaware that we were even being sued.  We have never been served with any summons or complaint.  Second, not only do we have no clue who these people (FG&G) are, we don’t even know the company they are supposedly representing!  My wife immediately contacted FG&G to find out who they were and when we were allegedly served with a court summons.  They could not provide an exact date and even acknowledged they received no response from us.  After pushing for written verification of acknowledgement of debt and a copy of a signed, delivered summons they then stated they served it towards the end of last year but again, had no proof.  Upon further requests, they stated they sent it via first class mail, TO AN ADDRESS WE HAVE NOT LIVED AT SINCE 2008!  When my wife informed them that we never received any notice they told us to “take it up with the people who live there now because they never sent it back to sender.”  I’m sorry, what?  So you’re essentially saying you can sue anyone you want AND WIN by sending to a false address and claiming you never received a response, thus assuming the defendant was served?  So then came the second part of the issue, who the hell were they even representing?  The company they stated was a company we never heard of.  Again, after requesting more information we came to find out that this was for a credit card we defaulted on in 2003.  Not saying it’s right that we defaulted, but this was an 11 year old debt that had long since been written off as a bad debt and had since even fallen off our credit report it was that old!  So the company they “represented” was the company who purchased this zombie debt.  And to make matters worse, the default was $423.  This judgment was for $1278.48.  After all the court fees, sheriff fees and attorney fees, it was for $1663.92!  How is this even possible?  We were not even afforded the opportunity to defend ourselves versus these people.  And now that a judgment has been made, we have zero recourse.  Not because we failed to appear, but because they knowingly requested a default judgment on a non-served summons! After doing some research online I found all these complaints about FG&G and their shady collection practices.  So at this point, we’re out $1600+ but you damn well better bet everyone who I can tell will know of these crooks!

South Lake Tahoe, California United States of America ",www.jordanmorgenstern.com,5305429194,"Jordan Morgenstern  FAILURE TO DO SH*T SYNDROME South Lake Tahoe, California"," Walmart Auto Services.  Oil technician stripped oil plug causing oil leak.  Returned to store to address the damage.  Manager asked me to follow him, and he took me into service area under my car into oil changing bay.  He didnt put on Safety goggles and did not put Them on himself. He Refused to take responsibility for the damage to my car. I asked to speak to his Supervisor and he went up the steps and I followed him. I was focused on the steps and didn't realize that he had not taken enough of the steel grates off the bay and I slammed the top of my head into the grate and it jammed my head onto my neck.  He turned around and screamed at me ""I removed three grates for you!!"" and stormed off. I already had a couple damaged discs in my neck which I had an Mri 1 year before accident for proof of pre existing damage.  I got a headache ,neck pain, and stiffness right away. The main store Manager came and said he was not allowed to take me into the service area at all and safety goggles are required for any employee to go into the bay.  He violated multiple store policies.  Everything was recorded on Security cameras which have been confirmed as existing by Claims Management employees and store management as being viewed. I didn't realize at the time how serious the neck inury was because I was so upset.  I went home and took pain meds,muscle relaxers,and an icepack.  I could not sleep for the pain and immediately went to the Dr. when they opened up the next morning to seek help.  I was repeatedly called by Claims Management about the car. No concern for my injury,they wanted me to take my car to get proof of the damages right away.  I was in agony.  I took the car to a mechanic who told me that the oil plug was stripped.  I didn't know what the damages were and was relieved to find out that their wasn't serious damage to the car.  I paid for the plug to be replaced.  Never a drop of oil afterwards. They never claimed responsibility and sent a letter that they weren't responsible even though the oil change was two weeks prior to the oil leak. They called and said that they would settle with me after treatment because the injury never would have happened if the manager had not taken me into the bay and service area.  I had an up coming major surgery that was going to be scheduled any time.  I had crippling pain and needed the surgery it had to be the first priority as I was dealing with this before the Walmart injury.  My insurance said that they would not pay for 3rd party responsibility so I was left with no way to seek treatment.  After recovering from the major surgery I sought an Attorney because I could not handle the stress of repeated calls and intense pain. I thought it best for there bea go between to deal with this insurance co. I started seeing a chiropractor who was willing to be paid after the settlement agreed upon by Claims Management.  3 months before the statute of limitations runs out Claims Management said now they won't settle and my Attorney drops me after after a year plus of representation saying ""thank you for letting me review your case,but will won't be accepting your case"". Oil field injuries are far more profitable. I have struggled with daily serious pain since September 2012 and was finally able to get an Mri with serious damages to the left side of my discs and bone spurs forming in every disc trying to repair and fortify themselves.  I never had any damage on the left side in the previous Mri.  Concrete proof of significance of Injury. Now they say I could gotten hurt any time in the last two years, I didn't seek treatment right away which is not true.  I was an adult and didn't have to follow the manager and if he asked me to do something illegal would I have done that too?  They offered to settle I  what would amount to a couple of car payments for a permanent injury that will require  surgery and untold more treatment.  I have chiropractor bills and they said they are not responsible for them although they have repeatedly that the manager broke store policy and that the injury occurred due to this.  I will be in pain for the rest of my life with medications to treat the nerve pain from multiple additions areas of damage that would not be trying to endure from the serious negligence and endangerment of the Manager. It is beyond my understanding that a company could have such a lack of conscience,integrity,common decency,and responsibility for a serious lifelong injury.  How do you seek treatment with no insurance and no help or concern from a company that caused the injury and then take advantage of the fact that you can't get desperately needed treatment.  Its just inhumane  and disgusting.  I have a couple weeks left before the Statute of limitations runs out and they said they are closing the case.  Please help me get this out to the public to somehow get pressure on this company to give fair and just settlement for my injuries and pain and suffering from this gross negligence.  I need my medical bills paid and have no way to do this. Someone stand up for a nobody who is being thrown under a bus for them to save money.   responsibility     ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

Here’s my sad story. I am a widow whose husband died in the fire that destroyed our home in the fire that followed hurricane Sandy in Staten Island, New York. The insurance company refused to pay  our claim in full so I sued for bad faith. In the middle of the trial my contingency fee attorney suffered a stroke and couldn’t continue so there was a mistrial I needed another atorney. My formeer attornmey referred me to Weg & Myers as  experts in bad faith insurance litigation.  I visited Dennis D’Antonio in the Weg & Myers’ office in Downtown Manhattan. Dennis quoted his fee at $600 an hour which was more than I could afford and told him that it was out of the question. But he told me that I needed an attorney like him who could charm the jury into giving me a large award including punitive damages of at least two million dollars. He proceeded to recite his opening and closing arguments to the jury in which he said that insurance companies  are quick to collect premiums and act in bad faith in not paying claims. He charmed me into agreeing to retain him and paying a $30,000 retainer in advance which I had to drain my savings accounts and max out my credit cards to pay. Dennis had my prior attorney send him all the files including depositions and ordered the three days of trial transcripts which he reviewed. He then had me visit his office to review the case. He had his partner and an associate attend the meeting which I objected to as redundant and unnecessary but Dennis insisted they had to be familiar with the case as they would be working on it. I was billed $300 an hour for the associate plus $600 an hour each for Dennis and his partner for a total of $7,500 for the five hours of meetings. I was billed thirty hours for his associate to review the files including reading the depositions and trial transcripts for another $9,000. Then Dennis had to review the file, read the depositions and trial transcripts himself – he billed for reading them twice explaining that this was necessary so that he would not miss anything for a total of another twenty-five hours at $600 an hour adding $15,000 to the bill. Then they billed me $2,400 for the trial transcript sending me a bill at the end of the first month for $33,400 insisting that I pay $3,400 and send another $10,000 against future work. I called Dennis repeatedly to discuss the bill and he did not return my calls. Eventually the office manager called me to say that if I did not pay the money, Weg & Myers would not do any additional work on the case and would make a motion to be relieved of representing me telling me to get another lawyer. Ultimately, I found another contingency fee attorney to represent me but he can not get the files from Weg & Meyers as they refuse to release them unless they are paid $3, 400 which I do not have as a widow with two small children to support with no job.  I feel that Dennis Antonio and Weg & Myers really ripped me off by running up an atstronomical unnecessary bill. There was no need for three lawyers to attend the meetings with me.  There was no need for both the associate and Dennis to read the depositions and trial transcripts and review the files. Based on this I believe that I have been overbilled to the tune of at least $22.800. Given that they intended to resign the case after using up the $30,000 retainer and are none of the effort they put in is of any value to me I feel that that I have been ripped off for the entire $30,000. Dennis D’Antonio is an evil crook who takes advantage of widows who have no money. He is evil. Beware of him – he will cheat you. He will run up huge bills before making any actual progress on your case. He bill you for doing work twice. Beware of this crooked shyster.   ",Attorneys & Legal Services,0

Well after speaking with (to be honest, I don't know who) they told me and my husband we could qualify for Chapter 7.  I was very uncomfortable with that but the attorney (I have to be honest, I thought he was an attorney) advised me this was our best option.  After appearing at the 341 Hearing and waiting to meet our Doan Lawyer, we soon found out, they sent a substitute attorney to handle the hearing in a wrinkled suit not knowing ANYTHING about our case.  We waited and was seen by a lady from the Trustee's office who grilled us on our finances while the attorney had nothing to say.  Needless to say, our creditors meeting was continued because papers were failed to be filed in a timely manner.  Second Creditors Hearing...another attorney NOT FROM DOAN showed up..this one also not knowing anything about our case.  I don't want to go into details but our creditors hearing was AGAIN continued for a bumble by Doan Law Firm.  Third Creditors Meeting, it was decided...guess what...You don't qualify for Chapter 7, now you are Chapter 13 and you need to appear again for confirmation of your chapter 13.  You guessed it...NO ATTORNEY FROM DOAN, someone else appeared for us.  Our chapter 13 finally gets confirmed.  I haven't even touched on the emails from Doan that were abusive and threatening to drop us.  We paid $4000 for these above services.  We have been in our Chapter 13 for a year now and everything was going okay until we had an offer to refinance our rental property.  It required a check the box form, No Hearing or appearance by an attorney and I just got a bill for $750.  Yep...that is no typo.  I filled out the form myself, I attached all the exhibits and exchanged a few emails with a paralegal and they now want another $750.  I am sick to my stomach.  I can't believe I fell for this and didn't listen to my inner voice.  PLEASE LISTEN TO ME...I am now considering going In Pro Per and representing myself or putting out more money for another attorney.  I have sent an email requesting a lower fee and I hope someone from this firm contacts me to right this wrong.  Stay posted....

I showed up for my first court date and she literally bad mouthed me in front of the judge.  Not only did she not help me, she actually hurt me.  I had given her every last dollar I had at the time but she was just such a bad attorney that I decided I was better off representing myself.

Any way I was looking on the internet for Businee Finance because I wanted to get my business open. So the gentlemen that I spoke to said the the SBFC group did work like this and they were very fast. He said that he works with them all of the time in fact he new how mcuh their fees were $750.00.          I later spoke with the firm and charged the $750.00 dolars to my credit card. At that time I recieved a email stating what there company would do. They convinced me that they could get my report cleaned up within thirty days because since I paid most of eveything off wouldn't take long at all. They told me that I would be getting credit report from Trans Union and Expierien . Well I never received that first report and they also said that I would need to fax a copy of my credit report to them. That made me wonder because none of the other firms had me send anything in they took care of all that stuff.           I know its been about two weeks I recieved a email from them saying that my file was now inactive and more less just trashed it. I have sent several emaila and numerous telephone calls. They won't email me or call me I have demanded a full refund. The next thing was I filed this with you folks and the BBB.
