										David Morgan is very helpful when setting you up for the initial payment and getting the ""contract"" taken care of to start the appointments.  After that, as stated in other Rip-Off Reports, he blames you for being negative when you ask why people are not home or wondering why you are at their doorstep.
In regards to how the appointments are set, I have a few theories that are concurrent with other Rip-Off Reports:
1) People are ""fast-talked"" and just say OK to get them off the phone.
2) Old folks are confused when the caller says ""Someone will drop by to have you sign something.""
3) They simply call from any old list bought from a poor quality list broker.
I apologized to one prospect and asked her what exactly the person said to her on the phone.  She said they called andstated that they worked for a number of different investment companies and that someone would be by to have her sign a paper, to which she did not agree.  Nevetheless, I received an appointment in my e-mail box:
""Your appointment has been scheduled for 5:30PM. We identified the asset as an IRA. He would like to see what new options are available toward his investment that could be beneficial to him.""
She mentioned that all assets were with another firm and they needed no review whatsoever. I have over 15 similar comment logs and all appointment ""confirmations"" saved for evidence and record-keeping, if anyone wants specific and consistent results of my wasted time and gas. So far, there has been 1 appointment that I accepted as ""good"" because the guy (very confused) allowed me to come in and go over his investments just to be nice I believe.
As with other reports, they never offer a full refund, only more bad appointments because that is what the ""contract"" says.  How long can that go on? I cannot even get a phone call back from Janet (a real specimen), Zack, or David Morgan.  I have also literally been hung up on by David Morgan, when they promise the best service possible on their web page.
If there is a group of agents that would like to go to their Cookeville office to take a ""tour"" of their office, I would be glad to discuss that.
There are quite a few reports surfacing lately and, against what David Morgan will say, they have not tried to be helpful or give me the time of day for a real refund.

 Mike Mullen -  Allstate Insurance Agent ,"  Mike Mullen -  Allstate Insurance Agent  Lakeside Office Park Suite 305 
Southhampton, Pennsylvania U.S.A. ",, 772-546-2299,Mike Mullen - Allstate Insurance Agent You might be in good hands with Allstate but not Mike Mullen! Southhampton Pennsylvania,"
										August 27, 2008 I contacted an insurance agent by the name of Mike Mullen in regards to having a few vehicles insured. I started off by having just one vehicle insured to see how he operated, well everything seemed to be going ok so I had Mike insure me with business, workers comp, and cargo insurance as well. I initially recieved a quote for $2800.00 dollars. That was fine. 
September I bought 4 for more vehicles for my business and decieded to have these insured also but with less limits than the bigger truck I own because I do different work these vehicles that dont require as much insurance. Mike's office insured me without a problem except they forgot to mention that I would have to drop an additional 20% down payment on the total premium combined for all these vehiclesthe following. Nor did he mention that all my vehicles would carry the same coverage. 
Now I have dealt with other insurance companies in the past where you could add the vehicles with the only result being that you pay whatever difference in your monthly payments. Long and behold this was not the intentions of Mike Mullen! Back to the beginning, The $2800.00 was to be paid on September 28th, 2008 in which it was. The following week Mike decieded to automatically withdrawl $2000.00 from my checking account without my consent nor ever recieving a bill for the new vehicles I added, when I caught it I called Mike and he said that it was a done deal, I couldn't get my money back. I did though only by calling Allstate cooprate in regards to his behavior.
October 28th I get a bill from Mike Mullen for the amount of $6800.00 for the vehicles I added. I was outraged!! After recieving the bill I contacted Mike and that's when he decieded to inform me of his method of doing business, which was new to me after dealing with Progressive which I regret leaving!
Now for all this insurance you would think I would have all the coverage in the world. Wrong!!!!!!!
October 24th 2008 Mike ammended my policy by adding Non Owned Autio coverage to my policy without my knowledge which was another charge of $128.00 per vehicle. During the week of October 26th 2008, I placed one of my vehicles in the shop for repairs. Just my luck the shop went up in flames but to add insult to injury I find out that the shop never had a lick of insurance and Allstate denied my claim of loss. My agent once again failed to explain that Non owned auto coverage which only extends full coverage to vehicles I rent or borrow but not my own vehicles.!!! Crazy right...
Saga continues.... Now we are up to Dec. 1st 2008, I called Mike Mullen to report a home damage claim using my supposed business insurance which covers any home I'm doing work in. I explained to Mike my situaton, Mike assured me that I would be covered 100% before getting off the phone with him. 1 hour later Mike calls me back saying that the policy wasn't issued because of a bounced check. Well this check was issued initially 8/27/08 when I signed on. Ironically the check wasn't cashed until 12/1/08 so I visited the bank to inquire about this check. The bank informed me that November 29th 2008, was the first time this check was ever presented to them and it cleared Dec. 1st 2008. The bank also gave me a copy of the front and back of the check, the also illustrated to me that the back of the cancelled check shows all activity on a check being presented for payment.The check never bounced!!!! 
This has been one nightmare after the next dealing with this shady individual so stay away from this insurance gangster. I'm still fighting this guy but had to let you guys know how he plays................

I was going to do a credit card but they said they were not doing credit card anymore ( I wonder why) and ask for a check info at the last minute. If you do decide to do business with them I suggest insisting on credit card, better chance of getting money back from the credit card company.
Like the other reports, leads are fraudulent if you get any. I was suppose to have it sent to my email nothing; can't log into their system.

										My experience with the Huggins Financial Group was disappointing to say the least.
They hook you by advertising ""NO PROSPECTING"".  Of course, they charge you $24 per lead.  Jeff Huggins appears to be a very nice person who has been very successful in the insurance business.  His sales pitch was very appealing.  However, after they make you pay $500 to simply join the company as a 1099 agent. Then they turn you over to a man named Frank Vandersande, a successful salesman turned General Agent.  He conducts all the training.  You receive training to sell one product, a Universal Life Product specifically geared to the mortgage protection market.  I found Frank to be extremely arrogant and incredibly pushy and rude.  He didn't like answering questions, preferring to tell me to  say exactly what he told me to say.  He liked to say, ""You don't need to think.  We've done all the thinking for you.  All you need to do is EXACTLY what I tell you to do.""
The training seemed rushed and incomplete.  In talking with others in the training class, along with a few agents who had been there for a short time, it seemed to me that very few really understood the policy we were selling.  I became afraid to ask Frank any questions because of his rude and unprofessional manner.
After a couple of weeks of Frank's rudeness, I quit.  As it turns out, I was typical.  Most people who pay their $500 and go through the training, then start paying $24 per lead and endure Frank's rude manner soon quit.  I just caution anyone considering this opportunity to BEWARE!

Also, they put me on an automatic re-bill, when  I was told that I would reach the end of my first $100 and then have to direct them to re-bill.  What a waste of $300!  I'll never use them again.

										This report is being written for the thousand or maybe hundreds of thousands of customers who were stooped into buying and are now insured through ADRIANAS Insurance. Beware of high prices. Make sure you understand what you are buying before you sign the insurance papers.
  Adrianas Insurance preys on the innocent people who do not have a license to drive but need to have insurance on their vehicle because they need it to go to work to support their families. Yes I am talking about latinos immigrants. That is her bread and butter. Especiall now that the economy is so bad. She charges them high fees and says they are getting the best coverage, when in reality she gets them on a liability insurance only.
Currently she has pending lawsuits because her ""INSURANCE AGENTS"" do not sign the insurance applications like they should and the reason they are not signing them is very simple, she has unlicensed, undocumented workers and managers working for her not only selling the insurance, but also underwriting the insurance policies. Thats right ILLEGAL ALLIENS. I know this because I was employed by this company at one time. 
This so called Insurance company is not an Insurance company but a broker. She has offices all over the Los Angeles area. Its really a shame what she is doing not only to the customers but to her employees also. Im surprised she has not been caught or fined, but the reason she has not been caught is because once again her employees are scared to speak out and report her to the department of insurance because of their legal status. And of course she takes advantage of that and treats her employees very unfairly.
 Currently she is one of the biggest agencies for insurance in California and is very very well known throughout the latino community. There is alot of advertisements on tv, radio, and hispanic magazines. They have a website, WWW.ADRIANASINSURANCE.COM, and they advertise zero down and low monthly payments for auto, commercial, motorcycle, rv, health and life insurance. Are you kidding me.Not many people know this,but It is illegal to not charge for insurance. So next time you are shopping around for an auto insurance think twice about where you shop, and help me in challenging the department of insurance to place harder guidelines on these companies.

										Having had a business liability policy with Nationwide for the past 4 years I chose to drop them to get a good package rate for workers compensation and general liability with another company. Shorly after this I recieved a bill that stated that I owed them $851.00 as the result of an insuranse audit covering the period from 7/10/2007 to 7/10/2008. 
My insurance rate is based on the payroll and according to my records we owe them around $290.00. I have always paid them based on payroll but for some reason I was told that they charge a minimum amount covering the owner. I told them that this was odd that I had never been charged this before we cancelled with them. I also ask them to reveal in the policy where this is stated and was never given an answer. 
I feel that they invented this policy due to the fact that I cancelled with them and posibly due to they're $346.4 million dollar loss for the third quarter of 2007. I have auto insuranse with them now but will shortly be cancelling this as well. I will make up my losses by getting a cheaper auto policy. I hope to see a $346.4 BILLION loss for Nationwide in 2009.

										Do not do business with Edgewood Insurance. They are a terrible company with no integrity.   You can tell a lot about a company based on the people they employ and also on how they treat their employees. 
Their employees, for the most, are awful. Patty Aguayo is the Administrative Secretary. She talks about employees behind their backs and is rude to their faces. Those she is rude to have never done anything to her, but she singles them out  and treats them with no respect. She has a clique with a few other  ladies  in the office. If you are not in her little clique, you'll get laughed at, made fun of, and talked about. She is a bitch. 
Other ladies in the office are two-faced: they'll act nice when you're around, then talk about you behind your back. Other ladies basically ignore you, except when they are giving you dirty looks for no reason.
One of the worst people they have employed is Tom Donahue. I cannot believe this company lets him work there. He has absolutely no respect for women. He is a womanizer and completely obsessed with sex. He'll sleep with anything; and if you don't sleep with him fast enough, he'll ditch you.  I am shocked that this company would employ someone with no character, no morals, and no ethics.  And he is also known to charge a higher commission that most, so if clients go through another broker they'll likely be able to save some money.
The company has no integrity and no regard for the law. They purposely break the law. If someone gets hurt and has to take time off, while that person is away the company will rename the hurt persons position so the person doesn't have a job to come back to. And then they'll hire someone else to fill that position. Now their job still exists, the same duties are still there, it's just called something else and now someone else is doing it; and Patty and Management are open about it to employees: people who work there know exactly what's going on. It's outrageous, completely unethical behavior. I wouldn't want people like this or a company like this handling any of my accounts.
This is a terrible, unethical company with terrible, rude, unethical employees and should be avoided.

I walked in and was led to a room full of other people and realized that instead of a personal interview I'd have to view a long presentation. 
We were asked to place a copy of our resumes on the front table and I took a seat near the front.  Mr. Grimshaw spoke for roughly 40 minutes and I was actually interested in the opportunity and based off of my background felt I would be an excellent candidate.  He then stated that the next step would be for those not interested to leave, and that he would proceed with personal interviews of those who remained.  
Mr. Grimshaw then walked up to various people and shook there hands (including myself) and said thanks for coming.  I just thought he was being nice, but then realized after the others whose hands he shook were leaving, that he was basically stating he wasn't interested.  I was a little pissed off because what was he basing this on, looks?  
He surely didn't review my resume because it was on the table at the front of the room.  Then I realized every person that was remaining was male, and white.  Though I would have been an excellent fit with the firm, I surely don't want to work for a racist or bigoted company.  It's sad too because when you google any of the business names a bunch of terrible reports pop-up.

Burlington, North Carolina U.S.A. ",, 775-786-3577,"NAA - National Agents Alliance, Breach of contract, excessive bank drafts after termination Burlington North Carolina","
										Your NAA contract or contracting is not worth the paper it is written on, they make up the rules to suit them. I was terminated over the phone, not in writing by normal mail as your contract says. I was terminated for doing exactly what my recruiter talked me into doing with my former employer. They want you to do all kinds of contracting before you leave your employer, but don't contract with some one else when you are with NAA. No where in your contract does it say you can be terminated instantly for any thing. 
When they terminate you they stop all your commission advances and you get paid a little bit every time some one pays their premium. They also continue to debit your account even though you try to discontinue all their little extras, they don't return calls even after several attemps, but they still debit your account. They tell you they refuse to release you from any contracts for 6 months, but you can continue to write business and let ever one in your upline continue to make money off you. 
Just when you think you have your new business all set up and you try to write some businees with one of the companies you find out it has been refused because they have now terminated your contract with that company, you can't transfer it now you have to re apply with another agency. What do you tell your client then? This company and it's people are ruthless and vengefull. Do your self a favor and walk away, they take half your commission and tell you not to believe what you read or hear about the real world.

Wilmington, Delaware U.S.A. ",, 775-786-3577,CitiWide Lending Group Company commits fraud against insurance agents Wilmington Delaware,"
										I received an unsolicited fax on 03/12/09 from Jackie Miller with CitiWide Lending Group. I then called CitiWide and was referred to Hubert David who said they have a referral lead program for insurance agents. Hubert David said the leads are people who need homeowners insurance in order to get their mortgage loan processed, he then faxed me information on the program which required authorization to debit my checking account. 
I researched CitiWide Lending Group and was unable to find any information that they are a licensed Mortgage Lender. According to the Delaware Department of State: Office of the State Bank Commissioner CitiWide Lending Group is not licensed in the state of Delaware.
I believe CitiWide Lending Group is attempting to defraud insurance agents by getting the agents bank account info and then deducting money under false pretense. They DO NOT have a license in the state of Delaware for mortgage loans, the business license that they do have was recently obtained as of 02/25/2009 which shows ownership by another name: New Castle Management & Consulting, LLC.

Orlando, Florida U.S.A. ",, 775-786-3577,Kuhne Insurance Agency Unethical business behaviour - cancelling all insurance policies when only 1 requested Orlando Florida,"
										I would advise not using Kuhne Insurance Agency. Mary Kuhne has been difficult at best in trying to carry on a business relationship in the insurance realm. Always seemed to be doing things in the insurance company's interest rather than her own customers. Her company provided both General Liability and Business Automobile insurance for us at a very substantial rate. We had questioned her on our rate and she always defended it. Recently we decided to ""shop"" our general liability and found a company for considerably less. After making sure we had the new coverage in place, we contacted Mary Kuhne to cancel our old policy. She responded by saying, I've cancelled your general liability policy per your request, but am also canceling your auto insurance policy as well. This we did not request. 
Her actions were similar to a snotty, spoiled brat - leaving us without insurance, even though our policy was paid and there have been no claims against us.
This type of behavior is what makes insurance agents look bad.

Garland, Texas U.S.A. ",, 775-786-3577,"Wes Staub Agency, An Allsate Agency is using the old bait-and-switch tactics to sell insurance Garland Texas","
										I received a flyer in the mail from Wes Staub Allstate Insurance Agency in Garland, Texas. The flyer was touting the fact that they could get my annual homeowner's insurance premium down to $529 per year with the replacement cost of my house at $151k.   The exact words in very large type were Your Annual Premium Rate Estimate - $529.27.  There was a disclaimer in tiny, almost unreadable print at the bottom stating this may not be the actual rate.
As I am currently paying $852 per year, this sounded too good to be true.  I called the agency on 03-13-09 and spoke to a girl named Daisy.  I gave her my information and she said she would get together an exact quote and call me back.  When she called back, she said my annual rate would be $1206 per year with a replacement cost of my house at only $149k.
I asked her what happened to the $529 per year rate it stated on their flyer.  She said that was just an estimate.  So the actual quote was over twice the amount of the estimate quoted on the flyer.  I spoke to owner Wes Staub and told him this was a bait-and-switch tactic and was dishonest.  He defended his advertising practice of luring potential customers into calling him with this deceptive advertising by saying I get some business off these flyers.
I told him this bait-and-switch advertising was dishonest and that they are intentionally misleading people into calling them by advertising a very low rate and then switching them to the real rate for their homeowner's policy.  Wes Staub was adamant about this business practice as being something that was acceptable to do.
I will be filing a compliant for deceptive advertising with the Texas State Board of Insurance and any other agencies I can think of. I would advise anyone not to do business with the Wes Staub Allstate Insurance Agency as Wes obviously feels it is OK to use the old bait-and-switch tactic on unsuspecting homowners.

										If you bought an insurance policy from IFG or are thinking of doing so please read the following:
  I am a disgruntled employee.  I will agree to that.  But what follows is the absolute truth.
  If you bought  an insurance policy from IFG please check your policy.  Your policy will probably show that the agent was Mike Lee or Adam McConnell.  Did you actually buy your policy from them?  Probably not...
  See the way this works is you are contacted by an automated system asking if you are interested in buying insurance.  If you respond you are then contacted by a telemarketer who may or not be a licensed insurance agent.  You are then told you will be contacted by an ""underwriter"" which will probably be Adam or Mike.  They will then submit your policy to the insurance company under their name and collect the commission and pay the actual person who sold your policy to you next to nothing.
  If you have a policy form this company please check the agent's name on the policy.  Is this the actual person you spoke to?  Or does your policy show another name?  Why would this be?
  Because Mike and Adam hire people who are not licensed to sell insurance and pay them next to nothing and when they do sell the policies Mike and Adam submit them in their name to collect the fat commissions and other incentives.
  If you do have a policy and it was not sold to you by Mike or Adam, please contact the actual insurance company and ask why????
  I confronted IFG about this situation and was accused of slander, but the defense against slander is the absolute truth, and this is the absolute truth.

										Man do I have a few bones to pick here. First of all, this company found me on the internet and called me up to staff Wal Mart stores with a United Healthcare booth. All was well until I encountered problems with my booth. I called and called Edgar to have the issues resolved, but to no avail. Then I resorted to using their medicare marketing leads, in which people filled out a form and mailed it back in to be contacted by an agent. After calling a few of these people and being hung up on as soon as I mentioned that I was calling in response to the form that was mailed in, I gave up on the idea. So then I resorted to my own marketing efforts, only to find out that Gordon Marketing lost its license in NY. 
Now I am dealing with all kinds of commissions problems while my bills have to wait to be paid. I have attempted to resolve the situation with Edgar of Gordon Marketing, but so far I have not been paid despite submitting business two months ago. If you want to get contracted to sell medicare plans, I suggest trying another agency out there. You will save yourself a lot of trouble and actually get paid for the business that you submit so that you can pay off your automobile expenses and light bill.

										After over 25 years of service with Ray Hefty, Jim Hefty took over his accounts. Mr Jim Hefty and his staff made repeated errors on my account with multiple polices and then lied about it and were rude. The worst act was when Jim Hefty transferred my original 20 year plus vehicle policy into me ex-wifes account even though she was not on the title. This took my discount. Then when I had a claim on another portion of my policy Jim Hefty called to berrate me and accuse me of deception. When he and his staff broke the law. He spoke in a very unethical manner and according to my new agent Mr Hefty can be turned into the Insurance Board; however, it is a small town and I do not wish any further account harm to come to my relatives who have policies.  Stay away from the agency.

Franklin, Tennessee U.S.A. ",, 775-786-3577,Mutual Of Omaha & Gary Simmerly will cost you MONEY! Franklin Tennessee,"
										The purpose of this letter is to convey a costly financial risk associated with working as a career agent for a Life/Health insurance company.  My experience is based on working for The Mutual of Omaha in Franklin, TN during 2008.   
There are two financial risks associated with this position.  The first is charge-backs from policy's that were sold, but declined.  In this situation the agent is advanced commission, but the application is declined by the company or client. Then the advanced commission is charged back to the agent.
The other financial risk is the cost of leads provided by the insurance company.  At the Mutual of Omaha agents are pressured into buying leads that the manager buys. In my experience these leads were terrible and I would not have bought them if not pressured.  During my three months there my lead cost totaled over $1600.
At the Mutual of Omaha you have to attain a sales objective in 3 months or you are out of a job.  Due to a large number of declines, I did not make the objective and therefore left the company.  Now I am getting letters from a collection agency.  
If I had been told while interviewing that there was a possibility that I could be in debt in three months, I would not have taken this position.  I know the job market is tough, but you need to know about these risks before contracting with an insurance Company like Mutual of Omaha.

										I'm glad the other agents in California and Alabama posted on here. I almost fell victim to these con-artists. I must admit that their offer sounded good, in fact too good to be true and thats why I did some research before giving them my bank account information.
I found out the Delaware address they use is just a cover-up for their main operating location which is in California. According to public records Citiwide IS NOT a licensed mortgage lender in either state.
They run numerious ads on Craigslist employment section looking for people to help them sell their crap. I called and pretended to be interested in working with them and was told directly that they Fax broadcast (which is illegal) and spam email insurance agents.
The companies is full of lies, I was told they've been in business for 34 years which isn't true, they just got their license in Delaware and their website was created in February of 2009.
DO NOT let them fool you and DO NOT give them your bank or credit card info.
Unsolicited faxes are illegal in the United States, you can sue for thousands just for one fax and the great thing is you can file your claim at you're local small claims court and Citiwide would have to travel to your state to defend themselves otherwise its an automatic win for you!

										Debbie Hoskins must be the worst, laziest insurance agent I have ever seen.  I have been by there ten times and she is NEVER THERE.
When I call, she is clueless, has no idea what she is talking about and the one time my husband and I did go in her office when she was miraculously there a year ago - she was watching soap operas!
She hadn't even addressed our concerns and she could not tell us about our policies and was CLUELESS!
TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  She was unpleasant and even rude when we asked her to describe our policies - she acted like we should know already and was frustrated when we asked about what was included.  That was last year.  I haven't been able to find her this year! 
She was so rude.  The last 10 times I have been by, and I live close, she has not been there.  I wonder if she is ever there!  Buyer beware!!!!!!
She is a pretty girl with a rude inside.  I didn't see a degree on her wall either, I wonder if she just shows up sometimes to return messages.  
Dealing with her was a terrible ordeal and we let our policies lapse and got away from her.  Very bad experience.  It was very frustrating and I would not write this if she wasn't the rudest meanest person I have every dealt with.

										I am writing to express my gratitude to all that have written in regarding IPA.  I recently applied for a sales position there having no knowledge of how insurance sales work - shame on me!! The truth is the invitation to interview stated nothing more than ""Account Executive"" so I arrived at the interview thinking it was an admin position.  
Please look closely at the initial comments regarding this company.  I called a VP (to cancel an interview) and confronted him with some of the facts I found most credible.  Primarily, paying nearly $350.00 up front for an insurance licence when the state doesn't require nearly that much. Any applicant for a new job deserves free training and if after that, they decide to move forward, you take the exam, send in your scores and applicaion for licensure.  
The company you work for should have no interest in this, as they are not paying for any of it. There was a lot of Huumming and Hawwing and he (the VP) finally decided that ""You are clearly not the competent person who we interviewed and are not the type we want working for us!""  WOW!! When I was a naive newcomer to sales with no information about who they were or state standards I was a ""Premier"" candidate!! - GO FIGURE!!  PLEASE BE CAREFUL.  
I know a lot of people go with them and make a lot of money. How they make their money is what I wonder about.  As a customer of ABBA I am very concerned and looking at other healthcare insurance options as now I doubt the credibilty of the entire organization.  (Please note that IAC is NOT endorsed by the BBB and that their stock has had a steady decline for that past six monts.)

He or she will talk to you and will try to convince their great business model where you wil try to recruit more people to form a team and be your own boss and they wish to hire you on 1099.
They will start asking your personal financial details to give you financial advice for free as if they are doing some favor on you.
I am not bothered with whatever sh*tty things they are doing within the legal limits, however I am bothered by their unethical practices (lies) and how they hook people to come to their meetings/Job Interview by taking advantage of the need of simple people who are looking for regular legit job, telling them that ""Yes...we have job available for you....same position whatever you are looking for""...so this is same illegal tactics as ""Bait and Switch""..

THE OFFICE MANAGER IS ESPECIALLY RACIST AS SHE DOES NOT LIKE AFRICAN AMERICAN PEOPLE OR CLIENTS THAT ARE  LOWER CLASS. I HAD TO TURN DOWN MANY OF CLIENTS BECAUSE OF HER STANDARDS. I GOT FIRED NOT BECAUSE OF MY JOB PERFORMANCE BUT BECAUSE OF MY OWN RACE.
WHATS SAD TO TOP IT OFF I HAD PLENTY OF PROOF WHEN I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE STATE OF FLORIDA AND IT WAS VERIFIED THAT I HAD A GREAT CASE AGAINST THIS AGENCY FOR RACISM BUT BECAUSE OF FLORIDA LAW THERE HAS TO BE MORE THAN 7 PEOPLE WORKING IN THE OFFICE FOR THE STATE TO DO ANYTHING!
PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS AGENCY! AGAIN THI S AGENCY IS NOT FOR THE PEOPLE!

 First Century Mortgage ,"  First Century Mortgage  2003 Southern Blvd #101 
Rio Rancho, New Mexico U.S.A. ",, 775-786-3577,First Century Mortgage Misrepresented nature of their product / loan applicants in need of insurance to complete their mortgage. Rio Rancho New Mexico,"
										I was contacted by First Century Mortgage via phone saying that they had a client near me that needed Homeowners insurance to complete their loan process on a house they were purchasing.  I agreed to help and then I was transfered to Cody James of First Century Mortgage who explained to me that they were looking for Insurance Agents to partner with that would help their clients who were in the process of purchasing a home and that needed a Homeowners Insurance policy to complete their transaction.
Cody said that these leads would be exclusive to me and that if I did not sell the policy, that they would replace that client with another.  He said that these clients will have been working with First Century Mortgage for over a week and are in the final stages of closing escrow.
All of this sounded very good.
Of the first 30 leads I received I left several messages on voicemail, without a single response.  Several disconnected phone numbers.  Several wrong numbers.  I was able to talk to about 10 people on the phone. EVERY one of them did NOT know who First Centry Mortgage was and they were NOT in a loan process or looking for a loan OR insurance.
Tamera at First Century Mortgage, a manager there, will not comment of what I was told about the quality of these leads. She only refers to the ""contract"" where it says that there are no refunds and that she will give me more leads to replace the others. I don't want more names from the phone book to call.  I want either my money back or the quality of leads, or at least close to it, that I agreed to purchase, receive and help and that I was promised.
Tamera, just yesterday, promised me better leads today and asked me to try these ""better"" leads.  I called two about an hour ago. The first not home.  The second, no idea who First Century Mortgage is and they are not looking for a mortgage or insurance.
First Century Mortgage is promising a quality product and says the right words to make it sound like they are legitimate but, delivers nothing more than names and numbers from phone books.  
A complete waste of time for me and the poor people I actually get a hold of.  Their actions are criminal and they should be prosecuted.

When I contacted him about it, he just brushed my aside and told me that he did not deal with it.  I had to go to his assistant.  I guess he is too busy for helping his clients with issues.  He does not fully disclose to his clients and provides poor service.

=====================NOW TO THE ORIGINAL REPORT THAT WAS FILED  
===================== 
Liberty National Life Insurance St. Louis Branch 638 Unprofessional crude rude tasteless juvenile behavior untrusting unreliable unorganized disrespectful Saint  Charles Missouri Where to start...well as a veteran agent of Liberty National, I will admit that there is definitely money to be made there.  I've been in sales for all of my adult life thus far...I'm 29, single mother here.  Anyways, I can only speak for my experiences as well as what I have witnessed and I will leave you all with this to sum it all up...Letter to Regional Director: (who did absolutely nothing which is surprising for the fact that 3 others sent him emails of similar complaints of disrespect, foul mouth management, ridicule, unfair treatment, racial remarks, and the list goes on and on and on...Dear Mr. Roger Rich,Per our conversation on June 11, 2009, at your request, I am composing this letter to express my concerns regarding the management strategies of Branch 638 and my desire to resign.  Oh, please forgive my poor transition...I'm just getting this all out and not even attempting to be eloquent about it.  It is what it is!There have been several situations that I, as an adult possessing integrity and honesty, can no longer bring myself to work for Monica Burgess and Todd Baxter.  I have never in my life had to deal with such contradictions, hypocrisy, rude, and disrespectful people in my life.  Unfortunately I am not the only person with these concerns.While working the field with my UM, Monica, I witnessed her bash other employees, another UM, as well as the BM.  People's jobs are in jeopardy each day depending upon the mood she is in.  I've witness her acknowledge that she felt certain employee's were ""worthless, lazy, pieces of sh**, fu** them"".  I've heard her tell Agents on the phone that ""excuses are like a**holes...everybody's got one"".  Her personal dislike for particular people are made clear by her demeanor, disposition, as well as her own statements voiced aloud in front of their peers.I ran with her for nearly 1 month, then ran with her and Jennifer Criss who was shortly after pulled from working with me because she had children she had to attend to by 6:30 pm.  Then I worked with Karen Vallor, who's father recently passed away and had to attend to her mother on occasion who is a retiree.  Monica literally said, ""I'm done w/them, they are on their own"".  Soon after, again, I started over again running with solely Monica until somebody ""with a work ethic like myself"" was found.  I'm here to make a living, not friends but I myself understand that people have loved ones, and other responsibilities other than pacifying this person.Needless to say, it's now week 9 for me and I've been running with Jessica Eversmeyer, who is about 5 weeks in this company, for 2 weeks now.  I feel that after getting off that roller coaster, and running solely w/Jessica, we have found a groove and developed a great system.  However, yesterday a situation happened between Monica and Jessica that was totally uncalled for.  I heard the conversation from the next room.  Never in my life have I ever seen and heard a person mistreat others as Monica does and what's even more disturbing is that Todd condones it.  I refuse to work for people who have no respect for their employees.  It was everything Jessica had in her to not run out of that office and never look back.  The sad thing is, Jessica was not the only person that Monica snapped at that very day.Additionally, we have asked for a Sales Genie list and have been told flat out ""NOPE!""...no reason, no explanation at all, just ""NOPE""!  Who does that?  Not Managers!  I've expressed my concern regarding the reasoning behind the cold shoulder and where I stand for I did not know if I even had a job the next day after taking 1 personal day to attend to my son and I was assigned ""homework"" to list my commitment to my Branch...bit ridiculous in my eyes considering just 2 weeks prior to I was told in confidence by Monica that she was taking a branch and she wanted to take me w/her to help her build it and that I was the only one within the branch that she wanted to take...now what changed? I hadn't...except for 1 day out.  I graduated high school in 1998 and I have no desire to return.  I'm an adult, and I carry myself as such.  I'm not doing homework at 9:30 pm on a weekday for a tasteless UM on a power trip that is obviously throwing their weight around.I understand Monica's #3 UA UM and I could honestly careless-it means nothing if at the end of the day the only person left within that branch is the BM.  Dealing w/individuals sales and running an office w/your Branch manager only vs. running a branch w/numerous units as well as dealing w/business owners is a totally different ballgame.  There has to be some level of trust, flexibility,  & consistency amongst the Branch, units, AND these business owners. We have been forced to push our prospective clients into enrollment dates that are not feasible for them.  We have been forced to drop in on prospective clients whom we consistently have kept the lines of communication open to push paperwork out of them.  I do not know about you but I'd trust my agent that has the report to handle their deal not intervene and push and subsequently lose the entire case especially when the agent has given no reason whatsoever that they are not performing.  Bottom line, if I'm doing what I'm told, bringing in paperwork, and have proved myself please allow me to run my deal I see fit since I'm the one w/my hands in it...not somebody who has no idea about the case or the ongoing communications.This past Monday I attended the mandatory recruiting session as I have gone to each & every one since the weekend prior to my start date.  The majority of the time the dialer is not set up, the internet is down, or they are just too busy as UM and BM to get us going on the calls.  We waited patiently Monday for 2 hours before we were given anything to call and recruit on.  I understand things happen but we are micromanaged to the point where it is known and practiced that we come prepared and ready to go ""no exceptions no excuses"" and we abide by this rule.  Our time is just as valuable and should be respected as us agents do theirs.I have always been a hard worker, been at plan, hit my #s, and have been known as a Top Performer.  I would love to recruit people into LibNat but I will not recruit for this branch.  Knowing what I know, and experiencing what I have experienced, I lack the capacity to bring another person into 638.  I am absolutely bewildered and floored that this is acceptable behavior.Since the 1 personal day off I have been snubbed, trashed, and have been informed that Monica has advised my own partner ""do not tell Lisa"" about situations that I have had a part of.  Regardless of how big or small, it's the point:  I do not need it, I do not want it, and I definitely do not deserve it.I'm not walking on pins and needles any longer.  I'm not stressing if a deal I partook in will be given to somebody that's on her good side/buddy list/safe list that day or that week.  It's asinine.  I understand what I'm about to leave behind, a few deals and a few friends but I'm not subjecting myself to this nor will I sell out my 4 year old son for this particular branch who could obviously careless about the 16 hour days I put in as an Agent.The array of individuals that come in and out of this branch should be expected from here on out.  I hope that you understand my level of frustration, for I've got a lot in to this.  I do apologize for inconveniencing you after business hours however I felt it of utmost importance that these issues be looked into.  I would have contacted Tim Knuckles whom I have utmost respect for but after witnessing Mike Rivera get trashed, backstabbed, and disrespected I felt the least Tim could have done was maybe research his accusations and his side of the story.  It is common knowledge within this branch to be vague, to the point, and discuss nothing in detail about your deals-it's a ""needs to know basis"".  I've been warned by other UM and agents to watch who I talk to in the office.  I've been told, as if I'm a child, to not speak to particular people by my UM and BM!!!  Again, not the only one to have experienced these juvenile and bogus restrictionsI'm not looking to seek revenge for it's not in my nature...but my objective for this composition is to hopefully be a voice so that somebody can intervene and salvage some great people that are currently there.Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions or need names and #s from others who said that they are willing to voice their concerns as well.Thanks for your time and consideration,Lisa

123 No Way Dr.
Somewhere, USA 90210
(((ROR redacted)))June 12, 2009To Whom It May Concern:I, Lisa , am composing this letter as my formal resignation.  Under circumstances beyond my control, I no longer have the capacity to work for Liberty National Branch 638.In nearly a decade of sales and sales management, I have never seen the behavior and practices that I have seen within this organization.  I have witnessed lies, manipulations, backstabbing, disrespect, and such juvenile behavior that I find unacceptable to tolerate.The lack of consistency, integrity, and trust has been made crystal clear to me over the last few weeks.  During my short-lived career here I have been told whom to associate with, what to say to others, and what not to say to others including my branch manager, other agents, and UM.I pride myself on being a straight shooter, honest, integral, and hard working.  I refuse to assist in the recruiting of more individuals into this branch for I would not work here myself.  If I can't give it away, how could I sell it?Working here has been like being in high school again.  When expressing my concerns and frustrations to my UM, I was assigned homework-literally.  My opinion is that a UM should converse amongst their staff and trouble shoot the situation in hopes of rectifying them-not ridicule an agent who clearly has worked hard, proven themselves, and stays positive all while being backstabbed and micro managed.I could give example after example of instances where I've been disrespected, uncomfortable, and worn thin but to be perfectly honest, why on earth would I put more time into this Branch?  I won't.  I do not need this, I do not want it, and I most definitely do not deserve it.I do apologize for this inconvenience however as of Wednesday when my partner was spoken to like dirt, I started weighing out the pros and the cons of this position and unfortunately it was 17-1 in favor of the cons.  We ran our tails off Thursday staying strong, staying positive and by day end I finally broke down and informed my partner of my decision which surprising to me-was on her mind as well.I've done nothing but do what I'm asked and work hard for my family but it has gotten to the point where any question that I ask is ridiculed, second guessed, or twisted into something that is totally in left field and off the wall.I need stability not only professionally but mentally from my branch so when I walk into the office and I do not know where I stand due to a UM's mood, it's time to move on.  Zebras do not change their stripes therefore this will always be uncomfortable, inconsistent, and a hypocrisy of what is really trying to be accomplished.I find it sad and unfortunate for the simple fact that one month ago I thought I had finally sunk my teeth into a career with an amazing compensation plan, bonus structure, benefits and great people to work with and forbut the writing on the wall is there and it's time to move on.Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to have this experience for it has been one that I will never forget.With utmost sincerity and regards,LisaNEEDLESS TO SAY...SEVERAL PEOPLE, HARD WORKING, HONEST, INTEGRAL PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED THESE SAME ISSUES, YET NOBODY HAS OFFERED A TRANSFER TO ANOTHER BRANCH.  THEY ALL, INCLUDING MYSELF, HAVE BEEN DISREGARDED AND THROW OUT AS IF WE PUT NOTHING INTO THIS.  KEEP IN MIND...3 PEOPLE IN 2 WEEKS WENT TO THE HIGHER UPS AND IT WENT NOWHERE...THIS HAS GREAT POTENTIAL BUT THERE'S NO WAY I'D RECRUIT ANYBODY TO WORK FOR 638.  THEY ARE MISERABLE MONSTERS W/NO REGARDS FOR PROFESSIONALISM AND DEFINATELY DO NOT KNOW A THING ABOUT B2B.  THEY ARE BETTER OFF REMAINING A UA BRANCH WORKING THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET-IN MY OPINION.

										I along with several others fell for the Hillside Financial scam. I was contacted regarding an on-line loan application I filled out. I sent them the first 4 payments and was told my loan would be in my account the next day. The next day I was contacted and told that the lenders insurance company would not insure the loan unless I made an additional 4 payments. Like an idiot, I wired them another 4 payments. I was told the money would then be in my account the next day. The following day I was contacted by Mark Hamilton and he told me that the department who deposits the money was backed up and that I would have it by the next day. Well the next day was a Saturday, and of course the money was not deposited. It was not until Monday that he contacted me to tell me the loan company had backed out. He said that they had found another lender who would take my loan if I would send them another 8 payments. Of course, by then I was beginning to wonder about this company. I argued with them on the phone and demanded my 8 payments back. I was informed that the lender only did refunds on July 13. I have asked Mark Hamilton several times to fax me something in writing that I would receive my money back no later than July 13 and have not received any fax yet. I am not sure what else to do about this. If anyone has any advice please feel free to contact me.

Woodland Hills, CaliforniaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

 Denise Wardwell ,"  Denise Wardwell  6111 Fm 1960 Road West Suite 210 
Houston, Texas U.S.A. ",, 781-9449930,"Denise Wardwell Advised me I could not file claim, would not stop calling mortgage co to get payment AFTER I cancelled with her repeatedly, showed up at my brother's job, threatened him. Houston Texas","
										I signed on with Farmers homeowners' ins several years ago.  My first agent was several months late in submitting my payments for my coverage and eventually went out of business.  I was informed I had a new agent, who did nothing but repeat the former agent's work and was generally ignorant regarding my policy.  I looked for a new agent and found Denise Wardwell, who was very nice and efficient, at first.  My brother signed on with her just before I did since he was purchasing a home.  Shortly after I signed on with her, my brother told me she showed up at his job!  He was not happy, she had no reason show up there since he had already submitted his payment to her.
I had a water pipe leak in my home.  The pipe ran through the foundation and my plumber said it would be too destructive to locate so he rerouted the line through the attic.  When I tried to file a claim, Denise Wardwell argued with me saying I could not file a claim since my foundation was not covered.  No matter what I said, she insisted it was a foundation issue and my foundation was not covered!  It was a plumbing issue!!  She then advised me to insure my foundation and increased my premium.
Later hurricane Ike came and she informed me that I could not file a claim because my deductible was too high.  I did not file a claim and then looked for another agent.  When my brother tried to file a claim she told him he could not since his deductible was too high.  In fact, my brother has a very low deductible.  He searched for another agent and informed her she was no longer his agent.  Denise Wardwell then called my brother, telling him that she did not like the policy the new agent drew up and that she was going to report the new agent to the insurance commission.  My brother told her to never call him again.
I immediately changed agents to my brother's new agent as well.  I sent a letter via email, letting Denise Wardwell know that she was no longer to be be my agent.  
My Texas Windstorm was due after my renewal on my homeowners and anticipating Denise renewing the policy in spite of my 'firing' her, I called my mortgage company and my new agent.  I instructed my mortgage company that Denise Wardwell was no longer my agent and to not disburse premium payment to her.  As predicted, Denise renewed my homeowner's policy.  I immediately called the mortgage company again, and they transferred the fee to my new agent.  My Texas Windstorm was up for renewal several months later and in anticipation of the same issue, I called my mortgage co and instructed them not to pay Denise Wardwell and that she tried to receive payment previously when I had told her I had a new agent.  Again, she CALLED my mortgage company and demanded payment.  I did not know this until I recived my new policy with her name on it.
I called my mortgage company again.  While I was on the phone with my mortgage company, they called her to confront her and instruct her to refund my money.  She did not answer.  I will be reporting her behavior to the insurance commission.  She will not go away and I formally composed a letter to her when I met my new agent.  My new agent sent her a letter as well.
This is unethical behavior and she has forced me to have her as my agent by renewing my policy in spite of my informing her that I changed agents.

										This company is trying to take money from people. They charged me without me ever giving them consent in the first place and when I called to get my money back they charged me AGAIN the next day. They can take money out of my account in a day but for some reason it takes weeks to get it back. Every person I talked to at this company doesn't care at all either, this is standard practice from them for sure. Don't ever get any insurance that has anything to do with this company.

Louisville, Kentucky U.S.A. ",, 800-214-6416,TriState Financial Network - National Agents Alliance Terminated and stole my team once I had established an Agency. Louisville Kentucky,"
										I started with National Agents Alliance through Mike Lewantowicz in June 2006.  I worked this business on a part-time basis until building it to an income I could afford to leave my full-time position in October 2007.  I have several prior Agency Managers who said they will testify to my experience and most of whom experienced the same.  
I worked my NAA independent business on a part-time basis eventually building my agency into 140 agents in 28 states.  I was on several national conference calls with the founders of the company.  The mortgage crisis hit and I went looking for additional income sources to help support my business since I was supposed to be ""independent"".  Mike Lewantowicz decided to have me terminated without ANY official notice from him or National Agents Alliance because I contracted to sell health insurance to support the downturn in leads.
We had the fastest growing team in the Alex Abuyuan Master Agency.  I discussed the fact of me leaving a 15 year career to pursue this business with Alex and Mike.  They both stated how they were behind me.  I was never given official notice of my termination except from the carriers.  NAA corporate never responded to any of my requests for status.
I have spent $3500 in attorney fees to date.  We are looking for other Agency Managers who had this same situation happen to them who are willing to share their experience for a class action lawsuit.  National Agents Alliance, their owners, Mike Lewantowicz, Alex Abuyuan, and others will be named.  
If anyone has interest in contacting me or questions concerning National Agents Alliance or Mike Lewantowicz's TriState Financial Network, you may replay to this posting.
I'm sorry to have to do this, but my family has suffered greatly do to the activities of Mike Lewantowicz and National Agents Alliance.  I have lost significant income and it's time we made a statement to shut down their illegal activities.
I sincerely say this to anyone considering NAA as a long-term business opportunity, run.  You are playing with the lowest snakes in the insurance industry.  You are not independent.  You are not given fresh leads.  You will pay more than you earn especially if you decide to build an agency.  
If you decide to pursue National Agents Alliance after reading this from a prior respected Agency Manager, don't say you were never warned.  I'm hoping this saves someone else from experiencing the same severe hardship as I have.
P.S. Philip Hudgins claims this to be a Christian company  This is a RED FLAG...  Hopefully there is a special place for people using this as their way to build a business.

Internet Italy ",, 800-220-6238,DAN EUROPE - Divers Alert Network Europe INSURANCE COMPANY The above insuarance conpany failed to provid me with the relative  medical assistence stated in the policy. L Roseto Internet," 
I hold an international  medical policy by  DAn Europe. 
On the 31 August  while travelling to Bangkok I suffered a massive congest rite attack , this was due  by  food poison,  I collapsed  to the  ground  at 5 am  while at the Morchit bus  station in Bangkok, 
Soon after I was approached by the local bus station Personal to help me. In meantime also a foreigner  Mr . Robert Zotescue while  passing by he called to my help.
While in agony I  give my DAn insurance detail to Mr.Rober, and he called Dan insurance to forward them my problem.
In meantime an ambulance  was called and arrived within half  hour . I was rushed to the  Hospital.
Before departing I was assured by Robert that DAN insurance would call me within a few hours. 
I would like to state that most people at the time  were also very scared for the  swine flu  and  a few also in panic.
In the local hospital in Bangkok, (  this  was not  a private  hospital ) I was  soon after placed to all kind of  blood test and put on drips with medicine and  heavy painkillers.
A few hours  passed by, 7, 8, and I was still waiting to hear from my insurance  company. Soon after I was questioned  for the  payment of the hospitals by the management  and  I tried to explain that I had no much funds available at the time and that Dan would  take care, as they previously spoke with Robert , and give their impression that all would be take care of.
I also did call my insurance and I run out of  credit on my phone  I had the local personal to speak to Dan and spelling the  name of the Hospital  I was in. 
Dan  failed  to understand  and  they never  tried harder again  to  phone back or even trying to speak to the  Doctors.
So at the  end  still in agony i was  forced to dismiss myself because of luck of  funds  available.  I had limited  amount of  money available. I just  managed to pay  the bill  and left the hospital still in pain and unable to walk.
Now  Dan is cancelling my claim as they state that i was not  2 days in The  hospital, and their policy only state  that I need to be  hospitalised  2 day before  i get assistance from them.
I also bring at the attention that the same thing happened  4 month ago, then again dan failed to contact the hospital and speak with the   doctors.
In meantime they  do charge me   every  year for  medical  assistance, for  which i can never  use any kind of benefit.
i do think that D A N should rephrase  them self a Deaths  Are  Nothing.
 Their  negligence is deliberate and they do   misleading the public.
I thank God that i survived this horrendous ordeal. I just wander what would  happened if my case was going much worsen  and without  any support from the medical insurance  company. For  what they care I could be well dead for them. But I am alive and I am here to take legal action at the mean to  expose this to the other fellow  members that are using the same  insurance.
I am now still in a recovery stage that if well take me  a list a week , with no any king of  medicasl support.
I wander  who need a DAN  or DAM insurance.

He has made several false allegations about why he is not paying me. I have refuted 100% of his allegations with the true facts. 
It is amazing that he would do business with and pay a convicted felon, without an insurance license, but not me?

										When I heard about rip off reports.com and searched for Sea West Financial I was not surprised to find their names on your list. My situation is similar to some of the others. I bought a car from a used dealership in 2001 and in 2002 I received a letter stating that they have turned my loan over to Sea West. No one contact me until this was done , so I had no say it in it at all. 
I was supposed to make 39 payments of $300.00 and one last payment of $69.00. Last week I called them and asked for my balance and found out that it is $900.00 more than what I owe. I made 4 payments to the dealer before my balance was turned to Sea West so I called them to discuss this and everybody was rude specially Mr. Cruz who told me he did not have time to sit there and give me an accounting class, he also stated that if I don't pay I just won't get my title. 
I have proof of 4 payments I made to the dealer and the payments I have made to them. What can I do? Please give me an advise!!!Is there any way we can get a class action suit against this company?

										I had an auto insurance policy with Bob Babigan Insurance company of 5900 100th S.W., Lakewood, Washington.
When I began this policy I was told provided I recieved no tickets or accidents within a years time I would qualify for lower premiums. Fair enough.
On the 11th month of the policy I was sent a 3x5 mailing card from the wife of Bob Babigan who works in the office.
It stated on the card that the policy was set to expire soon and that for $100.00 she could ""reveiw the policy and find the lowest rate"".
There were no accidents or tickets within that year.
I paid the $100.00. (Like a fool).
(Come to think of it I have never heard of an insurance company doing this).
When the new policy was drawn up the insurance premiums were now $50.00 HIGHER each month than before not to mention that I paid $100.00 for these higher premiums.
The agreement was that if there were no tickets and no accidents the premiums after one year would be lower, i.e. ""good driver discount""
I dropped that policy immediatly when I found this out that I would be paying even more for being a ""good driver"".
There was one month left on the policy.
I told them to cancel immediately.
They didnt.
 They billed me for that month then turned around and submitted that to a collection agency where I was hounded by bill collectors for that one month of non payment of which they said ""you were covered"".
I seriously doubt that statement.
 Should I have got in a wreck on that 11th. month they would turn around and say, ""you werent covered""
This is a total fraud and coersive tactic to force people out of money. 
This is shitty business practice and I will say this.
Did you think I would stick around after pulling this stunt? You lost a long term customer, you did it to yourselves.
Never again will I use Farmers Insurance and I will tell everyone I know the same, especially Babigans of Lakewood, Wash.

										I was contacted by a company representative named Carl Michaels in August 2004.  As a new agent I needed a source of leads to grow my business.  I was promised 35 leads for $360 and never got anything.  I called up after a month and asked for my money back but was given a hard time.  They kept pushing me to give them a few more days but they hadn't gotten me anything so far so I refused.
Long story short, I pursued getting a refund for over a year and a half and never got any money back at all.  Each time I called I was given a different story like they would mail it out next week or they already mailed it but it must have gotten lost, etc., etc.  
Ultimately, I spoke with the owner Joseph Schiavone who then told me he had a heart attack and was financially broke and couldn't refund the money.  He also said that the company was no longer in business.
My advice is to never do business with any company that you can't get SOLID references for.  Make sure that whoever is recommending the company is legitimate.  There are, unfortunately, many people out there who are simply trying to take your money.

										The agent misrepresented the policy to entice us to make the purchase. He asked us to sign blank forms, assuring us he had the information he needed and it would save time if he filled them out later. He also insisted on cash for the first payment, that had to be made to start the policy. We trusted him as he explained the benefits of the policy in comparison to the Blue Cross policy we had. The premium was less expensive and guaranteed not to increase, unless everyone in our age group had the increase as well.
The premium did rise, all in the same year, from eight or nine hundred a quarter to thirteen or fourteen hunderd a quarter. I had been hurt August of 06 and needed medical attention. I was later referred to a nerosurgeon, which needed all types of test and xrays to confirm the damage and recommended surgery. When I contacted Mid West National Life of Tennessee to inform
them of my need for surgery, they instructed me that I could receive three thousand for the hospital, three thousand for the surgeon, and a percentage of the surgeons bill for the anesthesiologist. This was about what I would have paid for premiums on this policy for a year, and in no way helped with the eighty some thousand dollar surgery.
We informed the Dept. of Insurance and they contacted the
insurance company on our behalf, but the papers we had signed were our exceptance of the policy. The coverage described was not at all what he (the representative) had explained to us. He basically told us what we wanted to hear, and hoped we would never use it to find out. 
There has to be some law against misrepresentation of a
product or service. Needless to say we are financially
unstable, with medical bills galore.

										This is the crap I have to deal with. Driving on the 8 Freeway in San Diego, midweek rush hour 5pm traffic in 2005. I get rear ended, the driver has Progressive Insurance. They admit fault. Progressive pays $1800 for my car to be fixed and tells me to seek medical treatment if needed. 
I go to a chiropractor, send them the bill of $5K, and they refuse to pay. They offer $2,500. I go in circles with Tracy from Progressive. I hire a lawyer and we are going to court, 2 years later. I've paid the bills already, trying to seek reimbursement.  
I live in Seattle. I am flying to San Diego April 21st, to go to court now over the $5K bill from a car accident from over 2 years ago.  I got an MRI who concluded I have a 3-4 mm protrusion in my low back at L4-5 with an annular tear. Still need to go to court. 
I had a trip to Cabo booked this week, and now I need to spend my vacation suing Progressive over $2,500. My back still hurts, so it's worth the fight.
I'm not an idiot. I am an Executive with a Fortune 500 company. I am an ethical person, and if I feel I am entitled to the additional $2,500- I'll fight for it!! My friends, family, work are all involved. Thought I'd entertain you as well. Thanks for reading :)
Stay away from that company. It is hell trying to get reimbursed. Not worth the pain- back still hurts, getting friends involved. It's horrible!
So I'll be in court down in San Diego in 2 weeks, I'll let you know how it goes. Suing Progressive. They already admitted guilt. What a great fricking way to spend a vacation.

Claim No.:  0442152XX
Dear XXX:
I have reviewed your case.  There are several issues, or problem areas, with this case that just make any high dollar settlement not feasible.
The full amount of my initial evaluation is $2050, any additional consideration is minimal at best.  No future care will be considered as we have causation concerns pertaining to your injuries and medical treatment as it is.  The loss of earnings you submitted is so far removed from the date of loss that I cannot consider that as part of the settlement either.
Originally I considered only the treatment you received in San Diego as reasonable.  In an effort to resolve this case I can give you the month of February for your medical treatment as well.  However, I cannot give you the charges billed by Associated Chiropractic.   Their bills are incredibly excessive.  The supplies are included in the procedure charge and this facility billed $50 per treatment for supplies, they charged $108 for a procedure whose code indicates it's a 15 minute procedure.  They also billed another $48 for manipulation.  A standard chiropractic visit with several modalities generally runs around $90 per session, maybe $100, but definitely not $206-$223 per tx.
You had 5 tx in February.  I will consider those 5 treatments at $100 per visit.  The offer for full and final settlement is now $2500. You must realize I have to look at the severity of the impact, the nature of the treatment, the consistency of the treatment, whether or not the charges are reasonable, how your age and physical condition would affect your injury, medical documentation to support the healing process for an
injury of this nature.  
Nothing in this claim or surrounding your diagnosed injury supports the medical treatment you received.  This is the best I can do.
Sincerely,
Tracy Kaner-Hizon

										By comparing PIA, The Big I and Brooke, it seems that Brooke took the decades old tradition of assisting agencies and new agents in starting their agencies. Giving them access to carriers, especially preferred commercial carriers. But thats where the similarity stops. First, there is NO franchise fee with PIA or the Big I.
Unlike the PIA and the big I, Brooke charges for everything they can. Legitimate Insurance Associations do not steal from their agents. 
It does sadden me to see what Brooke has done to the tradition of PIA and Big I, which both have been around since the 1930's. They worked very hard over the last several decades to change legislation, to change insurance rules and laws, to make sure that honest agents get a fair shake in their industry. And that the consumer, has an agent they can trust. Ethics, strong Ethics.
Then along comes Brooke. 
""OMG, we could charge a fortune for all this stuff"" !?!?!
And thats where they are today. Instead of assisting new agents and established agencies move ahead, they themselves dont know what they are doing, and in effect, are killing the ""agent spirit"", all in the name of their mighty dollar.
The agency is left an empty shell of its former book.
I know a family of agents that sold their family business of insurance agencies to Brooke. This agency was established in the 1950's. A strong book and 6 locations statewide. In the short time Brooke has had control, half of the agency locations are not cash flowing anymore. How the hell can you destroy a book of business that fast !!!
I have spoke with reps from PIA and the Big I as well as some companies that provide AMS and raters & carrier reps. Brooke has such a ""stigma"" in the insurance world. People giggle when they hear you are with Brooke.(people in the industry that is)
As far as the consumer is concerned, who is Brooke ????
Heck even I have been called ""Brooke"" by my clients !!
They (Brooke) dont advertise on a National Level, like other Insurance entities do, AIG, Progressive, Nationwide, so who would know Brooke ?
Its a useless name, it gives you no credibility,and it actually involkes a giggle or two.
The writing is on the wall. 
Save your dreams, your agency and your reputation. 
If you are not with Brooke, dont consider it. 
If you are, start doing some damage control before its too late.
If you invest, do it wisely, Enron came without a warning.
Class action suits have been filed in CA,TX,KS & LA.
They have moved so fast and grown so quickly, using unethical tactics, its going to come to a crashing halt sometime in the near future. The lawsuits are being filed, the carriers are dropping Brooke and insurance commissioners are taking a second look at the mounting complaints against Brooke. 
Think about it.

										MEGA Life, NASE, PFL
I have had their Catastrophic Hospitalization Insurance. Basically a $5000.00 deductible  and up to 10k they pay 80% after that it is 100% of the charges. Now I bought this back in 1986, in 1993 I had a brain tumor and the company I was working for paid for the operation. Then I thought really, PFL, Mega is my primary Insurance company. Their first coverage. 
I called the company and told them this and they were over joyed, as it was a self insured company and the employees provided the pool of money. There was no problem, PFL picked up the cost, as they are my primary insurance company. The cost was $397,000.00 for the operation, MEGA PFL paid everything, that was covered. To say the least I was very happy with the company and though my rates are almost $700 per month for just my coverage, I recommended them to everyone.
Now they have decided that they are no longer my Primary Insurance Carrier, that my wife's coverage from her job is primary, medicare comes second as I am on SSD and Mega PFL is third.
How can they do this, they have been my primary insurance since 1986, my wife has had many jobs, no guarantee this will last.
This was all done with out my knowledge except the billing person at my Primary Doctor mentioned this when she was trying to refund money to Mega PFL.  This has to be the biggest rip off and I am sure highly illegal. 
They are doing it because all my wife's company had to do is deny the claim and it goes to Medi Care and then PFL. I am not 65, no where near that. So all PFL would have to pay, is what Medi Care did not pay, at the Medi Cares rate of about 37% of a Doctors normal charge. What a scam and a terrible thing to do for those who need Medi Care.
I intend to contact Medi Care Fraud Department as this was all done behind my back and I am not even required to keep the Medi Care, it's just an option and Medi Care has never paid a dime. With 2 other insurance companies ahead of them. I think this is collusion between the two companies to with hold payments on care and medications that I need, turn it over to Medi Care and MEGA PFL only pays what little Medi Care does not play.
I must say I am surprised, not all that much, but still surprised, as MEGA PFL has paid for the things they were responsible for till now. As I read through their list of problems, I remember back to the interview with the agent.  She was brand new and I had to reminder her there were a couple of questions she could not ask. 
I figured if I was getting pushed around, so must others be experiencing what I am  today.  I am shocked, but pleasantly at the agents that have come forward to say how this company does business now and reveal how it acts and operates behind the scenes. 
This takes courage, that is so lacking in most people today. Their saying that they were duped and told false promises and not kept up date on their policies by the company they were selling for. This takes courage to admit you made a mistake in life and come forth to warn others. That is inner strength.
I only wish I had kept track of the company, with the rate increases I would think they were happy, but it is clear their has been collusion among the 2 insurance companies and I will be the loser. If any one knows about this happening or if they can do it with out notification, I would appreciate it. Also how to get to the people who make the decisions, I do not want to spend days going through the phone tree. This will really hurt me, I just don't see how they can assign positions, when I have been with them for 21 years and they have always been my first insured. Then swap with another company and assign a government benefit  Medi Care at the second position. Who gives them that right.  Now they say where the Government will pay     
Any help or ideas most kindly requested and accepted. They sure have changed since 86.

They called a few months ago and said the first product caused problems and wanted to sell me the ""fix"" for it.  They said it actually clogged up your septic system.  I declined.
They are now calling to offer septic system insurance.  The caller id says Selective Health at 561-314-0854, but the sales rep said FBK Products.  She wanted me to apply for septic system insurance at $100/yr with $10 application fee.  I said I would not take insurance I had to pay for before I saw the paperwork.  She said I could see it on the website: fbkproducts.com and call her at 800-730-7315.  She claims they are backed by AON (not sure of spelling) insurance, and they pay for anything for the septic system up to $5,000.  She denied that FBK had problems with the first product and said those calls must have come from some other company.
This year I have been called 2-3 times about buying the ""fix"" product for the septic sytem and 2 times about buying the septic insurance.  I will not do business with the company again.

 Liberty Mutual Insurance ,"  Liberty Mutual Insurance  6909 W. RAY ROAD 
Chandler, Arizona U.S.A. ",, 800-257-4725,"Liberty Mutual Insurance Office Horrible Customer Service, don't respond to emails, phone calls ripoff  Chandler Arizona","
										When I was a Liberty Mutual Insurance carrier (home, auto) my initial experience was great. I went to the office and met with Jennifer (an agent there). She was friendly and got me all signed up for a policy that was appropriate for my needs. That was the LAST time I recieved good customer service. 
I had a few problems with billing (getting double charged) and immediately emailed my agent. My emails were wither ignored completely or she responded up to 2 weeks later. After the first problem took several months to resolve, I decided to stop using email and call the office directly for any further issues. Nothing but lost messages, unreturned messages, and incompetence resulted from my calls. Eventually I resorted to calling the general 1-800 number for all of Liberty Mutual, so I could talk with someone OTHER than my agent and/or the people in her office.
The last straw came recently when I cancelled my policy. I was told that although I cancelled my policy in April, I still owed a balance on my account in May. I assumed that my payments were covering the following month, not the previous month. What company gives you coverage in advance of your payment? 
Regardless, when I got the bill I immediately called the Chandler office to ask for an explanation. They had made billing mistakes previously, so who's to say this wasn't another one? The receptionist said she'd take down a message and someone would call me back with an answer. 
A week passed and I never recieved a call back. I called again, and left another message with the receptionist. Again, no call back. I called a total of 4 times. After 2 months, since nobody was calling me back, and I hadn't recieved further bills, I assumed that they had investigated it and found that they made a mistake.
WRONG! I got a letter from a collections agency today for the charge. I called the Chandler Office and explained the whole thing. the multiple ignored messages, etc. She explained why I still owed money in May, even though the policy was cancelled in April, and told me there was no record of my many phone calls and messages, and promises of a returned phone call with explanation. This was frustrating. Why wasn't I told this the very first time I called? Why didn't anyone have 2 minutes to call me and give me the brief explanation?
If you want to be largely ignored, overbilled, and your time wasted repeatedly, then Liberty Mutual in Chandler is the way to go.

 Kelly Johnson Insurance Agency ,"  Kelly Johnson Insurance Agency  320 East Peyton Street 
Sherman, Texas U.S.A. ",, 800-265-7977,Kelly Johnson Insurance Agency Insurance agency couldn't find my homeowners policy they sold me. Sherman Texas,"
										I called Kelly Johnson to renew my homeowners insurance policy on 5/30/07. This policy was set to expire on 5/31/07. This office didn;t have any of my information on file. The office told me that I didn't exist and that they would have to investigate to find my policy. 
Well the next day I contacted their office to find out more information. They found my policy, but couln't tell me if it was still active or anything. I told them I needed a new policy on 6/01/07. The office told me they would look into a possible refund, cancellation date and etc. The office offered me a new policy on 5/31/07. The office told me to come down and sign the policy and that I needed to bring a money order (this was the only payment accepted). 
This office called me at 4:00 and said if I could make it before 5 they would write my policy to avoid any lapse in coverage. I left work early, went to get my money order and was at the office at 4:24. The lady told me the guy who was helping was leaving and she wouldn't help. I ask her to just check, because we had been talking the whole day. She said he would not help, she wouldn't help and there was nothing I could do. She told me that farmers has an agreement that won't allow them to write a policy after 4. I told her I just talked with him and he insited me coming down right now. She said I needed to come back. I ask if she could at least print out my quote. She said she was happy to. 
I took my quote and went about 2 blocks where a famers agent was more than happy to write my quote. She said this was never a policy of farmers. However, this agent Kelly Johnson didn't have my policy on file, couldn't find my policy, didn't have any information on it, invites me down to write a new policy and refuses to so as promised while open for business I must add. She can't find out if I need a refuns because she doesn't know when my policy started, ended or anything. I could have lost everything becuase of the carelessness of this office and agency.

Reading, Massachusetts U.S.A. ",, 800-278-2386,Old Heritage Insurance Agency - Old Heritage Agency  WARNING NOT TO BE TRUSTED WITH BANK INFORMATION!! ripoff Reading Massachusetts,"
										This insurance agency is one of the worst I have dealt with. Within 1 month of opening a policy through their agents my insurance was canceled in error due to misfiled paperwork and they deposited my initial installment check 2 times (4 weeks apart), removing a large sum of money from my bank account illegally. 
Once I caught the error they refused to make restitution to cover any fees I incurred as a result of their illegal banking transaction. They told me ""just sue (them) if (I) had a problem with that"". I would not trust this agency with any financial information. They are not a secure business nor do they care to change their security weaknesses to protect their customers. This one is a real scam. 
Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. All of the companies they work with have more reliable agents all over MA State.

Since then i had tried to get in contact with the company in regards to the rest of the winnings but only got that same answering machine and no call back. I am a single mother of 3 and any finacial help that comes my way is usually looked at as afinacial blessing.

I found that this company is a fraud.Everything was a scam. I cant believe i was that foolish to believe i could wake up to free money in the mailbox. though nothing has come back on me i am afraid that the future could bring me legal and finacial burdens on me.

=====================NOW TO THE ORIGINAL REPORT THAT WAS FILED  
===================== 
SHC Agents Charned and Burned Ripoff Valdosta Georgia
While the products are well supported and customer service seems to be a goal the agents are treated like cattle.  
Surprisingly this organization continues to flourish despite its growing poor reputation among insurance professionals.   The primary concern is the companys direct and distinct captivity of non-employees.  Traditionally a captive agent would be afforded the courtesy of small base salary full benefits from day one and expenses for the purpose of marketing an organizations products.  None of those standards are true here.  The agent is on the hook for all the expenses including the lion's share of the preset appointment cost.
In this case the interviews are cattle calls and the training process in extremely entry level suggesting a desire to induce inexperienced or newly licensed agents.  This is were things get very sticky.  Once signed on your bound and will never ever be aloud a release for those products.  Meaning that if you do not meet any one of a very long list of qualifiers
Quotas you may be summarily dismissed or directed to re-earn the right to participate in the standard preset appointment marketing plan.  While quotas are always great for building a polished professional sales team they should never be used or aligned for the purpose of profiting from false failures.
Normally when measuring turnover in a corporation the primary goal is retention of the employee. Given that the national average for employee turn over is somewhere in the 22-31 percent range this company's 90-94 percent turn over rate is appalling. This smacks of CHURN and BURN methodologies.
Please be very aware that if you choose a career path with this company that you are willing to risk the loss of years of renewal income to the whims of its management.

										As a student, you are bomb with millions of advertisements for everything. You chose what a professional recommend due to his/her knowledge. If the associate students recommend a health insurance group, you tend to believe is the best option. 
Unfortunately this is not the case, I was enrolling in a health insurance plan back in February with Wells Fargo administered by Blue Cross. The membership card was said to arrive in 3 weeks, which never did. Days later, I called to see what happen and for the first time I was told of a member ID #. Since I had a number, I try to use the benefits of the card by purchasing some prescription medication. I was not able, since I did not have a group number neither the address where the pharmacy supposes to bill my insurance. 
Four months later, I received the card. I went back to the pharmacy, to received my prescribe medicine. The pharmacist had trouble with card, so she called Blue Cross. Once she spoke to a customer specialist, she was told I was not in the system. She gave them my social security number and my group and medical id numbers. 
That's when I reached my max point and I called to request a refund. I spoke to a customer service rep called Alma and she said ""I am not able to issue a refund, since the system shows there is claims outstanding."" When I was not able to use my benefits of the insurance to begin with in the past. It looks that their computer system showed me active, after the pharmacist called.
Then, Alma mentioned that I was going to get a called from the manager specialist ""Jolie"". Jolie called me and we discuss the issues. She will just keep apologizing for not receiving the insurance card and that there was nothing for her to do. After mentioning the pharmacy issue. She said that I needed to pay on my own and then get reimburse by an insurance claim. When in the claim forms says that the prefer procedure is for all providers of health care to bill them for service, since they will provide more details than are ordinarily provided on bills to patients.
Overall, I was told that I would not have a refund or an extension for the insurance.

										I purchase GAP insurance in case of an accident.  Well...  From reports and what I read from the company they cover the difference between what the primary insurance does not and what is owed.  Well they calculated on their own what the balance of the car loan should be not the actual pay-off.  The account was current at the time of the accided. What they don't tell you is they don't cover the interest.  Next bit - The covered the GAP between the amount they calculated to be owed and what the NADA value was.  Leaving me a balance of $2669.49.  The took 112 days to settle, which accrued late fees that they say they aren't responsible for. They paid a measly $369.42.  Unbelievable!!!  Now I have gathered that the way the Primary insurance (Allstate) and the GAP insurance claim the value are two different ways.  Now I've got the finance company telling me its going into charge-off stage if I don't pay the $1298 past due.  In which I was advised to wait for the settlement amount.  I don't understand this maze as to which I am trying to find the end of but I can complain as much as I want.  Any help you can provide would be greatly be appreciated.

										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.

Southlake, Texas U.S.A. ",, 800-400-9192,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"
										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.
 I have filed a complaint with the DOI in Nevada and am looking for other who have had same problem to file a class action lawsuit against United American and Torchmark INC. They have other companies Glob Life, AIL, LIberty National,UA and severa other Names they go by.

Leaving me a balance of $2669.49.  The took 112 days to settle, which accrued late fees that they say they aren't responsible for. They paid a measly $369.42.  Unbelievable!!!  Now I have gathered that the way the Primary insurance (Allstate) and the GAP insurance claim the value are two different ways.  Now I've got the finance company telling me its going into charge-off stage if I don't pay the $1298 past due.  In which I was advised to wait for the settlement amount.

Lake Worth, Florida U.S.A. ",, 800-400-9192,NAA And Ed Orell Do NOT Get involved with Ed Orell and NAA Lake Worth Florida,"
										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.
STAY AWAY FROM ED ORELL!

Southlake, Texas U.S.A. ",, 800-400-9192,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"
										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.
 I have filed a complaint with the DOI in Nevada and am looking for other who have had same problem to file a class action lawsuit against United American and Torchmark INC. They have other companies Glob Life, AIL, LIberty National,UA and severa other Names they go by.

										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months.

They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.

										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.

Southlake, Texas U.S.A. ",, 800-608-4471,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"
										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.

										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.

Southlake, Texas U.S.A. ",, 800-861-8670,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"
										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.

Lake Worth, Florida U.S.A. ",, 802-229-3333,NAA And Ed Orell Do NOT Get involved with Ed Orell and NAA Lake Worth Florida,"
										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.
STAY AWAY FROM ED ORELL!

 Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott ,"  Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott  P.O. Box 93988 
Southlake, Texas U.S.A. ",, 812-2801360,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"
										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

Reno, Nevada U.S.A. ",, 813.870.3801  ,United American Insurance Rip off of employees and money from clients Reno Nevada,"
										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.
 I have filed a complaint with the DOI in Nevada and am looking for other who have had same problem to file a class action lawsuit against United American and Torchmark INC. They have other companies Glob Life, AIL, LIberty National,UA and severa other Names they go by.

 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent.

										I purchase GAP insurance in case of an accident.  Well...

What they don't tell you is they don't cover the interest.  Next bit - The covered the GAP between the amount they calculated to be owed and what the NADA value was.  Leaving me a balance of $2669.49.  The took 112 days to settle, which accrued late fees that they say they aren't responsible for. They paid a measly $369.42.  Unbelievable!!!  Now I have gathered that the way the Primary insurance (Allstate) and the GAP insurance claim the value are two different ways.  Now I've got the finance company telling me its going into charge-off stage if I don't pay the $1298 past due.  In which I was advised to wait for the settlement amount.

										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.

Southlake, Texas U.S.A. ",, 858-530-98,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"
										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.
 I have filed a complaint with the DOI in Nevada and am looking for other who have had same problem to file a class action lawsuit against United American and Torchmark INC. They have other companies Glob Life, AIL, LIberty National,UA and severa other Names they go by.

										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.

If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.

										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.

If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.

										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.

If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.

										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.

If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.

										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.

If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.
 I have filed a complaint with the DOI in Nevada and am looking for other who have had same problem to file a class action lawsuit against United American and Torchmark INC. They have other companies Glob Life, AIL, LIberty National,UA and severa other Names they go by.

Lake Worth, Florida U.S.A. ",, 866-5720031,NAA And Ed Orell Do NOT Get involved with Ed Orell and NAA Lake Worth Florida,"
										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.
STAY AWAY FROM ED ORELL!

Lake Worth, Florida U.S.A. ",, 866-5720031,NAA And Ed Orell Do NOT Get involved with Ed Orell and NAA Lake Worth Florida,"
										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.
STAY AWAY FROM ED ORELL!

Southlake, Texas U.S.A. ",, 866-5720031,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"
										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.
 I have filed a complaint with the DOI in Nevada and am looking for other who have had same problem to file a class action lawsuit against United American and Torchmark INC. They have other companies Glob Life, AIL, LIberty National,UA and severa other Names they go by.

										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.
STAY AWAY FROM ED ORELL!

Southlake, Texas U.S.A. ",, 8668790179,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"
										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.
 I have filed a complaint with the DOI in Nevada and am looking for other who have had same problem to file a class action lawsuit against United American and Torchmark INC. They have other companies Glob Life, AIL, LIberty National,UA and severa other Names they go by.

										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.
STAY AWAY FROM ED ORELL!

Southlake, Texas U.S.A. ",, 877-932-6333,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"
										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.
 I have filed a complaint with the DOI in Nevada and am looking for other who have had same problem to file a class action lawsuit against United American and Torchmark INC. They have other companies Glob Life, AIL, LIberty National,UA and severa other Names they go by.

										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.
STAY AWAY FROM ED ORELL!

Southlake, Texas U.S.A. ",, 877-932-6333,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"
										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.
 I have filed a complaint with the DOI in Nevada and am looking for other who have had same problem to file a class action lawsuit against United American and Torchmark INC. They have other companies Glob Life, AIL, LIberty National,UA and severa other Names they go by.

Lake Worth, Florida U.S.A. ",, 888-551-1283,NAA And Ed Orell Do NOT Get involved with Ed Orell and NAA Lake Worth Florida,"
										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.
STAY AWAY FROM ED ORELL!

Southlake, Texas U.S.A. ",, 888-605-4776,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"
										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.
 I have filed a complaint with the DOI in Nevada and am looking for other who have had same problem to file a class action lawsuit against United American and Torchmark INC. They have other companies Glob Life, AIL, LIberty National,UA and severa other Names they go by.

Lake Worth, Florida U.S.A. ",, 909-335-8110,NAA And Ed Orell Do NOT Get involved with Ed Orell and NAA Lake Worth Florida,"
										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.
STAY AWAY FROM ED ORELL!

Southlake, Texas U.S.A. ",, 909-335-8110,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"
										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.
 I have filed a complaint with the DOI in Nevada and am looking for other who have had same problem to file a class action lawsuit against United American and Torchmark INC. They have other companies Glob Life, AIL, LIberty National,UA and severa other Names they go by.

										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.
STAY AWAY FROM ED ORELL!

Southlake, Texas U.S.A. ",, 909-335-8110,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"
										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.
 I have filed a complaint with the DOI in Nevada and am looking for other who have had same problem to file a class action lawsuit against United American and Torchmark INC. They have other companies Glob Life, AIL, LIberty National,UA and severa other Names they go by.

Lake Worth, Florida U.S.A. ",, 941-377-6780,NAA And Ed Orell Do NOT Get involved with Ed Orell and NAA Lake Worth Florida,"
										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.
I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.
I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..
By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.
I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.
Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.
STAY AWAY FROM ED ORELL!

Southlake, Texas U.S.A. ",, 949-215-1530,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"
										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). 
They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).
I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.
I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.
If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.
After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.

										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on. 
 I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy.
 When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. 
United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month.
 I have filed a complaint with the DOI in Nevada and am looking for other who have had same problem to file a class action lawsuit against United American and Torchmark INC. They have other companies Glob Life, AIL, LIberty National,UA and severa other Names they go by.

San Diego, California U.S.A. ",, 9548018602,Virtual Lending Souce - Virtual GAP - Gap Insurance Ripoff San Diego California ,"
										I purchase GAP insurance in case of an accident.  Well...  From reports and what I read from the company they cover the difference between what the primary insurance does not and what is owed.  Well they calculated on their own what the balance of the car loan should be not the actual pay-off.  The account was current at the time of the accided. What they don't tell you is they don't cover the interest.  Next bit - The covered the GAP between the amount they calculated to be owed and what the NADA value was.  Leaving me a balance of $2669.49.  The took 112 days to settle, which accrued late fees that they say they aren't responsible for. They paid a measly $369.42.  Unbelievable!!!  Now I have gathered that the way the Primary insurance (Allstate) and the GAP insurance claim the value are two different ways.  Now I've got the finance company telling me its going into charge-off stage if I don't pay the $1298 past due.  In which I was advised to wait for the settlement amount.  I don't understand this maze as to which I am trying to find the end of but I can complain as much as I want.  Any help you can provide would be greatly be appreciated.
