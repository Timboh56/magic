As I wrote policies for this agency I began to notice the premiums quoted to the customer and the actual premium the customer paid were always different.  There are two types of quotes.  The first is a bating quote that Jeff Shi demands his producers send to the customer.  This quote offers a ridiculously low premium.  However, once the customer has been baited to contact Shi's Allstate Agency, the true premium charged to the customer is usually much higher.  This bait and switch technique is common at Jeff Shi's Allstate Agency of Sterling, Virginia. In addition, many times the premium would increase again at the last moment after the customer had given their credit card or banking information.  In one instance I personally witness the premium rise on the binding screen.  I asked Jeff Shi’s ex-wife, Yolanda, who is the office manager with his agency, about this increase.  She reviewed that the Future Effective Date had been added, there were no breaks in insurance coverage, and no claims and still she would not explain the last minute increase in the premium.  Yet the policy was still charged to the customer's credit card for a premium amount higher than the customer had agreed to pay. In addition, two policies Jeff and his ex-wife  reviewed gave the customers a discount based on the customer adding additional cars to the policy within a certain amount of days.  If the customer did not add the additional cars, the premium would shoot up with no explanation to the customer.  Neither customer had promised to add additional vehicles on their policy.  How can such policies be issued under the “watchful” eye of the agent and his ex-wife when Jeff Shi and his ex-wife Yolanda always review policies before they are issued?   In frustration and disgust with Jeff Shi and his ex-wife’s management, I quit after eight weeks of employment with them.  At the time I quit I had not found another job but I could not continue to work for this agent.  As an act of petty revenge, Jeff Shi has refused to issue my final pay check paying me for the hours I worked.  I am reporting him to the Better Business Bureau and others and advising everyone to stay away from this agent and his agency.  It is surprising that Allstate even allows Jeff Shi (aka J & J Insurance) to carry their name.  And it is even more surprising that the Virginia Insurance Commission has not investigated this agent.   The hostile work environment created by Jeff Shi and his ex-wife is illegal.  In front of the office, his ex-wife shouted to a Latino employee “you are so Hispanic.”  When another employee was out of the office due to a hernia, Jeff Shi’s ex-wife and office manager, Yolanda talked about the employee to both me and another new hire calling the absent employee “worthless.”  She made a similar ""behind-their-back"" comments about another employee who was out of the office.  That employee later quit asserting he needed to return to school.  As the office manager, Jeff Shi’s wife spends an incredible amount of time talking about each employee behind their back thus fanning the flames of discord, mistrust, co-worker harassment, and hostility.  Jeff Shi and his ex-wife create a work environment of intimidation as a means to keep their employees from speaking out or questioning them. Therefore the work environment at Allstate Insurance of Sterling, Virginia (aka J & J Insurance) is hostile, unethical, and unhealthy.  Customers and job seekers beware. ",  Insurance Agencies 
 ICS Merrill ,"  ICS Merrill   Nationwide USA ",http://www.emsinet.com/Investigative.aspx, 888-932-7364,""," I fully agree with what was said in the posting at: http://www.ripoffreport.com/r/ICS-MERRILL/internet/ICS-MERRILL-Liears-and-Rip-off-Artist-Internet-877198 and want to add to it.  1. I am working for ICS and can not stand to watch how ICS is swindling its clients (insurance companies) by charging them billable hours for work that is not being done.  What I mean by it is, ICS wants to pay its investigators as little money as possible and to accomplish that ICS designed a web based The Smart Partner Compass Case Management System https://www.tmgecase.com.  In order to avoid paying investigators for writing required case updates and case reports, ICS trains investigators to do those tasks while working surveillance at locations.  Basically an investigator sitting in a car on a surveillance case is required to write his/her reports and updates instead of doing the surveillance.  There are several issues with that: (a) the client is paying for those surveillance hours at a full rate; instead the ICS Merrill uses that time for report and update writing.  (b) At the same time an investigator can not look into a computer screen typing, and at a claimant who is the subject of the surveillance.  (c) Clients are not aware that investigators instead of doing surveillance spend a significant time and efforts typing updates and reports, because if they don't ICS Merrill would only pay them half (1/2) of their hourly rate for the time spent doing reports and updates after the surveillance efforts are completed.  Basically ICS Merrill gets a free ride at their customer's expense.   2. ICS Merrill takes advantage of its investigators in many ways: (a) In the Smart Partner Compass Case Management System cases are scheduled seven days a week without any time to rest.  It is common for ICS employees to work 14 or 21 days in a row without a single day off.  Investigators are extremely tiered,  not accurate or focused, and they burn out quickly. (b) The cases are scheduled back-to-back in blocks of 4, 6 or 8 hours without a single break.  No lunch break for you the ICS investigator. When two 4-hour cases are scheduled back-to-back only a minimum time to commute from one case to another is allowed.  Regardless if it is 4, 6, 8, or 12 hours work day no meal periods are given.  Employees are not allowed to even go to a bathroom.  Employees work out of their cars and they are told to urinate into “pee-bottles” that they carry in their vehicles. (c) ICS employs full time hourly employees are paid a variable hourly pay rate based on different tasks performed: i. Full Hourly Rate for fieldwork. ii. Half (1/2) Hourly Rate for drafting updates. iii. FREE.  Zero, no compensation for writing reports. iv. When traveling to and from cases, employees are only paid half of the regular hourly rate after one hour of free travel.  In another words, because that work is not billable to ICS clients, when traveling to and from cases ICS does not pay any compensation to it’s employees ($0.00) for the first hour of travel, and every following hour (after the 1st HR) is paid at half of employee’s hourly rate.  v. The ICS system is cleverly designed to take advantage of every little thing.  For example, investigators are required to submit time traveled so they could get compensated for the time after the 1st FREE HR and to do that ICS uses a decimal point calculation system instead of Hours/Minutes/Seconds.  Employees often do not spend time calculating the decimal equivalent.  If an investigator traveled 1 hour and 15 minutes, he/she often enters into ICS system 1.15 but that is less, because 1 hr and 15 min is 1.25 (15 min is a quarter of an hour). This is is not explained to investigators and most of them do not even know what they are doing.  But there are approximately 400 investigators at ICS Merrill and if ICS gets a little time off each investigator 24/7/365 it adds to big money to ICS.   3.  ICS Merrill cheats the unsuspected insurance claimants out of benefits they receive or should be awarded by spying on people and instructing all investigators to always use certain words like: (a) ""During the surveillance effort, the claimant was observed as he worked on his vehicle in front of the residence.  When observed, the claimant was not observed wearing any visible braces or orthopedic support devices."" or (b) ""Additional surveillance is recommended to further document the claimant’s activities and abilities. Surveillance to include a weekend would provide an opportunity to observe the claimant as he appears to be active during this time frame."" --- they always want to squeeze clients for more money. (c) it does not matter that claimants may have injuries.  If they are not extremely careful, they will have in their reports surveillance info that may deprive them of the benefits.    ICS represents that it cares about ethics, etc. But it's all just a BS, when you go deeper you will find an organization where people do NOT matter.  The investigators do NOT matter.  They are all disposable.  That is why ICS is a revolving door employer; investigators come because they are sold on company’s song and dance. They get the ICS treatment, and after they can no longer stand it, they leave or are fired to make a room for a new bunch. I still work here, because in my market there are no other employers, but as soon as I am able, I will be out of here.      ",  Insurance Agencies

Most of my sales were through the Federal Insurance Exchange, aka Obamacare. Excuse after excuse was given for not receiving commissions, ""the government had to pay the carriers"", ""the other company kept inadequate records"", ""you'll have commission checks within 30 days"". Integra and Premier Insurance Benefits split ways and one company began pointing to the other as the ""real problem"". Each company claimed the other was responsible for commissions, always without regard for the agents. I nearly had my home foreclosed upon and had to borrow thousands of dollars from my family just to keep our heads above water. As of this day, August 22, 2014, I am still owed thousands of dollars in unpaid commissions for sales I made six months ago.

They were pushy in the fact that they wanted the checks overnighted and wanted tracking numbers to prove the checks were on the way.  Once the checks were deposited we didn't hear anything for about a week even though we went through the requested process, sent Bios, schedules, etc.  We were pushed off to Victor Hamilton who sounded like a more ignorant version of Barry (if that's possible) although I believe they are the same person. Week two we had some appointments set up although none of them seemed to even know why were there and didn't want to be bothered.  Others didn't answer doors.  One prospect's daughter answered when I called regarding their missed appointment and was confused as to why I was there and how I recieved any information on them at all.  After explaining that I was there for an annuity review that was set up for me she was nice although following the call she contacted a major insurance carrier to ask how anyone would know anything about her father's current policy.  I had given her my contact information and apologized for the situation and left it at that.  About a week later I get a call from said Insurance carrier asking how I got this lead etc.  (I will be giving them any and all information I have Victor, Barry, etc. as the insurance carrier has more than enough money and manpower and time to go after scam artists like this) I called Victor asking for a refund and explained that I wouldn't be willing to approach another prospect that is confused and calling carriers regarding my visit.  He said he would refund the money but after waiting a month we still had nothing.  The next call from me wasn't as pleasant.  He put me on hold then disconnected the call.  When I called back private he answered pretending to be a call center machine with his voice saying to call back without a blocked number.  Seriously???  I told him to quit with the BS and he started speaking to me.  He said he just had back surgery, was in a lot of pain, couldn't even pay his rent, blah blah.  I told him we'd need the check back by no later than this past Wednesday or I would turn over his information to said insurance carrier.  He then started rambling that he would file a class action law suit on the carrier (what??).  He begged me not to call the carrier then said he wanted to marry me.  What a weirdo! Needless to say, we DID NOT get our money back and I will be reporting them to any and all carriers with whom I have internal contacts.  These people need to be stopped.  Do not send them any money!  I've seen other complaints on here from people that sent much more money and lost it.  Apparently they keep changing the name of the company and employees as well so beware.

He also said if the client didn't have 100.00 for insurance he didn't sell them insurance.   That was my second red flag.  Now reading all the post about clients getting sold product they didn't even know they were getting is totally believable.  At this office agents receive phone calls or text from their sale manage each week, if the agent hadn't text in any numbers for the week, the manger would state you better not blank for the week.  Meaning not having sold a supplement policy for the week.  Every Friday at the weekly sale meeting they put everyone supplement sale on the board and if you didn't have at least ""1"" supplement sale, they put a RED line through your name.  I love to sell but seriously this company is  ridicules.  My last red flag was during my sale manage weekly phone meeting, he stated that ""Wayne"" had a meeting with all the sale manager  the prior week and told each sale manager to fire TWO agent from their team.  And our sale manager said he was sorry, but he was going to have to think about which one of us it was going to be.    He hated to do it, but ""Wayne"" the top manager said they had to.  That was enough for me, to just throw in the towel.  I sincerely didn't want to sell one more policies with this company.  Everyone who is approached by an agent from Health Markets ask lots of questions about what you are purchasing.  Critical illness and accident are excellent insurance if YOU WANT the coverage, just make sure you are the one making the decision to add it to your health policy not your agents.        ",  Insurance Agencies

After calling agent, Amanda, in Muskegon, MI., it took days to find out why there was an increase, and why I was not being notified properly, of which I still did not get an answer. After many problems I decided to change the policy to an Allstate location closer, and an agent that responded to my concerns. However, since I could not be satisfied as to constant increasing of policy, I decided to not reinstate and faxed a notice cancelling policy as instructed by LaTasha at the Detroit Allstate office. I found a much better policy at AAA at less than half the cost of Allstate, which was before the 3/28/14 cancellation date recorded by Allstate. Now my son and I are receiving credit collection notices where Allstate is demanding 747.38 for changes to home policy. The Detroit office, LaTasha, told me she could not give me information, I would have to ask the Credit Collection Service, they in turn told me they were only doing what was sent to them from the Detroit office, and if I cancelled before Allstate cancellation date there should be no problem. The Muskegon office said they no longer had anything to do with the policy. The first year I paid a 89.00 premium, then 136.12 in November 2013, increased after home inspection, 93.00 in December 2013, 92.95 in January 2014, 92.95 in February 2014, and I cancelled March 3, 2014 at 375.00. Why should I pay for insurance that was properly cancelled, and when I have been insured by AAA since before cancellation date recorded by Allstate. I as an on-time paying customer with no claims, have not had the satisfaction of being treated fairly. Please advise! Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.     ",  Insurance Agencies

I sent them a pre payment by check and that was to start the process for generating my leads everyday for 3:00 telephone appointments.  The first lead I received was for a prospect in North Carolina. I live in Texas.  I thought OK the filters must be off. I sent an email to both Monica Potter and Brett Thompson. I was given a credit and I assumed the filter would be adjusted for my requested territory, but no again I received another lead for North Carolina.  I called and spoke with Monica and she stated she would get the problem resolved.  A few days later again I get another lead for North Carolina. I am mad at this point. I emailed both Monica and Brett again and did not get a reply.  I called them, but it appears they have caller ID to recognize who is calling and know that it's a problem call. I took a different approach and called from my cell number Monica Potter answered because she thought it was a new customer. When she realized I caught her she responded with a slick mouth because she knew she could hide behind the phone.  Monica said she would call back in one hour she never did and I had a gut feeling I wouldn't hear from her plus she added my cell number to my profile to make sure she does not answer because she knows and everyone at that company knows they are not going to send any money back.  I have to assume all of the staff who works there must be related.  I can't beleive anyone would take a job knowing they are scamming daily and have to walk out of their office never knowing what angry scammed customer may roll up on them. They are living dangerously with this type of business model. I would advise anyone reading this to not send a single check to them because you will get only bad leads, and join the ranks of you got scammed. This was a lesson well learned!

The customers are never informed of these fees, they are hidden in fine print and when they are asked about the fee, it is usually too late because Michael purposely has them sign the disclosures after the policy is written. He gave orders to charge such ridiculous fees in the thousands to people he called close friends, even when they were from his home country, the guy has no shame.   If you have the unfortunate of working here, you will find out I tell not even one lie.  Never in my life did I see an employer have employees sign and not give them copies of what they sign.  He has his agents sign faulty non-competes to try and intimidate them not to work in insurance.  little does he understand those agreements are not upheld in California, but even when he was told this, he insisted on getting them signed as a means of intimidation against anyone ignorant enough not to understand they are not legal.     Which brings me to the ultimate scheme against employees by Michael, unemployment.  Michael purposely keeps anything he can use that is incriminating on his employees.  Let’s say, Jackie was late to work, he will write her up, even if she does a great job and this is her first time late.  Than in the future, should she decide to quit or he decide to fire her, this write up will come handy for him.  How you ask?  Well if she dares go to unemployment, and I have seen this everytime.  Michael gets so upset and mocks anyone that goes on unemployment after working for him.  He takes it so personal and makes it a vendetta to make sure he does whatever it takes to have them denied.  So for Jackie’s case he will write a nasty letter about her, even if she was a great employee, and send it to unemployment with any and all incriminating information including the write up and do his best to get her denied.   Another tactic Michael employs which I have never seen anywhere either is this.  If he wants to fire you, he purposely will make your working conditions terrible, he will give you more work than you can handle, hassle you about it on purpose, step up his micro management to become unbearable to force you to “quit.” Think about that, why does he force “you” to quit rather than just be a normal boss and fire you.  Well, if you quit you are not entitled to unemployment, and he makes sure to have you sign that you “voluntarily resigned for personal reasons,” he will have the letter drafted for you, you sign and get no copy.   That’s not even where it stops.  Let’s suppose you worked and dedicated years to this clown, and left the company on good terms.  Do you think that will grant you a good spot with Michael, NO!  He is really evil I hate to say.  If any company calls Michael for a reference on your past employment, he will never take the call, they all go to voicemail.  That is how much he hates employees.  Believe me when I say I know, this is all coming from the inside.    Michael is really a disgrace to Arab business owners.  He embodies the worst of all stereotypes.  He is cheap, does not appreciate the work of women or women in general and is a thief.   The only time he fired someone was an overweight women because he found out she had complained about him to others and called him a “megalomaniac.” He truly is a megalomaniac.  He used to call this women a “cow.” I have heard this man refer to black individuals with the Nword, when they come apply, he laughs when they leave and tosses their application in the trash.  When I say this man is cheap, I mean cheap.  When he interviews a new employee, he tries to squeeze them in to the absolute lowest pay they are willing to start at.  Working with other insurance professionals, he tries to squeeze them for their fees and con often paying less than what anyone else pays.  He is really an unintelligent business man, he thinks it is smart to be this way, but all it is doing is destroying his agency and that agency is going down slowly but surely.   Friendly work environment, hardly right!  The company has had many complaints sent to the department of insurance, BBB, Yelp and Yahoo.  Michael does everything he can to rebuttal all and get the truth removed, but a few Yelps reviews have survived and everyone who has worked here and gone (there are many as they have a great deal of turn over) knows the truth.  Tell your story.

In December of 2013, I was setting up bill pay with Wells Fargo when the rep mentioned our payment was going up in 2014, by $50.  She asked if we wanted to write a check or pay each month on our mortage payment which is what we opted to do.  She said this could happen for different reasons and had me think our property taxes increased.  A month or so later, I remember seeing our policy and not thinking, glazed over the homeowners seeing that it went from $1007 to over $1500, over 53%!!  I began investigating and calling my agent, who by the way is terrible at follow through or follow up.  He said 'his appraser,"" what drove by our home which is common practice now due to number of fraud claims in the south with our bad weather, and said our home is not 1200 square foot, but 1800 square feet, a tri-level with fire place.  First of all my home is split level, no basement, no fireplace.  Craig, the agent said you don't live in a 3 story home? No, let me send you the appraisal and we can fix this and move on.  I spent time going back to original title company and they sent the 24 page certified appraisal, veriying our 1200 sq ft home.  He said this is what I need and didn't get back to me for a month.  I reached out this May, expressing my frustation that it's been a month, he apologized and said it was fixed, I was going to receive a $466.00 refund.  First of all, it should have been retroactive and refund should have been over $500, but regardless I waiting for my refund check, never arrived.  Second, I did receive my updated policy and not only did it not go down, it went up another $5.00!!!  It still said $1800 sq feet with fireplace, blah, blah, blah.  Ok - now I'm really beginning to get upset, game on!  I called him again and suggested he look because he did NOT fix the policy, he actually increased it. ....also on a side note, I've been price shopping and have discovered Allstate is charging me an average of 50% higher rates and other carriers. Craig, my agent, says he'll put a call into his appraiser in the morning.  The appraiser disagrees with the 24 page certified appraisale from home sale.  His 'drive by' appraisal skills are far more accurate. At this point, I'm afraid of what I may say to Craig at Allstate and have my husband phone yesterday, 6-11-14.  The agent seems to care less and understand that I, Joe's wife doesn't feel she is getting the service she deserves.  Also, tells my husband, Joe, that 'it's complicated, these things take time...I wish it wasn't taking so long.' (regarding the false addl square footage on my home they are charging me for....6 months so far!) Our agent basically says to let him know when he should 'drop' us.  I have seen this same scam going on with Allstate on ripped off report and I haven't even started scouring the internet for more cases of this fraud....here is my $0.02.  Allstate is looking for a way to increase revenue's to cover the added expense of all the claims over the past couple years.  THey are doing this at the expense of their customers....This is a way to increase their cash flow while they pay out these claims, meanwhile buying time with extra money in their pockets until we figure out what they are doing.  My agent has still not fixed the problem.  He is overcharging me saying my home is bigger than it really is, even with an appraisal.  His appraiser has never stepped foot in my home.  How is this legal?  Thisis wrong and I hope someone will take on a class action lawsuit before Allstate slides it under the rug.

 Insphere / Health Markets ,"  Insphere / Health Markets   Nationwide USA ",http://www.insphereinsurancesolutions.com/, 1 (888) 870-8051,""," What a company Insphere / Healthmarkets is.  I am a former agent and was new to the business in 2008.  Healthmarkets was a very appealing company to work for in the beginning until you open up to find the dirty little details.  Remember ""the devil's in the details"".  Read and understand the contract has been my lesson learned. The offices are clean, the people young and professional and it seemed a great place to start my insurance career.  During my time there I was annually in the top 150 producers nationwide over 3+ years.  Since the cancellation of my contract in 2011 I have received over $59,000 in 1099 income that I have never received as income.  What has prompted this filing on rip-off report is that I just received another $11,000 in 1099's for 2012 when I have not worked for the company since 2011.  There are logistics to understand that ""debt"" is accrued when you work for an agency like Insphere and they don't tell the fresh young faces at Insphere / Healthmarkets that you are contracting with a company that has a borderline criminal approach to doing business.  An agent can make good money working there however you will be in debt the moment you sell a policy.   Insphere is making money hand over fist and at the young brokers expense.  Again it's borderline criminal how they operate.  Furthermore the products they sell are over-priced compared to the market.  Many of which are being sold as bold faced lies to consumers regarding how the coverage works.  Upon finding out that their system is made to make INsphere money and that the products they sell are (forgive me) crap, well that's when I decided to leave and work on my own.  This is being sent out with a lesson learned attitude and with a good bit of contempt for this company.  One would think that 3.5 years after selling my last policy and having made them a ton of money that it would be in the past.  Hear my message and take a lesson that they will screw you over the long run.Their products are not good for clients, their pay structure has nearly burried me financialy. Think twice before doing business with Insphere as an agent and run if one of their agents calls you to sell you a policy. ",  Insurance Agencies

I chose Allstate because that's what the complex recommended. Each year I renewed my lease I paid for insurance. The policy was valid only for terms of the lease, which again, was yearly. However, I would receive nonstop calls and emails from this agency -- The Sarah Nelson Agency in Bedford, TX -- on a weekly basis on all sorts of insurance including Boater's insurance (I live in an apartment)!   In 2014 my lease expired, did not renew, and moved out of the complex from which the policy I had was under. Further, I moved out of town and no longer needed renter's insurance. I notified them of the expiration of my lease, and that I would not need to renew. I was looking over my checking account transactions online one day and I see a charge from Allstate's Sarah Nelson Agency. They autorenewed my policy using my debit card information, without me agreeing to a new policy or signing a contract. They somehow ""forgot"" I moved and informed them I did not need to renew a policy.  I called them up and they were not kind to me, and did not offer any sort of apology. I demanded a refund for the charge for a policy I did NOT agree to or renew. They said they would have it immediately taken care of. After 2 weeks the charge had not yet been reversed. I had to call headquarters and scream at someone. This still did not seem to work, after another attempt and me demanding speaking to a manager I finally was reimbursed for the charges.  Suffice it to say you are NOT in good hands with Allstate; rather, their hands are in your pockets.  ",  Insurance Agencies

I checked and logged on to my acct. to check the reason why and it says that I wasn't enrolled in their program and contact my benefits administrator for more info. I immediatly called my benefits coordinator and says that I was enrolled and contacted them while I was on the other line to confirm that indeed I was enrolled. I explained that if i'm not enrolled in the program, why did i received an e-mail reminder that I need to file before the April 15th and why I can access the page where one can file a claim. It is very weird that I was told that on the phone. I understand WageWorks is outsourcing their customer service line in the Philippines because of cheaper labor. These people are polite and very good at sounding that they what they're talking about but it seems that someone is dictating them or reading their responses. The CS rep that we spoke to confirmed that my claimed will be reviewed again and mentioned that my claim was filed on the 17th of April. I told the rep that I have a proof that all of my claims were filed by the 15th since it was all automatically acknowledged the receipt of documents. I immediatly felt that they're starting to give me the run around. The rep guarantieed that he will review them himself once again and check my e-mail for any developments.  It is now early in the evening and I haven't heard anything form that rep that is supposed to review my claims.

I definitely do not condone his behavior. My firsthand experience with him is that he is very unprofessional, a shyster, and has a history of attempted fraud. I warn you to stay away from this man and his business. Timothy McNeely of McNeely Financial Strategies LLC and representing Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. works in the financial field. He takes your money to invest in stocks, bonds, or insurance deal and makes money off of your money no matter if you win or lose. The kind of guy who makes you sign 22 pages of legal contracts to cover his butt. He hired and keeps trying to defraud LAComputerBuddy which is a small, family owned and operated business that trusts people. We've been that way for ten years. Timothy McNeely contacted LAComputerBuddy to solve voice quality and drop out problems with his VOIP phone system.  We discussed the problem and joked around in email and telephone discussions. We sold Mr. McNeely a $1600 router below our cost, gave him a $600 discount. On top of that we charged half the normal rate of network VOIP technician work. We configured it and installed it on his network as planned. We talked about implementation. We explained it to office staff in layman's terms. We tested it afterward. Upon completion his father, Fred McNeely, INSTANTLY commented on the improved clarity of the phone, concept proven and job well done. When we finished the work and looked for payment, we found out that Timothy McNeely had left the state that day for two weeks without ever telling us. The same day that he had set the schedule for us to do the work. We updated him to the job status and sent him an invoice that clearly said the billing terms were ""Due upon receipt."" Keep in mind, we are overly trusting people and left the expensive equipment there and had done hours of work for him...and he left no compensation. We never asked for a contract or signature. Mr. McNeely sent a partial payment to us via PayPal. We refunded his money and told him that a company check would be fine to save on the PayPal processing fees. Mr. NcNeely then proceeded to send a scathing email. His tone and words hit us from left field. We had done everything he asked, accomplished all goals, and his office was clearly in a better technological state then it was before our work, yet he seemed to want to make an issue out of nothing. We offered to stop by the office to pick up the equipment and zero out his balance, owing us nothing. Mr. NcNeely threatened us with the police! He then bought a discount coupon from Yelp!, which clearly states ""not valid with any other promotional offer,"" and in spite of his $600 discount and incredibly competitive labor rates, demanded we accept it. This is after the work was done and balance past due! We told him we would gladly honor it for any future work. Mr. McNeely then proceeded to make full payment via PayPal. He then went onto any social media outlet he could find to fabricate fictional reviews. He saw we received an accommodation from Thumbtack.com as being ranked in the Top 3 among IT professionals in L.A. He then created an account on Thumbtack.com to write another bad review without ever using Thumbtack.com's service. We believe that Mr. NcNeely saw an opportunity to deceitfully take advantage of the non-contract business situation. Mr. McNeely attempted to ""stick-it to us"" by fraudulently requesting a refund via PayPal using buyer's protection stating that he never received the product and services. Good thing we had taken a picture of the equipment installed at his office and PayPal denied his fraud attempt. Let this serve as a public service announcement to all small business owners and independent contractors: AVOID Timothy James McNeely of McNeely Financial Strategies. He's a shyster, a fraud, a troublemaker, an evil opportunist. Don't do business with him unless you want a headache. You have been warned. ",  Insurance Agencies

Well, the arm that spins inside the dishwasher fell off. So I called Home Depot who gave me two choices of companies I had never heard of before to fix the part. I chose A&E by pure dumb luck. I got a call from A&E saying I needed to be home during a 4 hour period. I called them back and asked for a more definite time the day they were to come out (more on there ""coming out"" later). They did narrow it down to two hours and said a guy would call me half an hour before coming out. I was running errands when the guy called to say ""I'll be there in half an hour."" So I rushed home to wait for him. After more than half an hour I get a call from a different guy who says the case was assigned to him now (huh?!) and that he doesn't need to come out since he knows what part needs to be ordered (yeah, more on that one later too). I thank him so much for making me go home for nothing. HELLO YOU IDIOTS. MY TIME IS JUST AS PRECIOUS AS YOURS!! He says he'll order the parts and someone will be out in a week to install the part. Okay, deep breath. Stay focused. Could get better from here. Only it doesn't. So today the technician comes out to put the part in. Oh, of course I had to be home today too. I asked again for a 30 minute ""before you get here"" call. This dude calls me TEN minutes before he gets here. He then tells me that the first guy from an entire week ago, ordered the wrong part. I am not particularly thrilled with this company by then and tell him so. ""Oh I'm so sorry ma'am."" ""Don't worry, I'll help you out."" Those are just two of the myriad of phrases this guy could have said. Instead he says.....nothing. Clearly he has no interest whatsoever in me being told to wait for a technician that never shows up or for having the wrong part delivered or for having to wait a week for ...oh yeah, nothing. He doesn't give a crap at all. Not one bit. He says he will oder the correct part but that it will take at least TWO WEEKS. OMG are you friggin' kidding me?!! By this time I have had more than my fair share of this moronic company so I decide to call the 800-905-9505 number to tell them that my very first experience with their company has been a disaster.

Me: ""What? it has to be what YOU think is a good reason for me to speak with a manager?"" Them: ""Yes."" Wow, great customer service. Not. I finally speak with a ""case manager"" in the US who says she will file a complaint with their company (really? Ooh, I wonder what will happen. I'm guessing nothing) and suggests I call Home Depot back since I have an extended warranty. Done and did. Getting someone else to come out.  First impressions count A&E aka Sears.

I signed up for this company's lead program after receiving advertisement and talking with their head scamster, Michael Carter in March, 2013.  I know, I know....very stupid and naive....but I bought into their guarantee program.  I am no newbie to the industry, and I should have just realized that it was too good to be true. Michael said all the right things and answered my questions....little did I know that he was outright lying to me the entire time. I paid my $1,500 to get started with the low-end lead service.  Within a couple of months I started to notice problems with their services.  It took over a month to get even my first lead.  And then when I started calling them (1 to 2 per week), I found consistent problems, as others have noted in their complaints about this company: Out of about 13 leads received, NONE of the prospects had a clue why I was calling and had no recollection of talking to anyone from First Annuity Source.  It was almost as if they simply picked random names out of a phone book. They claim in their advertising and in discussions with Michael Carter that they record every conversation with every lead.  I never heard a single recorded conversation with the leads I received.  When I questions Michael Carter about it, he said the they couldn't record calls from their cell phones, and often made calls this way without recording.  He said they would start to record them but it never happened. They promise a money-back refund in their agreements.  I finally became fed up with their scamming and called for my refund.  I was told that they would look into it but never got any return phone calls after that time, despite calling and leaving messages dozens of times. I'm looking into reporting them with other reporting and State agencies for fraudulent activities.  They're not even registered with the California State office, so I'm suspecting that they're operating outside the U.S.  If I were a litigation attorney, I'd be all over this one for a class action law suit.  It could be easy money if the owners are in the U.S. and there are certainly no shortage of unhappy customers.  Any attorneys interested should contact me for more details.

They stated they had requested it but that the deputy never filed the report - so I called - the deputy had filed the report. Lies by USAA. Then they kept stating they just hadn't received the report. Then they stated they needed a receipt for the AC unit - A receipt - an AC unit came with the house when we bougt it - Duh - Really ? We had actually had to buy an AC just a couple years prior - so we provided a receipt. STILL no payment. Then I called Jamie Parries alleged boss (the adjuster) . I say alleged because Jamie arries denies that Karen Cocia is her boss.  Her boss apologizes profusely and states she will take care of the situation. I fax them estimates on replacing the AC unit - Jamie Parries pays me for a lower grade AC than the one we had lost and the estimates provided on the paperwork. I called an attorney -the attorney stated USAA was also liable for our lost mortgage monies for the months the home was nonlivable. I am a nursing student and the home is on the other side of the stte which added to the problem since I couldn't verify things that Jamie Parries stated - whichall turned out to be lies. Jamie Parries agreed they were responsible for the lost morgage monies and called meand stated such and that she would provide me a check only if I had a copy of my rcent lease to tenants ? Why wouldn't my mortgage bill be sufficient ? RIGHT ? So - she sends me a check for one hundred dollars over the cost of one month's mortgage which she states is one months rent at current rental value. I was supposed to get a check for $3,675 and she sent me a check for $1,350. I googe search this chich to see if she is a public adjuster - she was listed as an adjuster in Tampa with the address and everything. I call her and leave a scathing message because we are literally in financial ruins because of this wretched lying person and her thieving tactics. So what does USAA do? Cory B Nelson, their head of security sends me a threatening letter that I threatened their employee. Ummmm I threatened to sue her and notified her that I reported her and her license to the state for review. I didn't threaten her knee caps. So in his lettr he states that I am now no longer allowed togo to any USAA locations? I have been stationed on several military bases and never see one. Why ? Because USAA doesn't give a flying crap bout military families and veterans. So, I look up Cory B Nelson AKA the Henchman - he was the head of Chicago FBI for 7 whole months. Real classy USAA - forcing families to lose their homes, their investments and hey if thy don't agree with getting kicked in the face then you can sick a washed up FBI agent who couldn't make it in the ranks on them since he has some pent up anger he'd like to unleash on people who are already suffering - Like me - a nursing student with an autistic child and an injured war vet husband.   ",  Insurance Agencies

Her last email to me was ""I will get this sent to the company and we will see what it saves you. Let's give it a few weeks and then we can follow-up, but you will be getting a new declaration page in the mail as well."" I was waiting for this declaration page to come in the mail and never received it.  When I followed up with Alexis, I find out that I had been dropped by the carrier.  I was NOT even notified of this by Smith Ins Group.  It was my follow-up that spurred them to look into it.  Meanwhile, I was without insurance for the month of Sept - Hurricane Season in Florida!! I was first surprised at their response, which was blaming the carrier (St Johns) and I let them know that was not my concern - Smith is my agent and they should be on top of this, especially communicating back to me.  She then dusted that over by quickly getting me into another company who offered me a good rate, but appeared to be a bait and switch because the long and short of it - I was now paying about $1,000 MORE after replacing my old roof... Lastly, I went back to Alexis (to offer a chance for retribution) and find out why the amount was so much higher now, as this was nowhere close to the quotes she provided originally and she said they were the best she could do.  I let her know this was unacceptable, especially since the reason (I felt) the insurance was so much higher was because I had a lapse in coverage.  She again refused to take responsibility and even stated ""they are not babysitters""... I would highly recommend anyone looking for a Home Owners Insurance Agency to NOT use Smith Insurance Group unless you are looking for problems and poor service.  Not only are they not ""babysitters"" - but they don’t do their jobs!

At the beginning, The LIT requested a ridiculous amount of documents that other life insurance companies do not require; gathering these took a long time. Once those documents were submitted, The LITs representatives stated that all of those documents would suffice, then waited until December to tell us they would not. The LIT then requested documents that were already provided; claimed documents hadn't been sent that had; after said documents were resent, claimed that they did actually have them after all; mailed requests for documents to the Veterans Administration Hospital without indicating to which departments attention they need to go to (thereby ensuring the request was lost); refused to pick up a phone to make document requests; defer everything to Cigna saying that Cigna makes the benefit payments although the insurance policy is with The LIT & not Cigna.

INTREGITY AND HONESTY OF THIS COMPANY WOULD BE FOR THEM TO ALLOW FOR YOU TO SEE WHAT CONTRACT YOUR SIGNING, OR AT THE VERY LEAST SEND YOU A COPY ONCE YOU HAVE SUBMITTED MINIMAL INFORMATION, BUT ENOUGH INFORMATION IN ALLOWING THEM TO ATTACH YOUR SIGNATURE TO PAPERWORK YOU HAVE YET SEEN.  VERY SCARY!!!!  AND SHOULD BE A PRACTICE NOT ALLOWED IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS, AND SOMETHING THAT I AM GOING TO BE GOING TO THE INSURANCE BOARD ON TO HAVE CHANGED.  OUR BUSINESS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH GREAT PRIDE, AND INTREGITY, AND IF THE COMPANY YOUR REPRESENTING ISNT BEING UPFRONT AND HONEST WITH YOU ON HOW THEY OPERATE, THEN YOU NEED TO REALLY LOOK DEEPER INTO YOUR DECISION OF COMING ONBOARD WITH THIS COMPANY.  I WAS FLAT OUT LIED TO ABOUT NAA BEING A CAPTIVE IMO, AND AS I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER TO NOT TRUST WHAT ANYONE TELLS YOU, THE PROOF IS IN THE CONTRACT, BUT AS MOST PEOPLE TEND TO BE TRUSTING OF OTHERS, YOU BELEIVE WHAT YOUR TOLD, SORRY, BUT TODAYS WORLD IS FULL OF GREED, GREED, AND MORE GREED, AND PEOPLE ARE JUST OUT FOR THEMSELVES, SO IN THIS BUSINESS YOU WILL FIND IT IN MANY COMPANIES, AND ITS WITH THE ONES THAT DONT WANT TO LET YOU OUT OF A CONTRACT IF THAT TIME CAME THAT YOU WANTED TO MOVE ON AND PART WAYS.  THERE ARE MANY GREAT COMPANIES THAT WILL GIVE YOU ACCESS TO ALL MAJOR CARRIERS WTIH NO STRINGS ATTACHED, DO YOUR RESEARCH, I CAN SUGGEST A FEW IF YOU EMAIL ME, WHICH I DONT BENEFIT FROM, BUT MY WAY OF HELPING NEW AGENTS MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION WITH ALL THE INFORMATION THAT IS THE TRUTH. NAAA DOES STATE THAT THEY WILL PROVIDE YOU A COPY OF THE CONTRACT EITHER BY EMAIL, MAIL, OR ON A WEBSITE.  BUT YOU WOULD NOT KNOW THIS UNTIL  YOU FIND YOUR CONTRACT ON THE WEBSITE, AND THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY ISSUES WITH THIS PROCESS IF YOU WERE TO KNOW THIS WHEN YOUR SIGNING UP BY STATING YOU WILL FIND A COPY OF YOUR CONTRACT ON THE NAALEADS.COM WEBSITER, UNDER MY CONTRACTS, THEY DONT GIVE YOU THAT INFORMATION, SO WHEN YOUR NEW, THE NAA WEBSITE IS SO OVERWHELMING, THE STAFF SIDETRACKS YOU WTIH MANY OTHER THINGS, THAT I WOULD GATHER MANY PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SEEN THE CONTRACT.  OH, AND IN THE CONTRACT, IT DOES STATE THAT IF YOU DONT RESPOND THEN YOU ACCEPT THIS CONTRACT.  SO, IN THIS BUSINESS THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT SHOULD NOT ALLOW FOR ANY IMO, GA, OR INSURANCE COMPANY TO HAVE AGENTS PUT A SIGNATURE TO SOMETHING THAT THEY DID NOT PERSONALLY READ.  IT IS WRONG ON MANY LEVELS, AND SHOULD BE PROHIBITED.  SO AGAIN, CHANGES NEED TO TAKE PLACE IN OUR INDUSTRY, AND I AM LUCKY TO HAVE CONNECTIONS THAT WILL HELP WITH THIS AND SAVE NEW AND SEASONED AGENTS FROM BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS PRACTICE. NAA HAS DONE SOME GREAT THINGS FOR NEW AGENTS, AND THEY HAVE A GREAT PLATFORM OF MANY THINGS IN PLACE THAT CAN HELP WITH A NEW AGENT, BUT IS IT WORTH THE RISK OF WHAT LIES AHEAD IN THE FUTURE, BECAUSE IN THE END, THE GAME DOES END IF YOUR NOT WORKING AND PROMOTING ETHICS, AND HONESTY WITH CLIENTS OR AGENTS. AS A SEASONED AGENT, THE MOST DISTURBING PART I FIND IS THAT MANY AGENTS ARE PUTTING PEOPLE IN POLICIES THAT ARE NOT THE BEST BECAUSE OF THE QUICK UNDERWRITING TIMES THAT SOME INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE WITH LESS HEALTH QUESTIONS, WHICH MAKES A POLICY HIGHER, SO THEREFORE THIS IS WHERE INTREGITY COMES IN, AS A INSURANCE AGENT, IT IS OUR DUTY TO OUR CLIENTS TO PUT THEM IN THE RIGHT POLICIES IN REGARDS TO THEIR HEALTH.  THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY ENCOURAGE, OR TEACH, AND SO YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE THAT IS IT WORTH YOUR REPUTATION OF TAKING THE ROAD OF LEAST RESISTANCE FOR THE QUICK BUCK, OR TAKING THE TIME TO PUT YOUR CLIENT IN THE BEST POLICY REGARDLESS IF IT TAKES A FEW WEEKS LONGER, OR ASKING YOUR CLIENT A FEW MORE QUESTIONS ON THEIR HEALTH. BECAUSE IT WILL BE ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE ANOTHER AGENT THAT DOES COME IN  BEHIND YOU, SEES THAT YOUR CLIENT COULD HAVE PAID LESS DUE TO ANOTHER COMPANY, AND YOUR CREDABILITY AS AN AGENT WILL START TO COME TO LIGHT. THIS HAPPENS WITH EVERY COMPANY AND WHY INSURANCE AGENTS GET A BAD REPUTATION....IF YOU WANT TO READ A COPY OF AN AGENT THAT WAS OR MAYBE STILL WITH NAA YOU CAN SEE THE TACTICS USED TO SELL INSURANCE, AND MAKE A DECISION ON HOW THAT APPROACH CAN EFFECT YOUR LICENSE, BECAUSE IN THE END, IT ONLY TAKES ONE PISSED OFF CLIENT TO EXPOSE THE 10 PREVIOUS OTHERS...AS THIS HAPPENS EVERYWHERE, THIS IS JUST ONE CASE THAT PERTAINS TO NAA, AND SOME OF THE SALES TECHNIQUES THAT I HAVE HEARD USED FROM NAA LEADERS, SO AGAIN, YOUR CHOICE TO MAKE...STATE OF NEW HAMPHIRE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT, UNDER LEGAL NEWS ON HOME PAGE---DOCKET NUMBER: INS NO. 12-008-EP  MICHAEL S BETTENCOURT, THIS IS PUBLIC INFORMATION, AND SOMETHING THAT COMES UP WHEN YOU GOOGLE NAA AND LEGAL ISSUES, YOU JUST NEED TO GO AND SEE THE FINAL OUTCOME OF WHAT HIS SALES TACTICS AND APPROACH COST HIM, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS BEHAVIOR IS SOMETHING THAT IS A DISGRACE TO OUR BUSINESS.... I HAVE READ THE MANY REPORTS FROM AGENTS, AND AS I CAN AGREE WITH MANY OF THE THINGS SAID, I BELEIVE THAT THERE ARE GREAT PEOPLE IN THIS COMPANY TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING, AND THERE IS ALWAYS GOOD AND BAD IN ANYTHING, ITS UP TO US AS PEOPLE TO DECIDE WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE..... I WAS LUCKY TO FIGURE IT ALL OUT BEFORE I GOT STARTED, BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE I HAD THE BACKGROUND TO RAISE EYEBROWS AND QUESTIONS ON A FEW THINGS THAT DIDNT SEEM RIGHT, SO WHEN THOSE QUESTIONS WERE LEFT TO BE IGNORED AND DOWNPLAYED, OR ONE COMPLAINT SAID IT PERFECTLY, ANDY IS AVAILABLE FOR ANYONE THAT IS OF USE TO HIM, IT WAS NOT MY EXPERIENCE, BUT MY SHORT EXPERIENCE WITH HIM WAS ONE THAT HIS EGO IS LARGE, HE IS DRIVEN BY MONEY, AND THE PEOPLE THEY TARGOT ARE THE ONES THAT ARE DOWN AND OUT AND WANT A BETTER LIFE, AND ANDY ALBRIGHT IS NOT AFRAID TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH MONEY AND POWER HE HAS, THE BEAUTY OF THIS IS BECAUSE OF ALL THE HARD WORK AGENTS DO, WHILE A NEW AGENT IS OUT HUMPING THEIR ASS AND PAYING FOR LEADS, AN AGENT IS GETTING 55 %, MR. ANDY ALBRIGHT IS GETTING AN ADDITIONAL 80 UP TO 110 PERCENT ON THAT AGENT, YES, HE SHOULD HAVE TONS OF MONEY, AND I AM SURE HE IS SWIMMING IN IT BECAUSE THIS PAST CONFERENCE THAT I ATTENDED, NOTHING WAS FREE, NOT COFFEE, NOT SODAS, AND DINNERS WERE AN ADDITIONAL 300 PLUS, AND THEY EVEN CHARGED  YOU FOR THEIR LEAD CERTIFICATION THAT THEY REQIRE YOU TO TAKE TO BUY LEADS, SO, ANDY ALBRIGHT IS NOT A WINNER IN MY BOOK, HE IS AN OPORTUNIST THAT IS PREYING ON THE NAIVE PEOPLE.  OH, AND I WILL CLOSE THIS WITH, IF YOUR A CHRISTIAN, YOUR GOING TO THINK GOD LED YOU TO THE PROMISED LAND, BECAUSE THIS CONFERENCE STARTS OUT WITH THE PLEDGE OF ALLIGIANCE, SINGING OF THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, AND THEN BRINGING IN A VERY INSPIRATIONAL CHRISTIAN FAMILY THAT PROMOTES NAA, THE GOADS, SO IT CAN BE QUITE OVERWHELMING WHEN YOUR A CHRISTIAN BELIEVER.   SO MY CLOSING WORDS IS THAT I HOPE ONE DAY THAT NAA OPENS THEIR EYES TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE MAKING A GREAT LIVING OFF MANY HARD WORKING PEOPLE, THEY COULD DO THE RIGHT THING BY BEING TRANSPARENT ON HOW THE COMPANY IS REALLY RUN WITH THEIR CONTRACTS, HAVE A CONTRACT THAT IS INDICATIVE OF WHAT YOUR SALES PEOPLE IN THE HOME OFFICE TELL THE AGENTS THAT ARE WANTING TO JOIN THE GROUP, THAT YOUR A CAPTIVE AGENT, THAT THE CONTRACT DOES NOT STAND BEHIND OR EVEN MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT GETTING OVERRIDES ON ANY AGENT, SO IT WILL BE AT NAA DESCRECTION ON IF THEY DO PAY, WHICH READING THE RIPOFF REPORTS, OBVIOUSLY MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BURNED....SO BEWARE AS YOUR ENTER INTO THIS BUSINESS WITH ANY COMPANY, AND NAA.   ",  Insurance Agencies

Many of you know the quote like a good neighbor state farm is there. But I would like to say they are not there also they are not there with good customer service skills neither. Well let me get down to it, I was with state farm only 3 months and withing those three months it was terrible you would think they would treat u good in the begining so u would stay their trusted customer but NO. The first time I went there it was good and I got a quote and it was okay not the best but it was okay. They quoted me 120.00 for car insurance liability only (yea I know high for liability) But only had license a few months and I was only 20. So also those 3 months I never recived a bil or insurance card in the mail. Good thing I had my bill automatically taken out of bank. Well later on in the 3rd month I was going through my bank statments scanning through looking to see if everything was normal. Well I see this amount of 157.00 for state farm insurance so I'm lik -__- ???what??? So I call them to try to figure out if it was an accident or what was going on. They told me they really didn't know and that they were sorry the most they can do is give me a refund and ill have no insurance until I find another or keep the insurance and use what I was going to spend that next month and get insurance. NO I wanted my money back because 1 u overcharged me and didn't let me know that my payment was changing 2 I don't have money to be paying extra for somthing that could be way lower . So they told me they would refund my money and I was cool after that. Okay so after that about a week and 2 days later I get my check in the mail about to go put gas in my car when I opened all it ssaid was 98.00 and I got mad all over again. I called them and they once again stated they didn't know but I would have to pay from my bill due date till the canclelation date..which was sept 28 to oct 8th . So are you telling me if I would have never got notified about being charged 157.00 and I wouldn't have found out till 2 months later wheni got my statement in the mail like normally. Your telling me that if I would have never viewed my statement online and would have waited longer u would not refund me the money that was never notified to me that was being taken out . Or atleast only make me pay what I was supposed to what I had knowledge of in the first place. If I would have knew they were charging 157.00 I wouldn't have went there...... ",  Insurance Agencies

All I was asking was how this liability insurance worked, what it covered etc. He turned the whole thing around on me and started attacking me about why I was asking such questions. He then refused to offer me insurance after that. I have dealt with many insurance companies in my life and all will explain how the system works. If I call AAA, they would be glad to explain what my home owners insurance covers. This guy refused to. Be careful! This is hands down the shadiest company I have dealt with in a while.

I was stupid enough to buy into Robert Taylor BS. The promise is to provide agents with free leads and contracts to write business with Mutual of Omaha and american National. Then when you make your first 5 sales you get back your one time fee of $500. That is what most companies charge just for leads and you dont get your money back. So I thought is was a good deal.. All I got was a $500 charge on my credit card and a bunch of videos that one can get striaght from the carriers.  They call it there training.  Then Mr Robert Taylor disappeared. He does not return my calls. Just how am I supost I called the phone numbers on the website for Avian Life Brokerage and no return call. I even called the phone number that charged my credit card (949-230-7898) and no answer and still waiting for a phone call. I called the carrier that I was suppose to be contracted with and they have no clue who these folks are and told me I was not contracted. Also I talked to Surancebay.

The leads were supposed to come from people getting mortgages and needing insurance and would be prequalified, with customers setting the time for me to call them. They sent some leads and I tried contacting the customers. Of the first six leads no one was aware of why I was calling them and had not talked to anyone about getting any type of insurance. I sent them in for credit and complained that these people were not expecting my call as promised. After the first six leads they did even bother sending any more leads at all.

Nothing unusual. We spent some considerable amount of time researching insurance markets for a competitive rate; it was a challenging and time consuming process due to his bad credit and NO PRIOR insurance. When we were ready to bind his coverage, he told us that he would be back in the morning with the cash. Never came back. Nothing unusual again. But, in this case we were dealing with not your usual ""real"" person. Almost at the beginning of our conversation, it was a suspicion that the man could be just a “wanna be”, but we, sales people, all would like to believe that we are dealing with a real buyer when we are facing a potential client. After telling us his life story about his various successful business ventures and him being a regarded Vietnam veteran, he mentioned that he had a contract on a $10,000,000 mansion, provided its address, realtor's name, and property information.  A call came in on his cell phone during our conversation, and we could hear him discussing $300,000 kitchen cabinets with a sales girl. It sounded as if she had already spent a considerable time with him trying to finalize the deal; the suspicion lifted a bit. We deal with high net worth clients, so it is not unusual for us to have affluent prospects walking in the door, and a great deal of them are eccentrics. The huge red flag came on when he threw a name of a yacht owner and his specific yacht he was contemplating to purchase (we happen to know both). The yacht was with $60,000,000 price tag. At that point, I knew for sure we had wasted our valuable business time and there was a fraud in front of us. I googled his name right away after he left our office and found a long list of warnings about this individual. He likes to go to auto dealerships, yacht brokerages, insurance agencies, real estate offices, and rob working people of their valuable business time and resources.

 Allstate Insurance ,"  Allstate Insurance  20600 Telegraph Road, Suite 2160 Bingham Farms, Michigan USA ","", 248-644-8904,""," To whom it may concern, The purpose of this letter is to document the events which occurred on 08/30/2013 in the Alvin Bates, Jr. Allstate Insurance Agency. After greeting my client, and seating him in the conference room, I was on my way to get him some water, when my co-worker, Tammie Todd, told me that there was someone on the phone, and I needed to take a payment. Now, Ms. Todd was very aware that I had a client in the office, so I told her that I was in a meeting, and she needed to take the payment herself. Ms. Todd replied, ""Oh, you ain't shit nigga!"" I said, ""excuse me? She said, ""you heard me nigga, you ain't shit!"" At first I tried to walk away and continue my task of obtaining the water for my client. However, Ms. Todd, then stated, ""you ain't nothing but a boy!"" At that point, I stopped and said, ""I am not a nigga, or a boy. I am a man!"" Ms. Todd continued to call me a boy several more times; yet, during our verbal confrontation, I never disrespected her; nor, called her out of her name. I had never been so embarrassed, ashamed, nor angry, in my life. I'm still upset, hurt, as well as in disbelief, even more now than when it was occurring. The more I think about it the angrier I get at how I was the victim and was victimized again by the threat of losing my job for something, in which, I did not initiate. I was just trying to do my job. At this point, Mr. Bates, Jr. comes out of his office, gets in my face, and tells me to be quite and shut up. Meanwhile, my client is sitting in the conference room listening to everything which was transpiring. Later, Mr. Bates called me into his office defending Tammie Todd. I was in disbelief! Mr. Bates kept telling me to be quite, and would not listen to neither my, nor the clients, explanation of the events. Instead, I was sent home and was told he would decide whether, or not, I would have a job, with his agency, after the holiday. Nonetheless, unfortunately, this was not the first incident which I had had with this individual and the situations just continued to escalate; even though, I immediately notified Mr. Bates of my concerns. Therefore, I wish to file a formal complaint of reverse sexual discrimination on the grounds of the derogatory statements Ms. Todd. For instance, the word nigga, at least to myself, is very hurtful, and one of the worst things which anyone could call an African American. Also, the word boy was commonly used, in the south, as another derogatory word to belittle black men. Just as I told Ms. Todd, as well as Mr. Bates, I am forty four years and I am not nobody's boy. Not to mention, I'm definitely not anyone's nigger neither. Thank you four your time, consideration, and assistance into this matter. Best regards,  ",  Insurance Agencies

When We finally settled on a new insurance company, we informed Bill's office that we were dropping them, for both home and auto, and provided them with the date that coverage was to stop.  It was Bill's son, who also works in the office as an agent, that handled the cancelling of our policies. Much to our surpise, Bill Duarte, Allstate Agent, did not cancel any of our policies.  One week after cancelling, Allstate withdrew the money out of our escrow account for home insurance and then debited our account for auto.  While Bill Duarte did mail us back a check for the homeowners insurance, he is refusing to refund us the money for auto insurance.  He has decided to pass the buck onto Allstate and place blame with them.  Instead of acting as an agent he has decided to not correct his mistake and keep his portion of the money that his office recieves as an agent.  Unauthorized debit of someone's account is theft.  He has taken no responsibility for the gross negligence that his office is guilty of.  It's been almost a month since we cancelled our policies with Allstate through his office.  To date, he has made no action to correct this problem other then pass the buck to Allstate's hands.   ",  Insurance Agencies

Box 2162 Yakima, WA 98901 718 733 4662 509 424 3037 aampubjusccsc@gmx.us     DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES INAND FOR THE DISTRICT OF MISSOURI Wayne R. E. Rudder Plaintiffs V DSHS ANPAC Insurance Company. Does, 1 through 10Case:COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES FOR: BAD FAITH, FRAUD, THEFT BY DECEPTION, DISCRIMINATION, BREACH OF CONTRACT For:  95,000.  Jury Trial Demanded       This is a complaint for damages against ANPAC Insurance Company.   Plaintiffs state for cause of action as follows:  Plaintiff Wayne Rudder (""Rudder"") is a competent adult residing in Yakima County  Defendant ANPAC Insurance Company is a heartless corporation, a den of thieves and a gang of racketeers doing substantial business and holding itself out as an insurance company in Yakima County, and licensed to do business in the State of Washington and elsewhere.  The true names and capacities of those defendants sued herein as Does 1 through 10 are unknown to Plaintiffs, except for these defendants aided and abetted Farmers in the wrongful acts and omissions set forth herein. Plaintiffs shall seek leave to amend this complaint to allege additional information and the identities of Does 1 through ten when these become known.  At all times relevant herein, each Defendant was the agent and employee of every other defendant and performed acts and omissions complained of herein in the course and scope of such agency and employment.  At all times relevant hereto, Plaintiff resided in a home he owns under a complicated set of unrelated facts where the home is titled to Antonia Garcia and Francisco Moreno , a home and real property known as 231 Windy Ridge Lane in Moxee, Washington, County of Yakima.  Relying, to their detriment, upon widely publicized but generally false representations by Defendant ANPAC to be ""fast, fair and friendly"", Plaintiffs purchased a policy of insurance from ANPAC which, among other things, promised to indemnify Plaintiff in the event their property in Moxee was burglarized.   At all times relevant herein, Plaintiff made all payments due under the policy, no matter how extortionate those payments may have been, and no matter how fraudulent the underlying promises of Defendant has been.  Plaintiff did at all times reside at their property in Moxee at the residence purportedly insured by the Defendant.  On the date of July of 2011 Plaintiff hired John Hale to complete repairs to damage caused by a fire to the home in January of the same year.  Hale was the fourth contractor to work on the home as the previous contractors had been unsatisfactory.  Hale demanded 900 to complete the work. However, when the Plaintiff had paid 1,900 to Hale in addition to some 800 in food, beer, cigarettes and other items, Hale then demanded more money from the Plaintiff in the form of A. 350  to pay for a purported ticket, and 450 to pay for a purported towing of a motor vehicle owned by Hale. Plaintiff balked at paying any more money until all the repairs were completed. This caused Hale to then engage in a two week sick out and then to stop work altogether on the premises. The relationship between Hale and Plaintiff grew caustic and uncommunicative. Plaintiff, because he feared that his long office hours would enable Hale to wreak vengeance on the property, spoke to Dan Williams, an agent for ANPAC who was his neighbor at his office location. Dan invited the Plaintiff to file for insurance and Plaintiff did purchase insurance to indemnify any loses at the home.  On or about October 12, 2011 the Plaintiff returned home to find that a brand new receiver purchased from Best Buy, still in the box, was taken by someone.  Plaintiff did not report that theft, but did foray into the stores to purchase a replacement.  On the date of October 25, 2011 the Plaintiff arrived home to find that the window leading from the exterior spa had been broken and the entry allowed entry to the house through the bathroom window. The following items, nonexclusive, were taken, television, computers, computer items, CD players, and many other items were taken from the residence. On this occasion the Plaintiff did make a claim with ANPAC and did urge to ANPAC that his items were stolen. The Plaintiff, an Immigration Specialist in Yakima, did detail one of his four secretaries to make a claim to ANPAC. The secretary did make the claim and did inform ANPAC of the loss.  The Secretary utilized a general list of items that were in the house that were missing and included a counter top stove which had not actually been stolen but which had been in the back of the Plaintiff’s Expedition and later placed in the office of the Plaintiff for sale due to the fact that it utilized gas and the Plaintiff had no gas outlets and the Plaintiff had purchased a stove from Home Depot.  A few weeks later the Plaintiff was again robbed and his work clothing taken, televisions, laptop and other items. These had been primarily the replacement items for the items that had been stolen. Plaintiff believed that both items had been done by John Hale who lived on a neighbor’s property with his family in a Fifth Wheel. On all occasions the Plaintiff reported the theft to the police and again proceeded to file a claim with ANPAC.  Finally, a little while later Plaintiff’s entirety of belongings were taken, clothing, jewelry, the stereo, and many other items were removed from the house.  Plaintiff filed another claim with ANPAC.  Plaintiff learned that his office was also being targeted and he could not be in two places at once. His home is located outside of Moxee, about seven miles outside of Moxee and it would take the police some 20 minutes to get to the house which, within that time, the entire house could be moved. Since all items had been stolen and only the beds and the stoves remained in the house, the Plaintiff began to spend most time at his office where he could also sleep and cook and bathe.  To allow the office to be robbed the way his home was would be absolutely detrimental to the Plaintiff’s clients. The Plaintiff reported all the thefts to the Sheriff Department in Yakima.  The Plaintiff had, at the time, some 580 clients for his immigration services and that had a higher priority rather than remaining at home to protect his meager belongings.    On or about the date of June 12, 2009 Plaintiffs Garcia and Moreno granted verbal Power of Attorney to Rudder and solidified the verbal Power of Attorney by assigning a written and certified Power of Attorney to Rudder in June of 2010. This Power of Attorney essentially transferred all interest in the house to the Plaintiff.  This Power of Attorney, for valuable consideration, granted Rudder the exclusive right and authority to, in addition to other responsibilities,  submit claims regarding the 231 Windy Ridge Property, to file insurance claims and litigate insurance and other claims regarding the property, and to tend to Garcia and Moreno's interests in the United States extending such to include the power to act as attorney in fact in dealings with third parties in relation to the particulars of Garcia and Moreno.  The Power of Attorney included the transfer of the furnished property to Rudder upon his determination.  Previous to the incidents related to this suit, the home had been burglarized by persons unknown.   At the time of Garcia and Moreno's being taken into detention, and before their ultimate deportation, , federal immigration agents seized and confiscated certain items of personal property belonging to Garcia and Moreno. The Agents provided a receipt for this property to Garcia and Moreno.    When Moreno and Garcia were taken into custody by the Immigration Agency, the house remained vacant with all of their personal property intact.  About two weeks after their detention the house was burglarized by parties unknown. The police were called by neighbors on several occasions as persons were seen leaving the property with items belonging to the house.   On or about May 12, 2009 the son of Francisco and Antonia and the daughter of Francisco and Antonia visited the house and had found the house to have been burglarized. Because they were undocumented aliens and due to the confinement of the mother and father no action was taken at that time. When Francisco and Antonia were sent to Mexico, it was without any sort of documentation which would allow them to make contact with Farmers Insurance and they did not know the depth of the loss.   The house remained vacant from April 29, 2009 through June 10, 2010 when Plaintiff arrived at the house and found the house to be completely vacant with all personal belongings of Francisco Moreno and Antonia Garcia having been burglarized during that time.    On or about July 4,, 2010 Mr. Rudder, upon locating the insurance information relevant to the Defendant, and consistent with his duties, contacted Farmers and made a claim in the name and person of Antonia Garcia and Francisco Moreno.  The value of the loss was about 119,980.  This is mentioned to provide the basis for finding that the house had long been targeted for burglaries and thefts due to its remote nature where it would take the police some 45 minutes to respond to any situation whatsoever.   Plaintiff believed that the ANPAC Insurance Agency would be reputable in their dealings with him.  However, this was not so. The company balked at the claims and began to make extraordinary demands upon the Plaintiff. The Company unreasonably sought items such as specific receipts for the property lost and when the receipts were provided from Best Buy, Best Buy included a page of someone else’s account based upon the fact that the person had once had the Plaintiff’s telephone number when he moved to Yakima. The records at Best Buy are kept primarily by telephone numbers, it appears.  Plaintiff provided a completed Proof of Loss to ANPAC where every page was certified and notarized. On one of the pages Plaintiff’s secretary listed a stove which had not been stolen and which was in the office of the Plaintiff since it had been damaged in transportation and needed to be taken to the Post Office.  ANPAC began to engage in delay. For several months they did nothing at all to award the Plaintiff money for the damages done to his property when their policy stated clearly that they would do so. They assigned the claims to Eric Z. Cannon, a lawyer in Seattle, Washington.  The lawyer then began to make unreasonable demands of the Plaintiff  where many of the items sought were attainable by the counsel himself from public sources including the following:   In a follow up to your EUO, please provide the below information and/or documentation as it pertains to the 10/25/11 claim:  1. Federal Tax returns or any other documents used for Federal returns between the dates of 2007-2011 for you individually (under all of the names and social security numbers you use) and your company Low Income Immigrations Assistance. 2. The full social security number for Vincent Daniel Hopper. 3. Any and all receipts you claim that you have detailing the purchase of all of the Macy's clothing items your are claiming on the expense claim sheet. 4. Cell phone records for October, November and December 2011. 5. The Youtube video that you believe might show some of the property claimed in this loss before the loss occurred. 6. The Power of Attorney documentation from Francisco Moreno and Antonia Marks which shows your authority to files claims on their behalf and also to be in the subject Windy Ridge home. Basically, I want to see any documentation which shows that you have ownership interest in the home. 7. Any documentation indicating that you are working with Bank of America in modifying the loan of the Windy Ridge address as well documents relating to the balance of said loan. 8. You mentioned that Balboa Insurance covers the Homeowners Insurance on the subject home. Please provide that policy and dates of coverage. 9. Any rental agreements you had in 2011 for anyone at the subject address. 10. Copies of your Bank account records (showing your debit account) for 2011 and 2012. 11. All documents relating to the insurance claim with Farmers Insurance for the 6/10/2010 which involved the alleged ""looting"" of the subject property prior to you moving in. 12. All documents relating to the insurance claims with Farmers Insurance relating to the 1 25/2011 fire loss at the subject property. 13. The complaint and restraining orders that John Hale filed against you and you against him. Although, I have the complaint you filed against him.  14.  The contact information fro Randy & Elsie Hendricks (the people that were staying in the subject property at the time of the loss). 15. The contact information for Sergio Mendoza, the gentleman that allegedly gifted you the Kitchenaid oven, microwave and stovetop. In addition, please provide his telephone number. 16. All other receipt you believe you have. 17. As you know, several things had to be deleted from the expense claims sheet as there were either recovered, not stolen or never bought by you. As such, you indicated that you will go through the expense claim form to see if there are other items that need to be taken off of the list. Please do this and provide me with a revised list. 18. Receipt for the two suits from Men's Warehouse. 19. Contact information for Francisco Moreno and Antonia Garcia. 18. Provide your statements for your best buy credit card for 2010, 2011 and 2012.  When the Plaintiff provided the entirety of his bank records and telephone records and informed Cannot that he would have to subpoena records for the telephones from two of the phone companies, Eron unreasonably believed that the Plaintiff had to gain those records himself even though the Plaintiff also would have to subpoena the records.  Plaintiff provided a wealth of documents to Eron while at the same time trying to safeguard his office and to minimize any more incursions on his home.     When the Plaintiff contacted Eron and informed him that he would need more time in order to provide the documents he demanded, Eron then issued a final letter of denial where in the letter he accused the Plaintiff of being broke and having motive to hide his things and claim insurance.   Plaintiff’s bank records provided to Eron shows no less than 259,000 in receipts to the Plaintiff for the 1 and a half year from June of 2010 through September of 2012. Yet ANPAC, through Eron Cannon, stated that the Plaintiff was destitute and had no money.  ANPAC balked at the fact that the Plaintiff’s funds and his firm’s funds were comingled to an extent to be difficult to determine which was which without realizing that the Plaintiff could run his business any way he choose to do so and keep his funds in accounts any manner in which he choose.  Wayne Rudder 231 Windy Ridge Lane Moxee, WA  98936-9356  Re:       Claim No.: Policy No.: DOL:   Insured: File:46-T-2EC807 and 46-T-2FF56346-T-25512M I 0/25/11 and 1125112 Wayne Rudder In Re: Wayne Rudder      Dear Mr. Rudder:  American National General Insurance Company (""ANGIC"") has completed its investigation and evaluation of your above-captioned claims. In summary, ANGIC respectfully denies coverage based upon the intentional acts provision, the fraud, misrepresentation and concealment provision, the cooperation clause and also exclusion of a claim due theft by a resident. All of these provisions are contained within your ANGIC Washington Tenants Homeowners Policy.  ANGIC has also decided to rescind or rather void your policy. Under separate cover, ANGIC will send you a refund of any paid premiums back to the beginning of the effective period of coverage for this policy.  ANGIC continues to reserve all other potential coverage defenses and rights as well as the potential application of any and all Policy terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions. The following paragraphs outline some of the facts that support this decision. Although this letter does not recite all of the known facts regarding this claim, you can rest assured that ANGJC reviewed and considered all known facts and circumstances before making its final decision.  Your Examination under Oath (""EUO"") took place in Yakima, Washington on February 8, 201 2.  For the purposes of this denial, the following language from the ANGIC Washington Tenants Homeowners Policy is pertinent:     TENANTS POLICY FORM 4 AGREEMENT   We will provide the insurance described in this policy in return for the premium and compliance with all applicable  provisions of this policy. The policy deductible applies to each Section I occurrence unless speci fically excepted. The deductible does not apply to Section II losses.   SECTION I- COVERAGES COVERAGE C - PERSONAL PROPERTY We cover personal property owned or used by any insured while it is anywhere in the world.  At your request, we will cover personal property owned by others while the property is on the part of the residence premises occupied by an insured. Also, we will cover, at your request, personal property owned by a guest or a residence employee, while the property is in any residence occupied by any insured.   SECTION I- PERILS INSURED AGAINST COVERAGES C - PERSONAL PROPERTY  We insure for accidental direct physical loss to property described in Coverage C caused by the following perils, except as provided in SECTION I - EXCLUSIONS:  Theft, including attempted theft and loss of property from a known location when it is likely that the property has been stolen.   This peril does not include loss caused by theft:  committed by any insured, or any person regularly residing on thevresidence premises;SECTION I - EXCLUSIONS We will not pay for loss or damage caused by any of the following excluded events as described in items I . through 12. below.  Loss or damage will be considered to have been caused by an excluded event if that event directly and solely results in loss or damage, or initiates a sequence of events that results in loss or damage, regardless of the nature of any intermediate or final event in that sequence.  Intentional Acts, meaning any loss arising out of any act committed; by or at the direction of any insured; and   with the intent to cause a loss.    SECTION I - CONDITIONS   2.     Your Duties After Loss.  In case of a loss to which this insurance may apply, you shall see that the following duties are performed; prepare an inventory of damaged personal property showing in detail, the quantity, description, actual cash value, and amount ofloss.  Attach to the inventory all bills, receipts, and related documents that substantiate the figures in the inventory;   as often as we reasonably require:  (2)        provide us with records and documents we request and permit us to make copies.    submit to us, within 60 days after we request, your signed, sworn statement of loss which sets forth, to the best of your knowledge and belief:  ( I )      the time and cause of loss;    '-------------       ·-····· ------       -----···· · -·   (2)             interest of the insured and ail others in the property involved and all encumbrances on the property;   (3)             other insurance which may cover the loss;  (4)             changes in title or occupancy of the property during the terms of the policy;  (5)             specifications of any damaged building and detailed estimates for repair of the damages;  (6)             an inventory of damaged personal property in 2c;  8.         Suit Against Us.  No action shall be brought unless there has been compliance with the policy provisions and the action is started within one year after the occurrence causing loss or damage.  SECTION I AND SECTION II- CONDITIONS  2.         Concealment or Fraud. This entire policy shall be void if, whether before or after a loss, any  insured has willfully concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance concerning this insurance or the subject thereof, or the interest of any insured therein, or in case of any fraud or false swearing by any insured relating thereto.  If we analyze the motives, means and opportunity that exist in the 10/2511 I claim, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence that you were intentionally involved in staging the theft of items from your home.  It is quite apparent that you have minimal financial means. You have less than $1,000 in your checking and savings accounts and have over $7,700 in unpaid traffic ticket collection. You also have $1,400 in revolving account balances with Macy's, and according to your own testimony you ""always spends all"" of your money. Moreover, in the beginning of the claim, you informed ANGIC that you were financially stretched and were pressing for a quick resolution of this claim. You claim to have a take-home salary of $4,000 to $6,000 per month, but you did not substantiate that claim. Your take-home pay at that amount would also be contradictory to your statement that you did not make enough money to file federal tax returns. Considering your financial situation, you certainly had a motivation to stage the theft of certain items within your  home in order to claim $13,000 in losses. The $13,000 is a substantial amount to you  as it slightly exceeds your adjusted gross income per year.    It is also important to note that you do not have any other money in savings, any retirement account, or, in fact, have any proof of ownership of the subject home. Even if you did, you could not afford the $2,700 mortgage per month.  You go by several aliases, three of which have different social security numbers. You indicated that you use these aliases and different social security numbers in order to avoid paying traffic tickets. This ruse, along with use of several social security numbers for one individual, certainly makes it likely that you are not a credible individual. Moreover, you are utilizing these various social security numbers and aliases to file several lawsuits and also to obtain credit in revolving accounts such as being a secondary subscriber under Antonia Garcia.Marks' Macy's account and listed as Antolin Marks.  You also hold yourself out as a licensed attorney in your business at Low Income Immigration Assistance. You appear to be practicing law without  a license and are misrepresenting your credentials on some of your websites. All of this in totality reveal that you are prone lo unethical behavior which may lead to an inference that you would have no issue in submitting a fraudulent insurance claim such as the 10/25/111 claim.  You indicated that two renters, Randy and Elsie Hendricks, were at home and sleeping in the room next to your master bedroom at the time of the loss. The loss occurred between 2:30 and 9:30 p.m. You could not explain why the Hendrickses did not hear the loss as it was occurring. You admitted that it would most likely take more than one person to have taken all these items and also several trips to accomplish the theft. It is quite difficult to believe that the Hendrickses were at home at the time of the loss and did not hear a window being shattered, one or more persons shuffiing around the house carrying some heavy items and making several trips. You tried to explain that it was your belief that the Hendrickses did hear the loss, but did not leave the room for fear of being injured by the purported thieves. However, when asked in your EUO, if that was the case, why after the theft did they not call the police or yourself? You did not have an explanation for this.  Moreover, the Hendrickses did not even tell you that they heard the loss.  You were obviously trying to establish an alibi, but realized after the EUO, that it was a weak one at best. You were requested to provide me with the contact information for the Hendrickses, and so far you have concealed this information.  During the investigation, you mentioned several suspects that may have broken into your home on October 25, 201 1 . However, you indicated that the primary suspect was John Hale.  You also indicated  that  it was his belief that  Donnyel  Ggobert was involved  and provided  a detailed statement to the Yakima County Sheriff.  However, after you realized that Mr. Ggobert was in jail, you could no longer point to him as a suspect.  Mr. Hale as a suspect raises some questions and issues.  In the EUO, you explained that Mr. Hale was 5'6"" tall, weighing 156 pounds.  Thus, it did not make any logical sense that Mr. Hale would have stolen over $6,000 worth of clothes that would never have fit him.  You tried to explain this away by indicating that Mr. Hale took these items out of ""spite.""  Moreover, at the EUO, you stated that you filed a detailed lawsuit against  Mr. Hale claiming fraud, deception, harassment, etc., in the amount of $259,000.   Thecomplaint adds quite a bit of colorful language as it pertains to the facts and circumstances surrounding Mr. Hale's  repair of your home. You most likely felt that the existence of this complaint against Mr. Hale would add credence to the claim that Mr. Hale was a suspect in the subject Joss. The Yakima County Sheriff dusted for fingerprints and could not find any foreign fingerprints, let alone those connected to John Hale. The claim that John Hale or Donnyel Ggobert were suspects appears to be contrived by you in order to shift focus on you as being the person who more likely than not fabricated this loss.    As it pertains to the items allegedly stolen and the expense claim fonn submitted by you, there are some serious issues related to the same. In the initial discussion with the Yakima County Sheriff, on the date of the incident, you indicated that only four items  were stolen, which included a TV, computer, pressure washer and mower. On the expense claims fonn, there is no listing of a pressure washer or lawn mower. Further, this fonn lists well over 50 items which is a substantial difference from the four items that were claimed initially. This was even pointed out by the Yakima County Sheriff that the supplemental list was quite a bit larger and went ""on and on."" It appears that you were trying to pad the loss by claiming more items.  It is also important to point out that there is an unusually higb number of recent purchases in 2011, which does not comport with your financial condition. If, in fact, you were financially stretched as you said you were, it is unlikely that you could have afforded this large amount of items in 2011. You also could not provide receipts for some of the large ticket items, to include the TV, computer, men's suits from Men's Warehouse, etc. It is also interesting to note that the clothes that you allegedly purchased from  Macy's in the amount of over $6,000, you were only able to provide documentation as to approximately $1,700 worth of items. Those that you did provide documentation for, they arc under the account of Antonia Garcia-Marks and a secondary subscriber of Antolin Marks. Interestingly enough, you have a balance of approximately $1 ,400 with Macy's at this time.  In one of the claimed items within the expense claim sheet, you claim a Samsung BD Blu-ray player for $163.51 that appears to have been actually returned, rather than purchased.  Thus, you may have, in fact, purchased these clothing items from Macy's, made a claim on the same, and then returned those items.  Based upon the foregoing facts and inferences, the preponderance of the evidence shows that you were more likely than not involved in the theft of items from your home. Consequently, this would not be considered an ""accidental"" loss as described in the ANGIC policy definitions above.  As it pertains to fraud and misrepresentation and concealment of material facts in this claim, the following is pertinent:  As stated above, you provided an expense claim report to both the  Yakima  County Sheriff and ANGIC. Initially, the Yakima County Sheriff investigated the loss on the date that it purportedly occurred, and you claimed that only a computer, TV, lawn mower and pressure washer were stolen. However, you then provided a supplemental expense claim fonn which listed over 50 items. Absent from this list is the pressure washer and lawn mower earlier claimed to have been stolen.   It is astounding that you, on the date of the incident, did not notice over $6,000 worth of clothing items missing, as well as a microwave, oven, countertop stove, camera, computer monitors, printer, home entertainment system, receiver, etc. Even the Yakima County Sheriff recognized this to be quite curious as they said the supplemental list went ""on and on.""   More  likely  than  not,  you  were  misrepresenting  the  actual  items  allegedly  stolen  from  your home.    You  may  have  felt  emboldened   after  the  initial  investigation  by  the  Yakima  County Sheriff and thought  you  could justify  a much  larger claim than previously  concocted.   You must have forgotten  that  you  told  the police  a pressure  washer  and  lawn  mower  was  stolen.   In  the expense claim form, dated November  I , 2011 , you had items on that claim form which were not, in   fact,  stolen,   or   were  not   even   yours   in   the   first   place.        When   confronted   with   the inconsistencies  of the  expense  claim  while  at  your  EUO,  you  attempted  to  explain  that  one of your  many  assistants  helped  you  prepare  the  expense  claim  form  and  that  you  should  have looked  at it more  carefully.    Nevertheless,  you did  admit  to  taking responsibility  for this  form and signing it in the presence of a notary.   You did withdraw various items on the expense claim form  due  to  the  above  reasons.    When  adding  up  all  the  items  that  you  withdrew  from  the expense claim  form, it  amounted  to $2,513.99.   However,  if you  also add the kitchen  top stove, which  you  indicated  he allegedly  ""found"" in the bushes  of your home, the total  amount  adds up to $3,927.99.   Jn your EUO, you realized your inconsistencies  and backed off and volunteered  to go  back  through  the  expense  claim  form  and  to  see  if  there  are  other  items  that  need  to  be stricken  from  the  claim.    To date, you  have  not  followed  through  on that  promise.    The  two major items that you misrepresented  on the expense claim  form  is the KitchenAid  microwave of $832.98 and the KitchenAid top oven of $!,200.99.   You also submitted a Best Buy account of purchases invoice for a one Maria Aguilar. You admitted that this was not your account, and it was a mistake on the part of Best Buy to provide you with this information. Nevertheless, that did not stop you from claiming some of her items on the expense claim form. While the items do not necessarily amount to much, around $100, it is quite telling  that there were specific items taken out of Ms. Aguilar's purchase statement which appeared to be deliberate. In other words, if in fact you had  an assistant go through Ms. Aguilar's purchase statement, one wonders how the assistant decided to pick those items. More likely than not, you directed the assistant to claim those items. Further, and along those Jines, you provided the Best Buy purchasing statements for Antolin Marks. There appears to be over I 00 purchases, and without your direct involvement, one wonders how the assistant decided to pick certain items. More likely than not, you had direct involvement in listing the items on the expense claim form.  It is also important to note the apparent misrepresentation by you that you purchased a Denon 75 watt 5 change audio/video receiver. You indicate on the expense claim form that you purchased this item on August 5, 2011,  but  when  looking  at  the  Best  Buy  purchasing  statement  for Mr. Marks, if you look at the column entitled ""Type,"" it indicates whether the item was a sale or POS exchange. Further, under the ""Price"" section, it indicates an amount, either with parenthesis or without parenthesis. Best Buy Customer Service Support states that if the item is under ""Type"" and it says ""POS exchange,"" and the price has parenthesis around it, that means that item was returned. Based upon the sales history provided, you claimed two items on the expense claim form that you actually returned to Best Buy. These items are the Denon audio/video receiver of August 5, 201 1 for $249.99 and the Easy LP to MP3 item purchased on July 19, 201 1 for $77.49, and returned on July 22, 2011.  There are a variety of items which we requested of you and you agreed to provide. Please see the list below:    Federal tax returns or any other documents used for federal returns between the dates of 2007 and 2011 under all the social security numbers and names that he uses.    Full social security number for Vincent Daniel Hopper.  Cell phone records for October, November and December 2011.  The Balboa Insurance Homeowners policy for the subject home.  Copies of bank account records showing any debit counts for 2011 and 2012.  All documents relating to the insurance claim with Farmers Insurance for June 10, 2010, which involved the alleged ""looting"" of the subject property prior to him moving in.  All documents relating to the insurance claim with Farmers Insurance of January 25, 2011 pertaining to the fire loss of the subject property.  Contact information for Randy and Elsie Hendricks.  i.    Contact information for Sergio Mendoza, the gentleman that allegedly gifted the KitchenAid oven, microwave and stovetop to Mr. Rudder.  An updated expense claim sheet identifying additional items that were not stolen or never owned by him.  Receipts for the two suits from Men's Warehouse.  Contact information for Francisco Moreno and Antonia Garcia-Marks.  Bust Buy credit card statements for 2010, 2011 and 2012.  All other receipts that you believe you have in your possession, which is ""easy to substantiate."" You made this comment pertaining to the clothing items he purchased from Macy's.  As of this date, you have failed to provide the majority of the above information. Considering that these items are accessible to you and you have failed to provide this material information, it appears that you are intentionally concealing this information from ANGIC.  Based upon all the above evidence, you clearly committed fraud and  made material misrepresentations and concealed material information during this investigation.  As it pertains to the 1/25/12 loss, it clearly appears to be a similar incident involving the same master bathroom window, which was purportedly broken into and used to enter the premises and in order to steal various items from your home. You stated that one of the tenants of his home, Luis Torres, more likely than not, stole these items from you.  However, you have not confronted   Mr. Torres and asked him  where these items are. Considering that more likely than not, Mr. Torres stole items from your home and was also a resident, ANGIC is denying the January 25, 2012 claim under Exclusion 9 in Section I - Perils Against The Insured, wherein it states that a peril  does not include a loss cause by a theft: ""committed by an insured, or any person regularly residing on the residence premises. "" Thus, since Mr. Torres resides at the subject premises, and more likely than  not stole the items from you, then  the 1/25/12 claim is not covered.   Additionally, as it pertains to the 1/25/12 loss, you have failed to provide your sworn proof of loss within 60 days.  Please note that your Policy and the law contain certain time limits for bringing actions against ANGIC, some of which may be less than one year from the date of this letter. Although the limitation period(s) may have been tolled during the time that ANGIC was evaluating this claim, the tolling will end upon the conclusion of this claim. Thus, at this point, the claims of 10/25/11 and 1/25/12 are deemed denied for purposes of all time limitations.  Furthermore, because you have misrepresented and concealed material facts, it is certainly possible that ANGIC is not aware of all relevant facts and that the true facts would result in further grounds to deny coverage for your claim of I 0/25/11. ANGIC is fully reserving its right to assert any additional rights and defenses as well as the application of any and all Policy terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions.  This coverage decision is based on the facts known to date. If you believe there are facts or arguments which may be relevant to this decision or if any of the above mentioned facts are in error, then please notify the undersigned and send me this information so ANGIC may consider any such new information.  Sincerely,    Stacey Jennings Special Investigations Unit American National General Insurance Company P.0. Box 3558 Springfield, MO  65808-3558   Many of the items demanded by Eric Cannon could not be produced, and he knew that he could subpoena the items from third parties but failed to do so: For instance, tax records which the Plaintiff did not have; Macy Credit Card Statements which the Plaintiff did not have, Best Buy Credit Card statements which were not even in existence since there was never a Best Buy Credit Card, Information relating to Antonia Garcia and Francisco Moreno; information related to Vincent Daniel Hopper;  Mr. Cannon took issue with the fact that the Supplemental List provided to the Sheriff’s Department went “on and on”, however, the fact is that at the time the Sheriff arrived at the home, the Sheriff took no inventory and that was left to be provided to a supplemental list to be provided to the Sheriff as it is done in every single case in Yakima County.  Cannon stated that it was more likely than not that the gardener, Luis Angel Munoz Torres, stole the items from the home and only his blatant racism is given for that conclusion.  In fact, Luis and Jose had been in the home for almost three years and enjoyed the items in the house more than the Plaintiff was able to.   It was clear from the facts evident that John Hale was the culprit in the theft of the Denon Receiver and the first burglary where he took the television from the bedroom, the computers, computer related items, and other things.  The second theft also bore the MO of Hale, but the third burglary where just everything else was taken was a bit perplexing in that it did not appear that the culprit was John Hale because John Hale was a music enthusiast and would have taken the best speakers which were bulky, but the speakers were not taken and they were left behind. This led the Plaintiff to believe that someone else had taken these items.  ANPAC cites that the Plaintiff did not accuse Luis of the theft but the Plaintiff did not have the duty to accuse anyone regarding the thefts at all. The fact is that the policy stated that ANPAC would indemnify the Plaintiff from any losses made at the house and they failed to do so. The only responsibility the Plaintiff had was to report the claim and then supporting documentation.   The fact that ANPAC delayed for several months, and the fact that they have called the Plaintiff a thief, defrauder, and concealer of things to commit fraud is reprehensible and completely unfounded.   The Plaintiff cooperated with ANPAC to the best of his ability.  Some documentation was impossible to gain as they did not exist. Others were commonly available to both parties and ANPAC should have been able to gain those documents such as their own policy, the policy of Balboa, etc. Their entire behavior in this matter was deliberately bad faith.  On or about July 25th 2013 when the Plaintiff decided to take legal action he called and spoke to Lindsay Vanzandt and he requested that they send him a copy of the claims and proof of loss filed in each claim. She mysteriously claimed that the Proof of Loss was never filed in the claims when the Chase Bank employees will testify that they notarized the Proof of Loss and their mailing system was used to mail the documents to ANPAC.   ANPAC denied the claim based upon, they stated, “the fraud, misrepresentation and concealment provision, the cooperation clause and also exclusion of a claim due theft by a resident” but their actions amount to racism against the Hispanic residents of the home and racism against the Plaintiff who is Black. What they call concealment is the fact that some documents were just not available to anyone like the Best Buy Credit Card Receipts since there were never credit cards from best Buy and every item was purchased using Debit cards from the Bank of America, Chase Bank, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank and Money Tree Premier Cash Solution Cards.  It is the claim of the Plaintiff that the ANPAC Insurance Company engaged in racism in their decisions on this claim (s).  It is the claim of the Plaintiff that ANPAC Insurance Company engaged in bad faith.  It is the claim of the Plaintiff that ANPAC voided and cancelled the policy without the required thirty day notice under Washington State law and this violated the contract between ANPAC and the Plaintiff and breached such contract.  It is specially claimed that ANPAC libeled the Plaintiff and slandered the Plaintiff and his employees Luis Angel Torres Munoz in their writings and their statements to the effect that they called the Plaintiff a thief and a defrauder.  To wit:  ANPAC stated, “If we analyze the motives, means and opportunity that exist in the 10/2511 I claim, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence that you were intentionally involved in staging the theft of items from your home.”  Plaintiff disavows the statement that he was “intentionally involved in staging the theft of items from” his home.  Plaintiff will prove that the statement was racist, and self-serving by ANPAC.   Moreover, Plaintiff claims that these statements does not fall within the legal exception to libel and slander and was deliberately made to denigrate the plaintiff and his employees.  Further, the statement by ANPAC, “It is quite apparent that you have minimal financial means. You have less than $1,000 in your checking and savings accounts and have over $7,700 in unpaid traffic ticket collection. You also have $1,400 in revolving account balances with Macy's, and according to your own testimony you ""always spends all"" of your money. Moreover, in the beginning of the claim, you informed ANGIC that you were financially stretched and were pressing for a quick resolution of this claim. You claim to have a take-home salary of $4,000 to $6,000 per month, but you did not substantiate that claim.” is directly disputed by the Bank records of Wells Fargo, Bank of America, U.S. Bank and Chase Bank. Which shows cumulative deposited income of over 259,000 for the period in question.  Further, ANPAC’s statement, “Considering your financial situation, you certainly had a motivation to stage the theft of certain items within your  home in order to claim $13,000 in losses. The $13,000 is a substantial amount to you  as it slightly exceeds your adjusted gross income per year.”  Is completely without foundation and is calculated to slander and libel and demand the Plaintiff and such is controvered by all evidence presented to ANPAC.   ANPAC also stated the following:  “It is also important to note that you do not have any other money in savings, any retirement account, or, in fact, have any proof of ownership of the subject home. Even if you did, you could not afford the $2,700 mortgage per month.”  First, the home has been undergoing modification under the Attorney General’s Settlement and the Making Homes Affordable Plan. Second, the amount of the mortgage is certainly dwarfed by the mean average of income which represents over 15,000 in income for the period in question.  It is believed that ANPAC’s representative was jaundiced in that he saw a Black man with an office staff of four persons and a clerk with three officers and designed to destroy that man with his words and actions and this was based purely upon racism.  ANPAC also stated, “You go by several aliases, three of which have different social security numbers. You indicated that you use these aliases and different social security numbers in order to avoid paying traffic tickets. This ruse, along with use of several social security numbers for one individual, certainly makes it likely that you are not a credible individual. Moreover, you are utilizing these various social security numbers and aliases to file several lawsuits and also to obtain credit in revolving accounts such as being a secondary subscriber under Antonia Garcia.Marks' Macy's account and listed as Antolin Marks.”  However, ANPAC misstates the facts.  The Plaintiff did at one time go by each of the names in question, Vincent Daniel Hopper, Antolin Andrew Marks and Wayne R. E. Rudder, but each of the names were properly changed by Court action and the SSN relative to each name was individual to those names rather than any attempt to subvert justice.  Far from the assertion by ANPAC that the names were used to avoid paying traffic tickets, the names were utilized when Plaintiff was in the process of running from abusive parents who sought to force Plaintiff to commit acts on his body not consistent with reasonability and which were born from homophobia. The credit card from Macy’s under Antolin marks was consistent with the name at the time and which was the legal name of the Plaintiff, these facts are ascertainable through legal records in the Yakima County District Court and the King County District Court, ANPAC knew this fact as they were provided with the certified copies of the name changes.  ANPAC stated, “You also hold yourself out as a licensed attorney in your business at Low Income Immigration Assistance. You appear to be practicing law without  a license and are misrepresenting your credentials on some of your websites. All of this in totality reveal that you are prone lo unethical behavior which may lead to an inference that you would have no issue in submitting a fraudulent insurance claim such as the 10/25/111 claim.” This is false. First, the Low Cost Immigration Assistance Agency is a firm licensed in Yakima County and the State of Washington. It is a corporation which provides service to immigrants in immigration matters.  As such, there is no necessity to have a Bar License. Moreover, since the firm utilizes contract attorneys for its journeys into court, there is no possibility of “practicing law without a license.”  Moreover, none of this is relevant to the twin questions:  A. Was there a policy in place for the theft of items from Plaintiff’s home?  B. Did a theft occur?  Jealousy does a lot of things and this is a case of Eron Z. Cannon being insanely jealous at the Plaitniff and his success where, whether or not the Plaintiff is an attorney he still is the only person, alive or dead, to have gained Four 4) published decisions from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals where he won the issue presented. Eron Z. Cannon has none (0).  ANPAC stated, “You indicated that two renters, Randy and Elsie Hendricks, were at home and sleeping in the room next to your master bedroom at the time of the loss. The loss occurred between 2:30 and 9:30 p.m. You could not explain why the Hendrickses did not hear the loss as it was occurring. You admitted that it would most likely take more than one person to have taken all these items and also several trips to accomplish the theft. It is quite difficult to believe that the Hendrickses were at home at the time of the loss and did not hear a window being shattered, one or more persons shuffiing around the house carrying some heavy items and making several trips. You tried to explain that it was your belief that the Hendrickses did hear the loss, but did not leave the room for fear of being injured by the purported thieves. However, when asked in your EUO, if that was the case, why after the theft did they not call the police or yourself? You did not have an explanation for this.  Moreover, the Hendrickses did not even tell you that they heard the loss.”  The fact is that ANPAC were informed that the Hendrickses had a habit of staying up all night playing video games on their laptop and sleeping during the day. Moreover, ANPAC was told that Elsie and Randy Hendricks moved out of the building two months after the theft but could not be reached. ANPAC could have taken steps to locate the Hendrickses, but it was not the duty of the Plaintiff to locate the Hendrickses unless he needs them to appear in court which he will certainly do.  The Hendrickses were certainly at home asleep at the time of the robbery.  They failed to hear any incursion on the property because they were asleep. Although Plaintiff believed that they may have heard the incident but were afraid, that is just a belief and not a fact.  Only the Hendrickses can state their feeling. They have stated they were asleep and that is all the Plaitniff can believe from their statements. There is no evidence to dispute such and Eron Cannon’s conclusions are just that, conclusions and speculations without evidence otherwise.  ANPAC states, “You were obviously trying to establish an alibi, but realized after the EUO, that it was a weak one at best. You were requested to provide me with the contact information for the Hendrickses, and so far you have concealed this information.” But the Plaintiff again asserts that the statement is libelous and slanderous for its implying that the Plaintiff is a thief and defrauder who needed to establish an alibi. The Plaintiff was at work as he was at work every single day from sometimes 4:00a m to the eleven at night, with the occasional overnighter at the office. Further, the Plaintiff did not have any information relating to Elsie and Randy Hendricks to give to ANPAC because they had moved and were then living in motels.  ANPAC states, “During the investigation, you mentioned several suspects that may have broken into your home on October 25, 201 1 . However, you indicated that the primary suspect was John Hale.  You also indicated  that  it was his belief that  Donnyel  Ggobert was involved  and provided  a detailed statement to the Yakima County Sheriff.  However, after you realized that Mr. Gobert was in jail, you could no longer point to him as a suspect.  Mr. Hale as a suspect raises some questions and issues.  In the EUO, you explained that Mr. Hale was 5'6"" tall, weighing 156 pounds.  Thus, it did not make any logical sense that Mr. Hale would have stolen over $6,000 worth of clothes that would never have fit him.  You tried to explain this away by indicating that Mr. Hale took these items out of ""spite.""  Moreover, at the EUO, you stated that you filed a detailed lawsuit against  Mr. Hale claiming fraud, deception, harassment, etc., in the amount of $259,000.   The complaint adds quite a bit of colorful language as it pertains to the facts and circumstances surrounding Mr. Hale's  repair of your home. You most likely felt that the existence of this complaint against Mr. Hale would add credence to the claim that Mr. Hale was a suspect in the subject Joss. The Yakima County Sheriff dusted for fingerprints and could not find any foreign fingerprints, let alone those connected to John Hale. The claim that John Hale or Donnyel Ggobert were suspects appears to be contrived by you in order to shift focus on you as being the person who more likely than not fabricated this loss.”  However, Mr. Cannon did not live in that area and he did not experience the disdain Plaintiff lived through with John Hale after the worker/employee relationship went sour where Mr. Hale would stand at the driveway and shout, “Nigger, Nigger,” to the Plaintiff as the Plaintiff came down the drive. Donnyel and hale were friends and it was believed that both were involved, but it became clear that Donnyel was in jail and could not be in two places at once and thus it was shown that Hale alone, along with his children had been the culprits.  The Yakima County Sheriff did not, as is asserted, “dust for prints.”  They never have during these incidents. It would be futile since Hale and his children had been in the house working on the sheetrock in the kitchen and the living room. The idea that the Plaintiff, “more than likely fabricated the loss,” is easily disputed by the evidence of the Plaintiff’s four secretaries who would have testified that the Plaintiff had been at the office at all occasions and will be disputed in Court by the Insurance Agent of ANPAC who had been to the home on three occasions with his family and knew the intimate details of the house and its contents.  Dan Williams, the agent, quit his job with ANPAC shortly afterwards since he could not believe their actions in this case.  ANPAC goes on to dispute several individual purchases at Best Buy in Yakima. They cite the Denon Receiver which they believe was returned, a Samsung Blu-Ray Player, and other items, but they deliberately omit the fact that shows that the items returned were replaced the very sae day and time with items which were the same items but which worked instead of not working. For example the Best Buy documents show that Three Easy LP To CD were purchased and two returned.  They were returned because they were faulty and the one that was kept was eventually stolen. The statements of ANPAC are reaching to the extreme. Their attempts to avoid this loss has even gone to the extreme of seeking prosecution of the Plaintiff, an act which has been rejected by the Yakima County Prosecuting Attorney. There is just too much evidence that this is just a case of racism by ANPAC and an attempt to avoid paying their fair share of the losses that they incurred in this policy.  In reality, ANPAC, given the facts of this case, maybe should never have issued a policy on this home. The home is remote there is no security and even if there was, it would take the responders some 45 minutes to reach the scene. Cameras are out of the question as it would take 36 cameras to secure a property where those cameras would be thwarted by a person with a raincoat over his head.  Plaintiff, of course, has choices as to where he lives, but a person should not be run out of his house by thieves and a thieving racist insurance company.  It is the Claim of the Plaintiff that ANPAC Insurance did violate the terms of the policy and this violation was meant to defraud the Plaintiff and to breach the contract held between ANPAC and the Plaintiff.  For these claims, the Plaintiff demands a jury trial and an award of specific damages and punitive damages in the amount of 26,980 specific damages and 580,000 in punitive damages.  Under the penalty of perjury I do attest that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and are related to facts that I have access to such information.  Submitted on the date of 8/15/2013.

A tree failed on her house the day after Thanksgiving, 2012, during a wind storm. I call for her insurance agent and left a message. The agent turned the information over to the claim office on Tuesday, Nov27th. The adjuster came to house unannounced on Dec. 5, 2012 and wanted to assess the damages. She did not want him to assess the damages until she got her own estimates.  She told him it was winter and the roof could not be fixed until spring. She would also know if leaks occurred inside the house.  Against her wishes he assessed the roof, fence, and tree anyway. Then on Dec. 6th he sent out a check $1901 for both (approx) fence (617.00) and roof (1250.00). When she started to get estimates this spring the roof alone was estimated a little over $3950, by the lowest contractor. We called and email him about the problem he ignored all our calls, emails, estimates she emailed, and the contractors we had call him about the estimates.

Anyone can use the phone book!!!! I was contacted by this guy Matthew Dilday, President/Owner/ whatever, claiming he would fix everything. He claimed he would send out and additional 2000 mailers and my contract would be fulfilled. Nothing came of that either, the few appts recieved were not within any of the demographics we established within my contract.

He claimed to send out more mailers after I agreeded to open some of the required demographics however nothing became of this. My last conversation with him was regarding his new seminar program.

If he could do this it would fullfill his obligation to me in regards to my contract. (WISHFULL THINKING) The date and time came and went with no communication from him whats so ever. After numerous calls and no response from him I had to cancel the seminar. The company and the man are crooks.

I'm not sure how they have any clients in small city like Ft Myers. I experienced the following: -Very slow or non-existent communication. Most of my voice mails and emails were either never returned/replied or took more than several days to get a response. -Very slow quote TA on existing policies. After finding out my insurance premium had doubled with a provider the agency was writing business through, I was told it would take at least 4 days to get a quote from any other company they represented. I received quotes from multiple companies outside the agency within minutes. -Poor customer service. When an independent insurance agency is aware that a certain provider has jacked their rates through the roof, they should contact existing policy holders upon renewal with quotes from other companies."" Mysteriously, after having no reviews other than mine a very chirpy perfect review is posted by someone who just joined Yelp and has no other reviews. More importantly though, two days later, the owner of agency replies in typical sub-par salesman fashion by not addressing issues I mentioned and misrepresenting the others. He replies that we all know it's typical for homeowner's insurance premiums to go up continually and mentions how particular and complicated they are in Florida...blah, blah, blah. I did not have a homeowner's insurance policy with his agency and had a different very simple type of policy. He essentially says insurance is complicated and a layman wouldn't understand...blah, blah, blah. I was a licensed insurance agent in a different state for six years out of college, I'm not a layman. He failed to address the customer service complaints all-together, which were 2/3 of the complaint. I then edited my Yelp review to respond to his misrepresentation of my knowledge and complaint. Mysteriously again, my review is pulled from Yelp. I'm sure Tim Shaw had no involvment in censoring a former client experience. I wanted to make sure my review got out there so I posted the same review on several other business review sites. Tim Shaw then replied to one the postings. This is where things got a little more serious, He called me a liar. He stated that I was not a real customer and was working for a competitor. This could not further from the truth. I gave an honest, fact-based review (lacking the hyperbole and exaggeration typical in online reviews) of a company I had bad experience with. Tim should spend at least as much time addressing customer service issues as he does trying to demean and discredit his customers. ",  Insurance Agencies

McLean Agency, Inc.  3070 W Lake Mary Blvd Ste 124 Lake Mary, Florida USA ",http://mcleanforseminole.com/, (407) 324-5662,""," My attempt to upgrade my insurance policy ended up with a cancelled policy, a forced insurance, unnecessary additional forced coverage at $3000 on a secondary mortgage and months of hassle with trying to fix a huge mistake and gain a new policy. McLean Insurance Agency FAILED to communicate and provide the customer service promised. Every year for over 3 years (documented by numerous faxes) I have had to personally update my insurance coverage with my mortgage companies. I have had to call, fax and email to ensure I have coverage listed with my mortgage companies. I called the 3rd year to ensure that McLean Insurance had all my update info and that it would not allow this to happen again. (But it did.) During that time, I spoke with Lisa to get assistance on a better policy and umbrella coverage for my rental property. I fully explained that I was not living in the country. I would need her assistance via phone, email or fax on any insurance communication or follow-up needs. She was using an inspector to obtain this new policy. She assured me that she would personally take care of this and email or call (stateside number - VOIP) with anything necessary. So I upgraded to a new policy. The new policy was rejected as the property needed some electrical upgrades and new water heaters. This would not have been a problem to fix. However, I never received notice from McLean Insurance company as promised on the new policy. The policy was canceled without my knowledge because they did not call or email as promised. Thus, my mortgage companies automatically placed a forced insurance policy my 1st mortgage (with much lower coverage) and an additional unnecessary forced policy for an unbelievable $3000 on my 2nd mortgage - which is NOT REQUIRED AT ALL. I received notice from my mortgage company via phone and email to send an update of my insurance policy as I was refinancing. I contacted McLean Agency's Lisa to have my policy information resent and updated. (Exactly what she had promised that I would no longer have to do.) At this point, Lisa claimed to send the new policy (which was actually NOT in effect) info twice that week. (Stating that the machine was having problems...) However, she never forwarded more than the cover sheet information when I requested personal copies of her communication to my mortgage companies. ALSO, at this time she never stated that the policy had been cancelled. How was she sending the up-to-date policy information on my behalf for a policy that did not exist any longer? If it was cancelled, then there would be no information to update... It was only via an online chat with the new insurance company that I was informed the new policy had been cancelled. This was obtained while I was attempting to get the new policy info and solve the lack of communication from insurance agency to mortgage company problem once again on my own behalf. When my mail was forwarded several months later, I received the formal mailed messages from my mortgage company and the insurance company that my property no longer had coverage provided by McLean Agency. After a lapse of insurance, I was automatically required to take a forced policy for a few months before being able to acquire normal insurance again. All at higher prices and excessive paperwork and inspections. Meanwhile, I was in the process of refinancing my house and this added more work to that process also. I used McLean Insurance Agency for my home prior to this rental property. I had personally met Mike at an Orlando Chamber of Commerce networking session in Orlando. Overall, I had used his agency for about 9 years. So when I was unhappy, I contacted the office manager Sharon and Mike. Mike never responded to my complaint. Sharon basically did the basics with minimal effort to correct the errors made, find a better policy on my behalf or even keep my account. This agency was a HUGE LET DOWN! It cost me thousands of dollars upfront in new policies (some unnecessary), months of paper chasing for refunds, new policies, etc. I had approached them for a better policy with higher premiums which should have been to their benefit. Instead, I got a huge headache! My policy lapsed due to their unprofessionalism. They did not contact me as promised when the policy was rejected. I have had to endure many months of fixing this. A simple phone call, fax or email would have prevented this. The fact that I received no assistance in remedying their mistake was HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL.     ",  Insurance Agencies

I am also NOT Un-educated as to what Constitutues Good Insurance Practice,Regulations or anything else,since I used to BE an Insurance adjuster (Licensed)for Auto&Home,and have worked my share of catastrophes for several different companies(all Scam Artists BTW in Pinstripe suits who hold us hostage with this crap&laugh all the way to the bank when they leave us High&dry),field claims,as well as being a Claims adjuster for the SIU Unit during Katrina.I KNOW what's going on here,and it STINKS to high heaven.I get some of the lowest rates because I have a clean record,with continuously being insured for almost 30 years.This is Dirty Pool by Progressive,since they can't seem to make enough Money on good Drivers,so they purposely cancel you illegally,then turn around and try to make you pay a rate that is TRIPLE,because you now have a Lapse in Insurance&when you try to prove otherwise,move the goalposts so it becomes impossible to prove&you get stuck paying these Mobsterswhatever they demand for'protection"".I'm not asking for special treatment or leaving anything out here to win folks to my side,I'm simply asking that the Company do it's job according to The contract stipulations without resorting to Illegal Practice&extrortion,Lies&lost 'supervisors"",nothing more,nothing less. I've called&called and gotten NOWHERE,but I HAVE run into quite a few others just like myself,in the SAME situation.As it stands,I now  have no insurance,am trying to buy a policy from other companies,and am getting Exorbitant rates because Progressive illegally cancelled me.My car is the ONLY way I get to doctors&treatments over an hour away(the rent close to the teaching Hospital was  WAY more than I can afford,even in the ""Ghetto""and their disabled housing I'd have to sell my car in order to qualify to even get on the waiting List,which is several YEARS out,so I had to wind up way out here  in order to afford it&still eat).Makes NO sense whatsoever,but that's how these grifters get rich.I've been inside the Insurance beast&I KNOW the awful,terrible things they do to people,just to make a buck.I've seen this scam before,it's nothing new,but still stinks.It's part of a quota Program that these theives do,in order to boost the Bottom &Profits,when they can't upsell you otherwise.I didn't carry the top Policy,but I DID carry VERY good coverage,more than most folks,but for Progressive,that wasn't enough.It's why I quit working for the Industry.They should NOT be allowed to get away with these things,yet NO ONE ever listens,or if they do,nothing gets done because these companies own EVERYTHING&have those in Power with the ability to do somethings Cahones in a vise. In a cruel twist of irony,I got crushed in a hit and run 15 years ago(not my fault),the driver never found,and my Insurance company at the time refused to pay for my medical or my car,because they said I was ""out of state""at the time.leaving me disabled,although I continued to work until I litertally fell apart&woke uppartially  Paralyzed in 2007 from lack of Surgery,with nowhere to go and no way to pay for things.They had a lawsuit filed against them for such practice(it took a so called""important""person getting screwed before they did anything though),promptly declared bankruptcy,folded&left us all stuck holding the bag.Now,once again,thanks to illegal Trade practice by an Insurance Company,I've got NO way to get to my medical treatments,no way to pay to get there,and once again,nothing being done about it.I'm NOT giving up though,and any advice would be great.I've tried calling several Lawyers,but so far,they say my case isn't worth the cost or time.Now what?Beware Progressive folks!Thanks.

We were told to contact GTN about an intial offer of 90 days trial period which would cost $900 and could be split into 3 payments. We were not informed that the only way to accomplish this would to use Paypal deferred billing. I set up an account and uploaded 1000 contact names.  Within the first week I received 9 confirmed contacts for the 8 hours which GTN says it called the names on the list. Not a single name or phone number was correct and I contacted GTN with my concern. I was told that the agent who had emailed the contact information had been given a correction and that this type of problem would not be an issue in the future.  I uploaded 2500 additional names and received 25 new confirmed contacts within the next 2 weeks.  Not one person answered the phone when I attempted to contact the customer and when I was successful I was asked to remove the name from any future calls.  I contacted GTN and was told that these problems could be expected since the information was only as good as the contact list uploaded into their system. I met with my District manager and called our state executive and was advised to cancel my contract with GTN.  Our representative was Mary Donohue and she suddenly started to become impossible to contact. She finally agreed to credit the remaining 60 days or $600 to me but stated that it would take as long as 60 days to process. During the next 60 days I heard nothing from GTN and did not see a credit to Paypal or a check to my door so I tried in vain to contact GTN via email and phone. Numerous calls to Cameron Seneca, ceo of GTN, went unanswered, voice mails were not returned, emails were not returned.  I succeeded in contact \ing Laura Miller on May 28, 2013 and informed her that I would be filing a small calims action against GTN in my county of residence and found out that GTN does not even have a registered agent in Washington state to receive process. When I told Laura that I would be including her and Cameron as litigants in the action she told me that she was not going to get dragged into something she knew nothing about and that she would have an answer for me within 12 hours.   I will follow up on complaint as it progresses.

 State Farm Insurance ,"  State Farm Insurance  10101 Slater Ave #105   Fountain Valley, California USA ","", 714) 963-9863,""," “Like a good neighbor State Farm is there” In my opinion at the time was a very true statement when Tonya Schneider was in charge of that local insurance agency. My family and I were happy customers for many many years until Tonya Snyder retired. About four months or so after Tonya Schneider retired Jared Diskin became the new agent. In my opinion I thought Jared was a nice knowledgeable guy who always offered me something to drink any time I came in the office to speak with him on any subjects. Jared also gave me his home cell phone to call if there was ever an insurance emergency. Up to this point in my business relationship with state farm was like their motto” Like a good neighbor State Farm is there” Then about six months later I walk into the office and ask for Jared and one of the secretaries said he no longer works here and hasn’t been here for about a month!!! No phone calls no letters no emails no text nothing!!!! I then asked did he leave or did you terminate him? I couldn’t get an answer to that question which I understand since there could be some legal issues and matters that could arise. I then spoke with one of the district managers of State Farm who told me that they apologies for the uncertainty brought on by this issue. Towards the end of the call the district manager tried to sell me on the idea of being a State Farm agent which I declined. After the call I thought this is getting weird but I thought give them the benefit of the doubt. You have to remember the State Farm motto “Like a good neighbor State Farm is there”. After about month I dealt with a new State Farm representative Kirk Glenn who I also thought at first was good representative. After about three months paying my bill in person at the State Farm office Kirk Glenn mentioned I could have an automatic payment plan attached to my checking account to make it more convenient so I wouldn’t have to go into the office, so I said O.K. I’ll do it. At that point in my opinion I had the State Farm company motto feeling “Like a good neighbor State Farm is there. For about three months everything is going through aok on the monthly payment plan attached to my checking account. Out of the blue I received in the mail in my opinion a startling, shocking, aggressive ultimatum IN BLOOD RED CALLED A CANCELLATION NOTICE NON PAYMENT OF PREMIUM.  The ultimatum stated that they have not received payment for my policy and that if I didn’t make an immediate payment they would cancel my coverage. On this document it clearly states THIS IS THE ONLY CANCELLATION NOTICE YOU WILL RECEIVE!. I had my payment plain attached to a checking account that had a minimum high four figures low five figure amount and didn’t have any other automatic payment deduction programs with any other companies. I never received a call to my home from my State Farm agent Kirk Glenn or anyone in his office on this issue even though he had my home phone number. I never received a call to my office phone from my State Farm agent Kirk Glenn or anyone in his office even though he had my office number. I never received an email from my State Farm agent Kirk Glenn or anyone in his office on this issue even though he had my email address. I never received a text from my agent Kirk Glenn or anyone in his office. In my opinion I can guess what the official State Farm legal boiler plate reaction would be Its not our company policy to try and have your State Farm representative contact you if something’s inaccurate with your State Farm Insurance account, well that’s speculation anyways. But personal feeling of State Farm after this letter is now turning to Like a bad neighbor State Farm don’t care!  I then made a call to my insurance agent Kirk Glenn to find out what’s going on The Woman who answered the phone in broken english said she would try to help me on this issue. After explaining the entire situation to her giving her my account number and other verification data  this is the response she gave me” You have too many address “  I thought this is totally surreal ! it would be like going to a pizza parlor ordering a large pizza and receiving a pair of  wing tip shoes. Now I don’t care if a person is Asian, African, European, South American, Middle Eastern, or from Mars I am an equal opportunity insulter and refuse to discriminate due to race, gender, religion and whatever else. Remember the State Farm motto Like a good neighbor State Farm is there or is it in my opinion Like a bad neighbor State Farm don’t care!. After receiving that highly sophisticated and technical response she placed me on hold for a long period of time and then transferred me to Kirk Glenn so I get his solution to my issue. I asked Kirk what was going on he said in a jovial voice “your bank cancelled the automatic check payment arrangement” My response is why would they do that? “Well I’m not sure but you otta givem a call” I asked “before I do that could I receive a letter on State Farm letter head stating that the potential cancellation of my policy was due to my bank freezing the automatic check payment arrangement” his reply was absolutely!. So then I call the branch manager of my bank asking about the automatic check payment arrangement and why she said that they didn’t freeze the automatic check payment arrangement at all what she did say is someone at State Farm changed two of account number digits that would cause the automatic check payment arrangement to be flagged for inaccuracies.  I asked them if I could receive a letter on my banks letterhead verifying this conversation she asked when I wanted to pick it up. My response was after I pick up the letter from State Farm and to pay off the unpaid amount on my policy.  When I got over to my State Farm office I immediately wrote a check for the unpaid premium and handed it to the two receptionists to which they gave me receipt for the payment in full. About two minutes later Kirk Glenn came out of his office and handed me an envelope that was supposed to be an State Farm letter that stated it was my banks fault that the automatic check payment arrangement had been cancelled. Thinking that this could turn in to a major fiasco I didn’t want to open the letter in the office instead I waited until I got home and this is what I received ! It was the same letter I received in the mail. Now in my opinion I’m now thinking “Like a cheap liar State Farm is there”. After reading the same letter I received in the mail I called the main office of State Farm in the mid west of the United States. I got on the phone with an individual who works in the State Farm complaints department. I gave the representative of the complaints department a complete overview of the entire issue I had been dealing with from start to finish she was very polite and agreeable that what had happened didn’t make sense. The representative then tried to get me to call back to the local State Farm office were I later found out is where this monstrous nightmare happened. The representative then gave me the number to the head of the State Farm automatic payment plan. After calling and speaking to one of the people in charge of the State Farm automatic payment plan representatives it took them about two days to research what happened it turned out that someone in the local State Farm insurance office that I had done business with had changed two digits in my account number that caused my bank to flag the payment request and ultimately reject it. I asked the representative of the automatic payment plan department to send me a letter to verify the information that she relayed to me over the phone of her findings on State Farm letter head which she did. If my State Farm representative would have been honest with me and tried to rectify the problem would I still do business with State Farm? Yes I would. Do I think State Farm Insurance is a bad company? No I don’t. I dealt with the wrong representative in the wrong office in this matter.  Things happen in business but the things that happened in my case could have been stopped very easily without this rip-off report being listed.            ",  Insurance Agencies 
 Ed Orell ,"  Ed Orell  301 Yamato Rd. Boca Raton, Florida USA ",www.sfgleadership.com, 561 886 0663,""," I have been working at Symmetry Financial Group full-time for more than a year.  The company owners are genuine and truly care about the success of the business, which is directly related to success of the individuals.  The original report should not conflate issues with Ed Orell with the legitimacy of Symmetry Financial Group.  As of today, Ed is not an owner of Symmetry Financial Group and his roles as marketing director and Agency manager are completely separate.  From personal experience, it appears that he does a lot of good in the former role but not so much in the latter role. I can truly say that when Ed is on the conference calls and in front of an audience at conferences, he is not the same Ed that you see on a daily basis.  On the conference calls and in front of an audience he portrays himself as a competent and trustworthy individual completely embodying the core values and core beliefs of the company; but in person he is the complete opposite.  He is a top personal producer, but struggles to retain a team and purely looks out for his own best interests even if it hurts those around him. Examples: -I witnessed Ed callously assigning valuable A leads to anybody who he could convince to give him a credit card number (whether it was their first time in the field, whether or not they could afford the leads, or a 'rodeo clown' veteran(as he calls them) agent searching for a new lead source).  According to Symmetry doctrine, a person should not be assigned brand new leads until they can prove they are able to produce.  At times when the A leads would be close to 30 days old Ed would increase the lead assignments to agents so that he would not be charged for the ageing leads.  Even if an agent signs up for 10 new leads per week, he would sometimes assign up to 15 or 20 leads without the agent’s consent; sometimes not even in the same geographical area(3-5 hours away). -The only training in his office is 'call from the home'. However, 80% of the time he does not answer the phone, then calls back 2 hours later, or the next day to ask if you still need help and how much money did you make him.  -The office environment is anything but professional.  Ed is constantly making sexist remarks and talking about inappropriate subject matter that have nothing to do with business. He goes on and on talking behind people's backs; some things true and of a highly sensitive personal nature; others exaggerated. -He shows up last minute to most meetings, and leaves during appointment setting instead of helping new agents get better on the phone.  I agree that it is his office and he can be wherever he wants to be, however he states that he will help coach you every step but he is not there for you when you need support. -Ed does not invest any time whatsoever in developing a team so it is no surprise that the 2 or 3 veteran agents are only 1 year or less in the business.  This is shocking for a person who has been in the insurance business for over 15 years.  It can’t always be the other people’s fault since Ed is always at scene of the crime so to speak. -Despite what he says, Ed cares neither about the growth of the agents nor of an agency.  He is not to be trusted with your personal business or your credit card.  He will say anything to earn your trust then have his way with you.  Symmetry Management may want to re-consider their association with such an individual.  This can only hurt the reputation of a new company with great potential. ",  Insurance Agencies

PSI-Dodgy Company Largo, Florida","										PSI is probably a bogus company that bothers USAA members.  I do not know how they got my information but USAA was firmly asked not to share my information with affiliates or market to me.  PSI called my pay-as-you-go phone while I was busy taking a timed college online quiz.  When I called USAA, I spoke to two different people in their fraud departments and neither knew a thing about PSI or this number.  PSI mysteriously knew my new rank even before my AKO knew it.  Highly suspicious but if they have been harassing people since 2008 or earlier as online complaints suggest, you would think USAA would have stopped them by now if it were fraud, so who knows what this is all about?  Searching for others' experience with the number that dialed me, I found far more comments defending PSI as an innocent company than ones pointing out its inconsistencies.  Think about it: why would this many people post in defense of PSI?  It is unusual for there to be more defense remarks of a phone number than complaints about it because ordinary people almost never rush off to the internet just to tell a bunch of people on the WWW that the last call they got on their phone is just an innocent call.  Is that something YOU typically do?  And even if it is PSI people making the lame excuse that they are frequently misunderstood feel the need to do this, why haven't they adjusted their business model-given that these misunderstandings have obviously been going on for years-rather than continue on and on to disrespect and confuse USAA customers?Someone said they sent junk mail in the mail to warn that I would get a phone call.   I do not read junk mail but please re-read the second sentence in this complaint.The call broke my focus on a question on my quiz; I called back later and got a very dodgy response.  The talk was fast and the wording was tricky.  At first, I was told in a way you could almost miss the word, ""affiliated"" that they were affiliated with USAA.  ""Affiliated could mean anything-it could mean they are a department of USAA (which is what I assumed).  After about 4 minutes and several pieces of information tricked out of me, they finally identified themselves as ""PSI"".  I immediately stopped giving them information and inquired as to why they did not tell me they were not USAA.  The lady seemed defensive in telling me that she did indeed tell me that they were <merely> affiliated.  I see little need for a legitimate company to not just come out at first and say who they are in the first ten seconds of a phone call or to send a warning letter that they are going to call rather than actually ask you the desired information in the letter itself if they are so sure you are going to read it to be warned of the call.

The following is intended to serve as an outline of our company and the life agent position currently available. We ask that you review this document closely. After review, if you are interested in proceeding to the next step, please E-MAIL ME and we can set up a time to speak on the telephone, discuss the position in detail and determine if theres a fit between yourself and our company. Here is OAKTREE Brokerage Services!   Company Background  OAKTREE Brokerage was formed in April of 1999. If you know your industry history, 1998-2000 was the peak time when nearly every major life carrier was looking towards the future to revolutionize how high-volume life sales could be made as simple and as fast as possible to accommodate what was quickly becoming the new buying style in which modern day consumers were beginning to buy all products and services (i.e. purchasing over the telephone and/or via the internet). In short, OAKTREE Brokerage was structured and built entirely for that purpose. Since our inception, all of our marketing, products, platforms, scripts, methods, etc. have been focused and designed around a non-traditional, non-field based selling method. We do EVERYTHING completely over the telephone, through e-mail and the internet and 100% of all selling, processing, underwriting, servicing, and so on is handled with our customers sight unseen. After nearly 14 years of pioneering and fine-tuning, today we have what many would consider a perfect system. We get our customers insured with very competitive, very recognizable brand name carriers FAST and with as little headache and hassle as you can possibly imagine, within 48-72 hours in nearly all cases. Customers get the coverage they need easily and affordably, we get paid fast and it just plain works.  We currently have 40 full-time agents on-site plus supporting staff and our management. Although we have a very solid core of In-House producers, we have and are able to consistently provide far more qualified leads than our current agents can support. Therefore, our current expansion plan is the virtual agent program being described.   Position  Even though youll be working with us remotely, it would be desired that you work very closely according to the agent parameters strictly in place that our current In-House agents observe. That said, its just all about production of course. Obviously, working remotely is going to offer you the highest level of schedule flexibility imaginable. We understand that. BUT, you have to make sure that you are consistently putting in the time, effort and energy to sustain adequate production. Here is the environment and resources you need to have available to you daily in your off-site location. Please note we have NO preference really whether your off-site location is a home office and/or if youre working from a current office location just as long as you have the following and can be productive. You need                       Initials:_______________  A RELIABLE computer with a high-speed internet connection.  A higher volume e-mail account (i.e. an account with adequate storage to save all of your correspondence, applications, etc. In most cases, you can simply upgrade your storage with most providers, if needed).  You need the ability to print, copy, fax and scan. A good Multi-Function machine from any office store should work fine. Just keep in mind that you may be doing a good amount of scanning and e-mailing so it needs to be a machine/method that works smoothly.  RELIABLE telephone service ideally with unlimited long-distance. We sell OVER THE PHONE so clearly youll be making a lot of calls.    Agent Licensing & Contracting Requirements  You MUST be current licensed and in good standing in at least your resident state (Non-resident licensing requirements will be discussed on an individual basis).  It is suggested, though not required, that you have current Errors & Omissions insurance coverage with at least minimum limits of $500K/$500K.  We will appoint you with our core carriers initially and additional carriers, as your product needs determine.   Leads  ALL leads over the entire course of your affiliation with us that we supply are provided to you by OAKTREE Brokerage at NO COST. The leads you will be provided will be Mail-back Life Leads, Internet Life Leads AND even OAKTREE Brokerage Book i.e. current and former clients with us that you can contact for new sales, policy reviews and up-sales including spouse policies, other family members, business coverage needs, etc. Please note that of course we have very strict replacement guidelines to ensure appropriate primary policy replacement when needed. Generally speaking, we dont do very much primary policy replacement when working with existing customers for obvious reasons. Our inforce book is approached entirely from an addition/upselling perspective. ONLY our best producing agents are given existing OAKTREE Brokerage clients as prospects. Beyond just being a good writer, we have to be sure at all times that ALL existing clients given as prospects are being handled properly. All of this said, there is NO mandatory period of time that you have to be with us before we will give you existing OAKTREE Brokerage clients as prospects. You can get those clients as part of your weekly lead flow very quickly. We just need you to convert when you get them and again we have to be able to trust youre working them properly. In short mail-back leads, internet leads, existing client leads, etc. all are provided to you in abundance at NO COST. And, of course we always welcome any customers/prospects generated on your own to be written through us as well, assuming the products we offer are suitable for that customers needs. That is ALWAYS very much appreciated, though NOT required.   Compensation  For ALL Virtual Agents, our range of commission is between 60-75%. All agents will start at the 60% level and commission increases will be based on the following 3 items:  #1 Consistent written production (8-10+ applications per week) #2 Placement (70%+ expected, in line with current company levels)                      Initials:_______________ #3 Persistency (OAKTREE Brokerage currently enjoys very strong retention levels on ALL policy types)  Again, up to 75% commission, additional bonuses and incentives are available PLUS renewals on our permanent products.  ALL of our top agents in our office earn 75% commission. Also, please keep in mind that we are high-volume producers. You will receive A LOT of leads every week. We are NOT field-writers and NOBODY in our office or organization writes an average of 2-5 applications each week, as is common for most field agents. Its a COMPLETELY different ball-game here with us at OAKTREE Brokerage.  Annualized Commissions  75% up front  Average Sale - $80 per month/roughly $1,000 annualized.  Sample Calculation  $83.33 monthly premium sale = $1,000 annualized $1,000 X *60% (starting individual commission rate) = $600 total commission $450 (*75%) advanced/paid to you at issue. Remaining $150 paid as-earned to you in policy months 10,11 & 12.  Average 4-5 paid cases per week = Average $1,800-$2,250 per week minimum earning expectation.  ALL Non-Med cases (roughly 90% of our business) are issued and approved within 48-72 hours. Pay day is weekly for ALL agents, even daily with some carriers. And, you can expect to be paid within 7 days of your first placed application.   One Time, FULLY REFUNDABLE Program Enrollment Payment  PLEASE read this section closely. We are looking for quality, profitable production for both you and us by adding competent, hard-working agents to our ranks. With every agent we work with, train and get into production, it is our hope that you join us, stay with us and earn with us for as long a period of time as possible. It is extremely important that you understand. We are training agents and supporting agents with an exceptional and cost effective, modern selling model to work WITH US. This program/position is NOT just a lead program. This position is what we do. This is ALL we do and, quite frankly, even though were very good at getting the right producers on-board and into production quickly, theres still some real work to be done. This is for nearly every agent an entirely different and very unique, new way of doing business. Even the most seasoned and experienced agents who join us will need training and detailed instruction on how to sell in this style, process business in this manner, and so on. That all said, this is that better mousetrap finally and once and for all. Once youre up and running on our system, I can all but guarantee you that your days of jumping in the car and venturing out to see prospects that may or may not buy even though youve gone to considerable time and expense those days will be over. Also, while were on the subject of training and the overall program in general, I want to stress that what we teach you is very private, trade secret information not to be shared or utilized elsewhere. Clearly, this is an extremely valuable model and we want committed producers willing/able to make a modest and FULLY REFUNDABLE upfront financial commitment. This commitment is intended to insure all of OAKTREE BROKERAGES COSTS including all training, all training materials AND ESPECIALLY ALL OF YOUR LEAD COSTS THAT WELL BE PROVIDING WHILE YOURE WORKING WITH US. As we all know, leads are very expensive and OAKTREE Brokerage will spend considerably on your leads alone over the course of your affiliation with us.   *Program Enrollment Payment is $500 (Will be discussed in detail during our phone appointment)   Finally, your one-time payment is FULLY REFUNDABLE to you once youve placed your first *5 cases with us totaling a minimum of $2,500 of annualized premium. When training is successfully completed and the refund                      Initials:_______________ requirements are met, you will receive a company check in the amount of your full enrollment payment. This check will be considered a bonus award for the successful completion of the training program including meeting your initial production requirement.   Hopefully you see, as we do, that what were asking for is very reasonable. Clearly, the point is to get quality agents into production and its NOT about the enrollment payment, as well be giving it back to you in full VERY quickly. You should have 5 cases paid within your second week with us. HOWEVER, again we will discuss this item in detail, as well everything else weve covered, as soon as we jump on the phone and have an opportunity to talk.   Thats everything! Again, if interested in moving forward to the next step, as I hope you are, E-MAIL ME at jwintrob@otbrokerage.com and let me know youd like to set a phone appointment. I will contact you back promptly with a proposed call time. Thank you for your interest and hope to hear from you very soon!!  Sincerely,  John A. Wintrob Managing Partner Lic.

Proficient in ID Theft  Internet","										In 1996 Pell Moore falsified documents to help Ponzi scheme con artists to obtain mortgage insurance for an FHA loan. If he was doing it then he is doing it now. Even worse, you never own true title to your home!Because the hazard insurance is not only used to obtain your Homeowners title policy, it also used to allow the originating lender to get Mortgage Ins. on the property. and you pay a premium in your mortgage payment, also known as Mortgage Insurance Premium or MIP.  In doing so, two insurance policies get placed on the home. If you are receiving forced place insurance when you already have insurance on your property this is a red flag.In my case one policy was paid through the mortgage payment (MIP) and a ""shadow"" policy is placed by the true investors, also known as Private Mortgage Insurance or PMI. The true investor or beneficiary will be listed on the Mortgage Insurance Certificate. Call HUD to see who is on yours if you have an FHA loan.The goal is to get the private investors insured under an FHA loan. This way the government guarantees to pay out on a default should the home be foreclosed on or in the event of a default in payments. The title company was also in on it.Google up Cheryl Wehlau of Gulf Coast Title now incarcerated for $8 MILLION Mortgage fraud scam. Major Financial Services, a Private Real Estate Investor Group, also known as Wealth Builders, Real Estate Entrepeuners Association, also known as Real Estate Investors Association, and by a plethora of other names, in conjunction with Pell Moore,  used my information to change and manipulate paperwork to send to the title company for the purpose of obtaining an FHA mortgage insurance certificate. He falsified documents by changing ( deliberately misspelling my name, a false address and two signatures on the same application, one for pretender lender and one for Countrywide Home loans.In addition he had me listed as the servicer on the loan. I assure you I never collected any monies for a mortgage payment on my own mortgage, but there I am, listed as the servicer for my own loan. He then used that info to get the broker, or in this case the true lender ( Major Financial Services ) a Mortgage Ins. Certificate. Afterward the pretender lender files the mortgage as the real party of interest, which is grounds for dismissal (lack of subject matter, lack of standing, and lack of jurisdiction for court to hear suit since they are not the real party in interest. BEWARE OF THIS SCAMMER AND CHECK YOUR CLOSING PAPERS, LOOK AT YOUR APPLICATION AND DEMAND A DEC PAGE FROM YOUR INSURANCE CARRIER FOR YOUR POLICY.",  Insurance Agencies

More importantly, in my view, Stacey Lui is a fraudster who may be undertaking various scams using her companies credit card.Heres are the facts.Stacey Lui of Toronto, Ontario, aka ""fraudster"" purchased a Stella an Dot Marrakesh necklace on Nov 24, 2012 through an online marketplace.Stacey Lui of Toronto, Ontario, a.k.a. ""scammer"" then requests for the item to be shipped to :Stacey Lui, Foresters, New Business 13th floor, 789 Don Mills Rd, Toronto, ON., M3C 1T9. Canada.After careful consideration and reviewing this address through the usps. [continued below]....																			.....com website, I realized it was a business. Understanding that this poses significant problems, since this transaction may be fraudulent and Stacey Lui may be using her companies credit card to make the purchase, I decided to cancel the transactionStacey Lui, then leaves negative feedback and also undertakes nefarious activities which would be considered 'defamation"" (not sure if there is an equivalent in Canadian law). Even if Stacey Lui of Toronto, Ontario, a.k.a. ""scammer"" who works for Foresters is not using her company credit card, then WHY would she be 1) making the purchase during her work hours 2) Using her companies computer to make the purchase (assuming that she has found a way to 'tunnel' through an ip filter to get around Foresters network block)  3) Having personal shipment be delivered to her workplace.After a careful review, I have found that forester does have protocols established http://www.foresters.com/us-en/About/Corporate-Governance/Documents/20121205-Foresters-Code-of-Ethics.pdfwhich do not necessarily exclude employee's from using the companies equipment, computer, delivery address for personal purchases, etc.... According to foresters 'code of ethics'Foresters assets  business machines, equipment, vehicles, buildings, business systems, telephones, mobile devices, computers, photocopiers, corporate credit and calling cards,electronic mail, instant messaging, voicemail, mail systems, for example  are to be used only for Foresters business. This does not prevent the occasional, minimal personal use of such assets, if appropriately disclosed and approved,The question now becomes, was her purchase of a Stella and Dot Marrakesh necklace approved by Foresters Managment? AND if so, do they approve of her using foresters equipment to do so. I thought that leaving my feedback is somewhat self deserving since  she will now know how it feels when someone leaves negative feedback, Once again, BEWARE of STACEY LUI OF FORESTERS, TORONTO, ON.

Free leads, nearly unlimited leads, etc. Sounded good, but the ""catch"" was that there was a $450 lead security deposit.

But, I wanted to confirm that if I didn't get appointed, that I'd be getting the deposit back. Mark's response ""Absolutely! It's only a deposit!"" Sounds good. No reason not to trust him.Similar to other reports, I was promised 70-80 leads/week and by week 2, I'd have enough to be very busy. Ok. But a couple weeks go by and nothing. After Thanksgiving, I get an email (that I'm sure was sent out to multiple agents), saying that we're almost ready to go.

In Googling the address, Robert's name comes up. Only, it isn't Halbot, but rather ""Robert James Abbott"". Here is his Utah license. Here is his CA license. Lastly, I have been in touch with the CA Attorney General, and I will be trying to contact any and all people who were scammed by these people (person?) in regards to this situation. I don't know if he got into an accident or not, but it's very hard to believe based on other people's claims. Contact me if you'd like to ensure that this person(persons) get prosecuted for this scam.

I worked for both for several years combined time. The Assurance Group is a real joke! As you can see from the pattern of complaints for several years they all basically say the same thing. They will steal your money! After making a few calls and some research I found that The Assurance Group is in several lawsuits from former agents. I followed the links from one of the posts on here to see that is true.  Now I find out that The Financial Market Place has joined forces with The Assurance Group (not sure when). A couple of the people I spoke with had received emails that said Ed Shackelford was in charge of all past and future commissions! I could not believe that. Mr. Myrick could not stand Ed Shackelford after working for him for several years and getting burned by him.That is why he started his own company. Before Mr. Myrick passed away I never had any trouble getting paid. Now I cant get my money that is owed or a response to why.  Some of the former agents for The Financial Market Place cant get a response from Algie Myrick, Terri Matthews or their secretary Tammy. From what I heard the clients were sold to The Assurance Group.  Once again my hard work for clients has been turned over to Ed Shackelford who holds all commissions and reports.I have made several calls to both the Insurance Commissioner and CMS. I received an email from CMS on the guidelines on agent pay from Medicare Advantage plans. CMS wants a full report from me for both companies.The guidelines are clear as to the amount and timing of payments to agents. It also says that the agent owns the right to contact the customer not the brokers (so the agent owns the business they write). It also says that the contracted companies through CMS like United health Care, Humana, Secure Horizons and so on have the responsibility to monitor agencies with ANY complaints which they have not done. I will send them the report that I am sending CMS and the Insurance Commissioner.  I have contacted the attorneys in the links from a previous story on Rip Off and am awaiting response on what they need from me.I guess its true what they say, Birds of a feather flock together! Its funny how greed of money changes people and pulls crooks together. Do yourself a favor. If you get a call from a company in Archdalenamed The Assurance Group, hang up! ",  Insurance Agencies

However, as he started to get older his son Charlie Cutler started to take over. In 2010 it became final that Tom would retire and Charlie would run the agency. An agency with mainly women working there, we all knew how Charlie was. I remember at times i would see half naked women on his computer desk top. But he was a good salesman and the owners son so he could do whatever he wanted. He would write the business and his notorious money hungry account manager Audra Pirestani would service it. She was the most aggressive account manager in the agency. She was strictly salaried, but would make additional income by endorsing coverage to the policies. She would tell lies to her clients to try to sell them additional insurance and products they didn't really need. She always wanted fake breast and made it clear at work. She figured if she was able to do 120 endorsements within 6 months she could afford to get them. In 6 months she ended up with 132 processed endorsements and generated an additional $34k in commissions for Charlie. WOW! On the other hand plastic surgery gave her that rare opportunity to make her inner appearance reflect her outer appearance. FAKE!  ",  Insurance Agencies

The rep. gathered all of my info, including copies of my existing policies, and gave me a quote for all three policies. She then asked if she could order inspections on the homes to proceed with the process of writing the policies. I agreed and she ordered the inspections. Prior to the inspections, and based on the information detailed in my existing policy, she quoted me $600 per year for the homeowners policy. My home is a brand new construction purchased six months ago in a Pulte subdivision. The sub is just 50% occupied so I can purchase new homes from Pulte in this sub for the same price I paid for mine. Once the inspections were complete, the insurance rep called me and said that the replacement value of the house came back 41.6% higher than I paid for the house. Keep in mind that this is a new construction house that I purchased just 6 months ago from Pulte. Since the inventory in this subdivision is only 50% sold, anyone at any time can purchase the exact same house as mine for the exact same price as I paid. She (the insurance rep) told me that this would increase the price of the policy to $728 per year (a 21.3% premium increase). I told her that the inspection was inaccurate and she said that there is nothing she can do about that. I asked for the name of the inspector so that I could file a formal complaint with Allstate corporate and she said that she didn't know who did the inspection. I asked for the name of the inspection company and she said that there is no company name, it's just anindividual. I said, how do you get ahold of them if you don't know their name?She replied, ""they just show up in our e-mail"".At this point I was frustrated and asked for information to file a formal complaint with Allstate. She said that she didn't have time because she had customers in the office! I asked to speak with John Ivkov (the actual agent) and that request was declined. Apparently, this agency feels no responsibility to ensure that their home inspections are accurate and has no problem hiking premiums on potential customers by over 21% at the last minute. Needless to say, I will never dobusiness with Allstate!",  Insurance Agencies

Archdale, North Carolina","										Wow, where to start with these jokers.  First off, I'm not some rookie, disgruntled sales person.  I've been in the business for a very long time, and joined The Assurance Group with the best intentions and no preconceived notions.Within a few months I started to realize there were some major inconsistencies with how they were running their business.  Let me share with you some facts, not opinions, because in all honesty I think the majority of the staff with ""TAG"" are great people....the major exception being some of the management team - Curt Klien specifically who any and all agents ultimately report to, and might possibly be the worst ""leader"" I've ever met....Forced to purchase their E&O coverage, which won't cover any carriers outside of their companyForced to be a captive agent, you must give up any outside carriers or contractsYou must assign all of your renewals and residuals to themInability to work areas of your choosing, you will be traveling to do door knocksLow contractsFive years before being vested - you leave, they keep your renewals and residualsHorrible commission schedule.  You will wait at least TWO weeks AFTER a policy is approved before you get paid.On that same note....you have to assign your commissions to TAG, which will hold them, deducts every lead cost, postage charge and supply shipment from them BEFORE you get paid....which takes FOREVER!Regarding their leads......read below for the real deal on how they work: - Their leads are garbage, but don't even think about complaining about it.  I know, I know, the fact that some of them are ""free"" sounds great.  Oh, and the fact that they finance them is awesome too, right??!  WRONG!  The free leads are, on average, 2-4 years old....good luck!   And literally HALF of the new leads, that you ultimately WILL pay for, are trash - low income, poor areas (which you can't decided whether or not to accept), clients with no money or checking accounts, and here's the biggest negative - You will be paying for leads from clients that did not even include a phone number.  A lead from a client that did NOT request coverage... Their response will be, ""just go door knock it, they sent it back for a reason"".....like I said, get ready for about 50% of your lead costs going towards THAT.After working with close to 50 different agents the consensus is this:  TAG is stuck in the stone age, and their company is filled with good ol' boys who have no clue how to sell insurance in 2012.  Their turnover is incredibly high.....even in an industry that has below average retention.  Don't waste your time with these country bumpkins, all it will do is frustrate you.  There are many other options out there where you don't need to give up your commissions, assign all of your renewals and residuals, and travel your entire state to door knock crap leads on your own dime.Hope this helps - wish I would have known these things before selling the opportunity to so many others.

My husband is disabled and our adult son had his hours cut.  They were happy to take my money and give me a policy on 10/16/12.The first part of November I started getting emails threatening to cancel my policy. I live in MD but it is a small town without home delivery to those of us living within the town proper. So all my mail goes to a P.O.Box.  I moved here from TX and, since my husband is disabled, I don't have the money to change my DL from TX to MD. When I got the policy the agent said it didn't matter. My son is on the policy and he does have a MD-DL showing our physical address. We all live together. My husband even has a MD-DL showing this address but he doesn't drive and is not on the policy.

It comes electronically and the address on it is the P.O.Box!  So I drove 20 miles round trip to the bank, get a copy of 30 days worth of transactions. His logic? Where I spend my money would show the general vicinity of my ""garage address"".  Keep in mind faxing is $2 per page and I have already faxed at least 5 pages. So faxed a copy of my son's DL, six pages of bank statement and a cover letter on 11/20/12. On 11/27/12 I get an email notice that my policy will be cancelled at 12:01 12/16/12 because I failed to prove where I live.I called from my cell phone since we have no landline. I waited nearly 45 minutes on hold, using my valuable cell minutes, only to be told that they have no record of me faxing them the bank statement. I have the paper showing that it went through. So guess what? They want me to fax everything again.  I told them I have the P.O.Box application from the Post Office with my PHYSICAL ADDRESS on it. That's only one page.

Insurance fraud, twisting, churning, insurance agent nightmare, dual agent application scam, fraudlent activity, senior abuse, customer abuse jacksonville, Florida","										I worked for this agency in 2009. During that time I saw every abuse and criminal activity one only hears about in insurance agent training. They claim as a new agent you'll work with a seasoned veteran during training and share in that agent's commissions. In reality, new agents get screwed out of the promised income because they let the field trainers work the appointments they expect to write policies on after dropping off the trainees back at the agency. Standard agency practices include twisting and churning. I personally witnessed agents rewriting policies after a trainee left the employment of the agency. The clever ""dual agent"" signing page allows the corrupt Jacksonville, FL agency I worked for add another agents name to the application after the fact. Keven Stephens of Liberty National (an ex Banker's hit man) told me he personally rewrote hundreds of policies every year during his employment with Banker's of Jacksonville to screw new agents out of commissions earned in order to redirect the commissions to newly hired agents. [continued below]....																			..... This agency is totally corrupt. You can do far better starting with an agency that is not predatory against both customers and agents. It's a dead end job. There is a reason Banker's Life and Casaulty Jacksonville Florida agency is not accredited with the Better Business Bureau. Keven Jeffries and his henchman Frank Fowler both demonstrate criminally intent. I remember one meeting where we were ordered to write guaranteed issue policies only due to it being the last week of the month. The training director Frank Fowler fielded a question by a trainee agent who inquired why he couldn't write fully underwritten policies to save the prospect hundreds of dollar a year in premiums. Frank replied ""do you want to write a policy that will pay you in 2 weeks guaranteed or one that may never pay you a dime?""									",  Insurance Agencies

 State Farm Insurance ,"  State Farm Insurance  POB 661029 Dallas, Texas United States of America ", , 866-879-3014,"State Farm Insurance  State Farm denies liability for multi-car accident Dallas, Texas","										According to crash report, at 10:08 pm witnesses called in an accident in progress: an oncoming vehicle lost control, crossed opposing traffic and flipped his vehicle. At the same time, my daughter encountered a puff of heavy smoke and collided with the other driver's debris-field in her lane. She pulled over the side of the road and called us (her parents and owners of the vehicle she was driving) at 10:09 pm (we have a text message with this time on it). We arrived before the police showed up.When the tow-truck driver arrived, he stated that the motor in our van was pushed back and he would consider it a total. When we called State Farm, they said the accident was our daughter's fault because she didn't avoid hitting the debris. They said liability is determined by degree of negligence. Evidently, crossing lanes of opposing traffic and leaving debris all over the road, ditch and field isn't sufficient. Nor is a heavy cloud of smoke or the mere seconds between the flipping car and oncoming traffic. By that reasoning, her only negligence was not possessing DNA to grow wings and fly to avoid the accident.Our daughter was not cited because even the officer did not consider her at fault. As a result of this accident, we lost a vehicle (with no recompense) and had to salvage the vehicle for towing and lot charges. This is wrong.We wrote a Senator and he forwarded our complaint to the Ohio Department of Insurance. They, in turn, wrote State Farm to resolve the matter. Of course State Farm continued to deny liability. I wrote our State Senator and he too, wrote State Farm. No one does anything. They just write letters, as though State Farm has any incentive to pay. They have an invested interest, but it is in declining this claim. They have financial motive to refuse. I cannot get an unbiased and fair result if State Farm is not held accountable by another agency. I am not surprised they continue to deny liability since they know they can get away with it.This type of self-governance does not work. Corporate greed is what led us to widespread fraud in Wall Street and the Banking collapse. It is what has led to class-action lawsuits against health insurance companies like Blue Cross and Blue Shield. It is responsible for some of the worst American atrocities against employees, clients and stockholders by large corporations like Enron and AIG. Large corporations are notorious for bullying and selling out everyone and everything except their own Board of Directors and CEOs. To expect them to behave in our best interests is ludicrous. They must be held accountable to more than a few impotent letters from equally impotent State departments and representatives.",  Insurance Agencies

I am a senior! Atlanta, Georgia","										October 1-5, 2012I received a call from a voice that identified himself as William Joe Davis who told me that there was a $1,000,000 life insurance policy on my husband that would expire in a few days.  I was the beneficiary.  The premium of $4,980.37 was due in 3 days.   To efficiently process the payment so that the policy would not lapse, Davis said I should send the money right away to a Romanian account.  Branch Rorzbr.   Account number ************0605.  Agent:   Raluca Adina Radulescu.   I was suppose send the payment by international transfer using the code:  IBAN  Ro03RZbr.    I said I needed proof that the policy existed.   I did not know of it and my husband could not remember ever having bought it.   But I told Davis that I would look for it in our files.   I was unable to find any such policy anywhere.The next morning I received a call from a voice that identified himself as Gregory Meeks who said I did not have to wire the money to Romaniathat I could get a bank draft from my bank then go to Wells Fargo and deposit it to their Wells Fargo (San Francisco) Account Number *******3735.   I was to use the payment transaction number 996334059 specifying it was a pre-authorization only.   I would be ableto release the funds later.  All this had to be completed by 2:00 PM in order to save the policy from cancelling out.   He gave me the insurance policy number **********59IP issued by Nova Financial.  I informed him that I was unable to locate the policy and that I would need a copy of it before I proceeded with any payment. I received a call from a voice that identified himself as David Bucher, a retired insurance agent, who told me that he was the training insurance agent at the company years ago where my husband used to work.  He named the company.that one of the trainee agents sold the original policy to my husband.   (More babble in an attempt to convince me.)  I wanted to send him some info about my business.  He agreed.  He gave me the address of 5401 Temple Street NW, Atlanta, GA 30305, which according to USPS.com does not exist.Over the course of several additional phone calls, I also told Meeks that I had never received a bill for the payment that was supposedly due.    Curious note:   He said this policy had premium payments every 5 year.   Meeks then said that they dont send out invoices.that the holder of the insurance policy was responsible for going into a web site to ask for it.  He never ever gave me a web site to access.   He also mentioned the need of a password.  I repeated that I never received a paper bill, I did not have copy of the policy, and I did know about any web site.  I said I would not make any payment until I had a copy of the policy.  I asked him to send me a copy of the policy.   He agreed to overnight it to me.Each call continued to pressure me to get the payment sent.   Then I was told that since my husband had been so good at getting all the previous payments in on time, that even if I was a little late, they could probably get any late fees waived.   Hmmm.   I thought the policy cancelled if I didnt pay it by the due date?!?!?   Now Im told about a grace period of several more days duration and they could get the late fee waived.   The next day I received a copy of the policy delivered by Colt Messenger Service, 770 S. Brea Blvd. Brea, CA 92821 phone number 714-257-0134.   When I opened the package, I received something that looked like a computer generated 9-page document copied from an email instead the multi-page preprinted documents expected.   Nova Financial Basic Life Insurance appeared in the document along with the policy number, my husbands plan sponsor (where he once worked) and my husbands name.  The policy date was the end of the previous month.  After payment, the policy would extend 5 years forward.  It also showed me (his wife) as beneficiary to the value of $1,250,000.  There was no other date, no company address, no phone numbers, and no address for my husband.  The insurance agent listed was Gregory Meeks, phone number 615-241-0186.  This was a policy that they said originated in 1982.  And the clincher is that the policy could not ever be renewed or revived unless the payment was kept current.More investigative work, I called the Colt Messenger Service to ask the originator of the delivery.  The person who I talked to refused to give this information.  He did say that he did not take that order and had no way to look it up; however, he did seem know that the order came through email.I had my local insurance agent review what I received.  He recognized immediately as a scam.probably geared toward seniors.",  Insurance Agencies

Monica tells me she's faxed over the  request to 3 doctors but NONE of them  have ever recieved anything. then Monica tells me she will ""re-fax"" and that i am to call them to make sure they got it.  lets review that.....I AM SUPPOSE TO DO THIS INCOMPETENT IDIOTS JOB BECAUSE SHE CAN'T USE A PHONE!!!!! guess what monica. i have a job and the only reason i could do what i did the last 3 days is because i am on the computer most the day as part of my job. what would a normal person do???? that is why you get away with your incompetence.  unfortunatly for you i was the wrong guy to mess with.   then i try to get hold of mike steere, david maciejewski, carla fritz, lee smith, chris amborg, michael fossenbger, and monica lang as well as a handful of others.  lee smith calls me back after 4pm and acted like a total ass. like i'm suppose to be grateful that he returned a phone call and then he lectures me about calling monica a ""skank"". sorry monica but that is the nicest name i could think of. i have so many other pet names for you. however, after 4pm there isn't much left to do as most doctors are gone for the day. and btw....why doesn't anyone seem to know the chain of command and who their supervisors are??? i'm still not sure who works for who but i know you are all under Dennis Glass. then lee smith tells me he has what he needs from 2 of the 3 doctors and with what he has he thinks Luz's claim will be denied. At that point i was ready to lose it. needless to say, i didn't sleep well last nite.  this morning at around 8am i sent an email to most of you on this list and then went about tracking down Dennis Glass.  when i got to his office his assistant who's name escapes me now as i can't find where i wrote it told me she would get someone on this after hearing of my frustrating story. i would like to thank her as it appears it was her boot that got you idiots off your asses.  however, by the time i spoke to her it had been over 4 hours since i sent you that email and guess what??? NOT ONE PHONE CALL!!!  you do know how to use a phone don't you??? then finally jo gregory calls me with lee smith on speaker phone and proceeds to tell me that they are going to pay the claim and i will have a check for about 1100.00 next week. i can hear in her voice that she expects me to all the sudden jump up and thank her for her intervention and expertise in solving this problem.  not once did i hear jo or lee say monica dropped the ball and will be disciplined. not once did i hear why carla, david, michael, monica, mike, chris, or lee hadn't called me til AFTER i got hold of Dennis Glass' office.  i guess the reason is that you had no intention of doing anything but ignoring me. making me sweat all weekend about  how i was going to float my bills til money came in.   in conclusion, i hope you all are sweating this weekend worrying about your jobs and what kind of discipline you will be recieving tuesday morning.  i hope you feel the stress and worry i felt.  i take your incompetence as a personal attack on my family.  i hope you all rupture your colons and end up in the hospital so you can feel as helpless as my wife does.  you tried to put me over a barrel and made me feel powerless because you have all the money in the world.  there is a special place in hell for idiots like you and i hope you all get there.  i'm sure you feel my anger in this letter but you have no idea of how angry i am.  i promise you this. you have bought Lincoln Financial thousands of dollars worth of bad press and this story will make it to the internet along with the method i used to get your attention. so you idiots better start doing your jobs because this could happen again and the next guy will have an easier time getting at you.  i don't think your superiors will tolerate another screw up like this. so try to enjoy your weekend as you look forward to tuesday's meetings.ROY Cone of the reason's they finally responded was i threatened legal action. for 200.00 i could sue them for up to 25k here in TN.  with this being consumer protection fraud i would also be entitled to triple damages so it would go to around 6k.  even if they were to beat me in court i would have subpoenaed at least 6 of these assholes. that means on top of hiring local counsel for at least 300/hour they would have to fly down 6 other people just to kick my ass.  Lincoln Financial only responds to threats. they don't even know how to use a phone.",  Insurance Agencies

I have never been charged tax on a lead service before and questioned this.  I was not happy this fact was not disclosed to me before the charge went through, but I let it go.  On June 5th, I received an email from the owner of the company stating he needed me to sign an acknowledgement form that stated how many leads I would be given and how the leads were to be provided.  I was also unaware I had to sign this agreement.  I was told there was no contract.  This is all happening AFTER they charged my account.  I went through the contract and everything seemed to be in order, so I sent it back and anticipated receiving leads that day.  June 15th came and I still had not received any leads.  I contacted Jared and asked where my leads were and he promised they would be sent that day, at latest the 16th of June.  On the 17th of June, I was very irritated and emailed cancel@policy5.com (as the contract requested me to do) and asked for a full refund.  I was immediately contacted by Temen (TJ) Williams (The owner of the company) regarding my cancellation.  He said it was my fault I had not received my leads, that my email provider must be blocking their emails.  I never requested to receive leads via email, I signed up for Client Space, a service Policy 5 provided to receive leads.  TJ went on to say he was sending leads immediately and I should receive leads by that afternoon.  (He later called to say he was having technical difficulties and I would receive leads the next day)  For the next couple days I received several leads that were completely bogus.  Every person/lead I received had no clue why I was calling, wrong phone number and addresses, didnt have names attached to them or they were in cities that were hours away from me.  The leads were supposed to be Zip Code, Age and Claim # specific, so I could target clientele in my area.  Every time I would call to ask why the lead was not complete or completely fake, TJ would get on the phone and act inappropriate, using profanity and becoming enraged when I said something he didnt like.   Everything this company had promised was a lie to this point.  I sent another email requesting cancellation of my account and a refund. (I had not even received enough leads to get through the free leads promised)  Again, TJ contacted me immediately and sent a barrage of emails and phone calls stating he was going to sue me for breach of contract and I would NEVER see a dime of my money back (Along with profanity and enraged behavior).  I was completely taken aback.  I received nothing from this company except for a few bogus leads, an earful from the owner and wasted time and energy. However, they walked away with $433.00 and there seems to be no recourse for me. Through the course of these events, I have come across information that I want to share.  The address they provided in SLC, Utah is non-existent.  Temen Williams is located in Van Nuys, California.  Please do not fall prey to this company.  You will NOT get the services promised, you WILL be treated inappropriately and you will NOT get your money backThis Guy is a professional Con Man.

 first financial Security ,"  first financial Security    Norcross, Georgia United States of America ",www.firstfinancialsecurity.com, 770-662-2222,"first financial Security  First Financial Security is a scam. I have the detail and proof! Norcross, Georgia","										To all you people..... who want to join First Financial Security aka FFS, This is the timeline of what you have to go through when you join .I got tired of my cousins and friends in Minnesota telling me to join FFS so I decided to do tremendous pain staking research on the company and its structure. But it was kinda fun - so enjoy. First they do switch and bait. They tell you that you only need 125 and your set. Wrong!The real price of getting in this business is around 1000. 125 for the membership with FFS. you pay 150 to your life insurance application. then 30 for each test. then 600 for the insurance to sale the insurance. they don't tell you any of this. - application and fees varies by state but 1000 is the ballpark.They constantly pressure you to go to their convention. They hold it in nice hotels but remember you are paying 25 which mean you are paying for the place not them. Ohh yeah, they will pressure you when you go to their meeting. It's not like those timeshare in Vegas where they pressure everybody. It'smore like 5 to 10 people on stage pointing at you and your friend that you making a big mistake not joining FFS. This is possible because 90% of the attendants are already member. They will make you feel super uncomfortable (just like in high school- so if you want that feeling I encourage you to go) but when you give in and join they act like your best friend.The licensing process usually take minimum of 3 months, if you pass on the first try. While you are trying to study for the test, your upline will continue to pressure you into giving out your clients to them. In the training part (which 99% of people who joined have to go through except if you are the top guys real friend) they give you 30% of 50% percent which is 15%. the 85% goes to your trainer and their upline. You have to do this until you made 6000 in total. So after training, you made them 5100 and you got 900, and that if you get the license! If not then they keep the whole $6000.They have this saying in FFS,  they will recruit anybody and ""let the system filter it out"". It just another way saying that they going to scam you by not telling you the real cost of starting and use you to sell life insurance to your friends and relative. It basically cost 1 grand to start the business and if you fail the insurance test, that's ok because they already sold insurance to all your friends and family plus got some of them to join. After you get your license, you get soo desperate (because they exhausted all the people you know that will buy life insurance in the training period) you start doing what they are doing. Youstart lying to people that it only cost  $125 and let the system filter them out. it's a vicious cycle. they are basically parasite. Walahhhh. You became a crook, a liar, just like them.- and to your own brother, sister, relative, and friends.Trust me they recruit anybody including : gangster, FOB, gogo dancer,  basically people dumb enough to believe them. So if you want to keep you professional image then you shouldn't join. They even got some doctors joining them too . I guess those doctors didn't do their research and fell for it. They look for people who are unemployed and desperate for a get rich quick. These trainer will act like your best friend. They will come stating that you are somehow related to them and they are doing you a big favor. If it was such a great opportunity then why is it only us lower class Asian descendent doing it? Why do you think not a lot of white are in FFS? Because they are smarter than that. Because these trainers cannot us these tactics on them.Their system is made to fail. That's why they are listed by the federal government as a pyramid scheme. The government already did the math and the math is that the top guy will make the most money  and the bottom guy will work their ass off for bread crumbs.And about the equity share they have people rooting for. It's a scam too. When you make 100k from 15% -30% percent commission then you probably made your top guys 700k. The main people have already diluted the share of the company. When you finally get your 100k to qualify you probably get like .0001% share because Gillies would already have 7 million in share plus everybody else share which is probably another 15 million it will get diluted. It's good to have high hopes your financial dreams, just not in other people dream.People state that Gillie is such an genius and a leader, but he started in this business with 95% (yes it was given to him). For example: If you sell one  life policy you get 30%. He will get 95-30= 65% if you are directly under him. Gillie didn't do anything special he just hype people up. He got there by lying to you about the $125. While all his follower are praising him.  Ohh! and the Gillie taunt that they do at the convention- well it came from WLG. FFS will tell you that you can build a team so don't worry about the 30% it's better than working by yourself for 100%. But the thing is you can go to any insurance broker and start with 90% to 100% and recruit people to work under you for 30% or whatever price you setup (in insurance business -these people are called subagent, in FFS these are call you downline). Just don't tell them that they can do the same. In a legit insurance firm, the people who get the 100% who hired you as an subagent usually pay you E&O insurance and pay for your office space but not in FFS. ""ohh yeah did I tell you they promote all their real friend to make it look like they worked really hard but they are just leaching from you. They are getting 70% to 85% from the beginning but they won't tell you this . They tell you they work from the bottom up but they really laughing at how hard you are working, I know this because one of the top guy from told a girlfriend  of mines when he was trying to flirt with her, while he was drunk ( he was telling her how rich he was) at a party""Some of them really believe that it is not a scam. Well who are those people. Just remember you working under someone who lied to you from the beginning about joining for 125 and encourage you to do the same to all your friends because the business cannot survive without them doing a switch and bait. And if you ask them later when you see the true cost they will tell you that they thought you already knew - as if they were really surprised. But since you guys been hanging for a month now and somehow you are related then it's hard to yell at them and it's too late to go back because you invested soo much time in it. In your head -Just a little mistake that they made I'll let them slide . But in their head they knew that they got another sucker. I bet they get the ""why didn't you tell me about the 1000"" all the time. This is what going to happen to you when you go to their convention. You will get all hype up! You will get pump up! Then when you come home you start getting desperate and desperation leads to lying to your friends and family. Yes you will make money. and it's only going to cost all your friends 1 grand each and probably a lifetime of friendship. That's why they pressure this everybody to go to these convention.They will tell you story like look at this lady she barely know how to speak English and she is making over 200k. It's because she didn't know that she was switching and baiting all her recruits. The really successful people in FFS don't know what they are doing they just recruit. They recruit like crazy and let the system filter these people out. can you imagine how much 1 grand did all these Hmong people lost if we all add it up? And the  Brian Moua (Gillie older brother) guy in FFS that state that he is the farmer who became rich from FFS don't believe him. Brian Moua was the guy who was in charge of all the Hmong portion of WLG ""who refinance most of all the Hmong people house before the housing crash. WLG is a pyramid scheme just like FFS. He made millions with the pyramid scheme and now he switch boat and tell people that he was a farmer. But there is some truth to that, all Hmong immigrant are farmer from the beginning. It's just weird how he didn't state that he was one of the top guys who made millions at WLG. - thanks drunk guy for comparing yourself with him ( you know who you are LOL).This is information was gather from several former FFS , spectators, and me. These are real experiences not something I made up. The people that I got this from were really emotional about what they went though. They bluntly express their hatred for the company. Don't believe me. Go find out yourself and join. Then try to get your friend to join under you for 1000. Wait,  they won't join? OK how about 125 to get in. Much better huh?Don't let these people in your house. Don't let them near your friends and family, because they going to trick them. And if you do, your friend and family are going to be calling you all day about joining FFS. it's a infectious lie that promise people false hopeIn conclusion, Yes you got scammed again. And yes by your own Hmong people again. But don't start hating. You just have to do your homework and be smart about it in the future. To all you Hmong girls be skeptic and do your homework before you believe what they tell you. It alright you live and you learn. if you found this information useful please forward to all your friends and relatives who would like to save 1000 - though Facebook, text message, mail, email whatever we use now. Print it out and give it out at the flea market, Hmong village, MN 4th of July, Hmong New year. If you already spent that 1 grand and went to hell of a ride with no profit my hearts goes out to you. To all you people in upline who made profit off FFS. LOL. you know what you did or too dumb to even notice. To all you FFS defender: please do your homework before accusing me. you know I'm right but I'm costing you your recruits so don't make lies about FFS to make it look good. I'm not saying all FFS people are bad. I'm saying that the FFS system is bad. The switch and bait technique is bad and illegal. Lawsuit! LOL. And if they told you the truth from the beginning they would have never gotten you to join FFS. Money make people do some weird things .

Government Back's Another Public Screwing!! Rapid City South Dakota,"   I am a disabledveteran suffering from agent-orange heart from Nam. Five years ago I purchaseda LC1200 air conditioner from Carlson's Appliances in Santa Monica I had theminstall the unit then they sold me a service contract with Assurant Solutions.I paid every year for four years $around $90.00 each year and $28.65 for thefirst payment this year. One day my landlord said she felt the unit wasdripping to much. I explained to her that I had an service contract and that Iwould have someone look at it. I dealt with customer service and was anappliance tech for over thirty years. I know about serving appliances and musicaudio equipment. When DG service center was sent over they never called to fineout any information regarding the location of the unit what floor I was on oreven how was the unit installed. That would have give the tech all theinformation he needed before coming no call. Then the tech shows up I give hima ten dollar tip before he even starts the work and I clearly said to him"" If YOU CAN""T DO THE JOB RIGHT DON""T START IT"" he assuredme everything will be o.k. He came with no ladder I had to let him use mine. Nodrop clothes I provided that. He claimed up the ladder removed two srew's I thought he was going to remove the hood and service it while he was upthere no he came done the ladder went back up sprayed on the radiator someform did something put the two srew's back came down did something more on theunit and gave me a receipt for service done. Great I left and a few hours laterI came back turned on the air and it is leaking worse then before. Now as a x-tech I know some units do that after service. So I called DG appliance servicethey said that they couldn't do service on the unit because it was installedwrong. WHAT!? I explained to them that Carlson sold me the unit they installedthey sold me the service contract and now after four years of paying theservice contract is not valid because it was installed wrong. I called Assurantthey basically said the same thing. What I told them was someone was going toget sued. They said I had to speak with Carlson's I called Carlson's said noway we installed it correctly. They called DG now DG say's I miss understood. Iwas a recon specialist tunnel rat in Nam security for NORAD a military policein the reverse and a CID under cover agent for drugs in the army reserve andcivilian adviser for them. And they think I misunderstood what? At first Iwanted all my payments back from Asssurant Solutions however being a logicalman I thought about it and I felt those four years I paid nothing happened withthe unit so I can't speculate of what could have happened all I can deal withis what happen after I paid this first months service contract payment $28.65.So I called Assurant and believe or not the first few people working basicallyas one said I couldn't care if your a vet or the president that is the way itis. Finally I was able to get some one there. I explained to her my problem andshe understood being she lost her son in Afghanistan she directed me to thewhat they called the presidential phone number and there finally afterexplaining again they agreed to refund me the $28.65. Then I have to have theair conditioner removed because my landlord only gave me three days to resolvethe issue and I was past that she was upset the service caused more problemsthat I had to buy a new portable air conditioner costing me $389.00. So Icalled Carlson''s to see if they would for customer service and to help aveteran out being at this point I don't know who is responsible and being theyinstalled it that they would help me out, No they want to charge me $75.00 theyinstalled they srewed up my service contract that is what Assurant Solutonssaid. Can You Help ME? My phone number is 310-442-8522. I feel completelybroken hearted that this B.S. is allowed to continue that veterans and thepublic keep getting ripped off.

I called them and they said I need to go through the details with them. I told them I have already and that it was all paid and no problem. They said I had been driving on the right and that made me a risk on the road (I wonder how we get insurance to drive on the continent?) and said they need to do a new quote. So not knowing any better I said ok. They came back with a price close to double the original quote. I didn't have the money to pay immediately and so arranged to pay it over 3 months. More problems!!They told me a letter would be sent out to me with the payment dates listed, but a letter never arrived until the letter came telling me they were going to cancel my policy if I didn't pay the installment and an extra 25 late payment fee. I call them again and they say that as I never got a letter they would waive the 25 and arrange the payments again with me on the phone. they took the first payment as agreed, then they took the next payment on the 10th of the next month and then this month they tried to take it on a holiday, when I could not put money into the account anyway, so now I get an extra 25 added on again.I have been to the financial ombudsman about them, which caused them to leave the quote at the second agreed price, but the trouble never stops. I asked them about what they would send back if I cancel the policy now, and they told me 167.00.This company are the biggest ripoff merchants I have ever had the misfortune to do business with and I am considering sending them an invoice for 50 for my time and telephone bill.Please if you read this avoid ""Be Wiser Insurance"" at all costs, they are not reputable by any means.I spoke to another insurance company about this and they told me that it's unheard of to be charged extra because you have driven on the other side of the road and quoted me a price of around 400, a very good deal.

For those of you in the business, you know how the rest of this goes: I build out the dialer, then he tells me what he really wants to do is run a ""push 1"" campaign (that's where you pick up your phone and some voice says ""want a new credit card? Press 1 now"" and then you get connected to an agent if you're dumb enough to press 1). Great. So I load up his custom audio file and configure his campaign. When he starts his dial he realizes that he'll need to dial against a zillion channels before he gets someone to press one. When he figures out that this is going to cost him big bucks, he abandons the dial.Here's where Quinn takes it one step too far: He then waits a month and charges back my labor for his dialer telling PayPal I never did the work. Classy move. Then he dodges a call from me asking him to explain. [continued below]....																			.....If that wasn't bad enough, he then has some random guy call me back to yell at me and sociopathically rationalize stealing from me (while Quinn is on the line) because he doesn't have the stones to do it himself. This guy who called himself ""Kevin"" (518-378-1771) even tries to extort more labor out of me ""because my PayPal reputation is on the line here"". He keeps saying that the dialer is an ""inferior product"". Okay. Whatever makes you feel better about stealing, I guess.In the first five seconds of the call this Kevin guy admits I did the work with a quick ""Well no, but it's an inferior product..."" Too bad PayPal only refunds for products not delivered, not for buyer's remorse when you decide that your unprofitable push 1 insurance scheme isn't the million dollar idea you originally thought it was.You can listen to that call here: http://5gigahertz.com/Skype-20120409-1119.mp3Even though this keeps happening a few times a year, you can still hear the surprise in my voice.I imagine I'm going to lose this PayPal dispute.

Western World is an underwriting organization, offering insurance products. They provide commercial general, professional, product liability, and commercial auto coverages.In 2005, the company reported $28 million in profits with $311 million in revenue. The company has $1.3 billion in assets.In my opinion this firm has a demonstrated miserable record of paying out on its claims.  Collecting premiums they like, paying out money they do NOT like and they spend quite a lot of time in the courts trying to hold onto every penney they can.From 1983 to 2011, Western World and its 2 clones, Tudor and Stratford Insurance companies, have been in 81 Federal Courts, from Arkansas to West Virginia, 392 times; 340 of these were civil cases, 16 bankruptcies and 36 appeals.  State cases are simply to many to bother counting.One of the larger actions Western World was involved in was big news on the West Coast and was reported in the press as:  ""Western World Insurance Company pays $2 million to settle group care homes discrimination claims"", when Western World agreed to settle a federal Fair Housing Act lawsuit for $2 million. The suit, a joint effort between the Fair Housing Council of Washington and the Fair Housing Council of Oregon, alleged that Western World systematically canceled the insurance policies of businesses that provided housing services to persons with mental disabilities.   In an unsuccessful motion to dismiss the suit Western World did not deny its discriminatory policies against persons with mental disabilities.Other egregious actions of Western World (Thomas F. Mulligan, President & CEO), Jimcor Agencies (Francis Mastowski, Sr.VP, 60 Craig Road, Montvale, NJ)  and their lawyer Carl A. Perrone of Iaciofano & Perrone (157 Washington St, Morristown, NJ), involved the owner of a building which was leased to a tenant and used as an adult book store.The Turnersville, NJ store was severely vandalized 12/29/10 and for over a year Western World stalled any payment by repeated requests for documents that had already been provided several times and by demands for information from the tenants, who were not part of the claim nor were they insured by Western World. The bookstore eventually filed suit saying that ""The refusal to pay coverage . . . has been wrongful without reasonable basis to deny, in bad faith, and designed to deny the benefit of insurance coverage by defendant""  The Owner of the building was forced to make repairs out of his own pocket despite having paid years worth of insurance premiums to Western World  The Owner's claim was for the $114,000 repair costs and $132,000 loss of earnings while the building was unusable.In a final piece of legal slight of hand Western World lawyer Carl Perrone cross filed against the prior tenant and with no proof at all stated in documents that they believed that the prior tenant caused the extensive damage and the Owner should be compensated by that tenant and not Western World Insurance, thus making the assertation that Western World had no duty to pay the insurance claim but the tenant should pay it!Details on these cases and others can be found at: http://westernworldinsurancestinks.blogspot.com/ and http://westernworldclaimsphotos.blogspot.com/This is another example of why consumers put insurance companies, like Western World, and their lawyers like Carl Perrone, on par with used car salesmen and IRS Agents.

Your troubled business practices are catching up to you. The people whose backs you broke to build your little business finally found a voice. I too am a disgruntled former employee, and use  employee very loosely. Pawn would be a much more appropriate title. You mention The financial services industry is not an easy industry to get started in which is one of the few points we may agree on. Lets discuss support for a moment; you start off by attempting to justify your so called support by discussing licensing fees. Point 1 - The fee for insurance for a line of authority is $120 (http://www.id.state.az.us/producers/forms/form_l-169.pdf). The test is $62 (www.prometric.com) and of course you will need study material. Study material can be purchased online at www.testteacheronline.com for $99. In total the cost is $281 for someone to do it without your support. There are many companies who will pay for licensing and I am confident you are aware of them, but we wont split hairs.  So, from the start, your support is costing money which you are pocketing. I personally can do without that type of support!Point 2  You mention We have investment professionals that have started their careers and have over 300 clients I would guess you may have an investment professional (singular) not professionals (plural). Given your horrible track record at developing anyone, it would be an amazing accomplishment if in fact you retained any more than one person for any length of time.   Point 3  In the previous company post, it mentions 50+ in experience.  With all that experience, I would think you would have more than one small office in Peoria. Im not asking for you to justify, only making a point that with that much time and experience, its only reasonable to expect more growth and more people who held on to such a great development program.Point 4  You gave many great reasons that people dont continue with you, and I want to elaborate. They left to start their own company because there was no support and they realized they could do it themselves. They left for another company because they actually wanted support which you promised but did not provide. Instead of giving respective candidates a reason to stay, you attempt to justify why people leave and are clearly justified in your own mind that it is OK. Your rational as to why people fail or leave your company is not appreciated. I am positive new recruits would rather read why they would succeed. Its obvious you cant speak to that point.Your company does not breed success. You prey on recent college grads that will provide you a list of friends and family. Once that list runs out, they are only left dazed and confused as to why they are being fired and why all the so called support has ended. The only thing being felt now is the pressure to make a new sale regardless of how and where.  Of your unsubstantiated $7million dollars in new sales, I would venture it was provided by new agents, their friends and family but not in part of any efforts done on behalf of the company for your agents. You have plans to reach $15million. You have been in business 27+ years with plans of growth whether its management development or business. Where is your track record? There is nothing but a path of destruction of thousands, yes thousands of past disgruntled reps who have their beloved family with your company that receive no compensation for their efforts and worse yet, the client receives no service because you have already been paid a commission and youre on to the next victim. We wont even mention your previous FINRA mediation(s) losses or the Bankruptcy(s).There are more ex-reps with your company than there are clients. This is a company that has been in business for decades using impressive words like growth, development, leader, management, etc. and has absolutely nothing to show for it. Mr. Simmers will shortly retire and sell the clients to the highest bidder. Run as fast as you can in the opposite direction. If you dont believe me, ask Simwey to substantiate their claims. Make them justify what exactly they will do for you. Ask about their marketing efforts and their track record from those efforts. Ask about previous agents success and ask to speak to those agents. Ask them to provide a staff tracker. This is a report that is kept that shows their staff and what stage they are in. After you have reviewed it, ask yourself if that is a report of a successful development program. Ask Mr. Simmers how many personal clients he has. Not accounts he inherited from terminated people, but personal clients that trust him with their hard earned money. Ask for their number and make phone calls.  Very Important note - Understand there is no $36K to $60K. It is solely commissions. Make them show you exactly how the pay works and make sure you understand it. The salary is a hook to get you there. Simwey may only God have mercy on your soul as no one else will. You have scammed people for years and will soon reap what you sow. I encourage everyone who has had my type of experience with this company to please post!!  Even though it is too late for you, dont allow others to find the same fate.

Please understand there are many factors which can lead to a rate increase. Some factors include statewide rate changes, general inflation and increases in the number of property claims within your state.Also your deductible was changed to $1000 from 1% which also increased your premium.If you have any additional questions about your new premium, our team of member service representatives can review your policy and discuss options that could save you money.

My biggest question and concern is that colonial penn is not making their customer aware of this 2 year grace period. I know this for fact because my mother knew she had less than 1 year to live, she would have rejected a insurance policy that said she had to live 2 years or longer in order to get full benefits. An example of how atrocious colonial penn is: If you buy health insurance and you only make 1 payment, then you get ill or injured and must have a major operation. The health insurance company would not dear say we deny your claim because you did not stay healthy for 2 years or more. Colonial Penn is a fraud and they will not get away with it if I have anything to do about it. They claim no medical evaluation and no health questions asked, which is true but this company needs to mention this 2 years grace period to people before they purchase a policy, which they are not doing obviously.

There were no requests asked of me in my initial conversation with Mr. [continued below]....																			..... Hart, if there were it could have gotten things moved along more quickly. Then after I get them the non-waiver agreement, there is no response. Nobody from Lloyds of London, Tapco or Crawco is doing anything. So, I called & emailed my agent again to let him know that I still have not heard from anyone. I then receive a call on 8/15/11 at 12:27 p.m., from Mr. John Toller, another representative from Crawford and Company. Although Mr. Hart never asked me for any documentation, on8/15/11, Mr. Toller asked me for an invoice for the newly installed A/C unit and pictures. I got them to him the very next day on 8/16/11. Then even though in our conversation on 8/15/11, Mr. Toller told me that he had the preliminary police incident information and he would file for the official police report (I have this on a digital voice recording to prove it), he subsequently sends me an email asking me to get the police report. Incidentally, I asked Mr. Toller how long it would take ""from A toZ"" to get this claim taken care of, he told me it would be done ""by the end of the week."" That would have meant 8/19/11, we're now at 10/19/11 and nothing has been resolved. I again sent an email to my agent, Patrick Craig, Mr. Toller and Mr. Hart stating that I was going to move forward with a complaint to the BBB and TDI, In the meantime, a local adjuster from Crawford and Company, Haley Woods, went out to the house, inspected the A/C then sent me an email stating theft is not covered! Then why even go out there, ask me for pictures, a police report an invoice, give me a claim number, tell me that I will be reimbursed for the balance after I pay my deductible (which is $2000 after paying the $500)? After I get all of the information to them, then suddenly Ms. Woods tells me via email that theft is not covered.** Fair Resolution:I was told by Mr. Hart that I would have to pay a $500 deductible. I paid $2500 for the A/C to be replaced. At this point, considering I have spent over two months and many hours, fighting with the agents, jumping through hoops and being deceived, Iwould like to be reimbursed the full $2500.

Treating us like criminals and liars, A&G used every trick to swindle us. Always new, endless excuses: items never covered in terms of the contract (which we never received despite endless requests); we were over-insured; A&G suppliers can replace items at 35% less than insured values; items becomecheaper over time (yet A&G automatically increases insured amount and premiums annually!); pay-out based on replacing quality items with inferior, cheap rubbish; size of house could never accommodate R 2 millions worth of possessions (yet A&G was happy to accept premiums on this sum each month!) and lastly  we wanted to enrich ourselves.

A&G has not honoured its legal responsibility to put us back in the same position as before the loss.We were insured for R 2,012,500, an accurate account of the value of the contents of our home. The largest electrical appliance that was destroyed in the fire was a Defy 530 litre chest freezer. A&G assessor Paul Wilson was made very aware of this freezer as it posed a major health risk due to its decaying contents. He promised to remove the contents, but never did. Following complaints and threats of legal action by the local Health Department, we eventually removed the decaying matterourselves. Furthermore, Paul Wilson intended replacing this item with a 210 litre freezer.Numerous items were blatantly excluded, for no apparent reason, from the inventory we were required to submit. (Inventory used to determine initial pay-out of R 883,792.00 - only 44.2% of the original claim).The value of most items was significantly reduced because Paul Wilson found replacement items of vastly inferior quality from low budget suppliers.All computers and every item in our home office at the time of fire were totally excluded because these were for business. No single computer, laptop or office item was used 100% exclusively for business purposes.

The contents of the garage was listed on the inventory and insured accordingly.We breed and show with Dachshunds and Whippets.

Utter rubbish!A&G frequently referred to the Bid or Buy website, which it used as a source to determine the value of many antiques destroyed in the fire. This website is an online auction site: people make an offer for an item which is for sale. Thiswebsite cannot be used to determine the real value of items. A&G offered 10% of the value of the 24-sitting Spode dinner service, other fine bone china, lead crystal glassware, silver items and a handmade Persian carpet. We obtained a quote from a supplier 2 years ago and the Spode dinner service alonewas valued in the vicinity of R 150,000.00. We paid the premium accordingly. Our greatest concern, which impacted significantly on the claim, is that we never received any official policy documents.

He provides a call list, and you call people all day long...most people are not interested, the ones who are cant be insured. When you finally find someone who might buy a policy you walk them through the application, send them to a medical exam and by that time 2 weeks have gone by.

Stay away! Pawtucket, Rhode Island","										I was one of the unfortunate souls to have been found by one of their Craigslist ads. Lucky for me, and I put lucky lightly, I was looking for an administrative assistant position and not a sales agent one.I was recruited... and I have to say this was one of the most dysfunctional companies I ever worked for. First off, The Pena Financial Group or the Pena Agency is NOT a ""business"". It is a part of the group National Agents Alliance, or NAA.NAA is another story in itself, with its cult mindset and HUGE MLM (multi-level marketing) which borderlines as an illegal pyramid scheme. Please look up further information on NAA and do NOT buy into it. It is NOTHING but a wormhole and failure waiting to happen and people have given up great jobs to wind up POOR.They expected that their administrative assistant be EVERYTHING -- I was not only doing clerical work for THREE, yes, THREE agents including pending applications, but I was also their human resource department.I had to hire new ""recruits"" or sales agents --- many of you might have seen the ads on Craigslist (which BREAKS Craigslist's terms of service as a company that is MLM or costs upfront fees is NOT supposed to post in the job section). These Craigslist ads often were looking for Athletes or Ex-Military people, claiming you could make up to 1k a week in income or over 100,000 a year.I was often told to lie to recruits, tell them I knew absolutely nothing about the details of the job and attempt to get their personal information such as full name, address, phone number and social security number in order to FasTract them onto the NAA website.I was also required to consistently call and harass people about getting signed up for expensive licensing classes, in which they were not told about having to pay upfront fees to get started until after they were signed up under NAA.I was also told to lie about the job being commission only, once again pushed to tell them I had no idea and direct them to either Paul or Beiya or, worse, Shawn Meaike who was their upline. They never told the recruits ANYTHING of value. Only how much money could be made in which they did not tell the recruits the amount of money they would have to spend on leads (information that is collected from consumers and SOLD back to agents), the charge backs, the amount of gas spent traveling, the licensing and liability insurance.I was also told that they would be able to ""finance"" recruits, which usually meant the recruit had to fill out a life insurance application so the recruiting agent could get the commission off of them.Many of the people who applied for this sales agent position were people without jobs who could not afford the upfront fees that I knew about. It was absolutely detestable to hear the hopefulness in people's voices about getting a job call back and setting them up for an ""interview"" - in which it was NEVER an interview. It was nothing but an informational meeting where they set-up MANY people from the same time slot. At this meeting, they only told you about how much money you could make.In terms of working with clients and doing applications, I saw my bosses, Paul Gonsalves and Beiyanil Pena (along with two other agents who worked out of the office, Jenny Rojas and Iliana De La Rosa) forge and erase information on life insurance applications to get the people approved so they could get their commissions. They usually told their clients not to list medical information that might get them declined by the life insurance companies. In which, the life insurance companies were legit - such as Mutual of Omaha, ING, Foresters, BUT there are much more cheaper options for many of the people who could NOT afford the premiums!They often whited out information, told clients not to list certain medical procedures along with ""guessing"" at their annual incomes and jobs. There were quite a few times when many clients claimed they ONLY wanted information and did NOT want to be signed up for a policy at all. They only agreed to speak to someone to gather brochures and paper work.I was usually left dealing with upset clientele who were wondering why an insurance company was contacting them for money when they only asked for information.Please, please! If you are in the sales business, stay away from National Agents Alliance, the Pena Financial Group/Agency, there are better, legit businesses that give you better support and more for your time and energy. And if you are an administrative assistant, this not the job for you! Please, find someone who will value your time, work and effort.I feel sorry for the poor person to work after me who I am sure had to go to their national conference in July, in which their conferences for NAA are nothing but expensive (they pay for NOTHING) lectures on how much money people have made.

That is not true. They have one position available that everyone starts in no matter what - the sales recruiting position (from the president's own mouth). You go through the first interview with their hiring manager Randy Yost. He is a good interviewer but lies to your face and has no problem doing so - more on that later. On the second interview, you meet with the President, Carolyn Luby, who isn't afraid to cross professional boundaries. She let me know she's going through a messy divorce without me prompting for that information. Also, everyone at the company I spoke with, and even the recruiter, let me know that she is very difficult to work with...red flags all around. Oh, and be prepared for a random person to walk into that interview and begin staring at you and taking notes. The president didn't even bother introducing this person.For the third interview, Randy had already let me know that since their sales work was done exclusively over the telephone, I shouldn't worry about what to wear - just come as you are. Verbatim, he said, don't worry about your dress, the panel doesn't care.So, I went about working (they only give you 48 hours to prepare) on the phone presentation. They had me come in, and I pulled out my multiple pages of scripts, product information, and objection answers that I had written from scratch and studied the entire allotted time.I went through the phone call in standard sales mode, addressing their ""no time"" objections and resisting talking about product before they were sold on me and the company. They said they would let the recruiter know. Guess what the recruiter said? They wouldn't hire me because I didn't appear prepared for the interview and I was dressed in business casual. HUH???!!!So, now I've wasted about a month in their pipeline only to have them lie to me on many occasions throughout the process. This company is BIG TROUBLE and I would recommend you stay away from them unless you want to spend your career being lied to and the first six months as a telemarketer.

I am an experienced licensed agaent representing different companies. I attended a webinar sponsored by Huggins Financial Group and that was what initially ceiled my fate for a nightmare that lasted 2 weeks.We will go right to the ""Heart of the Matter."" The compensaion plan was explained very carefully. This is a good thing. Right? I was informed I would receive 40% of the premium sold. Normally, it would be 60% but because I didn't wish to pay $28.00 per lead my commission would be reduced.Here is where you need to realize the Devil is in the Detail. First, I was advised that the average premium per aplication is $1200. I can report after selling 4 applications the amount of premium is 50% of that amount. Further, I was told I would receive 40% of premium. Not true. You receive 40% of target premium which is 10-40% less. Finally,  I was instructed that I had an option to send my applications direct to the insurance provider. This was fine except no training was provided so that unnecessary delays occurred in the application process. I should have been advised of this potential issue and applications would have been mailed direct to the agency.I had amazing success and after 2 weeks of driving to/from appointments, making presentations, writing applications and incurring an inordinate amount of mail expense, I made a grand total of $0.00. Not too good. Four applications were sold and 12 apointments out of a total of 14 leads were made. The leads were vetted by the Insurance Carrier.From a client perspective, their selling model is misleading and indeed full of chicannery. First, the watch word for their approach to selling Mortgage Insurance is FLEXIBILITY. The answer to every question is ""FLEXIBILIY."" they say, ""The customer is always in control.""I am here to report that the customer has no flexibility and is never in control. That is an illusion or maybe closer to pure delusion. Yes, the cost is 30% less when compared to any other options from even other companies but they are comparing their cost to the most expensive policy type of insurance on the market and one that few if any people would use for mortgage insurance. They sal that the client has the ability to take full, one half or no return of premium. That seems fair. The issue is that the first two are quite expensive as the rates are based on a permanent policy that builds cash value (not a good idea for mortgage insurance unless there are no client casflow issues). The problem with the no return of premium offer is that they say, the client can continue to pay premiums and have the policy for life. Yes, the agency finally admitted this is not true because no resonable amount of premium could possibly keep this policy going. The client would be 30 years older with no affordable insurance. As for the other options, there are much lower price options that would be far more cost effective than what they are presenting to the market.Finally, their management style is one of arrogance. Flexibility and Control are shouted from the highest mountain tops. Keep it simple and just follow the script word for word is their answers to all questions.It takes a woman. when my wife heard my so-called trainer hollering on the phone after the call ended she said, ""Who was that?"" When I told her it was my trainer, Jamie Davis, she said, ""Walk away."" I should have listened.Much more could be related about this agency but I would hope you have the idea, When you hear the name, ""Huggins Financial Group"" run baby run.It is not Caveat Emptor, Buyer Beware. It is Caveat Emptor, Buyer and potential client beware.If this comment helps just one person not to make my  mistake, it all would have been worth it.",  Insurance Agencies

Akron, Ohio","										John Petrowski is very well known in the field of health insurance.  He is the website owner of Agent Navigator, a free training ground for health insurance agents.  He is founder, President and Director of IHIAA (Independent Health Insurance Agents Association).  He owns the Maryland Health Plans, a company offering discount plans for medical and dental needs of Maryland residents.The man became more well known because of a number of complaints filed against himby some employees of his company, the Maryland Health Plans.  The complaints stemmed from John Petrowski's non-payment of their salaries and bonuses. His practice is to place an ad in his website for telemarketers.  He offers good salary, flexible working time, bonuses and more benefits.  When a person applies for the position, he schedules an interview and hires the applicant on the spot. [continued below]....																			.....John Petrowski discusses the terms of employment, the work schedule, the rate, and otherthings related to the telemarketing position. And he made sure that all these conditions were stated in the employment contract that he sends to the applicant for signature. Of course the employees fulfilled their end of the contract.  They worked according to schedule and they worked hard, inspired by the promised excellent salaries and working conditions.Some employees received their salaries for the first three weeks of working.  A majority of them did not get any cent up to the time they quitted their jobs.  So many excuses were given to them including the loss of their pay checks in the mail, his problems at home and with his wife, and his problems with the IRS.  He made promise after promise to his telemarketers but these promises did not materialize.  As they continued to follow up their money, they noticed that their phone calls and emails were not replied to. He turned on his voice mail and informed the caller about the problems he was facing.The employees started to think that there was something wrong going on, and whatever it was that John Petrowski was into, it needed to be stopped.  Some telemarketers filed a legal complaint and brought the man and his company to court. Some already got a court order in their favor.  However, there may still be others who are not doing any action against the owner of Maryland Health Plans. The employees who proved to be successful in their legal battle are encouraging these other victims to get out and seek justice.This man should not be allowed to get away because he will not stop and will continue to do his bad business practices, victimizing people on the process. Legal action should be taken against him, and there is hope that his license be cancelled.  Does this person owe you money? Then by all means take him to court.John Petrowski is the man you should stay away from.  The same is true with his company, the Maryland Health Plans.  If you can, you should also try to have an investigation conducted on the association he founded, the IHIAA.",  Insurance Agencies

So, I called a friend of mine in the ins. business and asked about her tactics and he stated that it was fraud. I proceeded to really look at our correspondence and was not happy. I realized that Phyllis was a bit shady, and her behavior was bad. I then found that I had no car ins.

I continued to request cancellation until December 20, 2010 before Kevin agreed to cancel the policies. After the cancellation of the automobile policies on December 20, 2010, the automobile insurance carrier (Progressive insurance) was really very honest and play fairly, Progressive  properly refunded me about 90% of the initial insurance premium. However Burke Insurance Services and IPFS Financial services failed to refund the unused portion of my premium saying that the money belongs to IPFS. After several request, Burke Insurance services later send me a check of $105.74 as the refund of the unused portion of the initial $2,249 premium. Both Kevin Burke and IPFS are unable to provide me any account breakdown showing how the premium was appropriated and why I was only due for a refund of $105.74 after 21 days of policy start up. When I called to request clarification Kevin Burke simply said to me,""you can go talk to your insurance litigation friend maybe he can help you understand why your refund is that small"".As for the yearly broker fee, Kevin Burke claimed he has earned the $1,000 dollars and no refund is due even though I cancelled the coverage the next day. Please be wary predators like Burke Insurance Services who only try to lure unsuspecting new contractors into huge debt.

 A Affordable Insurance Agency ,"  A Affordable Insurance Agency  486 Forest Ave Brockton, Massachusetts United States of America ", , (508) 588-4333,"A Affordable Insurance Agency  Not Giving the Facts Brockton, Massachusetts"," I had gone in duringOctober 2010to get a new insurance policy. I had signed all the paperwork, reviewed all of the information with the representative, inspected my car and was on my way. Unfortunately for me there was an issue with my mail, the first bill never got paid and insurance was cancelled, leaving me out $300 for the down payment. My fault, I should have realized it sooner that I hadn't paid. So in December 2010 I go back in. Same procedure, paperwork, reviewing information and signing documents to get insurance, paying another $300 down payment, but I need it. I needed full coverage because I have a bank loan on my car.  So just yesterday, 2/1/11, I get in an accident due to the snow and slam my front end into a pole. My car gets towed because it was not able to be driven, and I get home and immediately call my insurance company. While on the phone I ask about my rental so that I have something to get to work. They told me I had no rental on my policy. I was not expecting that. When I had spoke to the agent at A Affordable I asked them before I signed, I have FULL coverage on everything and i wont have any problems if I have an accident. They said no. Not once in the two visits and the two times I asked them did they say a word that rental was extra. They had me sign the paperwork saying I am signing for coverage, liability, etc etc. So I signed as they were going over every detail. There was a section in there about towing, which they said I didnt need because I had signed up for their towing package, similar to a AAA package, so I declined. I was unaware that this was also declining rental, which their package didnt have.  I understand I am at liability for signing without completely reading the whole document. I admit, that is my fault. But what upsets me is the fact that they are having people decline these certain things without telling them all of the facts so that they can make the commission on selling these separate packages. Now I am without my vehicle and paying out of pocket for a rental so that I dont lose my job due to insufficient transportation. And, to top it off, the manager of this branch was extremely rude to me, telling me that all of her employees disclose this information every single time they open a policy and that it was my fault for not listening. It was my fault for not reading, but I paid close attention to every word I was told, and not once in any of my visits to this location did they mention that this was an extra charge. Ive always had this standard in my full coverage.  So I would like to let anyone know who is planning to go to A Affordable to disregard what the employees are saying. Do not make the same mistake I did. Do not sign up for their separate towing package. Get AAA or something and read every last detail you can to aviod getting yourself in the financial predicament I now face. You will not get anywhere addressing issues with the location manager so avoid issues from the start. Lesson learned for me ",  Insurance Agencies

Box 31260 Internet United States of America ",www.progressive.com, 8007764737,"Progressive Insurance  Beware Progressive is a total ripoff , Internet"," Progressive has got to be the worst company that I've ever dealt with. On October 29 I took out a small policy on a 150cc scooter that I purchased. In Florida you are not required to carry insurance on a motorcycle or scooter, but I thought that I would rather be safe than sorry so I went to progressive for the policy. The entire policy cost me $70.70 for a years worth of cover, which I broke into two payments that would be auto drafted from my account. The first payment was taken the day I purchased the policy and the second and final payment posted to my account last month. Sometime, close to when the November payment posted, I received a noticed that Progressive wanted me to sign a form authorizing the auto payments. Given that they policy was already paid in full, really what's the point, so I did not sign it and send it back. So imagine my surprise today when I get an email notice saying that my next payment of $513.00 is due at the end of December. The scooter isn't running and I'm planning on selling, so it's a fairly simple decision to cancel the policy. I call their Customer Dis-Satisfaction line, explain that I want to cancel the policy and then I'm placed on hold, for an ""Expert"". I advise him that I want to policy canceled immediately, and he wants me to give him an explanation as to why I want to cancel the policy. Um, are you kidding me? I'm 42 years old and I don't have explain myself to you are anyone within this company as to why I want the policy canceled. He keeps pushing it, so just to get this done, I tell him I'm planning on selling it. He wants to know what the date of the sale is going to be. Wow, is this guy for real? I tell him I don't know what date the scoter is going to be sold and he tells me that he isn't going to cancel the policy because it's a requirement that I carry insurance in the state of Florida. At this point I'm really pissed because this ""Expert"" doesnt know the law in Florida. We get into a screaming match and of course the jack wagon hangs up on me. I call right back and demand to speak to a supervisor. I get a supervisor named Janet who proceeds to tell me that the $500.00 was charged because I didn't sign the stupid auto draft from and send it back. Now I'm hopping mad. The policy is paid in full and they have the freaking balls to charge me for not signing an auto draft from? Of course she wants to fix it and I'm not having any of it and want this policy canceled right now, not 10 minutes from now, but right now. Then we go back through the same crap of Florida requires you to carry insurance. I have to tell her to put me on old and look up the law. Of which she does because I'm hold for like 10 minutes. She come back and says that she will cancel the policy today. I say to so, I was correct that I'm not required to carry the insurance! She tries some BS and about I could get fines for dropping the policy. This is a point blank load of crap the law regarding motorcycle insurance is posted below. As you can see they were trying to strong arm me into keeping the tiny policy. Are they really this short of money that they have to point blank lie and try to seal from me? Please beware and don't use the company. Florida does not require motorcycle insurance for most riders. Only riders under 21 years of age or who do not wear a helmet are required to purchase motorcycle insurance. Many drivers, though, overlook a key technicality that could cause them future agony. According to the 2009 Florida Motorcycle Handbook, which is published by the Florida Department of Motor Vehicles, the state's Financial Responsibility law applies to drivers of all motor vehicles. The law stipulates that motorcycle drivers who fail to carry property damage and bodily injury liability coverage can lose their license and registration and be required to purchase mandatory high-risk motorcycle insurance. Such actions are taken only for motorcycle drivers who are involved in specific incidents, including convictions for DUI and involvement in crashes.  ",  Insurance Agencies

I will continue to use the services of the State Farm Insurance Agency but I will no longer be using this office. Over the past 6 months their level of customer service has been deteriorating to the point were I wonder how they can stay in business.We had two cars and our house insured with this company. In April we received a call about how when we sold an older vehicle in January they accidentaly canceled the policy for all three cars. They fixed it , no problem. Well recently we decided to sell a second car to my wife's sister. We called to remove the policy from this car and were told that it would be done in August. In September of this year I called to have new insurance cards sent to us and was told that the policy had lapsed on our 2nd car. Confused I inquired as to how this happened and was informed that it was because of non payment and that the policy had lapsed in JULY. The kicker is I was enrolled for auto pay and this should not have happened. We recieved no phone calls, letters, e-mail AND the person I spoke to in AUGUST regarding canceling the policy on the car we sold MADE NO MENTION WHATSOEVER of the policy being lapsed. We learned about this in the beginning of September and have been trying to get someone, ANYONE on the phone to discuss what to do to fix the issue. We did not receive a call back for over a week and when we did the person we worked with, Karen, told us it was our fault for letting the policy lapse and that we would now have to pay double the insurance rates because we were driving uninsured. After speaking with her I discussed the situation with the office manager Eric, who said he would work on fixing what happened and agreed that their lack of communication regarding the policy war "" 100% their fault. He promised to call back and then NEVER DID. Instead another agent called, told us that there was nothing they could do, that we were "" lucky"" that we were insurable by State Farm at all. REMEMBER, IT TOOK THEM A MONTH TO RETURN PHONE CALLS REGARDING THE SITUATION AND THEY FAILED TO CONTACT US IN THE FIRST PLACE. Also remember that I have been a loyal client with this particular agency for over 10 years.I would urge you to take your business to another agent as these people seem not to care at all about their clients and would rather place blame than fix a glaring issue with their ability to communicate or provide adequate customer service.

I did not authorize them to do so, and when I called, they told me I would have to write the corporate office to get my money back.  I did so immediately, and have not heard back from them in 2 months.I have called repeatedly, and they tell me that they don't have a number for the corporate office.  *EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back into your bank account that someone wrongfully takes it from you!   EDitor's Suggestions on how to et your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E. According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent! DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get. And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state. Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. 									",  Insurance Agencies

Like so many others I was unemployed and looking for work that would last. I got an e-mail, responded to it, went to an ""interview"" (cattle call), was totally taken in by the charming ""Rex"", Branch Manager. He said you'd have to work hard, but that 6 figures in a year or two would be the result. Only later did I learn that ""work hard"" meant committing 12-16 hours a day plus weekend time, and a whole lot of it had to be spent making largely useless phone calls, juggling piles of (largely useless) ""Surveys"" from those calls, and driving from business to business attempting to contact the person who was in charge of benefits, and/or the owner. Good luck, unless you drive 100's of miles to smaller surrounding towns. Repeatedly. Our call lists weren't filtered except by zip code, so most of the calls and stop-bys were businesses too small for us to work with, or Corporations whose headquarters were in another state, or Corporations who were headquartered in Dallas or Houston or somewhere else in Texas. Largely useless. But VERY time-and-gas consuming. When I asked for help organizing my wads of paper, or learning a new computer application, Rachel would snap something at me at warp speed, and I was left just as bewildered as before. I got reluctant to ask at all after she got right up in my face and snarled ""What? You need a baby-sitter? Well, I'm not a baby-sitter!"" in front of my co-workers. Lists could have been filtered out so that we were only calling on legitimate prospects - locally owned businesses with 10 or more employees: but the company prefers for their reps to do the same work over and over again, and then in a month turn out another batch of hopefuls to do it all over again, in the same areas that are being covered from the class before, and whoever's left from the class before that, and that, and that. Average of 1 (ONE) rep per class makes it through 6 months, according to not-so-charming-after-all Rex. Gee, wonder why. So I'd been doing as much of that as I could in 8 weeks or so (I'm 65, and had some health issues for about three weeks, when I couldn't breathe or speak well.) Finally got some appointments with decision-makers, to make a presentation. Except they refused to teach me how, and when I had asked to go along with a more seasoned employee to watch one, Rex and Rachel snarled ""No-you're not doing enough activity."" Solution? Pick a guy who's got some time, and send him with me to make the presentation, and pick up half of any commission. So now I'm looking at splitting any commissions from those 5 weeks of work with another rep who's got a couple hours invested. He actually closed one of them (a small company with 19 people) and enrollment was scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday. Rex fired me on Tuesday. So the $600 or so that I spent to get the license and constantly fill my tank, repair my car and computer, run copies, buy 3-rings and other equipment, is gone, and the day before I finally have a chance to make some of it back, I'm fired. The four other companies that I'd been working with will all go to the guy they sent in to do the presentations. So I'm ripped off of the money I spent, AND the money I was about to collect. They say the companies you get paperwork on are ""yours"", but they bring in other people, and split the commissions any way they please.  STAY AWAY!!!!!!

He knows people are in need and will work you from sun up to sun down with little to no pay..and under the table deals. During my interview process (3 TIMES you have to interview) to only be told come back for a 3 week training non paid..that is from 9 a til supposedly 3 or 4 pm which often goes over due to his need for attention and captivity of an audience. The 3rd week is VERY unorganized as you often have to ride with managers that are still in training themselves. My old manager would tell me how he was overworked...and overbooked and stressed behind the mileage/gas used to run appointments that were ALREADY seen recently!

He wants you to pay 5 dollar an appoinment he gives you BUT half of the time its already been seen BUT you still have to pay for it. VERY UNPROFESSIONALAlso Mondays and Thursdays are HORRIBLE..you have to be in the office from 9 am til around 2 or 3 just for a MEETING..YES he really talks that long! On top of that you have business check right after which may take an hour or 2 due to the fact he holds all of the mangers in managers meeting before we check business so were often left sitting and waiting...only to be back from 5 til 9..NOPE it doesnt end there..you have to stay after to wrap up the meeting. TIL 10ish! So your day starts at 9 and ends at 10ish p and you better hope the leads werent duplicates or in your neighbors leads or you will be stressed tired with NO SCHEDULE!

The Risk Group denied the claim and issued a counterclaim, contending that R+V had repudiated its obligations, but were unsuccessful. The court found that the addenda and their terms were clearly to the disadvantage of R+V. The existence of the addenda had been deliberately concealed from R+V's management, employees and accountants, and false descriptions had been given of their content. Furthermore, the chief executive of the Risk Group had been aware that the senior underwriter was acting without authority, and in breach of his duty to R+V. The Risk Group was ordered to pay the costs of R+V's claim and counterclaim. Two payments on account of costs were ordered in December 2004 and February 2005, neither of which had been complied with by the time of the hearing in November 2005.									",  Insurance Agencies

Health Insurance, out of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, I was very attracted to the company's offer.  (The lowest monthly cost I had heard all day.)After hearing the coverage and benefits, I was told the first months premium would be $439.95 ($289.95 for the monthly premium and $150.00 application fee), I was told that the insurance was underwritten by CEO Health out of New York and I was getting a ""group rate"" is why it was so low.  I told him I was very interested and would like to sign up.  He told me to stay on the line for the ""Verification Dept."" and they would take care of me.  Within seconds, a man named Scott Schneider, (my ""agent""...ha ha) came on the line and told me he was the ""Agent"" in Ft. Lauderdale for CEO Health.  He said he could set it up as an EFT on my bank account every month and that I would be receiving my ""packet"" within 7 - 10 business days.  Like an idiot, I gave him my bank information while I was looking at CEO's website, (which, by the way, was very impressive)  He told me if I had any questions, I could contact him anytime Mon. thru Fri. at 877-640-1663 ext. 1.  I thanked him and hung up waiting to receive my ""policy"" so I could read it over.Two weeks went by and I still had not received anything from the insurance company.  I tried to call Scott, at the 877 number he had given me an all I got was the phone company's ""beep...beep...beep..."" I went on-line to CEO's website and got their 800 number which I called and was led to another 800 customer service number.  Which in turn, led me to IRG's number 914-428-6400, which led me NO WHERE!Finally, on 5/7, going back to the ""customer service"" number, (Boy, it that a joke! I was on hold listening to their guitar music for over 23 minutes!) ""Glenda"" finally answered and sent me to the billing reps voicemail box.  It was full and I was disconnected.  I called back and stayed on hold another 21 minutes until ""Karen"" finally answered.  I told her that I wanted to cancel the policy.  I told her that I knew the $150 was non-refundable but I wanted my $289.95 put back into my account.  She gave me the fax number and the on-line address where I could cancel my policy, along with my policy number. (Which this was the first time I even knew what it was.) She told me it could take ""up to 30 days"" for my refund...NO PROBLEM!I faxed the cancellation letter and went online to the website she gave me and cancelled my enrollment.  I did this on May 7, 2010 at 3:15 PM (I have the e-mail notice they sent me) The policy was cancelled effective May 1.  I STILL have not been refunded any money as of today, June 8.  I have repeatedly tried to call ""Scott"" at 877-640-1663 and 954-640-1675 to no avail.  Also, the ""customer service"" email address he gave me, gets sent back as ""undeliverable"".  I called CEO healths' customer service number, 800-416-9907 in Ohio, again today.  After being on hold, with that same music again, for over 22 minutes, ""Lydia"" came on the line and sent me to ""Maria"", a billing representative.  I got her voicemail box.  She did, however call me back about 45 minutes later to tell me she, ""would have to send my inquiry to the billing department, (isn't that where she works?) and see what the problem is concerning my refund.""  By the way, that can take 3 to 7 days and she will have to call me back!""I just want CEO Health to refund my money!  This company is nothing but a ""RIPOFF"" and I hope this will be a warning for anyone looking for health coverage NOT to accept any offering from them.  I have NO idea where my ""agent"" disappeared to since the last and ONLY time I've been able to talk to him, is when he was getting my bank information from me to EFT the premiums!I feel that I may NEVER get my money back.  Normally I'm pretty skeptical of phone calls trying to sell me something but I was ""in the market"" so to speak for health insurance and it sounded like a great deal.  I hope this keeps any of you from making the same mistake I did.  Even IF the website looks legit, I'll NEVER buy anything over the phone again!  ",  Insurance Agencies

However, the most egregious part of our claim showed up when the money did not. We were told that a check would go out 'this' week it never showed up. We called Balboa (again) to see what might be holding up the payment now. Our account rep told us that the check had been put on hold for further investigation and was not able to supply any reason as to why. We called around a bit more within the company and a customer service rep told us that our claim was put back into investigation because my husband and I are not considered to be spouses in the state of Georgia... so they were going back through and removing anything that I paid for. Not only has Balboa taken our money for 10 years but now they throw in the offense of using Georgia's homophobic laws to not pay us.

Nowhere in that policy does it directly dicate how a person is considered a spouse. If you have Balboa as your renters insurance company it would behoove you to move your policy elsewhere.

She spent approximately 15-20 minutes on the roof. She was not equipped with a ladder, I had to supply one.  She took pictures but she did not put any markers in the photos to indicate what she was taking pictures of. After inspecting the roof, she came inside and spoke with me and told me that she did not see any hail damage. Let me add it took her over 2 weeks to come inspect my roof once the claim was filed.On 12/11/09 I had another roofer come out and look at my roof. He took pictures and indicated that I did indeed have hail damage. He also provided me with photos with markers showing where the hail damage was. Ultimately, Erie denied my claim and told me that they would not pay to have my roof replaced. I have had another insurance company, to inspect my roof and they also indicated that I had damage to my roof.  Since the first visit with Kathy Riser I have had a total of 3 different companies inspect my roof and say I have hail damage. Not to mention I have also been on my roof and can also say that there is indeed damage. On 12/17/2009, Michelle Stewart hung up the phone on me. She is a property Supervisor with Erie insurance. I was given her cell phone number and called her back and left a voicemail she never called me back. On 1/11/10 I called her on her landline again and she told me I was harassing her, on the phone. I have a witness that was right beside me and heard the whole conversation. This is not harassment at all; all she is trying to do is get leverage over on me. Michelle Stewart thinks she can get away with the way she talked to me, she cannot. She is supposed to be the property supervisor for Erie Insurance. Ive had Erie Insurance now and they are a wonderful company as long as you pay your premiums. But when it comes time to paying a claim they dont want anything to do with it. Also, Erie Insurance is telling me that these roofing companies are going door to door telling people they can get new roofs. This has nothing to do with it, this is irrelevant. Nobody came door to door and told me I could get a new roof. I have also talked with Phyllis Taylor at the corporate headquarters who is at 1-800-458-0811.  She told me she was going to get a letter out to me as far as what was going on. As of 2/24/10 I still have not received any documentation from her. This was stated in Dec. 2009. Also, Erie Insurance in Charlotte gave me 3 engineering companies to use to come to my home and look at my roof. My question is why cant I use who I want to use? They are mandating to me who I have to use. I didnt think it was legal for an insurance company to do that. One of the companies I spoke with told me it was a conflict of interest; they didnt feel like it was ethical because they do a lot of work for Erie Insurance. They are one of the companies that Erie Insurance referred me to use.On January 22, 2010, Michael D. Spensieri of Donan Engineering, another company Erie referred, came to inspect my roof. When asked how long he had been a Professional Engineer, he told me 6 months. He asked several questions, the main one being when was the approx. date of loss. Again, I told him I was not sure of exact date but know that it was in April. He said he would get that information from Erie. It took about 2 weeks to receive and review his report. Upon review of the report that Donan submitted the first discrepancy I noticed was that he stated date of loss was May 11, 2009. The report also stated that according to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) of the National Weather Service (www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/) did not report hail within 25 miles of the subject site for this date. That is not the date I gave Erie or Donan Engineering. I am not sure why they have decided to pull May 11, 2009 out of thin air.However, upon my own research using the same website, I did find that hail was reported in the area on April 10, 2009. This is in the same month in which I stated the loss occurred. I have attached those findings as well. Also, I reviewed the photos that Donan shot and compared them to the photos from the other roofing company and there is no detail at all in them. They did not zoom on any particular part of the roof. The only close up shot was taken of the nail pops. The Engineer also stated that there was No collateral indicators of hail impact on the light gauge metal flashing photo 0006. On photo 0008 in which the engineer stated the Collateral indicators of hail impact on roof vent cap. Difficult to see impacted areas with white paint on vent caps. Which is completely not the case in the photos that were taken by the other companies all of which are attached and areas are circled.  I spoke with Bob Waylon at Donan Engineering on Feb. 18, 2010. We discussed the discrepancies in the report and that we have numerous pictures from other companies that were blown up to 8x10 size to see damage was not in May but in April.  I indicated that I felt like their company was bias and represented Erie. I asked Mr. Waylon his title he indicated it was Territory Manager. I asked him if I could speak with the owner of the company and he would not let me do so. I then told him I was going to file a written complaint with the North Carolina Insurance Commissioner office. He hung up the phone on me at 3:19 pm during this conversation.  I called the office back and talked to his secretary, Keisha at 3:30 pm and she also hung up the phone on me. The number I called Mr. Waylon on was 205-420-8060 (cell). It is disrespectful and unprofessional to have 3 different people hang up the phone on me. In conclusion, my feeling is that this Engineer is trying to discredit this claim by stating that all damage is due to blistering, nail pops and man made causes. Clearly, that is not the case. Please note that upon further investigation, Erie Insurance in not accredited with the BBB (Better Business Bureau) with several complaints.  ",  Insurance Agencies

I was very shocked, because three months earlier on December 23, 2009, I had stated that I did not want an automatic withdrawal from my account as the funds were withdrawn over a week earlier than my Agent, Hank Tobin had informed me. Mr. Tobin was told that I would not have the funds in the bank u ntil the 18th, yet the withdrawal was made on December 14th, causing me to have $105.00 in overdraft. Mr. Tobin's response at the time, was that Blue Cross and Blue Shield can not be definite on their withdrawal date......that's fine, if my agent, who is representing his client would inform me of that.  Instead, I was told that I could not get coverage unless I had automatic withdrawals from a checking or savings. I know the danger of ACH withdrawals and I keep very little funds in my account. But I was informed that I could not get insurance without an auto draft.  THis later turned out to be a lie. The ACH hits 4 days early, I am hit with a $105.00 fee from my bank and the agent repsonse was that the bank should not have charged you, as there was nothing ever taken out.   Not only did this ruin my Christmas Holiday, but the insurance that should have cost $165.00 a month suddenly became $270.00. I called Blue Cross and Blue Shield, to complain about the charges, but that went to no avail and I never received a reply to the letter I sent to Blue Cross Blue Shield experessing my concern. After this incident, Mr. Tobin assured me that I would be direct billed for my future payments and no ACH would take place..this was on December 23, 2009. That is why I was shcocked to receive an email from Mr.Tobin in February stating that an ACH would take place on the 16th of February. I immediately emailed back Mr. Tobin, who emailed back to me that after spending an hour on the phone he had everything cleared up with the ACH.   Low and behold, a promise broken  and on 2/16 the ACH still comes out and I am hit with $70 in fees....... I immediately email Mr. Tobin, expressing my dissatisfaction with the service and aksing for the name and phone numnber of his Supervisor and a contact at Bluie Cross/Blue Shield.   My email went unanswered....and to add insult to injury, Bue Cross made another attempt withdrawal from my bank causing another $70.00 in charges.    I have now accumulated over $245.00 in overdraft fees, due to the negligence of an Insurance Agent, who was eveidently more concerned about the sale. If Adcahb is a reputable business, they would stand by the erroprs of their employees and reimburse me the $245.00 in bank charges.   To make matters even worse, in a conversation today (3/24/10) with Blue Cross, I was informed by the Bue Cross Representative Donna(call 1-1655966406)..That my agent never made a request to stop the ACH until February 12th...only after I caught the error on his email. THis is a blatant error and I should not have to suffer the monetary consequences of my agent's mistake.   Perhaps, Mr. Tobin was a new agent and was not aware of the policies, but it is a total lack of customer service not to respond to a customer concern and request to speak to a Supervisor.  Mr. Tobin may hav hid these errors from his Supervisors, but in that case, I can understand the lack of response from his Supervisor at Adcahb. I was left with no recourse but make reports to the Better Business Bureau and the Insurance Commissioner of the State of FLorida.           Insurance Buyers Beware,,,,the only thing representative Hank Tobin and Adcahb want is to sign you up and hit your account to make their commission....no customer service and no caring on their part for the customer..........Stay AWAY.....Blue Cross offers a great plan, I am hoping there are other agents out there that can sell it legitimately.   ",  Insurance Agencies

She did-stripped us of our contract, even though we were doing our job like our contract says.  She had no right to demote us due to her own personal issues against our relationship.Sabrina manipulated us with paying her $150/wk ($600/mo) saying that the money would be used to pay for someone to help me with some of my duties, but only later did she say that the money is really just to pay for her supplies-she was making me pay for her business all along!  Since when does an employer make their employee pay for their business?!  In total she stole $5,000 from me.  It is illegal to make an independent contractor do something, you can only 'ask', but she constantly threatened me with my contract that if i didn't pay that money that she would remove my contract-in fear of losing what i spent 9 months working for, i payed anyway only to learn now that that was illegal.  Plus no where in my contract did it state that I had to pay anything to anyone, it only states my management duties, which I fulfilled all of them.Sabrina made her agency do many things which were downright illegal, like during one 'team meeting' she made everyone pull up their phone records so she could peak into our private lives and see who we were talking to.  Recently she let her husband (who ironically is her manager since she didn't want my boyfriend and I to be together) grab my phone from my hand and look through it.  Later someone told me that I could have called the police because that was assault.She never took responsibility for her organization; when sales were down she always blamed me for being lazy,  when I have certificates to prove I was one of her top agents in the agency every week consistently for the 11 months that I was there, and my team had one of the highest production numbers for the last couple months I was there (not the sign of a lazy person).  Sabrina does illegal things within American Income Life Insurance Company-she does bad business which is illegal within the company, like she made me pay $215 to pay for a clients life insurance policy, just to get it back on the books, and made me lie to the client saying the company waived the premium for them.  She threatened me with my contract if I didn't do it.  She also was charging my clients for their ratings without letting them know, and a lot of my clients cancelled their policies because of it.  She also takes your entire team away from you before you get a certain promotion (which is MGA-a top management position) and makes you start all over.  SO if your team is producing 100K/wkly then all that would get put under her aka she now makes triple than if it was under you directly, and you have to start all over with your precious time and money to rebuild what would normally take you a year to accomplish a team like that.  SHE'S A THIEF.She constantly called me a lier, when she had no physical evidence of that (why she would hassle one of her top agents continuously is beyond me) but then all she does is run her business through lying and manipulating the poor souls who are stuck working in that agency.  She manipulated us into paying for our agency christmas party-her 2 managers she pays salary to went around to all 30 of us and said if we each give $100 then we'd get her and her husband Jay Z tickets which we later found out only ended up costing $1000 if that, then later someone over heard them saying that the money was used to pay for the christmas party.  What company makes YOU pay for their christmas party?!   ",  Insurance Agencies

That's when this Karl Lazar came on the line, identifying himself as the assistant manager. He came up with a completely different health plan for me than the first rep, insisted it was the best one for me (without giving me the option of looking at others), and had the annoying habit of interrupting me EVERY time I began to speak. This guy is slick. He got to the point that I needed to give him my bank information and slid right in to ""whenever you are ready."" I stopped him at that point and said no thank you. He put me on hold to ""check on something...see if the insurance company will allow no payment in advance."" I hung up on him. Since then, this blasted company has called me repeatedly. Every.

When I received my car on Oct 1st , 2009, Iimmediately noticed 3 new damages which were not there before.

I took photos of carin front of the driver and my witness. Before I paid the driver, I asked him tocall his boss, Robert Gabielson. He told me there will be no problem and justgo estimate the damages and fax to him, they will claim from their insurancecompany later. (But the broker delayed for over a week to give me the insuranceinformation. In the end, misled me intentionally by writing me the insurancecompany is Timberline Insurance Agency. The scam was followed up by theinsurance agent later. Diane Martin at Timberline Insurance Agency acted as anadjustor trying to reject my claim in all possible ways. I was never given theInsurance co ,mpanys contact by her.  And my claim was never filed withthe insurance carrier until I found the contact myself on www.fmcsa.dot.gov. Neither does she havean adjustors license in WA, (I checked with Washington Insurance Commissioneralready) nor was she authorized by the insurance company to act an adjustor.WhenI called the first time on Oct 9th, regarding my damages, she toldme to send her everything I have, but remained silent later.  She did notgive me a case number. Only told me both my estimates are below the deductible. When I asked her how much the deductible is, she only answered it doesnot matter. Finally she replied me an email saying: I have been advisedthat the broker, who arranged the transport, will be contacting youregarding your claim.Later, when the carrier falsified that I added more back to the Bill of Lading,she helped the carrier completely. Despite so many proofs I have sent to her,she dared to accuse me and never listened to me. All she wanted is to block anyclaims and frustrate the shippers like me. Her furious attitude gave me waymore stress and I felt there is nowhere I can make thisclarified.    Diane E. Martin also issued Atlasauto shipping an insurance certificate with 5 intentional ommissions/concealing. Especially for the carrier's insurance company, there is only ""Underwriters at LLoyd of London"", no phone number.. After wasting a lotof time and energy with Ms. Martin, and collecting all the evidences, I filed acomplaint about her with the D.O.I Wyoming(Complaint ## 10-6605I). But Shedared to write a letter to DOI that she filed my claim for me. The letter mustbe full of her lies, but the lousy law in Wyoming requires me to have an attorney torequest her letter. Again, the lousy Wyoming does not have a clear line between an insurance agent and adjuster, unlike other states such as WA. This tricky business never registered with its state BBB at wynco.bbb.org. But in fact, any business can be complained there, whether it'saccredited or registered. And you can complain to Federal Trade Commission at www.ftc.gov too, which is higher level.

"," I was contacted by phone in September 2009 by, who I thought was Bank of America, offering me an accidental death insurance plan.  I most likely told them to send me the information, and I would get back to them.  I would never have taken a plan like this, because I already have on.  They started taking 20.00 a month out of my bank accont without my authorization.  On January 9, 2010, I called and told them to stop immediately, and to refund the money.  No problem, they would do that.  I received a letter on January 17, 2010, telling me that there would be no refund, that I was covered for those months.  I called again on January 18, 2010.  This time I spoke with Omar and Lisa.  Lisa assured me that they would refund my 80.00 (because the fouth paying was in process) as soon as the last installment was receieved.  I have also requested a copy of the CD recording where I authorized this withdrawal.  I never signed any authorization or gave them my bank account number.  Nor did I ever get any information regarding a policy in the mail.  Now I am wondering if I should close the account.  I think I will.  I will be calling the FBI, and the writing the BBB.  EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder RipoffReport.com Author of www.ripoffrevenge.comRip-off Report PO Box 310, Tempe, Arizona 85280  ",  Insurance Agencies

Such as listing them as living in a parents residence, or making up a fake wife.  Some companies will not ask for proof and the client will get away with it.  Some clients receive uprates because they are later asked for proof of marriage or proof of low mileage.I have also seen them also purposely not ask clients all the information they are supposed to for the sake of keeping a quoted premium low/competetive.  The client will receive an uprate because an accident was not listed with the correct amount of points or a ticket was not listed at all.  The agent will make sure they have the clients signature on all necessary paperwork and then simply state that the client didn't disclose that information.  In reality, the client didn't tell because the agent didn't ask.  The clients don't always know everything they are supposed to disclose for an accurate quote.I don't know myself what the rule is for this, but I know the agents didn't always pull a motor vehicle report to write a policy unless it was going to be an important policy with a worthwhile premium.  I have also seen agents pull the ""MVR"" and purposely not list accident/tickets, or purposely list them incorrectly to lower the initial quote.On a few occasions, especially when audited, the owner/office manager has Forged signatures on documents or instructed employees to do the same to stay out of trouble.The agents constantly change their names to hide from troublesome clients. People who know that what was done to them was not right, and contact authorities.  The agents there do not give you their real names (some do, but the ones who have gotten into trouble don't). finally, This company has had a few Insurance companies that they aredirectly appointed with, which means that they are not allowed to charge any broker fee to write policies for those companies.  They have though, many times.  When they know they can get away with it, they will charge broker fees.  They charge as much as they think you are willing to pay.  I have seen hundreds of trusting people ripped off in the years I worked for this agency. Please do not be one of them.If anyone has any further information as to what steps may be taken to stop this, or even to bring justice to the people who have been taken advantage of already.  Please contact me.  ",  Insurance Agencies

Since it is a Bank of America affiliate, I sort of trust them. However, since I am getting full insurance coverage at my work place, there is no need for this extra insurance and I decided to terminate their services by July 2009. Hence, I called Bank of America and I was redirected to an insurance company called Apinion. Hence, I talk to the Apinion representative and they confirmed with me that my account was closed as of July 2009. Hence, all transaction after this should not be authorized. I complained to Bank of America about this and they credited the amount to me from May 2009 to August 2009. By September 2009, I got charged again, and I have to go through all the process, and again I confirmed with Apinion that my account was closed. Because of this harassment I have decided to close my BA account.Then I get another letter from Bank of America telling me that they will reverse their decision because their researcher said that it was authorized and they they a voice recording that I authorized it. It was authorized when they first called me but I don't recall authorizing after I closed the services. Hence, this company is very scrupulous, liar and a thief. I have already filed a case on the Better Business Bureau and I am going to check my legal option. With all these other complaints and Bank of America is still working with them, that tells me that BA is not totally honest with its consumer.

Yes, I got a similar email about my customer service/sales experience, and I went to the 'interview'. I was advised via phone that the 'group interviews' are done on a weekly basis.  We are also talking about training classes (2 full days at an out of town location, cost $80 and then other subsequent classes after that, total to equal 52 hours); a background check/credit check ($169) and Calif. state insurance agent license ($185).  Total of about $440 - all to be paid up front, maybe reimburseable somewhere down the line (or not), after you've taken the test, passed the test & background checks & got the papers signed/dotted to send to the Calif. State Insurance Commission for your license.I was the lone female with a group of 6 guys. One guy was not professionally dressed (pendleton shirt, brown cord pants, ugly brown work boots), one came in a suit jacket, shirt, pants and white tennis shoes.  The others were in a suit jacket, shirt, tie & well dressed.The presenter was a female (late 30s or so) who claimed to be w/the co for almost 10 yrs and moved up to be district sales mgr.  She stated that the president of the company was called out on a family emergency, so she was going to talk to the group about the company.   Once the presentation was completed (she had problems with the laptop & PowerPoint software program), this female called me into a private office for a 5 minute 'chat' about my resume.  I told her that while the 'opportunity' sounded interesting, I would not be able to give an answer until Thurs. 10/22.  She'll be calling on my cell phone.  It gave me enough time to research the information on line, spoke to my financial advisor about these folks on the stock market (supposedly publicly traded) etc.  He immediately saw red flags, sent me some additional web links with letters, etc. about HealthMarkets & Alliance for Affordable Services.It seems that these folks use Monster and/or CareerBuilder to send their 'form letters' for 'sales agent' or 'sales representative' for the insurance and other industries. I have come to the conclusion that only the sleazy companies (including those from a foreign country who want 'account reps') will use Monster/Career Builder to entice unsuspecting persons of a potentially legitimate opportunity.  The legitimate companies may bypass one of both job search engines.  I'll be posting my resume on Linked In early next week.I will be pulling my resume from both search engines shortly - it seems that when you update your resume & repost it, that's where the trouble starts/begins with these 'sales agents', 'financial advisors' or similar titles keep popping up on your inbox emails. Also beware that crooks from Malaysia are using the Nigerian scam stuff to email people with million dollar accounts from deceased relative- again, also thru Monster or Career Builder.Do your research on line about the companies - they may have been in business 10-25 years, but that doesn't mean they are reputable, don't have a bad track record, have paid massive fines & still do the same old stuff, just repackaged to deceive you.There's also the items of 'contests', 'promotions', 'competitions' among the 'agents' to see who can sell the most in a week, 2 weeks, etc.  There are these 'vacations' (Hawaii, Puerto Rico from what I heard), bonuses, winning of lap tops for getting residuals etc. I'll be declining the 'offer' to be a 'sales agent'.. obviously the fines and scams don't seem to bother these folks. It does to my husband and myself.  These places may want highly ethical 'agents' to work for them, but you can't do it if the company (national & local) are not ethical themselves.In closing - if you get an email through Monster or Career Builder re sales agent, sales rep, financial advisor or other multi level marketing, delete it, don't answer it, send it as spam abuse to your local email service etc.Attached please find the description of the 'sales representative' and 'sales leader' from HealthMarkets that I received.SALES REPRESENTATIVE / SALES LEADER DESCRIPTION:Immediate Weekly Income Potential > > -Call on prospects that have requested to see you > > -Multi Media Leads Provided > > Professional and ongoing Training > > -Prestigious Products and Services > > -Personal Sales and Leadership Development > > -Advancement Opportunities > > -Company Sponsored Stock Ownership Program > > -Bonus Programs and Trips > > -Annual first year potential is between $75,000 - $100,000.

Don't throw your money away New York, New York"," I used this company to acquire a large insurance policy. The insurance policy is for many rental properties and costs about $25,000 per year. I made a down payment of 25% (over $6,000) on August 30. Less than 30 days after the insurance policy started my agent at Dewitt Stern Group and Aspen Insurance UK Ltd notified me that they planned to cancel the insurance policy in 30 days because the properties did not meet their expectations in terms of physical condition (these were bank foreclosures that I purchased as an investment so they are far from being in great condition and this was explained to the insurance agent and insurance companies). I received this notice on September 28. My first installment payment was due on September 30 for $1700. I informed my insurance agent that she needed to cancel the policy and find another insurance company that would actually provide coverage for these properties. I also explained that I would not be paying for my September 30 payment since the policies were being canceled by the insurer effective October 28 (why would I continue to pay when I already pre-paid 3 months and the policy was being canceled in less than 60 days?). On October 10 I received a noticed from Budget Installment Corporation informing me that they planned to cancel my insurance policy for non-payment effective October 16 at 1201AM. This notice was mailed on October 5 from New York to me in the Chicago area. The law requires that they provide 10 days plus 3 days for mailing notice. They completely violated the law and left a group of over 50 properties without insurance. This is nothing more than fraud and theft. Avoid these companies like the plague. Don't make the mistake I made of giving them your hard-earned money only to be ripped off in less than 60 days. I normally don't bother filing complaints and reports about this sort of thing but when it involves a $25,000 annual insurance policy and a down payment of $6,000 that was essentially stolen I think it is more than appropriate. I also believe this company is involved in questionable practices with the finance company it uses - Budget Installment Corp. I believe they set up policies, collect the 25% down payment and then cancel the policies in less than 60 days so they can illegally retain 1-2 months of collected insurance premiums without refunding them to the insured or providing any actual insurance. They are not too far off from common thieves. You are better off keeping your money and self-insuring your property. ",  Insurance Agencies

I was left with four kids, one with a serious disability, a mountain of debt, the loss of our only income, and the trauma of losing our father and husband. He had Life Insurance through Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) in conjunction. The Border Patrol assisted me in filling out all of the claim paperwork within a couple of days and I submitted it. Since I was mailed an additional set of claim forms within the next couple of days, I refilled them out and sent in this second completed set. Our four children were named as beneficiaries and would receive their portions on the 18th birthdays. In the meantime, the money was to be placed in an interest-bearing account until they were eligible for payout. We heard nothing more for several years. When my oldest son was nearing his 18th birthday in October of 2007. We contacted MetLife to ensure he would get his money so he could continue his education. They explained to me that they had no account for my son. After multiple phone calls and too many transfers, I was referred back to FEGLI. They had me speak with about a dozen people before they came up with the explanation that I never designated what to do with the money for my children until they reached 18, and therefore the money was returned back to the Government. I explained to them that I had completed the paperwork twice, once with the assistance of the Border Patrol themselves. FEGLI insisted I was mistaken, the fault was mine, and therefore there was nothing I could do but start the process over. I was sent another set of paperwork and for the third time filled it out for all four children. They said it would take about a month for the money to be resent to MetLife and then a matter of a day or two before the accounts would be established and money available to my oldest son. The forms for all four children were completed, notarized, and mailed to FEGLI all in the same envelope. About 5 months later, he finally received his money, but no interest whatsoever. Almost 10 years of interest lost and then on top of that they blamed me. Shortly after my son received his money, I re-contacted FEGLI to check the status of my other childrens money to be sure that they were now in an interest bearing account, as this incompetence of FEGLI has cost them 10 years of interest as well. FEGLI told me they never received any paperwork for any of the children. Obviously they had received it as my oldest sons was processed and paid out. I filled out the forms for all four of them and sent them in the same envelope so if they got his, they got the paperwork for all of them. A few days later I received a fourth set of forms to fill out. I did so, had them notarized and returned them. It was recommended to me to send them certified mail, but since FEGLI only gives a P.O. Box, that was not possible. A follow-up call to FEGLI resulted in, you guessed it, you never filled out any forms, and a fifth set sent to the house. As a widow with several children, life insurance is supposed to help out the remaining family with living expenses and providing for the children. Schooling and raising them is not inexpensive, especially in this economy. FEGLI has demonstrated a consistent level of incompetence and mismanagement, and MetLife has never responded either. It is next to impossible to sue the Federal Government, and I cant imagine what forms they require then lose for that undertaking. I do not know what options are available to other Federal Employees or civilians that may deal with this insurance group, but if you really want to provide for your family in a worst-case scenario, these are not companies looking out for your family.

Finally towards the end of the month an adjuster called me up and said the underwriter had not been contacted until August 18. When the adjuster came out apparently he already had his mind up that this claim was going to be rejected because he did not bother to take pictures of most of the damage and didn't bother to inspect the roof. Also because of being jerked around for nearly a month and not doing any work on the interior because I believed the adjuster would prompty come out and I wanted him to see the original state I lost a month's rental income because the place was unlivable so I couldn't rent it out. But the story gets even worse. I gave Frank my credit card info thinking the insurance was being paid for and renewed.  Over a month later when I contacted the owner Len Garza I found out that my insurance had not even been renewed so I had no insurance for over a month! And even worse, he told me that my insurance was going up because my house had been vacant for over 30 days. I told him that if an adjuster had been sent out promptly as promised the house would now be rented out and would not be vacant.

The man that I spoke to was Jim Reid, he was supposed to be the head guy there, in the business for years, and on the phone was quite charming in his promises of hard work and dedication to service, he even said that he would be the one calling to set my appointments.

After a few more days I called in to see what the problem was and I got the usual run around about the economy and times are hard bla bla bla. It was at this point that I found out Jim Reid was not the one even calling for me. The next week they made an appointment for me. When I showed up to the clients house, the client stated that he told the man on the phone that he was not interested and already had an advisor. I didnt even get in the door.  When I called to complain they fought me all the way stating that it was  god appointment and I should have talked my way in.

When I objected and said that this was not part of the arrangement and I shouldnt be charged for this Jim Reid became furious and began yelling at me about he doesnt need to deal with ""bitchy and winey"" agents. He claims that his philosophy is that if you throw enough crap against the wall something has to stick. The bottom line is that I have been trying to call the company to try and get a refund since in 3 months thay had booked me zero face to face appointments. I have sent numerous emails and messages but no one has called me back.

Since that ceiling is just under  a shower on the second floor, I immediately stopped using the shower and  called the insurance company.It took my State Farm insurance agent, Matt Nickel, over a week to get  back to me. When he did, the best he could offer was discouragement about          how the policy probably wouldn't cover the damage.No offer to send out anyone to inspect it. Nothing but attitude. I called State Farm's regional office, who sent out an inspector. He looked at it in mid-September. Then he went back to his office to file a report. I didn't hear anything back from him for a week, at which time          he sent out a leak detection unit. The crew from the leak detection unit said that ""the damage was obviously          a shower pan leak and not a long term situation.""The State Farm policy does not cover damage from leaks, but it does cover fixing the source of any leak, like breakage, etc.Despite the leak detection unit's report, State Farm insisted that it would not fix the break. I did not request they fix the damage from the leak, only the break in the shower pan itself, which is a costly repair. That's why I have insurance. State Farm said they ""would get back  to me.""By late October, State Farm still had not gotten back to me. When I finally did get through to their agent, he informed me that ""the file had been closed"" in September.Some good neighbors, eh?I then pressed State Farm to send someone out and actually look at the property, at which time the regional supervisor agreed with me that my policy did cover fixing the break, but not the damage. He sent another agent out who carved a hole in my          ceiling and looked up at the damage. The State Farm agent decided that since there was water damage to the wood (duh, that's what leaks do),   State Farm wouldn't cover anything.Again, nobody was asking them to fix the damage, just the break, which is covered by their policy.RobEncino, CaliforniaU.S.A.

On Thursday Night 8/14/03, T.A.B.C. came into my place of business closing it down because my bonding was never updated. I called Bolger Insurance who then reinstated my bonding on 8/15/03. By this time it was too late. Bolger Insurance had my money order in early July and just sat on my money until it was too late. After a week's worth of calling and complaining, (and Bolger Insurance avoiding most of my calls along with giving me the run-a-round), my license was revoked and I am now out of business. I have since reapplied for a new license which cost me $1900.00 that I didn't have to spend. I am also looking at being closed down for at least a month. All Meredith Bolger Insurance had to do to remedy the mistake was fax a letter to T.A.B.C. stating that I had indeed paid on time. They couldn't even do that for me. I thought a lawsuit was in order for all of the damage Bolger Insurance has caused to me. I was advised by my lawyer that a lawsuit would be costly and not very effective. The only thing I can do now is warn others before it's too lateRoseCorpus Christi, TexasU.S.A.

UNBELEIVABLE!I called them and they state a rate increase went into effect the beginning of august. Never mentioned that, if they did, I would never have purchased the car. Now I cant afford the car, and had to lower the coverage to afford the payments,making it $25,000.-$50,000. instead of what they confirmed at purchase time of purchase.

It all revolves down to ""Bottom Dollars"" and revenue statistics and cost-cutting. I know, I deal directly with it within the company I work with and see the same thing happening to fellow employees. Unfortunately, I can't do much about it by myself unless this can somehow assist. The smaller insurance companies seem to offer better rates and coverages, but even these you have to research before hand. There's a lot of legal scams out there and insurance sales is one of the largest. I could continue for a long while, but hopefully people will research insurance brokers thoroughly. Dave Carpenter is a broker/agent that I would suggest people to really, really think twice about. You may think you know him really well, but so did I, if or when the tables get turned,don't be a statistic, check out another broker/agent. Women seem to be the best brokers or agents and tend to be more honest an sincere. They tend to have more values when it comes to your investments, so I'd suggest leaning towards finding a respectable female agent. At least, if you're going to stay with StateFarm, your chances may be a little more reputable.But as for Dave Carpenter, he's a highly professional con artist who's only getting richer by people such as yourself.Hope you don't become another statistic. Thanks for listening.TracyHartville, OhioU.S.A.

Nearly two years ago My boyfriend and I decided to renew our contracts and get new phones.  With the new phones we were offered an insurance policy on the phones for $4 more a month.  We thought well great now if our phones break or get lost we won't have any problems.  The phones we purchased were the new Sanyo SCP 5300.  Keep in mind these phones were about $350 at the time.  Unknown to us there is a problem with some of the phones and the hinges tend to pop off.  Back in May of this year the right hinge on my phone popped off.  The phone would open and close all day long in my pockets.  Eventually the battery would drain within 5-8 hours.  So I called Sprint to find out how to use the insurance and they gave me the number to Lock/Line.  I called Lock/Line and told them about the problem I had been having with my phone.  They told okay no problem we just need a $35 deductible from you.  This was right after my son had been in the hospital and I was swamped with bills.  I couldn't afford the deductible at the time.  I told the representative that I would call back when I had the money.  Again unknown to me I only had 60 days to pay this deductible.  The representative I had talked to had failed to tell me this when I told him I would call back when I had the money.  So when I called back two and a half months later when I had the money Lock/Line tells me that they won't replace my phone and the claim was expired.  I failed to pay the deductible on time.  When I told him that the previous representative had not informed me of the 60 days to pay he told me that they have know way of knowing that for sure.  So I figured okay fine I'll just have to change the battery more often than normal.  However, last week on September 26 the other hinge on the left side cracked.  Now the phone kind of reminds me of a spring loaded blade that automatically flips open.  Sometimes I have to use both of my hands so that the top of the phone doesn't fall off.  So I called Lock/Line to file another claim on the phone.  According to them they can't replace this phone at all since a claim was already filed on it.  So if the buttons pop off or the antenna, or the sreen stops working I'm basically screwed.  This is what they told me.  THEN WHAT EXACTLY HAVE I BEEN PAYING FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS.  Let alone the last two years.  I could have bought another phone by now.  I feel like I just paid these people for added stress in my life.  When I asked to speak to manager they transferred me to someone who spewed the same exact unwanted information.  I asked her well what are you going to do to make me feel better about paying you guys $4 a month for the past two years for nothing.  And she told me NOTHING.  I told her that this company is going to lose a customer and she told me that it didn't matter because they get new customers everyday.  If you ask me this company is very unprofessional.  Do you want to give your money to this company?  On top of that Sprint doesn't care either.  I told them what this company was doing to me.  The Sprint representative even agreed with me that it seemed a little unfair but there is nothing they can do about it.  I have to take it up with Lock/Line.  I then expressed how I was very unsatisfied with sprint for their choice in insurance agencies.  Also that I would be changing my wireless plan as soon as my contract was up.If anyone know how I can get around this whole not replacing my phone at all I could really use the help.!.!  My cell phone happens to be my home phone.  Basically I don't know how long my phone will hold out and when Lock/Line told me that I was SCREWED!!  They really meant it.TracyVancouver, WashingtonU.S.A.									",  Insurance Agencies

In fact I just laughed at the parody, when I typed in Homeowners Gold Star Special Deluxe.  There has not been anything gold or special in dealing with American Family Insurance.  My proof of that is simple - the sewage back-up occurred over 60 days ago and my wife, my 4 year old, my two year old, and myself are still displaced out of our household.  The construction company did not start the project yet because of items the original estimator overlooked and these allowances were not settled properly with American Family.  I am not trying to milk this thing for all it is worth; I am trying to protect my family, especially my children, from the harm of sewage bacteria, which your adjusters seem to not take very seriously.When this first happened it looked like everything was going to move quickly and be over in 6 weeks.  You can imagine our shock and dismay to now know we will not even be able to celebrate Christmas or the holiday season as we normally do.  My daughter is sleeping on a mattress on the front room floor where we would normally set up a Christmas tree and have family gather round.  When re-construction starts and the rest of the furniture is moved out, there will not be room for much of anything.  With my mother's severe osteoporosis, I question if the cramped living arrangements are safe now.  We did not move to an outside location  right away only because we thought this nightmare would be over in 6 weeks.My understanding of insurance coverage, especially Gold Star Special Deluxe, was to make sure this did not happen.  When we added sewage back-up coverage onto the policy, our agent knew it was because we turned a big part of the basement into a 720 square foot finished apartment for my family to live in and to help take better care of my mother.  We moved from Elk Grove Village into this basement apartment as we call it.Will was the first estimator from American Family to come out and take a look at our place.  He was cordial and took the time to answer my questions.  When we finally received his numbers and allowances on the claim, overall I was pretty happy, but did find a few discrepancies.  I thought they were small items that could be ironed out easily, but I'm finding out it was a huge mistake to even question the findings.  Now some things he allowed are now being disallowed by a second adjuster named Curt Costello.  Which teaches me there is no science to processing a claim, it must be all a matter of opinion - since 2 experienced adjusters are reporting different findings.  So please allow me to express my opinions too within this letter.In my first phone conversation with Curt on Oct.23rd, he let me know he would be in control of my claim now and get things expedited.  He let me know at that time, basements are uninhabitable.  Once again you can imagine my surprise at learning this, since my family and I have been living in this basement for over three years.  The first floor is my mother's personal dwelling space and she is the owner of this building.  My name was put on the home title when I first ran into financial difficulties in 1989 and she lent me monies.Curt also let me know the main item in question, a concrete patch, would most likely not be covered.  This is a thin concrete patch that was used to level our floors in a small hallway and into the 2 bedrooms.  The carpet normally covers it, so it is impossible to determine what the patch's condition was like before the sewage back-up.  But the whole point (regardless if it was already cracked or not) is sewage worked it's way under the patch and loosened the patch up which caused cracks and took an extra week to dry out.  I would like the patch removed and replaced simply because sewage was underneath it.  There is no way to kill it or clean it sufficiently without removing it.  There is no doubt the sewage temporarily trapped underneath it caused the patch to loosen and crack in areas.During this initial phone conversation Curt also let me know that even the source of the water damage was at question, that it could have possibly seeped in somewhere. He would make that determination after seeing the place.  I guess it made no sense to review the paperwork submitted by his coworkers prior to his happening on the scene.My understanding was the insurance was supposed to cover replacement cost and also cover similar living arrangements if our living quarters became unlivable. Quite simply, 2 families and their belongings and furnishings can not safely occupy 1200 square feet of space, especially when a 4 year old, a 2 year old, and an elderly person are involved. This arrangement is causing a lot of stress not only for my family but also a huge burden to my mother who has been on her own for over 8 years.  My son and daughter have now been sleeping on mattresses on the floor, my mother has lost over 60% of the space she is used to living in, and my wife has lost her kitchen and any way of keeping our household organized as we were used to.I don't even want to think about what will happen if someone in my family gets sick from mold bacteria or if my children hurt themselves trying to climb around all the furniture for the next 3 months.  All because Curt's opinion is we are not entitled to A.L.E. even though Will and Elida were ready to allow it before I asked for some minor adjustments.  Elida already sent us out to look at 3 different temporary places to stay.Also, on Monday the 25th I let Curt know I'd be out of town but could meet with him and my construction company on Friday the 29th and that was OK.  I did not want to slow the process down but my construction company felt I should be there.  When I called to confirm that Thursday, Curt said he could not make it till Monday the 1st of November.  That was impossible for me to be there that day.  My wife tells me that while he was here he even started to question whether or not all the drywall needed to be replaced even though all the drywall was wetted by sewage.  He also did not feel it was important for the paint to match after the project was completed as long as some paint was slapped up there.  Originally, we tried to put together a nice home for ourselves (even though this is a basement which some would look down upon).  We paid $29 per gallon for a better quality paint, we paid for lifetime Congoleum and a better grade of carpet and padding - I don't believe we'll get that replaced by American Family at the same quality.We spent a lot of time cleaning, tearing up the old carpet, trying to make room for construction, trying to prevent mold growth from the moisture.  Gutted a 40 year old workshop trying to make extra room, as we know this place will be like a dust storm when they zip out and replace all the bad drywall.  I even hurt my back and pulled an arm muscle and was in pain for 2 weeks trying to do some of the work on our own.  My children's birthdays just passed and this obviously put a damper on those events.  We really just want to get our place fixed up the way it was and as quickly as possible.  Our garage is old, dirty, and damp and I do not think you would want us to take a chance by storing our Ethan Allen furniture out there.  Yet furniture and boxes must still be moved out before construction can start.In summary, I am contesting two things.  First I'd like to be covered for A.L.E. during the construction process as it is a must for us to move out when the work starts.  On top of the other reasons I listed above, I will not subject my asthmatic wife to the smells of the bacterial cleaning and paint fumes and dust.  I will not have my 2 year old boy have his nap time destroyed by the noise that goes along with the construction.  Second, I'd like the concrete patch R&R to be covered so we don't land up with a future lawsuit over my children getting sick from bacteria and mold caused by the sewage back-up and not covered by your estimators.For your information, we are taking the necessary step to prevent this from happening again.  We are spending the $5300 it takes for proper sewage back-up control to be installed.  Wish we would have known about it sooner.  I wonder if our future insurance company will give us a discount for making this effort. Sincerely,PaulChicago, IllinoisU.S.A.									",  Insurance Agencies

I set up an appointment and went to see Cameron the next day. The next day, I met Cameron and was pleased when he told me that he could keep the original quote of $689.00 for a 6 month policy, including fees. The balance was to be divided into 5 monthly payments. The way this was shown to me by Cameron was $689.00 minus $328.00 is $361.00. Divide that by 6 and you get $60.00 a month. It is actually, from what the contract says, divided by 5 months giving me $72.20 a month payments. This I didn't know until the other day. I recieved a bill from Access General on the 20th of January for $94.00 a month, that was due on the 14th. It was post marked the 17th of January. Also the same day as the bill, came a cancellation notice. Apparantly Cameron only sent in $97.90 of my down payment, which according to Access General, wasn't even enough to cover me for one month. So, I called Cameron and he said that this is the dollar amount that we decided on when I was in his office. At this point, I was furious, so I faxed over a sign that said I was going to put up signs around Encino by his office building. The coward had some guy call me and pretend to be Cameron's boss. He said that if I would reinstate my insurance policy for $97.00, he would take $100.00 from his own pocket to send to me. Does he think I am that stupid?! He is so dumb, that he faxed me a copy of the contract (which I didn't have prior to that), that PROVES he ripped me off!!!To bring this to an end, Cameron stole my money, because he didn't send enough to the insurance company. I think it's because he is a liar & a coward, and when he has to talk to people to their face, he is too afraid to tell the truth. He says anything he wants, takes their money, and then tries to manipulate you into believing that this is what you agreed on. He CANNOT get away with this. If any of you have been lied to, stole from, or taken advantage of by Cameron, come to find out he is the owner, PLEASE contact me by using the rebuttal box below.

Some rebutals but mostly bad things. And after having dealt with them for a period of time as an employee I can say for certain that almost all of the bad things are in fact true. I feel so strongly about this that if any lawsuits are being brought up I am willing to be a part of them. But most important of all, I wish to warn either trainees, employees or clients to not ever get involved with this company.My story is pretty much the same as many others. I had recently moved to BC and was desperate for a job. I was fresh out of University and had bills to pay but no job to help me pay for them. The accounts from AIL stating that a person makes a minimum of $45,000 per year were just too hard to pass up. I mean I had invested in my future in University, why wouldn't I invest some money here.I spent the time (and more importantly the money) on ""training materials"", passed my tests and passed my training in record time (according to my supervising agents). The next thing I know, I'm getting sent all over the province at my own expense. I'm putting mileage on my car, paying for my hotel rooms and my food out of my own pocket. They tell us all it's a tax write off at the end of the year because we'll all be making so much money. Unfortunately, the only way to make money in this job is to have no morals, be good at lying and immerse yourself in their brainwashing 100%. Everything you do in this company is scripted and you begin to realize that you are pretty much decieving the people they tell you that you're trying to help.During cult-like brainwashing sessions every week, they like to try and make you believe that this is your own business and that you only have to answer to yourself. Not true. You are expected to work 6 to 7 days a week from 9 am to 8 pm. And THEN have training calls with your supervising agent. But the question remains, is the money worth it? No. Unless you are at the top of the food chain you make peanuts. Thanks to the brainwashing I had due to this company, I racked up my credit cards trying to live. All the while thinking of it as an investment in my future. Ya, looking back, I know it was incredibly naive of me but it's amazing the stories these guys weave. And when you try to get out, they all rally around you to try and get you to hang in there. The thing is, I think they believe it themselves.In the end, please do NOT sign on with this company. Don't mess up your future and your credit rating like I did. They threaten you when you don't make enough money for them and when you realize that they've in fact cost you one heck of a lot of money to in fact work for them they threaten you some more with government intervention and tell you that the government will come after you if you don't pay back money that they've never given you in the first place. They lie to get into people's homes. They turn you into a robot. They pretty much suck the life out of you. It's akin to an abusive relationship.And is their product worth it? Once you stand back from it  you realize that ""no, it really isn't"". They fleace potential clients and those who are already policy holders they love the best because they just keep milking them for more. All I can say is that I appologize for any one I hurt during my brief stint with this cult.Don't buy from these people. Don't let them in your door. Don't go to an interview with them. If you have one of their products, I suggest you cancel it and tell them why you are doing so. If you are working for them, get out! Tell others in the company about this site but get out. Don't even wait until you find another job. It's not worth it.ElizabethVancouver, British ColumbiaCanada									",  Insurance Agencies

HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action.  And good luck Let us know how you do! ED Magedson  Founder, Rip-off Report.com & Author of www.ripoffrevenge.com EDitor@ripoffreport.combadbusinessbureau.comwww.ripoffreport.com Don't let them get away with it. Make sure they make the Rip-off Report! We are not lawyers.We are not a collection agency. We are Consumer Advocates....the victims' advocate WE are Civil and Human Rights Activists We are a Worldwide Consumer Reporting News Agency...by consumers, for consumersCLICK HERE to read about Credit Card Scams... find out how to get your money back. *Rip-off Report Investigation provides valuable information.

I even asked him a question about the insurance, and he kinda blew  me off, and was very vague at answering. He then called each one of us in, for a brief interview, for only a few minutes, and he was REal persistent, about getting me to Sign Up, which I didn't . I then got an email from him, later that night, I asked him a couple of questions, about the prospecting, I never heard back from him. I almost went for it, Even my husband told me to go for it, get my insurance license, quit my job, and take from my 401k till I start making money.

I listened to a Mr. Willy Hayden extoll the virtues of working for AIL and how insurance is a ""recession-proof"" business. I would state that most of us in that presentation were unemployed and looking for a ""real job"" with ""real pay.""I then was asked back for a second interview with a Ms. Melanie Cohen. She seemed less sleazy than this Jay character. I actually liked her. But the fact was, she was not offering me a job either.The fact is that AIL uses people by requiring them to put in hours, dictating the times people will work, and then not paying them any benefits or salary. It is an MLM, and probably one of the most driven ones I've had contact with.I'm sure their system works, especially if you have no concerns outside of trying to make money,but the thing that bothered me was that instead of offering me a position, they were offering me an opportunity to be an independent contractor - and an opportunity to spend my money on gas to support thier business.Everyone starts at the same level. There are no MANAGEMENT POSITIONS.IN fact, there are no positions.The thing I can't figure out is why the IRS has not caught up with them because when you dictate hours and require someone to be at a location, then they are employees, not ICs.The best advice I can give based on my experience, is to wait for a REAL JOB to come around.

My medical problems resulted in severe depression; I had to start taking anti-depressants and begin counseling.  The ""disability"" unit denied my claim and didn't bother to notify my until 2-3 weeks after the fact.  They are NOW denying my disability due to the fact I went back to work.  Two doctors have stated that I shoud not be at work, however, regardless of my physical diagnosis and my mental health, I have dragged myself into work in order to get paid.  I am now at risk of being evicted (along with the utilites being shut off), losing my car, etc.  Today, I was told I may have cancer of my spine. I can't wait to see how they deal with that.Prudential has also denied 2 requests for a hardship withdrawal from my ESP, saying I didn't supply the correct documentation to support my monetary responsibility for the co-pay.  They have been supplied with TWO different reports from Aetna showing my financial responsibility for the THREE surgeries I have endured since July of 2004, and none of them have been sufficient.  Now, I am praying the apartment complex will issue an eviction notice, as they appear to want you by the ""short hairs"" in order to give me MY money.

","", 888-617-7906,National Agents Alliance ripoff Dallas Danville Virginia,"										I have a problem with their leads. I find that their leads are not that hot, and I have a problem with the way they distribute their leads.Let me explain, even though an agent buys the leads from NAA and pays for it by electronic draft on the agent's checking account, ALL LEADS BOUGHT ARE SENT TO THE GENERAL MANAGER where the potential for ABUSE is strong.Let me give an example of this potential for abuse. Lets say a general manager has 3 agents under him, and the manager orders 40 leads, 10 for him, and 30 for his 3 agents at 10 a piece, NOW NAA SENDS THE MANAGER ALL 40 leads. My question is what can prevent this manager from calling all 40 leads and setting his appointments for the week? then distribute the rest to his agents?--THIS IS THE ABUSE I AM TALIKING ABOUT.You see calling 40 leads is very different from calling 10 leads. In calling 40 leads the manager can easily set up 8 or 9 appoinments for himself. He can then buy the leads he sets appointment with, and distributes the rest to his agents.And I may add,  there is a strong motivation for him to do this, as these managers compete amoung themselves and there is tremdous pressure for them to produce and set an example to their agents.Please note I am not saying all managers do this, all I am saying the temtation is there for them to abuse the delivery of the leads.WHAT I COULD LIKE TO SEE SINCE THE AGENTS ARE PAYING FOR THE LEADS, IS FOR NAA to distribute the leads directly to the agents.My question is why don't NAA do this? it seems fair to me.LeeOmaha, NebraskaU.S.A.

HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action.  And good luck Let us know how you do! ED Magedson  Founder, Rip-off Report.com & Author of www.ripoffrevenge.com EDitor@RipoffReport.combadbusinessbureau.comwww.ripoffreport.com Don't let them get away with it. Make sure they make the Rip-off Report! We are not lawyers.We are not a collection agency. We are Consumer Advocates....the victims' advocate WE are Civil and Human Rights Activists We are a Worldwide Consumer Reporting News Agency...by consumers, for consumersCLICK HERE to read about Credit Card Scams... find out how to get your money back. *Rip-off Report Investigation provides valuable information.",  Insurance Agencies

I know about 75-80% of potential candidates I hired researched the company on this website. As a former Hiring Manager for Altig International in the Portland, Oregon office I want to alert potential candidates on a few things. Over 2 weeks ago our complete Hiring Manager team walked out of the Portland office. Over two months ago the company cut Salaries of the Hiring Manager by 60%. We continued to work for the company and continued to call resumes that we attained from a Resume Management System.What will happen is this company will contact you without looking at your resume. They just have a phone number list and will call anyone. It doesnt matter what your experience, age or job background is. What is going to happen is they will follow a well thought out script and have you come into an interview. The interview will be very brief and then you will enter a room with other candidates. You will go thru an orientation and at the end you will meet with the Hiring Manager 1 on 1. At that point you will be alerted that you will have to enroll in insurance school and pay roughly $450-$500 dollars. THEN THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU MUST PAY A $212 ADMINISTRATION FEE. They say the admin fee covers all materials and startup kits. IN REALITY, THE HIRING MANAGER WORKS OFF OF COMMISSION AND RECEIVES THE $212 DOLLARS. So that has the hiring manager hiring anybody and everybody. They will then set you up for a final interview with the Regional Manager Roger Fung. He will play a mind game in the interview asking ""why should i hire you."" He will then try to take the job away from you so you will appreciate it. Its all a set up. In reality if a Dog walked in with $212 they would hire the dog. I want all perspective candidates to know that you $212 goes right into the pocket of the individual that hires you. Very unethical. Who wants to work for a company that mass hires and is not equipped to train you. I know this because Roger will sit back in his office and play on the internet as his new insurance agents videotape their presentations over and over again. They tell you its about 4-6 weeks before you draw your first paycheck. In reality. I was there for over 11 months and it will take you in the ""Portland Office about 3 months."" Be very careful when they tell you they provide you with 150 leads a week. You will receive leads at the beginning but then will be asked for referrals to keep your business going. Once again be careful in your process with this company as you are only a number.MichaelTigard, OregonU.S.A.",  Insurance Agencies

I argue with him that he was fully covered and  I had his policy for over 9 years, however at his request I decided to give National Life Insurance a try at the request of one of their representative, who I personal knew.  Upon completion of all medical exams, and being cleared, the agent advises me upon payment of priemuem all would be completed, and my brother would be fully covered, upon meeting my brother the agent said he was a fine gentlemen and enjoyed meeting him.  The agent later requested that I fill out a replacement of Insurance for the prior insurance company I dealt with, I enthusiastically obliged unto his request, sign all necessary documents.  I estimate about two or three weeks later the agent then arrived at my place of business too present me with my policy. Only to have found out from my coworkers that I was not at work due unto the sudden death of my elder brother, (He suffer a massive heart attack and he never had any medical problems with his heart or never admitted unto anyone regarding any problems)  I later was contact by this agent,(he assured all my family members the policy would pay off) and he informed me that as long as my brother did not have any problems with his heart or any signs of pre heart problems, he was fully covered and the company will automatic enforced the policy for $30,000.  I felt so relieved until about two days later.  The agent said he was adviced to send the policy back and I was not entitled unto anything but a refund, he then requested that I attempt to contact my former insurance company and see if I could  put that policy back enforced instead.  I later had too spend out of pocket over $2800 to attempt to give my brother a respectful funeral, my relatives collected the additional cost.I really felt embarrassed with how things were handled and  a few days later I was returned my primium check of $60.00 in form of a check.  I refused to cash this check until this day.  I have contact legal professional who said that I have a strong case but requested that I go through probate court and  do other matters to request the release of his medical records.

I understand business, but I feel very strongly, that after 17 years of a 20 year term life insurance policy, one late payment should have not cancelled our insurance. WE WERE RIPPED OFF!!KathyLewistown, PennsylvaniaU.S.A.

 Dan Lawrie Insurance Brokers ,"  Dan Lawrie Insurance Brokers  105 Main St East Hamilton, Ontario Canada ","", 905-5257259,Dan Lawrie Insurance Brokers ripoff cancelled Home insurance without notification or reason Hamilton Ontario,"										My employer, in their infinite wisdom, recommended Dan Lawrie Insurance Brokers. After 30 years with another broker, I bought a new Home Owners policy through these incompetents & paid the years premium. Big mistake.Soon after signing, my mother had a heart attack in Florida. After spending 6 months there until she was fit to travel, we arrived home Feb 2nd 2006, to find a check and a note ""Home Owners Policy cancelled Dec 19th 2005"", no other information or reason was provided. The home was uninsured for 2 months.After a number of frustrating phone calls to the agent Cathy Philmister, she finally bothered to contact me.She informed me that I was cancelled for non-compliance...because they could not reach me by phone or mail, but she could not explain why they needed to contact me and a friend of mine & his family were living in the home providing access if the Insurance Company or anyone else required it.... meanwhile, Dan Lawrie sends their advertising updates via email which I received in Florida & responded to but did not receive a reply. Regardless of the situation with my mother and the fact that I could be reached via email she simply suggested it was too late & that I should go into a high-risk pool or find another agency. The latter is a catch 22 because once you have been cancelled no one else will touch you no matter how insignificant the reason. The high-risk pool she offered doubles the premium. I contacted the actual insurance company that held the policy, they were sympathetic about the cancellation but informed me that it was in fact Ms. Philmister, of Dan Lawrie who initiated the cancellation and they could not do anything about it.I have written to a number of people in the company and have not had the decency of a SINGLE reply. I even used their respective email addresses but again not one reply. We have significant real estate holdings and have never experienced such incredible incompetence before, live and learn. At the time Ms. Philmister signed me for the home-owners policy she also wanted the insurance for my vehicles but I declined. Thank God as she would have cancelled those as well.Unfortunately, there is no recourse for the consumer for this type of rip off/incompetence. However, I intend to notify every friend, colleague, mortgage and real estate broker about this Insurance brokers appalling customer service via the pre-eminent for of communication E-MAIL no less.PatrickBurlington, OntarioCanada									",  Insurance Agencies

Since about a year more and more companies don't care anymore about the do-not-call list because they think that they are smart enough not to be caught.The prerecorded message talked about an ""independent insurance agency"" without naming it or  giving any contact information. In order to find out who was violating the laws, I had to leave our phone number and state that I was interested in health insurance.  The next day a guy called Harries called me in regards to health insurance.  When I asked him for his phone number he hung up but a few minutes later the phone rang again and this time it was George Mitchell.  In order  to get the company name and phone number I had to act like I was interested in his insurance plans and he explained that he sells plans from ""Smart Healthcare Solutions""  he wanted to meet me in my home to make the contract. when I told him that I'd  prefer to come to his office he told me that  he does not have an office but could meet me in a hotel or restaurant.  I  pulled up his website  www.mitchellsfamilyinsurance.com  which shows an address at  3056 E.

","", 817-715-0349,Cornerstone America - Mid-West National - UICI ripoff Do Not Sign Up With These People!! Bedford Texas,"										This is a little complicated, so bear with me. At the bottom of this document, there will be a list of what I discovered, so read on and DON'T GET INVOLVED WITH THESE GUYS! Btw: these ripoffreports are great, but I've noticed that most of the respondents can't spell. This explains a great many things....SundayI received an email directly from a ""TODD KLEIN"" at Cornerstone America with a subject line ""In regards to your resume"" last Sunday. This had something to do with a sales position, but didn't mention the product. This is damn peculiar seeing's how I've been an I.T. guru for 25 years! This email from ""TODD KLEIN"" came from an SBCGLOBAL.NET email account. It stated that he thought I was a qualified sales rep. Right then, I knew this was a SCAM, but just for the helluva it, I played along. I replied to ""TODD KLEIN"" to have him to tell me more. You could not reach him by phone - EVER, just voice mail. I have all correspondence in these email threads between the two of us.MondayI received a reply from ""TODD KLEIN"" (from a mw-ins.com email address) asking me to come in for my ""INTERVIEW"" at their facility off of Airport Freeway in Bedford, TX and to be there at 10:00 the next day to discuss this ""Once-of-a-lifetime"" opportunity. I was close by, so I agreed to meet him. I got there a little early and noticed several cars pulling up with some respectable people going into the building. I followed suit.I met some chick named ""VERONICA"" (no last name, no business cards or email address. I spoke to her earlier by phone. I asked her what they sold, she was vague as hell. She gave me an an ""APPLICATION"" that was basically a contact info sheet. This was in the front office area. It was a nice place, but there wasn't a soul in the building that I could see. She led me to a ""CONFERENCE ROOM"" that looked a cool little movie theater with say, about 50 seats in it. All chairs even had their own little cup holders. How cute! In this ""CONFERENCE ROOM"" I found about a dozen of the people I saw out in the parking lot. After about a 10 minute wait, ""TODD KLEIN"" came in and did a NICE presentation. Only one lady asked a few questions. They told you how much ""MONEY"" you're going to make. You know, ""BIG MONEY"". He also said that this would be on a ""1099-BASIS"" (major flag).They told you that after a 3-day class, you'll take your test to obtain your license and then you're off to the races. You see, I make the ""BIG MONEY"" and that requires an ""EDUCATION"" of some sort, ""HARD WORK"", and ""DEDICATION"". This was too easy. Read a book, take a test, and then you'll be maikng 150k. This was starting to get fun. After the ""PRESENTATION"", I waited for my ""INTERVIEW"" with ""TODD KLEIN"" for about 10 minutes. I met with him for about 30 seconds and he asked me on a scale of 1-to-10, how do I think I'd fit in here. I told him a 10. He never asked about my background or anything like that. He told me he would call me back between 4:00 and 5:PM. He called right at 5:PM while I was grocery shopping. I didn't think he'd call to be honest with you. He wanted me to drive to his office in Dallas, Tx the following morning (the day I wrote this). He asked me to bring my driver's license, social security card and ""CHECK"" or ""MONEY ORDER"" in the amount of $247.00 USD. I agreed to meet him, but really had no intention of doing so. ""TODD KLEIN"" emailed me the info to find the place along with a STRANGE REQUEST"". This came from his email to me:Make it out to TKIA and I in turn will then send off a money order to the Insurance Center who will then send off a check to TDI. I enjoyed our meeting as well and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. ToddI already knew what ""TKIA"" (Todd Klein Insurance Agency) and ""TDI"" (Texas Department of Insurance) had to stand for. I asked him so he would put it in print. His response is below.The insurance center is UICI our parent company.  I send all paperwork into them to process and send off to TDI.  I convert all checks to money orders because I have had people in the past bounce checks which I ended up having to cover.  So it is basically just covering myself.  For all of the people that I hire for the week I just send over a money order to the insurance center so that I am not held responsible for any bounced checks.  I hope that this clarifies things a little and I am sure that you would not bounce any check, however I just have always taken this precaution and will continue to do so for my own safety.ToddHe better be worried about his ""SAFETY"". (Did I say that?)That evening I researched the h**l out of ""CORNERSTONE AMERICA"", ""UICI"" (the parent company apparently, and ""MID-WEST NATIONAL LIFE OF TENNESSEE"". My findings are below with my commentary. This won't let you hyperlink, so I'll give you the keywords you can use on a search engine under my heading ""RESOURCES"". You might want to take a 5-minute break before continuing....WHAT IS KNOWN (or rather unknown in some instances)""CORNERSTONE AMERICA"", ""UICI"", ""MID-WEST"", et al There is no listing in the phonebooks anywhere in Texas, but In Bedford, there are two buildings with their sign. There are listings for ""UICI"" however.Why were there no people (staff) there?They ARE NOT A LICENSED INSURER! See ""RESOURCES"" at the end and check for yourself. This is an official Texas site. On this site, look up ""CORNERSTONE"", ""UICI"", ""MID-WEST"" or Todd's like company called ""TKIA"". The Texas Dept of Insurance has never heard of them.""TODD KLEIN"" is licensed however, in CO. He can't sell insurance here in Texas.You would work for them on a 1099-basis (contractor). If they, or you violate any law as outlined in the insurance code, YOU, NOT THEM ARE IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY!!!!! Want to lose your house?Web addresses ""mw-ins.com"" (Mid-West Insurance)and ""uoneofakind.com"" (off of their brochure) all REDIRECT YOU to ""cornerstoneamerica.net"". Why are ""TODD KLEIN"" and ""VERONICA'S"" phone numbers different on each email exchange? One of ""TODD KLEIN'S"" numbers had a CO area code. He did say in the presentation that he was from CO, but had been here for some time.What does ""UICI"" stand for? Who knows? It ain't on the web.There is a valid website for MIDWEST, but it's not mw-ins.com like ""TODD KLEIN'S"" email address. MIDWEST is of ""TENNESSEE"", but they may be headquartered here in Tx. Licensing requirements. Goto the site below to check this out. You can't get licensed in 3 days like you think. Search for a document called the ""INSURANCE CODE"". To be licensed, you'll need far more than 3 days's worth of ""TRAINING"".So what about the fees to get my license? The state website will show you that some tests ar $50 dollars and some are $65. ""TODD KLEIN"" said the $240 was for the test (one) and license fees. It doesn't add up ""TODD-STER"". More on the ""FEES"". OK, so ""TODD KLEIN"" emailed me asking me to write a check to ""TKIA"" for the fees right? He'll deposit my check to make sure it doesn't ""BOUNCE"". He'll then send a MONEY-ORDER to ""UICI"", which in turn will send my money to the ""TDI"". Remember, all MONEY-ORDERS ARE UNTRACEABLE! Either way you look at it, this transaction is damn peculiar!!Now for some speculationIf I make out a check to ""T K I A"" and the letters are a little spaced apart, you can insert ""ood"" do it looks like ""Todd"" and then insert ""le"" in between the ""K"" and the ""I"", followed by one quick swipe changing the ""A"" to an ""N"" and what to you get? You get ""todd FING klein"". I grew up in banking and we used to play little games like that thinking of clever acronyms to change into a person's name on a check. The bulls**about him ""PROTECTING"" himself from hot checks is pure crap. Hey ""TODD"", ever hear of TELECHECK dude? Or he could be doing this instead. He could be some poor old smuck from CO brokering new recruits for a ""FEE"", submitting the $65 bucks to ""UICI"" along with the ""PAPERWORK"" to a VERY QUESTIONABLE ORGANIZATION. This ""ORGANIZATION"" has been, and continues to be sued from everything from unfair trade practices to out and out fraud. This outfit, with it's many layers of companies, is like an ONION, It stinks like one to be sure. CONCLUSIONIf you got this far, I'm glad because I put a lot of work into this so I can save some poor b**tard out there. If any of you want to send a rebuttal, bring it on! You can even email me if you wish. I believe that all of these ""COMPANIES"" are engaging in deceptive trade practices in two ways:1. Misrepresenting insurance policies, to customers that is not good for them. 2. Receiving payment on a short-term basis for these policies only to have the customer cancel later. What the h**l, you made a few bucks. 3. Have been charged by the State of Colorado for fraud,misrepresentation and direct violations of CO's insurance  laws.4. Engaging directly, or indirectly, in unsolicited email spam  from data mined 5 Emailing unsolicted and prospective ""JOB OPPORTUNITIES""to members on these search engines.6. Clandestinely, misled the job seekers into believing that there is a ""REAL"" job opportunity.7. You charge a FEE, under false pretenses I dare say, toa job applicant, on a 1099-basis without the proper   documentation (like an I-9). This is ILLEGAL. By collecting  a ""FEE"" you are entering into an agreement to train, license, and employ them as an ""INSURANCE AGENT"". Since there are more  then one of them, this constitutes a CONSPIRACY TO DEFRAUD.8. The ""FEE"" is always a little less than what would constitute a felony. Hmmmmm. WHAT I'VE ALREADY DONEOK, you're still here, good for you. Read on. We're almost done.The name ""TODD KLEIN"" may or may not be his. You can search him on the web. Two websites, he's givingtestimonials about other services, citing his position at Cornerstone. He's a web-marketing bastard. Bet hisol' lady is a cow! (why'd I say that)?1. Took some pics of ""TODD""  getting into a car with license number. My snitches in law enforcement shouldhave him ID'ed this afternoon. Same goes for ""Veronica"".2.  Have consulted  The Attorney General's Office who is going to perform a full investigation.....3. .....dragging in the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC), the Texas State Comptroller, andsubsequently, the US Department of labor. The FTC and SEC have to follow along.4. Have obtained ""TODD KLEIN'S"" fingerprints to aid in his identification. RESOURCES""uoneofakind.com""   which is ""ornerstoneamerica.net"", which is ""w-ins.com""On your search engines, use these keywords:""todd klein insurance""""texas insurance license""    ** VERY IMPORTANT STATE of TEXAS WEBSITE""mid-west insurance fraud""  ** The $40,500.00 fine they had to pay in CO.MESSAGE TO ""TODD KLEIN""I went through the motions with you out of fun.

American Income Life / National Income Life pledges to resolve all legitimate complaints and address any issues from the past, present and in the future. Waco Texas, Nationwide","										I had never heard of American Income Life until I had received an e-mail message stating interest in my online resume.  The first message went disregarded.  I don't have one bit of educational experience in marketing, sales, or business, so I was confused as to why they would want me.  The second message came, and I thought I would give it a shot.The interview process was highly inconvenient, as I had to commute over an hour and a half and take a day off of work to attend three separate  occasions.  The first was just a sit-down with my resume.  The second was a group interview, and the third was a confirmation interview.  At that confirmation interview, I was told of the unlimited income potential and I had dollar signs in my eyes.  ""Now, this job requires a little bit of driving,"" and I was okay with that.  And basically, over the next week, I was to learn that the money would just make itself.  These union families want the insurance, and we just have to sign them up and get some referrals.Even my standards were low.  I would have to average three sales a week to make about as much as I would make as a counselor.  That was good enough for me, and it sounded like a cakewalk.I stayed with my mom to save gas on the commute during training work, but I was still filling up once every few days.  I spent a few days training with a field supervisor who ""let me have"" a couple of sales.  And, really, the rest of the time was spent learning on-the-go.  I was actually displeased with a lot of my early experience because I didn't feel prepared enough for it -- that includes people who already have policies, people who were clearly not interested in getting insurance, and people who didn't even remember hearing about the union insurance in the first place.  I got more than enough irate responses.But that wasn't enough for me.  The money was there, and every Friday morning meeting would be an insistence that the money was there, despite having a faulty phone room or a misleading script or a baiting proposal before you sink 'em with the real plot.  And I kept holding out for the money.  The way feedback had been administered, it's my own fault if I make or break myself in this position.  That's just not entirely true.After reading about various accounts here, I realized that AIL does its best to ""bait"" you into staying.  You'll get good, productive leads every few weeks.  They're spaced that way so that, when you're on the verge of leaving, you have a good money day that makes you want to stay.  Psychologically and economically, that's really taxing and painful and stressful as all get out.Let me just summarize from here:MISLEADING STATEMENTSThe interviewing team claims that you make a base (I repeat, BASE) salary of -- last I heard -- $60,000 to $75,000 a year, but you are solely paid on commission.There is NO salary associated with this job.  You have to make your earnings week to week, and you are not reimbursed for any expenses.  Allegedly, you're entitled to reimbursement at tax time, but you still have to wait a full calendar year to take advantage of that.You are not reimbursed for the licensing materials and preparation costs.  Prepare to spend at least $75 for a home-study course and $260 for an insurance license, and that's if you pass the exams the first time.  One former co-worker revealed that she failed the test three times before passing.The interviewing team also claims that this job brings instant promotion potential, but you are only promoted if you recruit underlings.  You move into management positions at THEIR expense.You describe yourself as a Benefits Coordinator of the family member's union until you actually say you're a representative of American Income Life.Sometimes, you say you're from Globe.  What?!  Yes.  Contrary to AIL's claim that they do no advertising but have been in business for 80 years, they DO their mass mail advertising under the name Globe Life.You collect canned goods for a Union Food Bank; however, all the food I've collected is still sitting in the back room of the agency among the office supplies.AIL won't extend any good faith efforts to you if you're hospitalized because of sickness or the car breaks down or whatever.  In fact, the agency will make an adamant refusal to reimburse for any unforeseen incidents that compromise your ability to work.You're told to give feedback on your training experience.  Feedback consists of a sheet only indicating all the things you didn't learn on the job.Leads are free, but they are recycled from a database consisting of refusals, do not calls, former customers, lapsed customers, and so forth.  If you want people to set your appointments, you have to pay $300 a month for the service in advance, even if you don't generate anything in sales revenue.You HAVE to seek out some other way to earn money.  You need a part-time job to supplement your nonexistent insurance income, and that's just hard to do with a 60- to 70-hour workweek.Your managers insist that you call them should you have any problems or need to ask a question.  They are NEVER available.  I have two of them, and the many, many times I needed to ask a question -- right there in the home! -- they weren't around.  Furthermore, when I expressed having some difficulties with the job and that I was really stressed over not making any money, my manager blamed me for the problem.  He said that I probably wasn't sticking to the script.  Of course, if someone tells you that this is the FOURTH time they've been seen and they want to know if we're a legit operation, what CAN you say to that again?  Finally, he let out some ""inspirational"" story about having a car, mortgage, wife, and three kids to support on the verge of bankruptcy and how this job saved his life.  Come off it already!Once you add up all the expenses you incur in gasoline, dining out on the road, car maintenance, office supplies, and so forth,  you'll soon realize that you're making way less than you thought.  The sickening irony is that I thought I wasn't making anything waiting tables at a restaurant.  Five nights a week, even with slow nights, I was making over 25% more income  and NOT driving hundreds of miles a week.  In short...Don't let the pipe dreams, the dollar signs, and the empty promises compel you to work for this company.  I don't have any problem with the actual insurance products.  To be honest, anything bad you could say about life or health insurance problems is probably applicable across the board.I gave this job a fair shot.  Not only am I not a fan of sales professions in general (yet I'm a waiter, go figure), but I really, really disliked the hiring procedures, the dishonesty, and the falsehoods being spewed out of this company.  I got scammed.  I just don't want to see anyone else waste their time or money on something that isn't as ""surefire"" as they would have you believe.DeeLexington, KentuckyU.S.A.Click here to read other Rip Off Reports on American Income Life Insurance ",  Insurance Agencies

","", 573-474-6193,Columbia Insurance Group thank you for hanging up on me Columbia Missouri,"										In January, We contacted  a local agent to obtain farm insurance. She came out and looked at our farm and we discussed options, I told her several things that we needed. She gave me a quote, took my check and said I should be getting a policy in the mail. In March I re-contacted her as we still had not recieved a policy. I was told that she had not heard back from them but she would call them and get things going. In April I recieved a bill due/cancelation notice. Basically saying that if I did not pay by the due date (not for another 2 weeks) I would be canceled. The first correspondence from them was actually a type of cancellation notice! To me, that was pretty odd in itself. The next day I recieved the policy. It was not anything at all like I wanted and the price was 3 times higher then the quote. I had not heard this ever from the agent. In fact, the only time I heard from the agent was when I called them. Nothing was ever said about who it would be or a change in price, in fact until now I didn't even know if we were insured. Since the invoice contained such a forcful statement, that I would be cancelled if I did not pay, I contacted another company to get the correct type policy and felt that they should go ahead and cancel me. Thats what they said they were going to do.Last week I recieved a letter from them saying that my account balance has not been paid and since they have not heard from me (like I ever had the option...) they are assuming that I have no questions about this amount. They are insisting that I pay them in the next 15 days or they will be turning me over to a bill collection agency. What happened to the ""cancellation"" notice. What happened to the policy that I should have recieved, not something that was 3 times higher and excluded everything I had requested? What happened to communication? Did they intentionally wait till the last minute to send me that bill? And then send it as a cancellation notice, was that intended to happen that way? I did not get the policy until the next day. Were they counting on me not knowing what I was getting before I paid the bill? I called them when I got the last letter. It was only for 3 months and I had already given my agent a check way back in January which should have paid me up until May even at their exorbant prices)Anyway, the customer service woman that I spoke with was EXTREMELY rude, telling me that I should have called them and cancelled before I got another company. That I didn't have a right to do that and they were going to be turning me into a collection agency. I told her if they had to do that then I would have to contact the better bussiness bureau and let them know about their customer relations. She said ""go ahead"" and hung up on me.Before dealing with this company, I would suggest that anyone thoroughly read their policy - before signing anything. This is not a company I will ever recommend to anyone. We have a good, useful policy now. I'm not sure what this little company was trying to prove with their methods, but they lost this customer.  Don't they realize that customers ARE people? I know they have a Customer Service Dept because that who sent the letter and answered the phone. Didn't they ever learn how to deal with customers besides threatening them? And to think I called long distance to listen to them.Maybe if they had had something that I was looking for, I might have dealt with it all differently, but they had nothing that was even slightly useful. Basically their policy excluded everything including storms, farm equipment, all animals, all equipment and all buildings more then 250 feet from our house. Our garage would be excluded as its 300 feet from our house. The closest barn is not less then 500. Whoever heard of farm insurance that didn't cover anything? Especially at that extreme price. We were only insuring 4 acres. His mom's farm (which is in the same location) with 300+ acres 2 barns, a machine shed, tractor, and equipment and animals was $300 less then this one. I have an excellent record with previous insurance companies. My new husband only had vehicle insurance before this, but has not had any claims against him.Debbyclarksville, MissouriU.S.A.

He has held pay checks of ex-employees, which I am sure is illegal, just tostick it to them one last time. His many other actions have been highlighted throughout websites like this one.  For that, we thank the RIPOFF Report.  Now, It's time to demand that David Zophin be stopped from ruining the American Income name and lets allow good agents a chance to take advantage of a great opportunity by dethroning Mr. Zophin.  Sincerely, The UndersignedPhilWarwick, Rhode IslandU.S.A.

The company is now Mid-West National Life, and claims to have attempted to locate and contact with the information from the original paperwork.  They claim to have received all letters returned back and that is a crock.  In the end what took place is the policy was automatically put on an extension and was paying itself off the interest and eventually exhausted that so they forfeited the loan.Not once did I recieve any info or phone call and that is because I was appointed the Executor of the Estate.  So you would think that during the lengthy time of a probate case I should have recieved something.I only have birthday card that were sent to me up until 1989 and nothing else was found in the paperwork left behind.  The weird part is that last payment was made on May of 1990 and my father passed on later than that date. Why wasn't I contacted then???I honestly feel like this company was unprofessional and ruined my dream of starting a new career.I feel that my father paid for this policy for approximately 4 years there should be an account there for me.

How odd, right...1. First of all their web site is elementary at best.It lacks comprehensive information about the insurance program.You also can't find the names of the CEO or CFO or anyone that you can hold accountable if this is a scam.2. They have sent representatives out to prey on the elderly as I witnessed my self. I was not approached by the sales person but skipped and they elderly couple next to me were approached with this pitch about affordable life insurance with medical benefits.3. I don't care what you call these people, IBA's or Associates, or Reps, Members, Distributors etc... Its all **BS** these people are Sales people that heard the rhetoric and saw a way to make money by exploiting the elderly.4. They claim that anyone can sell the insurance they offer since the company eventually through some legal loophole does the actual selling.PEOPLE LETS GET TO THE BOOTOM OF THIS NEW SCAM!!

Primerica takes appropriate action against representatives conducting themselves improperly, pledges 100% commitment to customer service.","										I was looking for a receptionist position using  Internet for a couple of weeks. Once I got a call from a person whose name was Sam and who invited me for an interview.I wasn't sure if I had ever emailed my resume to Primerica (I used to keep all of the sent messages on my account, and I didn't find anything emailed to Primerica) or even heard about this company, but I decided to go there just in the matter of curiosity.I was inteviewed by Sam, the person who called me, and advised that they have two-step interview system I have to pass to get a desired position.He said that I successfully passed my first interview,and in a couple of days I got another call from him that was the actual invitation for the second interview. Sam also told me that for this interview I need to bring two pieces of my ID and Visa (credit card); the last item especcially picked my attention (which is no wonder :))); I have never dealed with companies that require any IDs along with credit cards. There were a lot of people waiting for interviews this evening.Primerica's stuff wrote our names and names of those who invited us.In about 15 minutes, they asked all of us to go into a big room and settle down. Some guys from Primerica stuff started telling about the company, expressing their huge excitement and encouraging us to join their team.They said brifely about opportunity to get  Primerica's licence and a price for it which was $199 plus GST.Most of the time, I had to hear about how much   they actually earn per year, how independent they are, how stupid it is to obtain certificates, diplomas and everything regarding the opportunity to get educated.I was feeling that was a big Bull****, but I still was curious about how it is going to end up.This presentation took about 2 hours. As soon as it was done, they said we have to wait for our interviwers.Some people wanted to contact their relatives because no one could expect this ""interview"" would take so much time. Primerica didn't have any working telephone, so one of its representatives gave his own cell phone standing in front of those who were using it.Just in a couple of moments, Sam asked me to come in.He was trying to make this mess more ""interview like"" asking one of the most popular questions, ""Why should we hire you?""I  repeated everything what I actually said on my first interview, and after his ""ok"" I was told to give my ID and Visa.I didn't have any Visa with me, and even couldn't understand the purpose of giving it to my potential employer.He said that ,at first, I have to obtain Primerica's certificate, and after that I could get a position of a receptionist. He sounded hypnotically. I could also make a money order for him; it just was a matter of time.Of course, I didn't give any money; I just turned my back and left. I am not requiring any lawer's help; I am not a victim after all; however, I would like to alert each and everyone:If you are invited for an interview, keep in mind that you are the one who is potentialy to be paid.V.Toronto, OntarioCanada									",  Insurance Agencies

Upon reading the policy with a lawyer, I was informed that not only are they NOT covered until years after I first purchased the policy, but their coverage is extremely limited. I have been led to believe that my children were covered and in the event of accident or death, the policy would make sure their affairs were take care of.When the policy was first sold to me, I was informed that the premium would never go up and that I could call anytime to speak with a representative. Neither statement was truthful. The information on my children is incorrect. I have made numerous attempts to call and get it changed, but to no avail. Also, when the policy was delivered to me, I was walked through certain aspects, but the ones I was falsely led into weren't covered.At this point in the game, the policy is completely WORTHLESS to me and my family. My children have been without coverage for almost two years and I was none the wiser. Something could've happened and I wouldn't have been covered. If I had known what I now know about the coverage, I would've never bought the policy. It was a copmplete waste of my time and my money.

Because I was tied up with business I did not have time to ""Google"" the company. I was told to dress ""business professional"" (why wouldn't I?)  When I arrived I was asked to complete a form, give them my resume and a list of references. When she called me into her office, she asked a few questions of my background, etc.  As time went on my radar went up when I asked about company information (which she wouldn't give me), the odd interview times, and the lack of specifics regarding the position itself. She then said ""congratulations you've made it to the next round!"" Everything about the interview felt ""wrong"".  She gave me a test to fill out and then scheduled me to come back the next day.Needless to say, I went home and immediately ""Googled"" the company.  I hit the Ripoffreport.com website and saw all the stories of others who had been equally duped in the same way I was.  Everything right down to the one former recruiter's apology to those who she had fooled.  I was appalled at the hiring methods by someone who claimed to be in HR.  An ethical HR person would never set a human being up on such a ""bait and switch"" tactic.  She and the company should be ashamed of themselves. Who would be proud working for them?Should I have done my homework first? Absolutely yes.  I failed to research them prior to going in for the interview.  But this type of hiring practice is deceptive and immoral. It sets up people weaker than I for a huge fall. Needless to say, I called the lady's phone and left the message that if indeed she was interviewing me to sell insurance, then I wanted nothing to do with the process.  And if I was wrong, then please call me back and we can talk about it.  So far, no phone call. On behalf of real Human Resources Professionals, I apologize that there are people like her posing as HR recruiters who in fact are knowingly being deceptive and using unethical hiring methods.

TAG is what you would call the middle man. They recruit the agents, the agents sell the insurance products, the insurance companies pay TAG, who in turn pays the agents.TAG is currently running ads nationally which promise agents no cold calling, constant leads, earnings between $1,000 - $2,000 or more per week, with professional ""back room support"". If you see an ad that goes something like ""Sell the Hottest Insurance Product"" call 866-224-8450...it is a TAG ad.All of this sounds great, but we have all heard the saying ""if it sounds too good to be true it probably is"". Agents seeing such an ad should BEWARE.During the recent Medicare Advantage Plan enrollment period it was learned that one of the primary insurers was paying TAG $350 per MA enrollment. TAG recruited agents and paid them $150 per MA enrollment, keeping $200 per case. They did increase the commission to $175 but this was eventually rolled back to $150 per case. Almost ALL other insurance marketing organizations were paying their agents $250 per case. After learning of this many agents, especially those who did several cases, felt they had been royally ripped off to the tune of $30,000 to $40,000+.As mentioned earlier TAG uses the promise of pre-set appointment leads as an inticement to recruit. Although the agents are required to pay for the leads, they are for the most part, garbage. Appointments are often set up with individuals who do not need or cannot qualify for the insurance products. Appointments are even made with people who do not want an appointment. If an agent wants a refund of an appointment charge he must go through a justification process, which is often an exercise in futility.TAG does not fully disclose contractual stipulations to agents being recruited. Agents who want to resign are told they cannot be released from their contacts for six months.TAG does not support those agents recruited. Their company motto should be Recruit and Forget. Telephone calls, letters, emails, and other forms of correspondence are ignored in a number of cases. Management support (?) does not exist for the most part. And you will never get a staright answer to a direct question especially when compensation is concerned.If you are considering this company you should do so with extreme caution and BEWARE of what you are getting yourself into. Like many others you will likely end up regretting a decision to work with these people. There are MANY other insurance marketing groups available to you who will treat you fairly and honestly.For other information you may want to check out the siteEnough said for now!GregCharlotte, North CarolinaU.S.A.

I have read what others have said and concur (fully) with their statements. The insurance business is a tough, tough way to make a living. It is made tougher when working with a group like TAG. The company recruits heavily with the promise of preset appointments. Such appointments are great if they are actually made with people who want or need what you are marketing. In my case (and I was promised 20 per week) there were several days when no appointments were scheduled, or appointments were made with people on a government assistance program, retired government workers (state-Federal-municipal), people retired with union benefits, and people who did NOT want an appointment.In several cases they were useless. To top it off you pay for the leads!The next sore point with me was their commission system. They pay far below what a licensed agent can receive elsewhere. During the recent Medicare enrollment period they were paying agents $150 per enrollment while others were paying $300. Street level commissions during the next enrollment period are $330 to $400...they are paying $175. Only an agent who just fell off the turnip truck would work for such a group.I could go on and one about TAG but a reader should get the picture pretty fast.

This sounded ideal, and is a great concept, if it actually works!I found out quickly that TAG did not know the difference between a qualified and non qualified individual. When appointments were made, and there were numerous days that they were not, they were often made with individuals on Medicaid(welfare), government retirees, retired union members, people who did NOT want an appointment, or individuals located far, far away from the office. Adding insult to injury you paid for these ""qualified leads"". I found their system so unbearable I stopped them from making such appointments and worked out my own system which was far superior to theirs.After working with TAG for several months I found out, from an informed and reliable source, that all TAG agents were being ripped off on commissions. While other companies were paying their agents $250 to $300 per Medicare Advantage enrollment TAG was paying $150 each. An explanation was sought for this disparity but it was never provided. Upon learning of this I quickly switched organizations, doubled my commissions, and enrolled 99% of my prospects using my own system and the new company's double verified, completely qualified lead system.The next Medicare Advantage enrollment period doesn't promise any improvements in TAG providing equitable commissions. TAG will be paying $175. Others are paying between $330 and $400 per enrollment. How they can justify keeping so much of a commission is something I will probably never understand.Other problems existed with TAG, such as their failure to disclose release information, emails, phone calls, and letters never answered, etc. Frustrating problems, but pale in comparison to their commission structure.TAG always blamed its problems on ""growing pains"". But, rather than trying to correct its problems it continued, and is continuing to recruit all over the country. I truely feel sorry for any licensed agent foolish enough to sign on with such a company.If you are being recruited by TAG, or are considering working with them, I would recommend you check with other marketing groups, compare lead and appointment systems, have an attorney read EVERYTHING before you sign it, and speak to other agents who have experience with any group you are considering. The many hassles you will experience with TAG, while receiving about half the commissions earned by your counterparts, just do not make it worth your while.GaryCharleston, West VirginiaU.S.A.

This was an all time low for me in the insurance business. I am still kicking myself for being dumb enough to have been associated with a company like this.What good can I say? Nothing! What did I learn? I learned that:a. TAG will pay you much less than you can receive from other such companies. By the time their bottom feeder national sales directors and state agency directors receive overrides from your work there isn't much left for you.b. The only person you can really depend on for quality leads is yourself. If you depend on minimum wage appointment people, like those who work for TAG, you are going to get minimum wage quality type appointments. Been to McDonald's lately?c. Their sales directors are clueless as to what's really going on. But then their only job is recruiting and enjoying the fruits of your labor. Nothing else matters to them.d. Many promises are made to you...few if any are kept.e. Getting released from this company is near impossible. I always thought we lived in a democracy.Of the 10 people on my ""team"" all of them quit in addition to the state director. What's that tell you? With The Assurance Group the only thing you are ""assured"" of is getting screwed especially when it comes to money. As others have said avoid this company.

My letter about The Assurance Group would be full of them. I worked for this sorry, money hungry, marketing misfit business for 6 months, the worst period of my career.Agents are recruited by what they call national sales directors. I have another term but won't use it. They promise no less than 20 appointments made for you each week. They also tell you Medicare won't let them make more than 20 per week and the average agent closes 50% of the time. WHAT A CROCK OF CRAP. There were several weeks when I had zero appointments. Others only 4 or 6. Since I couldn't get out of my contract for 6 months (which wasn't told to me up front) the only way I survived was by getting leads from another source.The sales director who recruited me was a real piece of work. I won't state his name but will say his deal with TAG is a family affair. Any time I tried to get in touch with him was impossible. I tried emails, telephone calls, voicemail messages, certified letters, and even Fed Ex. I was beginning to think he quit. A friend suggested that he call him, which he did. My friend left him a message that he was interested in TAG as were several associates. Guess what? He got a return call within 60 minutes. A miracle I thought...he did exist. But why didn't he return MY calls?After six months of disgust I quit. This was right before I learned about being ripped off on the commissions. This was one of life's hard lessons for me but I was lucky. I moved on and am verry happy now. I'm sad for those stupid enough to stay with them. I'm also sad for those foolish enough to fall for their lies. The only thing these people care about is how much money you can make for them. Period. End of story.

Humana, for example, is one of TAG's biggest companies. Many agents who represented Humana, through TAG, did not recertify with Humana for the next Medicare Advantage enrollment period. They are going to represent other companies and Humana, unfortunately, will end up losing a lot of business!Humana has been contacting agents, by telephone, to conduct a survey on the reasons why they did not recertify to represent the company. The people conducting the surveys are apparently getting the low down on just how TAG operates. The person I spoke to told me that she had NUMEROUS negative comments about TAG and that something was seriously wrong since so many agents chose to NOT recertify. She further indicated that it was her opinion that Humana would be taking a long and hard look at TAG.When you have a company that pays you much less than you can earn somewhere else, does not disclose important contract issues to you, and doesn't support your efforts, what else can they expect?Any person who works for $175 per case, when they can earn between $330 and $500 elsewhere, is a total fool. If they are dumb enough to be ""duped"" then they deserve whatever happens while working with TAG.It is hoped that some of the people considering working with The Assurance Group (TAG) of Archdale North Carolina will find this site and learn from the experiences of others.Do yourself a favor and avoid this company.

You will discover what this company is doing to the franchisees.  Brooke Corporation does a few things  they buy and sell insurance agencies.  They advertise that they will provide services such as financing of agency, accounting, marketing, provide insurance companies and other important services to assist insurance agencies.  They do not provide the services.  Brooke receives all commissions from the insurance companies.  The franchise fees are kept by Brooke and the remaining money is to be sent to the agency owner.  I have not spoken to one agency that has ever received money from Brooke.  Brooke will not send the agencies copies of the commission statements from the insurance companies.  They send you a monthly statement that Brooke compiles on an excel spreadsheet.  The statement is usually incorrect with all sorts of unusual charges and omitting commissions or paying a lower amount of commission that they receive (in other words, skimming).   Basically after a time the agency is failing but not at the fault of the agency owner.  It is the scheme of Brooke to see agencies fail  taking back the agency for resell  Brooke will then resell the agency to make another franchise fee (now at $165,000), Buyer Assistance Plan (program they force you to buy that is to provide services that are not provided), Loan Origination Fees, and Consulting Fees (they use outside' firms that Brooke owns, but Brooke does not disclose that they own the firms).  Brooke success is the failure of their agencies.  There are many agents from around the US that have been victimized by this company or they are in the system and are too scared to say anything because Brooke makes you borrow money (from Brooke Finance) when you have a negative monthly statement balance (when you in-fact DO NOT have a negative balance).  If you buck' the system, they cut you off' and foreclose on your agency.  So most agents involved do not say anything.  In fact, in some instances Brooke will let an agency walk away only if they sign a confidentiality agreement not to talk.  This publicly traded company is getting away with crimes against hard working families.

Before you know it, you have a ?negative balance? and Brooke is attempting to make a huge debit from your operating account and, of course, it bounces so you just have more frivolous fees that you now ?owe? Brooke.  When you do question Brooke's policies, they suggest you establish an exit plan and they stop responding to any of your questions.  Next thing you know you're signing for certified mail from Brooke that ends up being your foreclosure notice.  Brooke employs a team of attorneys and once Brooke finishes sucking the individual agent dry, none of the agents can afford to fight Brooke in court so bankruptcy becomes the only option.   All in all, if you are looking at buying into this Crooke of a company, ruuuuunnnnnnn!  Biggest mistake I've ever made and my family is paying the price for it.  Once the kids are tucked in bed and my spouse and I are attempting to fall asleep, we look at each other and say ?I can't believe this is happening to us.?  It is truly a nightmare!  Our only light at the end of this dark tunnel is knowing that the end is near for this scam of a company and hoping that by sharing our story at least one innocent family will be spared. Go to yahoo-finance & type in stock/ticker symbol BXXX.  Look at the ""message board"" section to see just how many agents across the country are being ruined.*Orphan accounts are new policies where Brooke says they have not received all of the documents from the agency which are necessary to write the policy.  (Brooke doesn't show a credit on the monthly statements for these ?orphan accounts?). ** Missing On lines - Brooke will claim your deposits can't be reconciled.  Brooke will stand by their incompetence on this issue even after you fax over (multiple times) the receipts from each payment entered into the Brooke system & the deposit slip showing the total deposit made into the trust account you have absolutely no control over.RobertShawnOverland Park, KansasU.S.A.

","", 360-699-6342,Greg Egbert Insurance 4 Less Unethical Insurance Advisor Misleading Seniors Vancouver Washington,"										This happened to my elderly mother.  Below are excerpts of the letter I sent the Washington State Insurance Commissioners' Office.An insurance agent by the name of Mr. Greg Egbert sold my mother a tax-deferred annuity from Allianz Life approximately 4 years ago.  It is currently making 3%.  When my mother informed me Mr. Egbert was going to put her in a different annuity I requested his phone number and wanted to ask him specifics about it.  I found the penalty for switching her to an annuity with a higher return there would have been $6,700 (over 18%) on her approximately $37,000.  When I called Allianz and asked when the money could be withdrawn in a lump sum without penalty the answer was never.  You make only take out in total up to 15% in the 1st 5 years, then receive only yearly, or quarterly payments for the life of the balance. Mr. Egbert would have made a commission on this trade.  Allianz would not reveal to me the amount of commission he would have made.My mother is 80 years old .   She does not receive enough money to file a tax return. In all probability she will be in her late 80s or early 90s before she will receive all the money that was in this annuity without suffering a penalty.  It is hard to imagine any reasonable individual of advancing age and limited income that would put their life savings in this type of annuity if the large penalties and severe restrictions were clearly and comprehensively explained to them beforehand. Mr. Egbert is less than forth coming and direct with details when selling this type of policy to an elderly person on a limited income. No reputable financial advisor would ever recommend a tax-differed annuity to an elderly person who doesnt make enough money to file a tax return and where the balance of her life savings cannot be withdrawn or transferred without huge penalty.  Mr. Egbert violated his trust with my mother.  That has done my mother an inexcusable disservice.  Mr. Egbert bills himself as a certified senior advisor.  If giving this kind of advice is not illegal, it certainly is unethical, reprehensible and amoral.JanedoughArleta, CaliforniaU.S.A.									",  Insurance Agencies

I was not there long enough to deal with his foolisness like some of the current workers do. The bickering that goes on there, you'll be surprised how people kiss him and his son ""BUTT"".Well I had a job offer to work in the alarm security business, but wanted to continue to work for the Hartford Life Group. I was told ""NO"" I had to work there full time or nothing at all. Now I have to admit the training was good, I did learn from Guy Beiliech or how ever you spell his name.The only problem I had was I wanted to continue to work for IPP even if I was not getting the advanced money, I justed wanted to continue to work with them since they took the time to train me properly. But the older Beiliech whom Freddie was talking about said ""NO"".So what I do go out start my own company where I am the MGA and I get all the overrides of what I or my agents do. I can admit it I did it out of spite. Since that time I have been contracted out to several other Insurance Companies who also provide Mortgage Protection Insurance with leads along with annuities, and the latest thing that is out now is Final Expense which I have taken advantage of. So what I say to the current agents. You can do your own thing by going out and buying leads that are a lot cheaper then what the Beiliech group is offering. I purchase my own leads and get referrals from the consumers I sell, and continue to work my full time job and make more money selling in the evenings and on the weekends just being on my own and no boss to kiss up too.So I tell the Freddies and anyone else in the office call me, I'm not promising you a job but I can show you how to be a independant agent without someone keeping what's due to you.

They promised to deliver leads every day, at a minimum of 20 per week based on their own marketing efforts. They gave me all the right answers but I was still hesitatant. Eventually, I agreed to give them a try and test out a small batch of these leads. It was a terrible mistake. I paid them $500 in March of this year, and between March and June I received only 2, that's right TWO, leads from them. Even worse, both of those people had no idea who I was or what I was talking about when I called them. It's nearly impossible to reach anyone when you call this company's main number (866-420-4267), you always get a voice mail system. I left countless messages between June and August, and never got a call back. Eventually, someone answered the phone and told me that to discuss a refund or problem with my account I had to call a different number and ask for Alice (866-419-2627). Even worse, now their main number is disconnected and the other number is forwarded to a different phone, I think it's a cell phone, (561-844-2450) that never gets answered. Agentdallas, TexasU.S.A.

I am an insurance professional with a medium sized Independent Insurance Agency; two years ago I hired an agent who talked to me about NAA.  I investigated it and liked the fact that they supplied leads and are a NON-CAPTIVE opportunity.  I became actively involved about a year ago.I recruited over 100 agents around the country based on who I was (a respected insurance professional) and the opportunity based on what I believed (a reasonable/rational person) after reading all the contracting and marketing information from NAA.NAA had seen phenomenal growth in their 5 year history as they hit the real estate boom on the nail with their mortgage protection program.I saw there lead system change from the option to buy recycled leads (B+ and B leads) to a scenario where you are forced to buy 6-10 week old leads now called A1-A3 leads.In the current market environment to be successful you must go and knock on peoples doors to make sales or travel out of your state.  I personally had no interest in doing this and the agents I had recruited had no interest in this either.  I had reached the level of regional manager and was questioning the methods used to recruit new agents as there were no longer enough A leads available. Amongst other issues, I also questioned the sales tactics on how to sell annuities after attending a seminar held by the number 1 annuity producer in the company. I specifically brought to the attention of other managers erroneous and unethical statements that this person was teaching agents to use to make the sale. I WAS TOLD BY MY UPLINE MANAGER THAT, ""WHO CARES, THIS IS WHY WE HAVE ERRORS AND OMMISSIONS INSURANCE"".I had a difference in opinion on how to develop my agency in NAA with my upline manager.  Realize this is allegedly not a captive agent deal, as long as one does not sell competing companies products into the NNA leads you have no obligations to NAA.  Although I had never done anything contrary to what is in the NAA contract, but was questioning their methods (had a brain and knew when something was amiss) had a different vision (my own opinions based on years of successful business strategies) on how to build my NAA business I was terminated and al the agents I had recruited were stripped from me.In a nutshell this is the worst type of deceptive business practice one can encounter and the part I like best is the owners always saying how righteous and Christian (values) they are.

The people at Liberty National Life Insurance Company did just that.=====================NOW TO THE ORIGINAL REPORT THAT WAS FILED  ===================== Liberty National Life Insurance Company is a Pyramid Scheme Birmingham Alabama Anyone considering a career with Liberty National Life Insurance Company beware: Liberty National is a pyramid scheme.  I'll summarize how it works.  Liberty's business model is divided into 2 parts: 1A (recruiting), and 1B (production).Recruiting is an endless process at Liberty.  Hiring goals are 10 new recruits per branch per week.  Each branch generally holds a monthly recruiting seminar.  This is nothing more than a cattle call.  Liberty will hire anyone, regardless of experience, without a felony on his or her record for a career as a professional in the insurance industry.  Liberty claims to hire for management (no experience necessary) while omitting the fact that the recruit will begin as a salesman, and will still make sales even after promotion to a management position.Production is Liberty's process of getting new recruits to make money for the company.  Emphasis is placed on recruits who have obtained a Permanent Insurance License (PLs) from their state.  The goal is to get these PLs sales to $5,000 in annualized premiums (5Ks).  Bonuses are paid to branches based on PLs and 5Ks, to be distributed as the Branch Manager sees fit (which may be in his/her own pocket).  Once a recruit is a PL and a 5K, he/she may be offered a position as a Unit Manager.The Unit Manager is now responsible to recruit more individuals for his/her group or unit, work with any s and 5Ks in his/her group, and constantly get new recruits to become producing agents (PAs).  There are of course standards for the number of PLs, 5Ks, and PAs each Branch Manager, and Unit Manager must have, and that's where the fun begins.Liberty National promises prospective employees everything under the sun: six-figure incomes, advancement opportunities, bonuses, trips to fun and exotic places, a proven marketing strategy, an in-depth training system, and more leads than we have agents to work them.The six-figure income is not a complete lie; it's just unrealistic.  Liberty has an activity model, which states that if the agent will make 240 contacts per week, he/she will be able to schedule 24 appointments, hold 15 sit down interviews and thus yield 5 sales per week.Mondays, and Wednesdays are designated training days where the agent will spend his morning at the branch office being trained (more in a moment) and work the phones after lunch calling 120 contacts each of the two training days to set appointments.  According to this activity model an agent will earn a $100,000+, and the agent will, if the average sale is $616.  How do you get 240 contacts per week?  That's for you as an agent to figure out.  Once you do figure that out, don't worry about your inexperience in sales because you'll hear every Monday and Wednesday how you can (because you're good enough, you're smart enough, and people like you) make those 5 sales per week.Now the only thing standing between you and that six figure income is the fact that Libertys average sale is about $380.The company promises a fast-track to management program to recruits.  Just show us you're serious by signing up on License2Go for your state insurance exam, your testing, and your licensing fees.  Of course, you're only serious after you've spent $300 - $500 on these fees.  If you want to get started without a permanent license, you can pay for a temporary license until you can complete the permanent licensing requirements.  You won't, however, be a priority until you are a PL.As a PL your Unit Manager and Branch Manager will bend over backwards to get you to 5K so you can have a title too!  If you fail to become a PL, or decline a promotion to Unit Manager you will be ignored (aka forget about receiving leads) for the rest of your career which will likely be very short.The proven marketing strategy consists of you talking ad naseum to your family and friends and almost anyone else you meet about your career, Liberty National, and insurance in general.  This goes over really well at Thanksgiving dinner, and you'll be the life of every party you go to.  No, really.trust me.Besides that, AFLAC, State Farm, Allstate, American General, Prudential, and the laundry list of other insurers who ADVERTISE are wasting their money because brand recognition is not important. No, really.trust Liberty National.Libertys training program sets new standards in any industry.  Every Monday and Wednesday morning, you will learn how make a presentation for Liberty National's cancer policy.  You may not know the difference between term and whole life insurance, but by-god you will know how to read a cancer policy brochure to a prospective customer.  If the customer has questions on any of Liberty National's other products tell them you'll get back to them, and remind them that you are an insurance professional.Once you've followed these instructions and sold all the insurance you possibly can to family, and friends you may be rewarded with leads so that you can finally realize the income you've been told about.  Many of these leads don't have phone numbers for you to call and set appointments, but you are encouraged to visit leads face to face.After you've spent a week of evenings catching up with these leads (who haven't moved, or never had interest in seeing an agent, or aren't deceased) and spent as much as $100 - $200 in gas and other travel expenses, you can take the $200 - $300 you've earned in commissions to the bank.  That 4 6 years you spent at college is really paying off for you now.Liberty's management will dismiss much of the above out of hand simply by saying that Liberty National is a 107-year-old company, and therefore is legitimate.  I used to respect Liberty National as being a great company.  However, in a misguided move Andy King was named president in 2006, and he and his team of executives have installed the 1A, and 1B business models described above.  They have essentially traded long-term stability for a temporary boost in sales, and Liberty National may not make it another 107 weeks if this system is left in place.  New people will be constantly recruited to make sales to family and friends, sending income up the pyramid, and then tossed aside when their natural market has been exhausted in favor of a new group of recruits to exploit.Those who stick it out will be told by their superiors that they are not working hard enough, and that's why they fail to make the income they were sold on.  Agents may even be told to prospect (solicit) at malls, Wal-Mart, or even church!  After all, that's the professional thing to do.I don't know about anyone else, but when I need an attorney, accountant, or a doctor I go to aisle 7 at Wal-Mart.Just remember, when you fail, and are in debt for doing your job at Liberty National, it is YOUR FAULT, for NOT WORKING HARD ENOUGH!  You were not misled, exploited, or outright lied to! Never forget that it's YOUR FAULT!Upper management at Liberty National has taken a once reputable company and turned it into a pyramid scheme.  Any prospective employee or consumer should avoid Liberty in its present form at all costs.Helpful links: (((ROR REDACTED)))AnonymousAnywhere, GeorgiaU.S.A.

They both said that this agency offered a good product and excellent service. My aunt told me to ask for a lady named Felicia, because she had worked with her when she bought her policy;and that this person was professional, knowledge and very friendly. She also told me that her coworker had worked with the same person at this agency and her results were excellent. Ok....so I called this agency to speak with Felicia and maybe set up an appointment with her. The receptionist or whoever was very unprofessional...ok she was ghetto as HELL....I ask for Felecia.....she said that there was no Felicia there...then I went ahead and told her that I was referred and my aunt has worked with someone a woman at this agency about 6 months ago and I would like some information or set up an appointment. The receptionist girl went on to tell that NO ONE EVER WORKED THERE with that name and they had an Terri or Amie or Nori or something. So after going around and around with the ghetto ass girl, I asked to speak with whoever is running this place. She said that it was a Tom or Thomas and placed me on hold. I spoke with this Thomas who seemed to be knowledgable, and I told him I would like to come into the office after work with was fine.When I got to this office it was ghetto...smelled like food and trash. The receptionist was eating at her desk while on what appeared to be on a myspace page or something while the phone was ringing off the hook. The office was dingy and dirty and needed a overhauling. I had to wait for 1/2 hour for this Thomas person while he finished what seemed to me a personal conversation on a cell phone. He was not very professional in his appearance, his clothes was dated and just too tight. I was not impressed by the way he offered my some insurance I never heard of and the rates were too high. He went on to brag about how he owned this agency and used to work for some other insurance company. I wanted to ask him about the lady that I was referred to but decided not to. I told him I had to think about changing insurance and rejected his many gestures of trying to flirt with me. Thomas you are not all that..... so please stop trying to flirt with prospective clients it is unprofessional and creepy. Trusted Choice and Click on Detroit if you guys are affliated with this mess, what in the hell are you thinking!!!I am so glad I did my research, before purchasing anything from this crazy ass agency.

" NAA, National Agents Alliance ","  NAA, National Agents Alliance  1214 Turrentine St. Burlington, North Carolina U.S.A. ","", 336-227-3319,"NAA, National Agents Alliance After 60 days, I have yet to make one penny from NAA. Burlington North Carolina","										Read all of the other posts about NAA. You'll begin to see a trend.Here's my personal story:I was interested in insurance sales because I have 9 years experience as a financial planner with a fortune 300 company, where I made MDRT (Million Dollar Round Table) for the last 4 years. I left my previous career because I was interested in becoming an independent agent. The company I worked for previously was ""captive"".On December 19, 2007, I was contacted by Paul Jara, National Recruiter for NAA by email after I posted my resume on Monster.com.Paul sent me a link that showed me that I could easily make over $100,000 with NAA by working part time from home, and that some NAA agents make over one million dollars per year. A couple agents make as much as four million dollars with NAA! Paul immediately asked me if there was anyone else that I knew who might be interested in making a lot of money. I mentioned that my young son could be interested. He told me to have my son attend an NAA event in Ohio.Paul told me that I had a ""gold mine"" in Phoenix because there were NO other resident NAA agents in Phoenix (That should have been a very, very big red flag!)On December 27, 2007 Paul sent me a pile of leads for free. All of the leads were very old. Some of the leads were over three years old! They were not mortgage protection leads as advertised on the NAA website. They were old internet and telemarketing leads. I would personally call them, ""garbage"".Although Arizona state law prohibits the solicitation of life insurance without a valid solicitor's license, Paul sent me these leads knowing that I was NOT a licensed life insurance agent. Again Arizona state law PROHIBITS the solicitation of life insurance without a valid solicitor's license. Understand the implication here, and understand what Paul was implicitly asking me to do. It's not hard to read between the lines.Paul told me that I should absolutely attend the National Conference in Texas (costing $800.00, plus airfare, plus hotel), and that I should ask anyone that I know to attend the conference.On December 28, 2007, I received an email from NAA informing NAA ""agents"" that Shenandoah Life was no longer accepting applications from NAA. (another red flag?)On January 31, 2007 Paul asked me to sign up for the NAA Master's Club (costing me $120.00 per month).I began listening in to the weekly NAA teleconferences. The speakers only talked about how much money they are making, how little time they are spending, and how easy the business is.On February 7, 2008, Paul Jara sent me an email containing 32 applications from Jobbing.com; People who were interested in perusing a life insurance sales career. He told me to recruit, recruit, recruit. Paul was, in effect, asking me to become an NAA recruiter.... all for FREE!On February 8, 2008 I received an email from NAA which stated: ""EVERY Friday, Patrick Connors will TRAIN you how to recruit!"" The cost is $50.00 per month.On February 14, 2008 I received another batch of old, free leads from Paul Jara. His email stated: ""REALLY old leads. I'm not sure if I would even call them ... If they were already covered by NAA agents you might try calling them to see if they would refer you to friends and family. Who knows.""I began noticing an obvious trend with respect to the weekly performance reports. It was evident that the only agents that were making real money with NAA were the same few agents. Over and over, week after week. The same people are the only ones making any money (and a lot of it!), Nothing is ever said about the rest.On February 15, 2008, I received 13 leads from Patrick Connor's office. All of the leads were in Yuma Arizona, a three hour drive from my home! All of the leads were old (one to three years old), some of the leads that I called couldn't speak English, and one of the leads told me that he already purchased insurance from NAA. The rest of the leads hung up on me, or simply told me that they werent interested.I sent Paul Jara and Patrick Connors an email asking them why I couldn't have any leads from my county, Maricopa County, which has over 3.8 million residents.On February 20, 2008, I received the following email from Patrick Connors about the old leads that I was sent:13 leads is a GOLD MINE! If this is not what YOU were expectingmy apologies. Let me tell you what WE'RE expecting: that out of those 13 leads, you get us 13 appsprotect 13 people and help their familiesand make about $5,000 - $7,000 commissions to help YOUR family.Patrick Connors, in his own written words, expects a 100% closing rate on very old B leads with a 0% cancellation rate, from NEW agents!I immediately sent Paul Jara and Patrick Connors an email asking that I be permitted to PURCHASE some A leads in my county of residence.On February 24, 2008 I received the following email from Paul Jara:""We (NAA and the leadership team) do NOT make money from the sale of leads. We are in business because we help cover deserving Americans. As such we must be stewards of our most valuable commodity. The ""A"" lead program is not just for those who can afford to be on ""A"" leads, it is for those people who have shown us that they will help our clients.""Since that email, I have received NO leads, NO emails and NO phone calls from Paul Jara OR Patrick Connors.I continue to receive NAA corporate ""email blasts"" informing me that I should purchase this and that NAA service which will help my business grow and cause me to make more money than I ever thought possible.I have been contracted with NAA since December 24, 2007, and I obtained my Arizona State Life insurance license on January 17, 2008. As of this date, I have not earned one penny by working for NAA.Remember. If it sounds too good to be true, It probably is.Draw your own conclusions!NAA-ripped-me-offMesa, ArizonaU.S.A.

This was AFTER they took our money and swore that they were committed to the surequote.com dial-in system.Every time we talked to the company, the canned response was ""we'll have someone get back to you"".  Andrew, Tim and Erik were consistently brushing us off and/or giving us excuses.  In addition, the training and contracting we paid for was never completed, always because of some technical difficulty.  The webinar training was always disorganized, unprofessional and consumed far too much time during each session because of ""technical difficulties"".  When I spoke with Andrew, and explained the situation, he stated that he would be as disgusted as we were, and that he will talk to the owner, Tim, about getting a full refund since they violated their contract ($2,400).

","", 561-434-3700,Total Mortgage Protection Peeling the layers off the onion West Palm Beach Florida,"										Total Mortgage Protection, the parent company of Surequote, is running some type of slight of hand, smoke and mirror fake lead generation program for insurance agents.  I've heard so many stories from people that were ripped off by these guys and gals in West Palm Beach (read: Wellington) Florida that my head is spinning.There's a few versions of this lead generation game going on. It started with a remote dialing system that had access to 100,000+ incoming fresh leads (yeah right!) that were generated thru a number of sources, but most importantly from lenders that were paid a 'bounty' for each mortgage deal name that was received and then sold by Surequote agents. I think the 'bounty' was $100.Surequote / TMP charged between $1,000 and $1,500 per month for access to their database and to their remote dialer. PLUS the contracts you got from the 5 insurance companies only had 'street' level commissions. So, not only did Surequote / TMP grab a grand a month from the agents, they made almost dollar for dollar on insurance commissions.Obviously (because I tried to used the system for 3 months), from all the complaints, the system didn't/doesn't work. Right now they're selling leads in some type ""of pay as you go"" deal, but I haven't bothered to really look into it.As I have stated in the Surequote ripoff report we, here in southern California, have been dealing with Surequote/Total Mortgage Protection for over 5 months and have been trying to get a refund for over 3 months.Wayne A Jenkins is the President and Owner of TMP and Surequote.

 Unitrin Direct Auto Insurance ,"  Unitrin Direct Auto Insurance  www.unitrindirect.com Tampa, Florida U.S.A. ","", 877-305-4165,Unitrin Direct Auto Insurance- Bad Faith Claim I implemented the appraisal clause on my diminished value claim and they have failed to abide by it. Tampa Florida,"										I was in an accident 8/2/07 less than 8 months after I got my 2007 Hyundai Sonata. I have been in a battle with my insurance company since 8/29/07 on my diminished value check. My car was a new 2007 Hyundai Sonata ($17,000) with 7,626 miles on it at the time of the accident. The car had $9,000 worth of damage including structure damage (radiator support had to be replaced and then the car had to be ""pulled"" for hours to get it back in place among other issues). So, my car had over 50% worth of damage for what I paid for the car. My insurance company (Unitrin Direct Auto Insurance) horrible horrible company, after initially telling me I had an exclusion in my policy for diminished value. For which I responded by complaining to the BBB and GA Insurance Commissioner's office with proof obtained from Unitrin's own website that they had never sent any exclusions to me, finally cut me a check for $1.017.75. Seriously! They are trying to say that the loss in value of the car would be fair market value minus $1,017.75 and that would be what I could get for the car. Are they kidding me? I don't know anyone who would by a car that had over 50% damage done compared to the value of the car, much less pay a thousand dollars under fair market value.So, naturally I appealed and I am still appealing it. I hired an independent appraiser to examine the car and he said the DV was $3,050. He also further stated that the car should not have been repaired in the first place. My appraiser has 32 years worth of experience doing this. I have asked around numerous places and he has a solid reputation. So, I trust him. He has also been trying to help me get a check that is more indicative of the loss in value of the car. For which he will receive $0 dollars of. Yep, he's a flat rate appraiser, which is nice.So, Unitrin and I have been going back and forth over the DV on my car. They rejected my appraiser's figure because he did not use a ""scientific formula"" and he did not provide Comparable vehicles. Are you kidding me? Let's address the latter issue. Their are no comparable vehicles when it comes to wrecked cars. You can take any 2 cars and wreck them the same way and they will both have different damage. The adjuster with the insurance company is an idiot if she thinks she can find comps on any car. Secondly, there is no ""scientific formula"" to calculate DV. What Steve did was call around to different dealerships and ask them what they would be the car for.Steve advised me to implement the appraisal clause, which states that if you and your insurance company cannot agree to a settlement amount. You will each hire an independent appraiser and they will negotiate it out thereby taking you and the insurance company out of it. In the event that the two appraisers cannot come to a settlement agreement they will both mutually agree on a third party umpire and whichever appraiser the third party umpire agrees with is the final amount. So, that is what I did. I implemented the appraisal clause by phone 1/4/08 and via email 1/7/08. Two weeks later I still had not heard anything and numerous calls to the adjuster at the insurance company had not produced results (which was the norm for this company.) I have never encountered such horrible customer service in my life. I have probably called them over 50 times since the accident guess how many phone calls they have returned. 4-5. That's it. Usually only after going above the adjuster and speaking to her manager. He doesn't return phone calls either at least not from voice mail messages. I don't know about you, but if I need an answer to a question or an update on my claim I want my insurance company to return my calls.Okay back on hand. 2 1/2 weeks after I implement the appraisal clause I get a call from an appraiser (Marshall) who says Unitrin hired him. He comes out and examines my car and he tells me up front that they just called him that morning and have not given him any information about what is going on. I told him it is a diminished value case and tell him the name of my appraiser whom he knows and says is a good guy. He also told me that Unitrin instructed him to NOT talk to my appraiser (violation #1 of the appraisal clause). So, he asks me to email him steve's paperwork since Unitrin has not given it to him and I do. I also tell him my car is a lease. Which does NOT affect DV at all. So, he takes pictures and writes stuff down and says the insurance company will be in touch. Huh! What? The insurance company is supposed to be out of this (violation #2). A couple days later Marshall (Unitrin's appraiser) emails me and asks for a copy of my lease. I send it to him. 2-3 weeks go by and I have heard nothing. I check with Steve and he has not been contacted by Marshall either. I email my not so great adjuster at Unitrin who says she will look into it and get back to me. A few days later she tells me that ""the case is being reviewed by management and i should get a response in 3-4 business days"". Again I say what! That is a direct violation of the appraisal clause (violation # 3). So, I start firing off emails to everyone I can think of the BBB, GA insurance commissioner I mean everyone. They are in a contract violation now and that is huge. I finally call the manager at Unitrin at this point and ask him what is going on. He had no idea. I told him about the email I got from my adjuster (he is her boss) and he says what do you mean it's being reviewed by management, we are supposed to be out of it. "" I was like I know. I told them their appraiser had still not contacted my appraiser this was a couple of weeks ago. He said he would look into it. he also had the audacity to tell me that the delay was my fault. WHAT! How can it be my fault if it hasn't even started? he said you are treating this as a DV instead of treating it based on the cash value of the car. Well, it is a DV case, so I'm confused here. So, anyway this was on 2/26/08 and he tells me that he will tell the appraiser to talk to my appraiser. An hour later I get an email from the adjuster telling me that they are sending their appraiser to talk to my appraiser. Well, duh. Her boss already told me that.I email Steve and tell him that he should be hearing from Marshall soon and he tells me that once he does he will not be in contact with me until it's over or it goes to a 3rd party umpire. I say okay.So, Marshall emails me and says that Unitrin had initially put the claim on hold but they had now given him the go ahead to negotiate with Steve.Oh, I forgot to mention I had been consulting with an attorney at this time because of Unitrin's failure to abide by the contract and the attorney advised me to let the appraiser's work it out.  Plus I could not afford the attorney so I did as suggested which was let them work it out...except...A few days later I get an email from Steve stating he still had not heard from Marshall. This was on 3/11/08. I got an email from Marshall 3/8/08 stating that he and Steve were working on the values that the final settlement was not up to them. Well, that goes against the appraisal clause too (violation #4). As of today 4/1/08 Steve has still NOT heard from their appraiser.I got in the mail 3/24/08 a letter from the GA insurance commissioner's office which included a response to my complaint from Unitrin. The information the regional manager provided is completely inauccurate.  He stated that any statements or claims that they are in violation of the appraisal clause is not true. he did not provide any evidence. he listed names and dates. The dates were wrong as are the names. I have emails and phone records to prove that. He also stated that their appraiser Rick Frantz had spoken to my appraiser as of 2/4/08. Well, first of all Mr. Frantz is NOT the appraiser who came and looked at my car so how can he put a value on my car when he has not even seen it? Second of all my appraiser keeps a log of all calls and mail and email and he has not received one phone call from Mr. Frantz (or anyone else for that matter) and does not know who he is. The funny thing is how can Unitrin state that Mr Frantz has been in contact with my appraiser since 2/4/08 when their appraiser (Marshall) wasn't even given the go ahead to talk to my appraiser until 3/4/08? That the case was in review by management according to an email from the adjuster on 2/26/08. I mean seriously. Get your act together. They don't know what they are doing.I sent a copy of their letter to my appraiser and had him write a response. I called Clark Howard's consumer advocacy line and they suggested I take them to small claims court. Which sounded great until I realized I would have to go to Tampa to do it as that is where the claims office is.I called the manager at Unitrin that I had been speaking to and he is nice enough for a car insurance guy. He told me that Unitrin is not going to settle this and it is going to 3rd party umpire. I told him I don't see how he could say that when his appraiser has not contacted my appraiser and that the name his boss gave is not the name of the appraiser that came out to examine my car. The manager also stated that Unitrin had not handled this the way they should have. He said that unitrin is not going to settle if you don't have a scientific formula. I told him that was in violation of the appraisal clause and he didn't say anything. I also told him that the amount that they offered me was not in accordance with the 17c formula (which they claim to use). I told him I calculated that formula and it came out to $1500. He said he would check the numbers and if the error was on there part they would cut another check. I called back on 3/31/08 and he stated the numbers were the same. I told him he was forgetting about the structure damage. He said they really didn't show any. Well, radiator support being replaced counts as structure damage. He said it didn't affect the value of the formula.  Talk about ripping me off!  Oh, I should probably mention that the adjuster they hired to go out and examine my car before the repairs and take pictures.  Didn't do it.  He went out there but he didn't write the report nor did he take the pictures.  The service manager in charge of repairing my car did and he is a licensed appraiser.  So, the adjuster just decided to use his stuff instead, he got paid anyways.Well, before calling him I contacted another independent appraiser and faxed them all the repair info on the car. they called back and said they really couldn't do anything as i had implemented the appraisal clause but they did vouch for Steve my appraiser. They also stated it looked to them like the DV amount should be between $4-5,000 and that Unitrin was trying to cheat me. They suggested I go after them for a ""bad faith claim"" which is when they don't honor an agreement. They also suggested I get Unitrin to provide everything in writing to me.So, I emailed the man whose name was on the letter from GA insurance commissioner's office and asked about that. He told me at this time I didn't have a case and if I had evidence I should send it in. I had already sent it in on the Friday before but I guess he hadn't read it yet. So, I resent it and included a more detailed accounting.  I unlike Unitrin provided supporting documents. So, I am waiting to hear back from them. I don't see how they could say I don't have a bad faith claim.So, back to the conversation with the manager at Unitrin. I told him I requested everything in writing and he said you want your file. I said yes. I told him I was going after them for a bad faith claim. he said Kelly we have really good records. I was like so do I and your records are faulty with regards to names and dates. Mine aren't. He said he would email it to me. We will see if he does.Any advice?  I am sick and tired of the large corporations trying to take advantage of the little people.  I am changing my insurance tomorrow.  I have already switched to a new agency but my policy won't go in effect until midnight tonight.  I am worried that Unitrin will continue to take money from my account as they have a history of doing that.  I could really use some help on this as I don't have the money for an attorney.Thanks!KellyAtlanta, GeorgiaU.S.A.

Well, I got these sporadic checks for amounts that were never correct and hardly ever paid on time. The insurance company's pay American Eagle Consultants, and you get paid from American Eagle because you sign a contract with them and part of that contract states you are signing your commissions over to them. Big mistake, I called and complained and sometimes they would correct their mistake and send me another check for the correct amount. Well, I was still out selling for them in 2007 and they decided to keep 15% of every policy I sold that year. I was supposed to get the 15% back after 90 days and that never happened. Still haven't been paid the 15%, called about it ten dozen times to no avail, incompetent accounting clerk keeps stating that the money is there, that she is just waiting for Will Smallwood to give the go ahead for her to release it. It has been over a year now and no pay from them. When I try to talk to Will myself, you have to leave a message of course, and he never calls you back.Now it is 2008 and I am supposed to get a renewal commission on all the policies I sold in 2006 and 2007 that are still in force, right... WRONG....I haven't received a dime since October 2007 and still waiting. It simply does no good to call and there are a lot of other agents just like me out here who have not been paid, just scammed...We know who each other are we think there are enough of us to file a class action law suit. Such a shame when you have earned the commission and you are still servicing these poor seniors, who call you all the time with questions, they don't have a clue you haven't been paid to service them. You are out here trying to sell to make a living and don't really have the time to fight the agency who is ripping you off, that's what Will Smallwood is probably banking on. There are some captive agents still working there that are SCARED to leave because they have signed so many contracts with them and they are new in the insurance business and don't really know what else is out here or what to do, well, they tell us independent agents what is happenning at the agency. I hear Will goes to Florida almost every weekend with his girlfriend, while the agents are looking for the mailman. Shame, shame and he said he was raised a Christian, and went to a Christian school.The one thing that is wrong, is you never get released from them once you sign a contract with them to sell the products. Will will promise you a release  so you can work directly for the insurance companies and get paid directly from them but he never follows through with his promises. Isn't there a law about a persons right to work in Georgia? I cannot go to work directly for these companies like Humana and Blue Cross Blue Shield because he won't release me, and I am not getting paid from these two companies because he refuses to release my pay.I made a bad mistake when I got hooked up with this shameless outfit, I did not realize that I was signing my paycheck over to the agency, or I never would have done it. All the other companies I represent I get paid directly from the company and have no problems. I am owed a lot of money and I deserve to be paid and released from this agency. I have the right to work for anyone I choose, and this agency is holding me back from earning a living, and that should be against the law.All you agents out here who are being ripped off from American Eagle Consultants and Will Smallwood let's hear you Yell....Licensed Agentsomewhere near Atlanta, GeorgiaU.S.A.

" Bobby Thomas, Jr. Agent For Nationwide Insurance ","  Bobby Thomas, Jr. Agent For Nationwide Insurance  Bell Road Antioch, Tennessee U.S.A. ","", 615-3330232,"Bobby Thomas, Jr. Agent For Nationwide Insurance Inconsiderate and Irresponsible Antioch Tennessee","										Three weeks ago I began requesting information for a new out-of-state policy (for the 2nd time because I was told to wait until my 6 month term was up before) and also needing a policy submitted to the state's database showing that I do in fact have insurance. I explained from the beginning that the state I live in has notified me that they need proof submitted by my insurance company or my license and registration would be revoked for up 6 months. I was told it would be worked on and someone would call me back. Several days later I called again to follow up because I had not heard anything. Again, I was told that Bobby would be working on it and he would call me back. So a few days later, I called to only be told it was being worked on and that he just hadn't been able to get to it.  I explained my concerns and that Bobby Thomas, Jr. had in fact not called me.  It wasn't five minutes later the same young lady called me back and gave me a quote. This quote was in fact $30 higher a month than it was 2 months ago when we originally went over what I would be looking at. Even then we went from almost $200 a month to $120. I was a bit concerned because I have been with Nationwide for 9 years now, never been a minute late on a payment and never have had to be reminded of my payment. I told here that I could not and would not pay $150 for my insurance a month and pretty minimal benefits being a female with a perfectly clean record. I had previously had a suspension on it that I was not technically responsible for but had such a time trying to get it removed that I gave up and decided to just pay the cost until it fell off. Though it was removed from my record later, my monthly cost never went down. I asked the lady on the phone (the office manager) to please stop the direct payment from my banking account in the event I could get it cheaper. I explained that I am doing the best I can to make ends meet as it it. She said okay and that my account would be fine until the Friday of that week. Mind you, we are well into 2 weeks from the original call and I have yet to be able to prove to the state that I have insurance and it has never lapsed. I find that with Allstate my rate is cheaper, I am getting more coverage, and my amount would go down each 6 months that I am accident free. Now, I would be paying very little had I started with Allstate in the beginning!! So on the Thursday of this week I call to follow up and make sure they are not planning to deduct money from  my account and the lady keeps asking me who I talked to about stopping it. Being on my way to my 2nd job, I had the paperwork I'd been keeping notes on locked in my office at work. I basically get a ""tough"" response and I am told that the payment has already processed and would be taken from my account the following day. She assured me there was nothing she could do. I should have sent her written notice 3-5 days prior to cancel my service, though she never mentioned any of this during the duck hunt they led me on over the past 2 weeks. Then she goes on to tell me that Bobby Thomas is going to tell me the exact same thing and there's nothing they can do...she puts me on hold for a while once I demand to speak with him and comes back to say he's on another line. I had even asked her what if I just withdraw the money from my account so that you can't take it and her response is well when it comes back to us we also charge you a $30 fee. WHAT?!?! So once she refuses to let me speak with Bobby Thomas I explain that I want to hear from him tonight or I would be taking further action she just says huh thank you, thank you, thank you. I told her that when we spoke on Monday for her to be so ""black and white"" now, the honest thing for her to do would have been to tell me then that if I was going to find something more I needed to submit the request then and not to lead me through this gray area.  And in case she missed a step it was actually her that told me the change on my account would be stopped and she dropped the ball. Though she insists that she is not capable of making a mistake and that basically I am lying but all she could say was that's not what she said. So either she didn't say it or I am lying and I have much better taste than that as I am much more responsible than that. She dropped the ball just as I assumed she had when she amazingly got my quote within 5 minutes of ME CALLING THEM to follow up... I am working 2 jobs 6 days a week 15 hours a day and have been for almost a year now. I have NEVER  been late on a payment to them and I am doing the best I can to make other things right and pay people what I owe.  The last thing I can do, as I am sure many Americans will agree with me in this time of distress economically, is afford to pay 2 insurance payments!!!  Here it is almost 4 business days later and I have yet to hear from Bobby Thomas, Jr. They are in complete disreguard to their customers, any situations, or taking responsibility for their actions. ( or lack thereof ) I spoke with a lady whom I believe is with the corporate office on Friday and explained my situation. She has been more than helpful and very very courteous (sic) to my situation and helping me resolve this matter. However because of this one agent, they have lost my business as a company and I will move forward to a smaller company before I will contribute them again.  My problem is not with Nationwide Insurance as it is with the Bobby Thomas, Jr office for Nationwide.  I ended up having to cancell payment with my bank and fortunately they were understanding enough that I had all fees waived and Nationwide Insurance waived fees on their end for the stop payment. And now a lady in Ohio is having to deal with me so that I know everything is okay and taken care of because OBVIOUSLY THE BOBBY THOMAS, JR OFFICE IS CONCERNED WITH ANYTHING BUT TAKING CARE OF THE CUSTOMERS THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR. I would advise anyone to go with Nationwide through the 1800 number. Sometimes even having someone directly to deal with is more worthless than a random person that is a little more understanding to what kind of creeps are in an agency.Concerned_customerla vergne, TennesseeU.S.A.

An employer is supposed to help his/her workers feel secure and valued in their role at that company but Greg Thomson's evil Office Manager was too damn difficult to work for.  All she ever did was make me feel inferior and so nervous all the time that I had tension headaches constantly and lost a lot of sleep.  I was only there a few days per week yet dreaded waking up on each of those days and having to face that workplace.I worked there for a few months and she always had some sort of issue with me, yet I did my utmost to fit into the office environment which was uncomfortably small and I am an extremely sociable person!  Yet these people were too hard to connect with.  Even another of their employees had issues with me and I was nothing but kind to her.  Just because these ignorant people have had vast experience and training in the insurance industry and I didn't, I was made to feel stupid and my work efforts were never good enough while I was there.  Also, it is very inappropriate for a person in authority such as this office manager to discuss people's private lives and talk about others in a derogatory manner, yet she did this constantly.  It made me sick to my stomach to hear her put people down, thinking she was so superior in this human race yet she did not realise that the whole time, she was just perceived as a bitter old grump who needed to get a bit on the side!  I pitied her for being so judgemental and nasty when what she should have been doing was being happy that she was in such a position of authority and being a positive example to the employees.So my advice to anyone considering applying for a job at this firm is RUN, run for your life and don't even go there because you will be nothing but disappointed (unless you're an a** kisser who fits in with a bunch of snobs who are out of touch with reality).  I know I am not the only former employee who feels this way.  Many of their past employees I've heard were dissatisfied with their treatment whilst at this firm.Anonymous7MelbourneAustralia									",  Insurance Agencies

I have never had a claim, or had my policy cancelled due to lack of payment.I purchased a home in 2002 and added my home to my policy. My first year was about 295.00 a year, then my policy went up to almost 400.00. This summer I receieved a notice from my mortgage company about my escrow account being to low and found out it was due to my insurance rate going up. I received nothing ahead of time from American Family. I immediately called my agent and was told, the new rates were based on credit reports and that my new yearly policy rate was almost 600.00.I have a credit score over 650! Its not perfect but I have raised a family on my own and had some small problems throughout those years. I don't have huge debt, my actual credit report has maybe two things on it that are very small, one is a charge I have disputed since the beginning.  The other one I am working on its a dental bill.I have a perfect driving record, work full time and I think this is unfair. I never gave American Family permission to access my credit information, I believe that is a privacy issue. I understand accessing my driving record, but this is just plain wrong. The most upsetting part of the whole thing was what my agent told me.She stated "" People with low credit scores are more likely to file a claim""! I think that is no better than people who racially profile. Like saying if you're a certain race you are more likely to commit a crime, if you're female you are more likely to call in sick to your job, or miss work due to sick children. By the way I called her Friday after work, she was irritated about it being close to 5pm but I had just gotten home from work and found the notice from my mortgage company. She promised to call me Monday and let me know exactly what the details were and she never did. I plan to continue to voice my disgust to anyone that will listen and change insurance companies ASAP! I will post it all over the net, email it to all my friends and family and ask that it be forwarded on. I was told by one person that due to the natural disasters in recent years like Katrina, floods etc. that insurance companies needed to bring in the money! Too much going out, well thats not fair. I've had things happen around my house where I could have filed a claim, I fixed them myself. Including lightning striking my air conditioning unit.

","", 717-295-4743,United Benefits FRAUD - BART KING LIES TO MAKE PIDDLY COMMISION - SELLS THINGS YOU DON'T NEED - HE MAKES GUARANTEES THAT ARE NOT TRUE Nashville Tennessee,"										My wife and I were looking for health insurance because I have become a stay at home dad while my wife is working as an RCA at the post office and trying to get a full-time position.   I was doing a search on the internet for health insurance and filled out an online form.  Only a few short minutes after I filled it out I got a call from a salesman named BART KING from United Benefits.  I told him I was interested in a Health Insurance quote and gave him some information.  He called me back a little later with the quote, one flat quote.  In all our discussions he never told me that he was selling me a discount plan that included reimbursements.  I was looking for HEALTH INSURANCE not a DISCOUNT PLAN! I only found out later that there were actually 3 different companies in the quote and that I could have picked chose what I wanted.  One for medical ""discounts"", one for accidental injury, and one for prescription ""discounts"".  He also stated that if I didn't like the plan for any reason after looking over the policy that I could cancel it within 30 days.Well, now the fun part.   There were ""enrollment fees"" attached to signing up and BART told me that every ""insurance"" company charged enrollment fees.  He told me that if I didn't like the policy I could cancel and get back all premiums AND enrollment fees except for the enrollment fee for the discount prescription plan ($100, again, I did not know I could separate this off the plan.  He conveniently wouldn't tell me that).   Once I got my policy and saw what I truly benefitted from I called UBA about a question I had regarding a limit of 5 visits per year to a doctor (that I was not told about) and the fact that it was only a reimbursment of $25 per visit.  I asked him point blank about what it would cost me to go to the doctor and he told me nothing because there was a $0 deductible and a $0 co-pay.  True, there is no co-pay...BECAUSE IT'S A $25 REIMBURSEMENT!  He was very sly about that and downright lied that there was no cost for me to go to the doctor.  So, when I called UBA I was greeted with an answering machine that says they will call you within 48 hours.  You will NEVER once get a person to talk to at their so-called ""customer service"".  1-800-608-4471 ext 204  Try the number...you'll see.So when someone called me back the next day I spoke with a lady named Michelle Cook.  I explained my dilema with Bart and his not telling me everything only to find out more about the fact that I could have opted out of part of the coverage that I didn't need.  I asked to be removed from the $119.95 per month $10,000 accidental coverage (meaning you had to lose a hand, foot, eyeballs etc... I wonder if I could claim a settlement for losing my mind with the company?)  I thought that price was ridiculous so I told her I didn't want it.  She told me that I could get my premium back but that the enrollment fee would not be refunded.  Well, at that point I had it with BART and his slick sales tactics.  I told her about how he told me that if I was unhappy with the plan I could cancel everything and get all but the enrollment fee back for the prescription plan.   At this point she's actually (unless she was just acting) getting upset at Bart and sounds as if she was going to have something done about it.  She even says that she will do what she can by talking to some at the other company to see about returning all fees for me.  I thought that was a good solution.  However, I heard NOTHING from them after that.  I tried calling and calling and calling, always getting that stupid voicemail saying that Michelle would get back to you within 48 hours.  That didn't happen.  All they did was try to wait me out those 30 days so I couldn't get my money back.  I ended up having to change by bank account number  so they couldn't pull anything else from my account.  I also signed up for LIFEGUARD protection because of the fact I gave them my social security number.  My bank is in the process of investigating them for fraud and hopefully I can get my fees back but I don't count on it (at least not the enrollment fees).  I am trying to individually contact these 3rd party companies to cancel directly with them and file complaints against United Benefits.  DO NOT waste your time and money with this company.  If anything call and ask why these people are luring people into these plans that don't offer what UBA guarantees.  BART's extension is 274 if you'd like to ask him directly.  I hope this will serve as a warning to all about doing thorough research on a company and getting things in writing before ANY personal information is given.  This is a slimy company with slick talk and you would only be a fool to do business with them.NottakingitSmoketown, PennsylvaniaU.S.A.									",  Insurance Agencies

This company (IPA, ABBA, IAC)doesn't want to make YOU rich, they want to make their band of brothers (all ex-NASE/Cornerstone) rich. Just like before, they will say ANYTHING to you to get you to do what THEY want. Funny thing is, they have so little creativity that they can't even find the time to make up new lies for you to tell your prospective clients!You do not have to get in your car and ""walk and talk"" business owners in the rain, snow, 100% heat while paying $4/gallon for gas etc. in order to sell health insurance. And you do NOT have to charge someone a $95 application fee after already adding up to $90 in an association plan they do NOT need on top of incredibly overpriced health insurance.Wake up people! It's 2008 and because of the internet and online applications, 95% of the health insurance written in this country is done over the phone...not in person.The captive agents sell Independence American health insurance (administered by IAC - a third party administrator) which in itself is not all that bad except for their lack of prescription drug coverage. The problem with the insurance is that it is extremely overpriced and your agent will LIE to you and say anything to get you to buy it because they have nothing else to sell.If you are considering joining this company by thinking you will retire a millionaire in 10 years...move on. You cannot maintain a book of business because a truly independent broker will come across your client and roll your business by simply showing your ex-client a better plan while saving them about $200 per month.I've been captive and I've been independent. Captive advances are simply loans. Since 99.9% of agents hired into captivity flunk out of the business, they leave owing companies like this thousands of dollars and usually signed on NOT realizing this and/or being lied to about it as well as the ""stock"" accumulation program. You won't retire a millionaire in 10 years if the stock ALL your money is in takes a dive the year before you vest. Just ask some of the NASE/Cornerstone hangers on that have lost over HALF of their stock value just in the past 18 months.The way these top tier managers/VP's are making money off your efforts is simple. They keep the $95 app fee, they make a killing off REQUIRING you to sell the ABBA membership which virtually gives your client nothing but a headache and is taught to be sold in a misleading way, they charge you interest on your debit balance and they charge you an average of $300 to join their little company. Multiply that by the 100's of recruits they hope to get every month and the thousands of app fees and ABBA memberships and the guys who left Cornerstone/NASE to start this deal are getting rich. They also cash and deposit your client's initial premium payment WAY before the policy is ever issued which other health insurance companies DO NOT. You do the math. How much interest are they earning during the 2-8 weeks before that policy ever goes into effect? Multiply that by the soon to be 1000's of apps taken weekly...60% of which will never be issued or not taken.Yes, THEY are getting rich, YOU ARE NOT!!! You will be making a piddly 18%. Oops, make that 9%. They will only advance you 6 months and when that policy falls off the books you ARE charged back...they just call it a ""taken rate"". Soon, your taken rate will be around 40-50% (if that high) and your advance commission weekly will drop to about 4 - 4.5%. In the REAL insurance world, you can negotiate a 25% contract, buy your own leads (don't get me started on the crap they call leads and the way they also make money off their so called manager's lead accounts), and if you get paid AS EARNED, you avoid chargebacks altogether.This is purely a scam that these guys perfected in the early 90's over at NASE/Cornerstone America. Read HUNDREDS of ripoff reports about how badly the agents were/are treated there.If you are in the market for health insurance, steer clear of the captive agent. They are only looking out for themselves and most of them haven't been in the business 6 months. Find an independent agent with at least 5 years of experience selling insurance for multiple carriers so you can feel assured that you are getting the best product at the best rate for your unique and individual needs.FreeatlastSomewhere in the SE, FloridaU.S.A.

After that, as stated in other Rip-Off Reports, he blames you for being negative when you ask why people are not home or wondering why you are at their doorstep.In regards to how the appointments are set, I have a few theories that are concurrent with other Rip-Off Reports:1) People are ""fast-talked"" and just say OK to get them off the phone.2) Old folks are confused when the caller says ""Someone will drop by to have you sign something.""3) They simply call from any old list bought from a poor quality list broker.I apologized to one prospect and asked her what exactly the person said to her on the phone.  She said they called andstated that they worked for a number of different investment companies and that someone would be by to have her sign a paper, to which she did not agree.  Nevetheless, I received an appointment in my e-mail box:""Your appointment has been scheduled for 5:30PM. We identified the asset as an IRA. He would like to see what new options are available toward his investment that could be beneficial to him.""She mentioned that all assets were with another firm and they needed no review whatsoever. I have over 15 similar comment logs and all appointment ""confirmations"" saved for evidence and record-keeping, if anyone wants specific and consistent results of my wasted time and gas. So far, there has been 1 appointment that I accepted as ""good"" because the guy (very confused) allowed me to come in and go over his investments just to be nice I believe.As with other reports, they never offer a full refund, only more bad appointments because that is what the ""contract"" says.  How long can that go on? I cannot even get a phone call back from Janet (a real specimen), Zack, or David Morgan.  I have also literally been hung up on by David Morgan, when they promise the best service possible on their web page.If there is a group of agents that would like to go to their Cookeville office to take a ""tour"" of their office, I would be glad to discuss that.There are quite a few reports surfacing lately and, against what David Morgan will say, they have not tried to be helpful or give me the time of day for a real refund.ProducerMultiple Cities, VirginiaU.S.A.

","", 215-364 -7600,Mike Mullen - Allstate Insurance Agent You might be in good hands with Allstate but not Mike Mullen! Southhampton Pennsylvania,"										August 27, 2008 I contacted an insurance agent by the name of Mike Mullen in regards to having a few vehicles insured. I started off by having just one vehicle insured to see how he operated, well everything seemed to be going ok so I had Mike insure me with business, workers comp, and cargo insurance as well. I initially recieved a quote for $2800.00 dollars. That was fine. September I bought 4 for more vehicles for my business and decieded to have these insured also but with less limits than the bigger truck I own because I do different work these vehicles that dont require as much insurance. Mike's office insured me without a problem except they forgot to mention that I would have to drop an additional 20% down payment on the total premium combined for all these vehiclesthe following. Nor did he mention that all my vehicles would carry the same coverage. Now I have dealt with other insurance companies in the past where you could add the vehicles with the only result being that you pay whatever difference in your monthly payments. Long and behold this was not the intentions of Mike Mullen! Back to the beginning, The $2800.00 was to be paid on September 28th, 2008 in which it was. The following week Mike decieded to automatically withdrawl $2000.00 from my checking account without my consent nor ever recieving a bill for the new vehicles I added, when I caught it I called Mike and he said that it was a done deal, I couldn't get my money back. I did though only by calling Allstate cooprate in regards to his behavior.October 28th I get a bill from Mike Mullen for the amount of $6800.00 for the vehicles I added. I was outraged!! After recieving the bill I contacted Mike and that's when he decieded to inform me of his method of doing business, which was new to me after dealing with Progressive which I regret leaving!Now for all this insurance you would think I would have all the coverage in the world. Wrong!!!!!!!October 24th 2008 Mike ammended my policy by adding Non Owned Autio coverage to my policy without my knowledge which was another charge of $128.00 per vehicle. During the week of October 26th 2008, I placed one of my vehicles in the shop for repairs. Just my luck the shop went up in flames but to add insult to injury I find out that the shop never had a lick of insurance and Allstate denied my claim of loss. My agent once again failed to explain that Non owned auto coverage which only extends full coverage to vehicles I rent or borrow but not my own vehicles.!!! Crazy right...Saga continues.... Now we are up to Dec. 1st 2008, I called Mike Mullen to report a home damage claim using my supposed business insurance which covers any home I'm doing work in. I explained to Mike my situaton, Mike assured me that I would be covered 100% before getting off the phone with him. 1 hour later Mike calls me back saying that the policy wasn't issued because of a bounced check. Well this check was issued initially 8/27/08 when I signed on. Ironically the check wasn't cashed until 12/1/08 so I visited the bank to inquire about this check. The bank informed me that November 29th 2008, was the first time this check was ever presented to them and it cleared Dec. 1st 2008. The bank also gave me a copy of the front and back of the check, the also illustrated to me that the back of the cancelled check shows all activity on a check being presented for payment.The check never bounced!!!! This has been one nightmare after the next dealing with this shady individual so stay away from this insurance gangster. I'm still fighting this guy but had to let you guys know how he plays................KPhila, PennsylvaniaU.S.A.									",  Insurance Agencies

Of course, they charge you $24 per lead.  Jeff Huggins appears to be a very nice person who has been very successful in the insurance business.  His sales pitch was very appealing.  However, after they make you pay $500 to simply join the company as a 1099 agent. Then they turn you over to a man named Frank Vandersande, a successful salesman turned General Agent.  He conducts all the training.  You receive training to sell one product, a Universal Life Product specifically geared to the mortgage protection market.  I found Frank to be extremely arrogant and incredibly pushy and rude.  He didn't like answering questions, preferring to tell me to  say exactly what he told me to say.  He liked to say, ""You don't need to think.  We've done all the thinking for you.  All you need to do is EXACTLY what I tell you to do.""The training seemed rushed and incomplete.  In talking with others in the training class, along with a few agents who had been there for a short time, it seemed to me that very few really understood the policy we were selling.  I became afraid to ask Frank any questions because of his rude and unprofessional manner.After a couple of weeks of Frank's rudeness, I quit.  As it turns out, I was typical.  Most people who pay their $500 and go through the training, then start paying $24 per lead and endure Frank's rude manner soon quit.  I just caution anyone considering this opportunity to BEWARE!BruceMarietta, GeorgiaU.S.A.									",  Insurance Agencies

Beware of high prices. Make sure you understand what you are buying before you sign the insurance papers.  Adrianas Insurance preys on the innocent people who do not have a license to drive but need to have insurance on their vehicle because they need it to go to work to support their families. Yes I am talking about latinos immigrants. That is her bread and butter. Especiall now that the economy is so bad. She charges them high fees and says they are getting the best coverage, when in reality she gets them on a liability insurance only.Currently she has pending lawsuits because her ""INSURANCE AGENTS"" do not sign the insurance applications like they should and the reason they are not signing them is very simple, she has unlicensed, undocumented workers and managers working for her not only selling the insurance, but also underwriting the insurance policies. Thats right ILLEGAL ALLIENS. I know this because I was employed by this company at one time. This so called Insurance company is not an Insurance company but a broker. She has offices all over the Los Angeles area. Its really a shame what she is doing not only to the customers but to her employees also. Im surprised she has not been caught or fined, but the reason she has not been caught is because once again her employees are scared to speak out and report her to the department of insurance because of their legal status. And of course she takes advantage of that and treats her employees very unfairly. Currently she is one of the biggest agencies for insurance in California and is very very well known throughout the latino community. There is alot of advertisements on tv, radio, and hispanic magazines. They have a website, WWW.ADRIANASINSURANCE.COM, and they advertise zero down and low monthly payments for auto, commercial, motorcycle, rv, health and life insurance. Are you kidding me.Not many people know this,but It is illegal to not charge for insurance.

I have always paid them based on payroll but for some reason I was told that they charge a minimum amount covering the owner. I told them that this was odd that I had never been charged this before we cancelled with them. I also ask them to reveal in the policy where this is stated and was never given an answer. I feel that they invented this policy due to the fact that I cancelled with them and posibly due to they're $346.4 million dollar loss for the third quarter of 2007. I have auto insuranse with them now but will shortly be cancelling this as well. I will make up my losses by getting a cheaper auto policy.

","", 800-214-6416,Investor's Financial Group Insurance Buyer's Beware Dunn North Carolina,"										If you bought an insurance policy from IFG or are thinking of doing so please read the following:  I am a disgruntled employee.  I will agree to that.  But what follows is the absolute truth.  If you bought  an insurance policy from IFG please check your policy.  Your policy will probably show that the agent was Mike Lee or Adam McConnell.  Did you actually buy your policy from them?  Probably not...  See the way this works is you are contacted by an automated system asking if you are interested in buying insurance.  If you respond you are then contacted by a telemarketer who may or not be a licensed insurance agent.  You are then told you will be contacted by an ""underwriter"" which will probably be Adam or Mike.  They will then submit your policy to the insurance company under their name and collect the commission and pay the actual person who sold your policy to you next to nothing.  If you have a policy form this company please check the agent's name on the policy.  Is this the actual person you spoke to?  Or does your policy show another name?  Why would this be?  Because Mike and Adam hire people who are not licensed to sell insurance and pay them next to nothing and when they do sell the policies Mike and Adam submit them in their name to collect the fat commissions and other incentives.  If you do have a policy and it was not sold to you by Mike or Adam, please contact the actual insurance company and ask why????  I confronted IFG about this situation and was accused of slander, but the defense against slander is the absolute truth, and this is the absolute truth.ThehousefellonmysisterDunn, North CarolinaU.S.A.

First of all, this company found me on the internet and called me up to staff Wal Mart stores with a United Healthcare booth. All was well until I encountered problems with my booth. I called and called Edgar to have the issues resolved, but to no avail. Then I resorted to using their medicare marketing leads, in which people filled out a form and mailed it back in to be contacted by an agent. After calling a few of these people and being hung up on as soon as I mentioned that I was calling in response to the form that was mailed in, I gave up on the idea. So then I resorted to my own marketing efforts, only to find out that Gordon Marketing lost its license in NY. Now I am dealing with all kinds of commissions problems while my bills have to wait to be paid. I have attempted to resolve the situation with Edgar of Gordon Marketing, but so far I have not been paid despite submitting business two months ago. If you want to get contracted to sell medicare plans, I suggest trying another agency out there.

","", 615-371-1911,Mutual Of Omaha & Gary Simmerly will cost you MONEY! Franklin Tennessee,"										The purpose of this letter is to convey a costly financial risk associated with working as a career agent for a Life/Health insurance company.  My experience is based on working for The Mutual of Omaha in Franklin, TN during 2008.   There are two financial risks associated with this position.  The first is charge-backs from policy's that were sold, but declined.  In this situation the agent is advanced commission, but the application is declined by the company or client. Then the advanced commission is charged back to the agent.The other financial risk is the cost of leads provided by the insurance company.  At the Mutual of Omaha agents are pressured into buying leads that the manager buys. In my experience these leads were terrible and I would not have bought them if not pressured.  During my three months there my lead cost totaled over $1600.At the Mutual of Omaha you have to attain a sales objective in 3 months or you are out of a job.  Due to a large number of declines, I did not make the objective and therefore left the company.  Now I am getting letters from a collection agency.  If I had been told while interviewing that there was a possibility that I could be in debt in three months, I would not have taken this position.  I know the job market is tough, but you need to know about these risks before contracting with an insurance Company like Mutual of Omaha.Rip off victimNashville, TennesseeU.S.A.

I've been in sales for all of my adult life thus far...I'm 29, single mother here.  Anyways, I can only speak for my experiences as well as what I have witnessed and I will leave you all with this to sum it all up...Letter to Regional Director: (who did absolutely nothing which is surprising for the fact that 3 others sent him emails of similar complaints of disrespect, foul mouth management, ridicule, unfair treatment, racial remarks, and the list goes on and on and on...Dear Mr. Roger Rich,Per our conversation on June 11, 2009, at your request, I am composing this letter to express my concerns regarding the management strategies of Branch 638 and my desire to resign.  Oh, please forgive my poor transition...I'm just getting this all out and not even attempting to be eloquent about it.  It is what it is!There have been several situations that I, as an adult possessing integrity and honesty, can no longer bring myself to work for Monica Burgess and Todd Baxter.  I have never in my life had to deal with such contradictions, hypocrisy, rude, and disrespectful people in my life.  Unfortunately I am not the only person with these concerns.While working the field with my UM, Monica, I witnessed her bash other employees, another UM, as well as the BM.  People's jobs are in jeopardy each day depending upon the mood she is in.  I've witness her acknowledge that she felt certain employee's were ""worthless, lazy, pieces of sh**, fu** them"".  I've heard her tell Agents on the phone that ""excuses are like a**holes...everybody's got one"".  Her personal dislike for particular people are made clear by her demeanor, disposition, as well as her own statements voiced aloud in front of their peers.I ran with her for nearly 1 month, then ran with her and Jennifer Criss who was shortly after pulled from working with me because she had children she had to attend to by 6:30 pm.  Then I worked with Karen Vallor, who's father recently passed away and had to attend to her mother on occasion who is a retiree.  Monica literally said, ""I'm done w/them, they are on their own"".  Soon after, again, I started over again running with solely Monica until somebody ""with a work ethic like myself"" was found.  I'm here to make a living, not friends but I myself understand that people have loved ones, and other responsibilities other than pacifying this person.Needless to say, it's now week 9 for me and I've been running with Jessica Eversmeyer, who is about 5 weeks in this company, for 2 weeks now.  I feel that after getting off that roller coaster, and running solely w/Jessica, we have found a groove and developed a great system.  However, yesterday a situation happened between Monica and Jessica that was totally uncalled for.  I heard the conversation from the next room.  Never in my life have I ever seen and heard a person mistreat others as Monica does and what's even more disturbing is that Todd condones it.  I refuse to work for people who have no respect for their employees.  It was everything Jessica had in her to not run out of that office and never look back.  The sad thing is, Jessica was not the only person that Monica snapped at that very day.Additionally, we have asked for a Sales Genie list and have been told flat out ""NOPE!""...no reason, no explanation at all, just ""NOPE""!  Who does that?  Not Managers!  I've expressed my concern regarding the reasoning behind the cold shoulder and where I stand for I did not know if I even had a job the next day after taking 1 personal day to attend to my son and I was assigned ""homework"" to list my commitment to my Branch...bit ridiculous in my eyes considering just 2 weeks prior to I was told in confidence by Monica that she was taking a branch and she wanted to take me w/her to help her build it and that I was the only one within the branch that she wanted to take...now what changed? I hadn't...except for 1 day out.  I graduated high school in 1998 and I have no desire to return.  I'm an adult, and I carry myself as such.  I'm not doing homework at 9:30 pm on a weekday for a tasteless UM on a power trip that is obviously throwing their weight around.I understand Monica's #3 UA UM and I could honestly careless-it means nothing if at the end of the day the only person left within that branch is the BM.  Dealing w/individuals sales and running an office w/your Branch manager only vs. running a branch w/numerous units as well as dealing w/business owners is a totally different ballgame.  There has to be some level of trust, flexibility,  & consistency amongst the Branch, units, AND these business owners. We have been forced to push our prospective clients into enrollment dates that are not feasible for them.  We have been forced to drop in on prospective clients whom we consistently have kept the lines of communication open to push paperwork out of them.  I do not know about you but I'd trust my agent that has the report to handle their deal not intervene and push and subsequently lose the entire case especially when the agent has given no reason whatsoever that they are not performing.  Bottom line, if I'm doing what I'm told, bringing in paperwork, and have proved myself please allow me to run my deal I see fit since I'm the one w/my hands in it...not somebody who has no idea about the case or the ongoing communications.This past Monday I attended the mandatory recruiting session as I have gone to each & every one since the weekend prior to my start date.  The majority of the time the dialer is not set up, the internet is down, or they are just too busy as UM and BM to get us going on the calls.  We waited patiently Monday for 2 hours before we were given anything to call and recruit on.  I understand things happen but we are micromanaged to the point where it is known and practiced that we come prepared and ready to go ""no exceptions no excuses"" and we abide by this rule.  Our time is just as valuable and should be respected as us agents do theirs.I have always been a hard worker, been at plan, hit my #s, and have been known as a Top Performer.  I would love to recruit people into LibNat but I will not recruit for this branch.  Knowing what I know, and experiencing what I have experienced, I lack the capacity to bring another person into 638.  I am absolutely bewildered and floored that this is acceptable behavior.Since the 1 personal day off I have been snubbed, trashed, and have been informed that Monica has advised my own partner ""do not tell Lisa"" about situations that I have had a part of.  Regardless of how big or small, it's the point:  I do not need it, I do not want it, and I definitely do not deserve it.I'm not walking on pins and needles any longer.  I'm not stressing if a deal I partook in will be given to somebody that's on her good side/buddy list/safe list that day or that week.  It's asinine.  I understand what I'm about to leave behind, a few deals and a few friends but I'm not subjecting myself to this nor will I sell out my 4 year old son for this particular branch who could obviously careless about the 16 hour days I put in as an Agent.The array of individuals that come in and out of this branch should be expected from here on out.  I hope that you understand my level of frustration, for I've got a lot in to this.  I do apologize for inconveniencing you after business hours however I felt it of utmost importance that these issues be looked into.  I would have contacted Tim Knuckles whom I have utmost respect for but after witnessing Mike Rivera get trashed, backstabbed, and disrespected I felt the least Tim could have done was maybe research his accusations and his side of the story.  It is common knowledge within this branch to be vague, to the point, and discuss nothing in detail about your deals-it's a ""needs to know basis"".  I've been warned by other UM and agents to watch who I talk to in the office.  I've been told, as if I'm a child, to not speak to particular people by my UM and BM!!!  Again, not the only one to have experienced these juvenile and bogus restrictionsI'm not looking to seek revenge for it's not in my nature...but my objective for this composition is to hopefully be a voice so that somebody can intervene and salvage some great people that are currently there.Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions or need names and #s from others who said that they are willing to voice their concerns as well.Thanks for your time and consideration,Lisa (((ROR redacted)))Letter of Resignation:Lisa123 No Way Dr.Somewhere, USA 90210(((ROR redacted)))June 12, 2009To Whom It May Concern:I, Lisa , am composing this letter as my formal resignation.  Under circumstances beyond my control, I no longer have the capacity to work for Liberty National Branch 638.In nearly a decade of sales and sales management, I have never seen the behavior and practices that I have seen within this organization.  I have witnessed lies, manipulations, backstabbing, disrespect, and such juvenile behavior that I find unacceptable to tolerate.The lack of consistency, integrity, and trust has been made crystal clear to me over the last few weeks.  During my short-lived career here I have been told whom to associate with, what to say to others, and what not to say to others including my branch manager, other agents, and UM.I pride myself on being a straight shooter, honest, integral, and hard working.  I refuse to assist in the recruiting of more individuals into this branch for I would not work here myself.  If I can't give it away, how could I sell it?Working here has been like being in high school again.  When expressing my concerns and frustrations to my UM, I was assigned homework-literally.  My opinion is that a UM should converse amongst their staff and trouble shoot the situation in hopes of rectifying them-not ridicule an agent who clearly has worked hard, proven themselves, and stays positive all while being backstabbed and micro managed.I could give example after example of instances where I've been disrespected, uncomfortable, and worn thin but to be perfectly honest, why on earth would I put more time into this Branch?  I won't.  I do not need this, I do not want it, and I most definitely do not deserve it.I do apologize for this inconvenience however as of Wednesday when my partner was spoken to like dirt, I started weighing out the pros and the cons of this position and unfortunately it was 17-1 in favor of the cons.  We ran our tails off Thursday staying strong, staying positive and by day end I finally broke down and informed my partner of my decision which surprising to me-was on her mind as well.I've done nothing but do what I'm asked and work hard for my family but it has gotten to the point where any question that I ask is ridiculed, second guessed, or twisted into something that is totally in left field and off the wall.I need stability not only professionally but mentally from my branch so when I walk into the office and I do not know where I stand due to a UM's mood, it's time to move on.  Zebras do not change their stripes therefore this will always be uncomfortable, inconsistent, and a hypocrisy of what is really trying to be accomplished.I find it sad and unfortunate for the simple fact that one month ago I thought I had finally sunk my teeth into a career with an amazing compensation plan, bonus structure, benefits and great people to work with and forbut the writing on the wall is there and it's time to move on.Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to have this experience for it has been one that I will never forget.With utmost sincerity and regards,LisaNEEDLESS TO SAY...SEVERAL PEOPLE, HARD WORKING, HONEST, INTEGRAL PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED THESE SAME ISSUES, YET NOBODY HAS OFFERED A TRANSFER TO ANOTHER BRANCH.  THEY ALL, INCLUDING MYSELF, HAVE BEEN DISREGARDED AND THROW OUT AS IF WE PUT NOTHING INTO THIS.  KEEP IN MIND...3 PEOPLE IN 2 WEEKS WENT TO THE HIGHER UPS AND IT WENT NOWHERE...THIS HAS GREAT POTENTIAL BUT THERE'S NO WAY I'D RECRUIT ANYBODY TO WORK FOR 638.  THEY ARE MISERABLE MONSTERS W/NO REGARDS FOR PROFESSIONALISM AND DEFINATELY DO NOT KNOW A THING ABOUT B2B.  THEY ARE BETTER OFF REMAINING A UA BRANCH WORKING THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET-IN MY OPINION.

I was contacted regarding an on-line loan application I filled out. I sent them the first 4 payments and was told my loan would be in my account the next day. The next day I was contacted and told that the lenders insurance company would not insure the loan unless I made an additional 4 payments. Like an idiot, I wired them another 4 payments. I was told the money would then be in my account the next day. The following day I was contacted by Mark Hamilton and he told me that the department who deposits the money was backed up and that I would have it by the next day. Well the next day was a Saturday, and of course the money was not deposited. It was not until Monday that he contacted me to tell me the loan company had backed out. He said that they had found another lender who would take my loan if I would send them another 8 payments. Of course, by then I was beginning to wonder about this company. I argued with them on the phone and demanded my 8 payments back. I was informed that the lender only did refunds on July 13. I have asked Mark Hamilton several times to fax me something in writing that I would receive my money back no later than July 13 and have not received any fax yet. I am not sure what else to do about this. If anyone has any advice please feel free to contact me. (((REDACTED)))AnonymousNorth Augusta, South CarolinaU.S.A.

HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action.  And good luck Let us know how you do! ED Magedson  Founder RipoffReport.com Author of www.ripoffrevenge.com Rip-off ReportPO Box 310, Tempe, Arizona 85280",  Insurance Agencies

","", 281-589-1340,"Denise Wardwell Advised me I could not file claim, would not stop calling mortgage co to get payment AFTER I cancelled with her repeatedly, showed up at my brother's job, threatened him. Houston Texas","										I signed on with Farmers homeowners' ins several years ago.  My first agent was several months late in submitting my payments for my coverage and eventually went out of business.  I was informed I had a new agent, who did nothing but repeat the former agent's work and was generally ignorant regarding my policy.  I looked for a new agent and found Denise Wardwell, who was very nice and efficient, at first.  My brother signed on with her just before I did since he was purchasing a home.  Shortly after I signed on with her, my brother told me she showed up at his job!  He was not happy, she had no reason show up there since he had already submitted his payment to her.I had a water pipe leak in my home.  The pipe ran through the foundation and my plumber said it would be too destructive to locate so he rerouted the line through the attic.  When I tried to file a claim, Denise Wardwell argued with me saying I could not file a claim since my foundation was not covered.  No matter what I said, she insisted it was a foundation issue and my foundation was not covered!  It was a plumbing issue!!  She then advised me to insure my foundation and increased my premium.Later hurricane Ike came and she informed me that I could not file a claim because my deductible was too high.  I did not file a claim and then looked for another agent.  When my brother tried to file a claim she told him he could not since his deductible was too high.  In fact, my brother has a very low deductible.  He searched for another agent and informed her she was no longer his agent.  Denise Wardwell then called my brother, telling him that she did not like the policy the new agent drew up and that she was going to report the new agent to the insurance commission.  My brother told her to never call him again.I immediately changed agents to my brother's new agent as well.  I sent a letter via email, letting Denise Wardwell know that she was no longer to be be my agent.  My Texas Windstorm was due after my renewal on my homeowners and anticipating Denise renewing the policy in spite of my 'firing' her, I called my mortgage company and my new agent.  I instructed my mortgage company that Denise Wardwell was no longer my agent and to not disburse premium payment to her.  As predicted, Denise renewed my homeowner's policy.  I immediately called the mortgage company again, and they transferred the fee to my new agent.  My Texas Windstorm was up for renewal several months later and in anticipation of the same issue, I called my mortgage co and instructed them not to pay Denise Wardwell and that she tried to receive payment previously when I had told her I had a new agent.  Again, she CALLED my mortgage company and demanded payment.  I did not know this until I recived my new policy with her name on it.I called my mortgage company again.  While I was on the phone with my mortgage company, they called her to confront her and instruct her to refund my money.  She did not answer.  I will be reporting her behavior to the insurance commission.  She will not go away and I formally composed a letter to her when I met my new agent.  My new agent sent her a letter as well.This is unethical behavior and she has forced me to have her as my agent by renewing my policy in spite of my informing her that I changed agents.  SMSandraDickinson, TexasU.S.A.

I was on several national conference calls with the founders of the company.  The mortgage crisis hit and I went looking for additional income sources to help support my business since I was supposed to be ""independent"".  Mike Lewantowicz decided to have me terminated without ANY official notice from him or National Agents Alliance because I contracted to sell health insurance to support the downturn in leads.We had the fastest growing team in the Alex Abuyuan Master Agency.  I discussed the fact of me leaving a 15 year career to pursue this business with Alex and Mike.  They both stated how they were behind me.  I was never given official notice of my termination except from the carriers.  NAA corporate never responded to any of my requests for status.I have spent $3500 in attorney fees to date.  We are looking for other Agency Managers who had this same situation happen to them who are willing to share their experience for a class action lawsuit.

I have lost significant income and it's time we made a statement to shut down their illegal activities.I sincerely say this to anyone considering NAA as a long-term business opportunity, run.  You are playing with the lowest snakes in the insurance industry.  You are not independent.  You are not given fresh leads.  You will pay more than you earn especially if you decide to build an agency.  If you decide to pursue National Agents Alliance after reading this from a prior respected Agency Manager, don't say you were never warned.  I'm hoping this saves someone else from experiencing the same severe hardship as I have.P.S. Philip Hudgins claims this to be a Christian company  This is a RED FLAG...

In meantime also a foreigner  Mr . Robert Zotescue while  passing by he called to my help.While in agony I  give my DAn insurance detail to Mr.Rober, and he called Dan insurance to forward them my problem.In meantime an ambulance  was called and arrived within half  hour . I was rushed to the  Hospital.Before departing I was assured by Robert that DAN insurance would call me within a few hours. I would like to state that most people at the time  were also very scared for the  swine flu  and  a few also in panic.In the local hospital in Bangkok, (  this  was not  a private  hospital ) I was  soon after placed to all kind of  blood test and put on drips with medicine and  heavy painkillers.A few hours  passed by, 7, 8, and I was still waiting to hear from my insurance  company.

I just  managed to pay  the bill  and left the hospital still in pain and unable to walk.Now  Dan is cancelling my claim as they state that i was not  2 days in The  hospital, and their policy only state  that I need to be  hospitalised  2 day before  i get assistance from them.I also bring at the attention that the same thing happened  4 month ago, then again dan failed to contact the hospital and speak with the   doctors.In meantime they  do charge me   every  year for  medical  assistance, for  which i can never  use any kind of benefit.i do think that D A N should rephrase  them self a Deaths  Are  Nothing. Their  negligence is deliberate and they do   misleading the public.I thank God that i survived this horrendous ordeal. I just wander what would  happened if my case was going much worsen  and without  any support from the medical insurance  company. For  what they care I could be well dead for them. But I am alive and I am here to take legal action at the mean to  expose this to the other fellow  members that are using the same  insurance.I am now still in a recovery stage that if well take me  a list a week , with no any king of  medicasl support.I wander  who need a DAN  or DAM insurance.FaustoPooleUnited Kingdom									",  Insurance Agencies

He asked us to sign blank forms, assuring us he had the information he needed and it would save time if he filled them out later.

This was about what I would have paid for premiums on this policy for a year, and in no way helped with the eighty some thousand dollar surgery.We informed the Dept. of Insurance and they contacted theinsurance company on our behalf, but the papers we had signed were our exceptance of the policy.

He basically told us what we wanted to hear, and hoped we would never use it to find out. There has to be some law against misrepresentation of aproduct or service.

There are several issues, or problem areas, with this case that just make any high dollar settlement not feasible.The full amount of my initial evaluation is $2050, any additional consideration is minimal at best.  No future care will be considered as we have causation concerns pertaining to your injuries and medical treatment as it is.  The loss of earnings you submitted is so far removed from the date of loss that I cannot consider that as part of the settlement either.Originally I considered only the treatment you received in San Diego as reasonable.  In an effort to resolve this case I can give you the month of February for your medical treatment as well.  However, I cannot give you the charges billed by Associated Chiropractic.   Their bills are incredibly excessive.  The supplies are included in the procedure charge and this facility billed $50 per treatment for supplies, they charged $108 for a procedure whose code indicates it's a 15 minute procedure.  They also billed another $48 for manipulation.  A standard chiropractic visit with several modalities generally runs around $90 per session, maybe $100, but definitely not $206-$223 per tx.You had 5 tx in February.  I will consider those 5 treatments at $100 per visit.  The offer for full and final settlement is now $2500. You must realize I have to look at the severity of the impact, the nature of the treatment, the consistency of the treatment, whether or not the charges are reasonable, how your age and physical condition would affect your injury, medical documentation to support the healing process for aninjury of this nature.  Nothing in this claim or surrounding your diagnosed injury supports the medical treatment you received.  This is the best I can do.Sincerely,Tracy Kaner-HizonOn Behalf of Progressive Choice Insurance Company(619) 692-2880GailSeattle, WashingtonU.S.A.									",  Insurance Agencies

Giving them access to carriers, especially preferred commercial carriers. But thats where the similarity stops. First, there is NO franchise fee with PIA or the Big I.Unlike the PIA and the big I, Brooke charges for everything they can. Legitimate Insurance Associations do not steal from their agents. It does sadden me to see what Brooke has done to the tradition of PIA and Big I, which both have been around since the 1930's. They worked very hard over the last several decades to change legislation, to change insurance rules and laws, to make sure that honest agents get a fair shake in their industry. And that the consumer, has an agent they can trust. Ethics, strong Ethics.Then along comes Brooke. ""OMG, we could charge a fortune for all this stuff"" !?!?!And thats where they are today. Instead of assisting new agents and established agencies move ahead, they themselves dont know what they are doing, and in effect, are killing the ""agent spirit"", all in the name of their mighty dollar.The agency is left an empty shell of its former book.I know a family of agents that sold their family business of insurance agencies to Brooke. This agency was established in the 1950's. A strong book and 6 locations statewide. In the short time Brooke has had control, half of the agency locations are not cash flowing anymore. How the hell can you destroy a book of business that fast !!!I have spoke with reps from PIA and the Big I as well as some companies that provide AMS and raters & carrier reps. Brooke has such a ""stigma"" in the insurance world. People giggle when they hear you are with Brooke.(people in the industry that is)As far as the consumer is concerned, who is Brooke ????Heck even I have been called ""Brooke"" by my clients !!They (Brooke) dont advertise on a National Level, like other Insurance entities do, AIG, Progressive, Nationwide, so who would know Brooke ?Its a useless name, it gives you no credibility,and it actually involkes a giggle or two.The writing is on the wall. Save your dreams, your agency and your reputation. If you are not with Brooke, dont consider it. If you are, start doing some damage control before its too late.If you invest, do it wisely, Enron came without a warning.Class action suits have been filed in CA,TX,KS & LA.They have moved so fast and grown so quickly, using unethical tactics, its going to come to a crashing halt sometime in the near future.

Basically a $5000.00 deductible  and up to 10k they pay 80% after that it is 100% of the charges. Now I bought this back in 1986, in 1993 I had a brain tumor and the company I was working for paid for the operation. Then I thought really, PFL, Mega is my primary Insurance company. Their first coverage. I called the company and told them this and they were over joyed, as it was a self insured company and the employees provided the pool of money. There was no problem, PFL picked up the cost, as they are my primary insurance company. The cost was $397,000.00 for the operation, MEGA PFL paid everything, that was covered. To say the least I was very happy with the company and though my rates are almost $700 per month for just my coverage, I recommended them to everyone.Now they have decided that they are no longer my Primary Insurance Carrier, that my wife's coverage from her job is primary, medicare comes second as I am on SSD and Mega PFL is third.How can they do this, they have been my primary insurance since 1986, my wife has had many jobs, no guarantee this will last.This was all done with out my knowledge except the billing person at my Primary Doctor mentioned this when she was trying to refund money to Mega PFL.  This has to be the biggest rip off and I am sure highly illegal. They are doing it because all my wife's company had to do is deny the claim and it goes to Medi Care and then PFL. I am not 65, no where near that. So all PFL would have to pay, is what Medi Care did not pay, at the Medi Cares rate of about 37% of a Doctors normal charge. What a scam and a terrible thing to do for those who need Medi Care.I intend to contact Medi Care Fraud Department as this was all done behind my back and I am not even required to keep the Medi Care, it's just an option and Medi Care has never paid a dime. With 2 other insurance companies ahead of them. I think this is collusion between the two companies to with hold payments on care and medications that I need, turn it over to Medi Care and MEGA PFL only pays what little Medi Care does not play.I must say I am surprised, not all that much, but still surprised, as MEGA PFL has paid for the things they were responsible for till now. As I read through their list of problems, I remember back to the interview with the agent.  She was brand new and I had to reminder her there were a couple of questions she could not ask. I figured if I was getting pushed around, so must others be experiencing what I am  today.  I am shocked, but pleasantly at the agents that have come forward to say how this company does business now and reveal how it acts and operates behind the scenes. This takes courage, that is so lacking in most people today. Their saying that they were duped and told false promises and not kept up date on their policies by the company they were selling for. This takes courage to admit you made a mistake in life and come forth to warn others. That is inner strength.I only wish I had kept track of the company, with the rate increases I would think they were happy, but it is clear their has been collusion among the 2 insurance companies and I will be the loser. If any one knows about this happening or if they can do it with out notification, I would appreciate it. Also how to get to the people who make the decisions, I do not want to spend days going through the phone tree. This will really hurt me, I just don't see how they can assign positions, when I have been with them for 21 years and they have always been my first insured. Then swap with another company and assign a government benefit  Medi Care at the second position. Who gives them that right.  Now they say where the Government will pay     Any help or ideas most kindly requested and accepted. They sure have changed since 86.GeoffreyBig Lake, AlaskaU.S.A.									",  Insurance Agencies

I went to the office and met with Jennifer (an agent there). She was friendly and got me all signed up for a policy that was appropriate for my needs. That was the LAST time I recieved good customer service. I had a few problems with billing (getting double charged) and immediately emailed my agent. My emails were wither ignored completely or she responded up to 2 weeks later. After the first problem took several months to resolve, I decided to stop using email and call the office directly for any further issues. Nothing but lost messages, unreturned messages, and incompetence resulted from my calls. Eventually I resorted to calling the general 1-800 number for all of Liberty Mutual, so I could talk with someone OTHER than my agent and/or the people in her office.The last straw came recently when I cancelled my policy. I was told that although I cancelled my policy in April, I still owed a balance on my account in May. I assumed that my payments were covering the following month, not the previous month. What company gives you coverage in advance of your payment? Regardless, when I got the bill I immediately called the Chandler office to ask for an explanation. They had made billing mistakes previously, so who's to say this wasn't another one? The receptionist said she'd take down a message and someone would call me back with an answer. A week passed and I never recieved a call back. I called again, and left another message with the receptionist. Again, no call back. I called a total of 4 times. After 2 months, since nobody was calling me back, and I hadn't recieved further bills, I assumed that they had investigated it and found that they made a mistake.WRONG! I got a letter from a collections agency today for the charge. I called the Chandler Office and explained the whole thing. the multiple ignored messages, etc. She explained why I still owed money in May, even though the policy was cancelled in April, and told me there was no record of my many phone calls and messages, and promises of a returned phone call with explanation. This was frustrating. Why wasn't I told this the very first time I called? Why didn't anyone have 2 minutes to call me and give me the brief explanation?If you want to be largely ignored, overbilled, and your time wasted repeatedly, then Liberty Mutual in Chandler is the way to go.AnnieChandler, ArizonaU.S.A.

I called the number provided in which i was to call before July 2nd to get my winnings.I called numberous of times and only got an answering machine in which i left my information. I cashed the check the next day and everything went through fine. Since then i had tried to get in contact with the company in regards to the rest of the winnings but only got that same answering machine and no call back. I am a single mother of 3 and any finacial help that comes my way is usually looked at as afinacial blessing. I actually thought i had recieved tht finacial blessing that i've been praying for until i started to research the company on the internet in hopes to get in contact with them that way. I found that this company is a fraud.Everything was a scam.

The primary concern is the companys direct and distinct captivity of non-employees.  Traditionally a captive agent would be afforded the courtesy of small base salary full benefits from day one and expenses for the purpose of marketing an organizations products.  None of those standards are true here.  The agent is on the hook for all the expenses including the lion's share of the preset appointment cost.In this case the interviews are cattle calls and the training process in extremely entry level suggesting a desire to induce inexperienced or newly licensed agents.  This is were things get very sticky.  Once signed on your bound and will never ever be aloud a release for those products.  Meaning that if you do not meet any one of a very long list of qualifiersQuotas you may be summarily dismissed or directed to re-earn the right to participate in the standard preset appointment marketing plan.  While quotas are always great for building a polished professional sales team they should never be used or aligned for the purpose of profiting from false failures.Normally when measuring turnover in a corporation the primary goal is retention of the employee. Given that the national average for employee turn over is somewhere in the 22-31 percent range this company's 90-94 percent turn over rate is appalling. This smacks of CHURN and BURN methodologies.Please be very aware that if you choose a career path with this company that you are willing to risk the loss of years of renewal income to the whims of its management.   Clint Valdosta, GeorgiaU.S.A.

You chose what a professional recommend due to his/her knowledge. If the associate students recommend a health insurance group, you tend to believe is the best option. Unfortunately this is not the case, I was enrolling in a health insurance plan back in February with Wells Fargo administered by Blue Cross. The membership card was said to arrive in 3 weeks, which never did. Days later, I called to see what happen and for the first time I was told of a member ID #. Since I had a number, I try to use the benefits of the card by purchasing some prescription medication. I was not able, since I did not have a group number neither the address where the pharmacy supposes to bill my insurance. Four months later, I received the card. I went back to the pharmacy, to received my prescribe medicine. The pharmacist had trouble with card, so she called Blue Cross. Once she spoke to a customer specialist, she was told I was not in the system. She gave them my social security number and my group and medical id numbers. That's when I reached my max point and I called to request a refund. I spoke to a customer service rep called Alma and she said ""I am not able to issue a refund, since the system shows there is claims outstanding."" When I was not able to use my benefits of the insurance to begin with in the past. It looks that their computer system showed me active, after the pharmacist called.Then, Alma mentioned that I was going to get a called from the manager specialist ""Jolie"". Jolie called me and we discuss the issues. She will just keep apologizing for not receiving the insurance card and that there was nothing for her to do. After mentioning the pharmacy issue. She said that I needed to pay on my own and then get reimburse by an insurance claim. When in the claim forms says that the prefer procedure is for all providers of health care to bill them for service, since they will provide more details than are ordinarily provided on bills to patients.Overall, I was told that I would not have a refund or an extension for the insurance.Mr. valenciaFULLERTON, CaliforniaU.S.A.

Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.

They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.

","", 682-223-0117,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

I kept working..By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.STAY AWAY FROM ED ORELL!Naa agency managerSouth, FloridaU.S.A.									",  Insurance Agencies

They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.

","", 682-223-0117,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.

","", 682-223-0117,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.

","", 682-223-0117,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.

They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

I kept working..By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.

They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.

They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.

They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

I kept working..By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.

They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco.

They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

I kept working..By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.

They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.

They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

I kept working..By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.

They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

The Allinsuranceneedz rep was to contact me and provide a password to the secure web site where I was to obtain the leads. It is now 25 days after payment of $3,600.00 was made and no contact from the rep. I have called and e mailed everyday with no response from ALLInsuranceneedz. The rep was very persistent for me to contract with Allinsuranceneedz and called me every week but as soon as I sign the contract and the $3,600.00 was paid, no contact from any rep. at Allisnuranceneedz. If this company contact any insurance agent, slam the phone in their ear !!!!!!Thomas sellersBrush Valley, PennsylvaniaU.S.A.									",  Insurance Agencies

","", 561-351-9495,NAA And Ed Orell Do NOT Get involved with Ed Orell and NAA Lake Worth Florida,"										Ed Orell will build your trust in him and then do everything to better his position and abuse your faith in all of mankind.  He will steal your down line agents and take your commissions.I started with NAA in Apr '07 and very rapidly moved up the ranks being a top personal producer and was Promoted to Agency Manager in Nov '07.  According to Old Mutual I personally placed more than 400 life policies over the course of my first year.I made $85,000 in 2007 but spent nearly $120,000 on leads and travel expenses to run those leads.  When I brought this up to Ed he just said ""that it was a new business and you are supposed to lose money in the first year"".  I kept working..By  July of this year I had made right at $85,000 but again I had spent more than I made trying to run very expensive leads that were more than 1200 miles from my home.  Finally, in July, I had to throw in the towel.  My credit cards were maxed and I could no longer afford the trips that seemed to create great revenue but no net profits.I still had a few agents working for me that seemed to be doing ok as they weren't having to travel to run the leads.  But over time they started dropping off and by September I only had one guy left.  During the National Convention Ed took my last guy from me.  Re coded all of his business to him and then canceled my contracts with all of the carriers and to ad insult to injury froze my commissions.Ed will use you and abuse you, the whole while leading you to believe that you need to do all these crazy thing to be successful.  All these things make money for end but will put you and your family in the poor house.STAY AWAY FROM ED ORELL!Naa agency managerSouth, FloridaU.S.A.									",  Insurance Agencies

 Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott ,"  Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott  P.O. Box 93988 Southlake, Texas U.S.A. ","", 682-223-0117,Pasco Claims Service - Craig Scott Overworked Without Pay Southlake Texas,"										I was offered work by Pasco Claims Service, and accepted. They ""forgot"" to download claims to me in MSB for the first 5-days, which left me 35 claims behind right out of the starting gate.  What I didn't know was that they're using long-term, unlicensed adjusters, say you'll receive pay 10-days after a claim is submitted, then don't pay for at the very least, 2-months. If you ask too many questions about receiving pay for the claims you've worked the HR/Payroll person either ignores you, or sends a response at 5:00pm on a Friday (she doesn't work weekends). They left me stranded literally, in the middle of no where, and when I requested either an advance, or a paycheck, in order to finish scoping claims they'd assigned to me, not to mention pay bills at home, I was told that I was no longer working for them per Craig Scott, and that I had less than 2 days to submit what I had. They then had MSB shut down so that I couldn't work on claims. I had to remind them that this was coming out of my first paycheck that I hadn't received, and it was reinstated. I've submitted ALOT of claims, and they're looking at, maybe one, two at the very most, per day, and that's only if one of their clients calls and asks for a status (after they've called me and ripped me a few new ones thinking their claim hasn't been submitted).I've already talked to one attorney. I'm probably going to give him another call as the email response I received at 5:01pm (Texas time) stated that I will not see a paycheck for at LEAST 2-3 more weeks.I've never heard of adjusting practices like this regarding other independent adjusting agencies. I'm disgusted, and trying to quickly find work so that I can catch up, I hope, on the last 2-months of bills that I have accumulated.If you're an independent adjuster, use good judgement before working for Pasco. If you're having the same issues, my next steps will be to file complaints with the Texas Labor Board, Texas Dept of Insurance as well as any Federal agency that has to do with fraudulent insurance practices.After all of this, I'll let my attorney handle them.Overworked not paidAltamonte Springs, FloridaU.S.A.

","", 775-786-3577,United American Insurance Rip off of employees and money from clients Reno Nevada,"										United American Insurance is a scam they have people sell insurance that is not what it seems. It pays less than benifits than the brochures say. They down grade the whole life policies and say house hold has max premium can have but still keep all premium that agent sells on.  I had $800 dollars in premium for policies they kept all and said my family could only handle $150 a month then cancelled all policies because of a returned check and charged the agent for that cacellation. When asked for premium return they said is agents responsiblity. THen they took out another monthly premium for $54 on a cancelled life policy. When asked for number to file complaint and get premiums back i was told to go to websight and file complaint or call home offices. United American issued policies not the Agent and United American cashed the checks not the Agent. So united american owes permiums back not the Agent who was suckered into working for them with promise of leads and reliable and strong company that could write up to a $2000000 dollar life policy but all the polices he did got down graded to like $25 a month. I have filed a complaint with the DOI in Nevada and am looking for other who have had same problem to file a class action lawsuit against United American and Torchmark INC. They have other companies Glob Life, AIL, LIberty National,UA and severa other Names they go by.AmberReno, NevadaU.S.A.									",  Insurance Agencies
