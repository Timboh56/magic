										 life is not hard enough getting work without YP posting people up on line without business license and also people for 50 miles.  I called the city of Stockton on a new company that they feature called  Bumping Rita and she has no license for Stockton. There she is at the top of Google ad for YP. Picture and all. Then I saw that tons of people are up here from other citys.   According to their by laws they say the people must follow the laws, local , state jurisdiction. Well they are not. Most or 3/4 do not have a license to work in other citys. Some have no license at all. So you promoting SAC. people that are 50 miles away brakes the city laws. You need to promote only local people on your  internet site unless they have proved that they are licensed to work otherwise.  Stockton should have only stockton people, Sac only SAC . Manteca only manteca, etc.  You are braking your own by laws,by not following local laws. Also the city laws.  Google also does not follow the city laws posting people up to 500 miles. It is time for the citys to take back there own revenue, and stop the braking of laws. This is my personal opinion.

										$9.00 charge appeared on my credit card that looked like this: ""WLI RESERVATIONREWARDS - 800-732-7031 CT $9.00""
When I called my credit card company, they said ""for that particular vendor,"" I would need to resolve any dispute with the company first. They also told me to get a cancellation number. It seemed as if they were very familiar with this situation and had advised many people before. 
To their credit, my hold time was less than a minute and the customer service rep was courteous. But I had to fight down the line to get what I wanted. 
For example, when I told her that I wanted a refund, she first tried to direct me to their web site so I could see all their wonderful member benefits and make sure I really wanted to cancel. I said I still wanted to cancel. She said she would cancel and there would be no further billings. I said I wanted a full refund. She said she would refund the past four months. No, I said, I wanted all of the charges refunded because I never signed up for this service and have never used it. She finally agreed to refund the full amount. 
I'm going to watch my credit card billing like a hawk and will be back on the phone with them if the full amount isn't refunded in 30 days. 
When I asked how I might have been signed up for this, she asked me if I had ever bought movie tickets on line. I said I had twice about a year ago. She said that I must have bought tickets through www.movietickets.com in order to sign up for their service. 
I have to say I am VERY careful when making on-line purchases. I read EVERYTHING. I buy things online all the time and have never had anything like this happen.

a charge appeared on my debit account on the 7th for $59.95.
from a company called eidelweiss card pt Donvale NE and Online Supplier.com.
I called my bank to have it removed, they could not until it had been posted for 3 days. When that time was over my bank screwed up & allowed these scumbags to re-post the same amount for another 3 business days. 
So, now I get to close my checking account change banks because they ""can't do anything while its in pending status"" so skip them too. 
this company has many addresses to hide that they are defrauding people from their money. 60 bucks doesn't sound like alot but online if they get 5000 people to do that which is relatively easy it can add up pretty dam fast.
so watch whats free online because these scumbags are able to steal money from your account.

										A Melody Watson called an employee of mine, that was new and was in training, and lied regarding a listing with Monarch Media 411. Melody informed her this was a renewal for the company, that was originally ordered by myself. She also informed her if we didn't want the service to write ""cancel"" on the invoice and mail it back. Which My employee did. Our company records all calls to avoid scams like this. 
There were 2 calls placed that day, one from Melody Watson, who lied about this being a renewal, who lied about me doing this in the past, and lied about it being cancelled. The second call was from someone named ""Lorne"" in quality control, My employee asked again if this was a renewal, and if it could be cancelled. She wrote cancel on the invoice and mailed it back. 
Then she received a call from Amy Micheal's, who informed her there are no cancellation policies, and told her it can't be cancelled. I called back that day after hearing our recorded calls from the sales call. They only had the second call, but the parts where she asked about cancelling and if it was a renewal were missing from the call. This company not only lies to get you to accept, but cuts their recorded calls. 
I called Mrs. Micheal's and informed her we had the original calls and were reporting she to the California Attorney General and the Better Business Bureau, she cancelled the order immediately. Don't be scamed by this company, they are the worst scam we have encountered.

										About two years ago my husband and I went to a cyberwize meeting. Everyone was very , very friendly and the house was beautiful equipped with dynamite furniture and two brand new cars in the garage. Long story short we signed up. What harm would it cause even if we don't make any money its worth a try right, not!
Now two years later my husband has lost his job which led to huge financial problems, uncluding losing our car. Also my husband had to file bankruptcy and when he received his 401k guess where most of the money went... you guessed to cyberwize. The estimated amount was 10,000. As of yet he has only made about 1,500 dollars from this company and although we are broke he still autoship every month giving them 145.00 a month. Now this angers me because everything is always about to get turned off and he is so brainwashed that he continues to throw money away! 
Here is the crushing point. My marriage is on the verge of a breakup. My last straw was basically my fault, but I trusted him. When his credit went south my credit was still good. Well I foolishly gave him my credit card which I had paid down. He promised me that he would not let it go over the limit. Unforunately it did go over the limit and I didn't find out about it until it was too late. Now the interest rates on all of my credit cards have gone up to 27% I will never pay these cards off and my credit is ruined as well as my marriage. This company has ruined my life and my husband doesn't see it because keep boosting his ego by giving him cheesy awards and patting him on the back. 
I truly need help because this company has done their homework and they seem to have covered all basis. So please honestly tell me if there is anything that can be done. I know I will never see that money again and I will have to work hard to pay this debt, but I just truly want my husband back.

										According to the website, you should get a payout option after you've exceeded the minimum amount limit (ie. 25$). But after you make it up to 25$ or more, it only results in a ""never ending"" Survey and thus, is a SCAM.
There are two more interestingly stupid things about iearn123:
The first unusual thing about iearn123 is that in most Traffic Referral Sites, the Sites have special security check to prevent abuse of the links ie. They check if you're clicking your links yourself (via IP Address). Most of Paid To Click Sites (like NeoBux) & Pay Per Download sites (like Sharecash) ban the User Account if they find that the Link Owners themselves are clicking their own link/s. Cautious that iearn123 might ban us, we used TOR Browser to hide IP Addressonly to find out later that just clearing the Internet History & Cookies was enough to get more clicks(referral visits) enabled. This is too unusual characteristic to be present in a legit Traffic Referring Site, sites like ADF.LY too won't increase your balance if you start clicking your own link because if the users are allowed to do so, the sites will be Bankrupt.The Second unusual thing about iearn123 is that the Link that you're given to refer to (ie. ""share your links with your friends"" - according to iearn123) only leads those who click your referral link to iearn123 signup page (instead of the page with Ads which increases some Website's Traffic). This is very unusual and is a ""POINT"" enough to alarm anyone who has experience with sites like NeoBux that the site in question is a scam.									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										Adbrite is involved in activities such as click fraud, zero by zero pixel fraud ad delivery, organized crime among site owners, mail fraud and credit card fraud.  Our company has recently opened a couple of accounts to track this firm for a client who needed a independent review based on our network tracking software and what we found was quite abnormal.
We are taking our findings to the high court in California and to the FBI.  This company is nothing more than a front with most (85%) of its listed sites being ""shell"" sites that are popped on servers nets.  There is little indication that any ads are being delivered to real ""eyeballs"" and the company is in fact working in concert with known internet fraud gangs.  
It is also plausible that Adbrite falls under RICO with the level of these activities reaching many states and customers across the globe.   It is the intention of this firm to bring a class action suit at a minimum and to arrange for this information to be given to authorities to garner an opinion on criminal charges as well.
We spoke with a ex-Adbrite employee who admitted that most of the companies traffic was not human in origin.  Bots, Java scripts rotators and other pervasive tactics where and are being used to defraud individuals and companies of 10's of millions of dollars.  He also stated that the senior executives of the firm are in full knowledge of this and that the company for many months had no personnel in charge of Terms and Conditions regarding site owners.  It was stated that in 2008 one person was hired for this to police the 10's of thousands of sites that are in the network.  
Adbrite misrepresents itself plainly on site entrance displaying the sites and numbers available to advertisers.  It is plain to see that this company is a front for crime and this company has no intention of delivering quality ads whatsoever.
We expect to file this class action suit in August - Septmeber 2009.
Please check back to this post, as we will give information on how to join the suit in the near future.

										Adnet Marketing Solutions sold me an online marketing business in October of 2006.  I was promised as much help I needed with its development.  Each time I called for help, I was told someone would get back to me.  Someone did, only not to help, but to attempt to sell me more services.  I told them each time I spoke with them that I was not willing to invest more money until the business created some cash flow.
After months of advertising via electronic newsletters (for which I paid monthly), advertising sites, etc., I made the decision to discontinue the business, as the return on my investment was not looking at all promising.
After six months of work on the internet in an attempt to get the business off the ground, without the promised assistance of Adnet, I decided to discontinue the business.  As such, I mailed a certified letter to Adnet Marketing Solutions within the 30 day deadline, requesting a refund and providing the reasons for such.  I was not contacted, so I made a call to the company.  I was told that in order to receive a refund, I would have to send evidence of my advertising efforts, which I did.
I did not hear from anyone, so once again, I followed up with a phone call and spoke with Mitch, who called himself the ""General Manager"".  He stated that he was working on other ""cases"", took all my information, and promised he would get back to me the following week.  To date, I have not heard from him, and each time I've called, the message has been that he's not available.
This company is robbing individuals.  While others have spent a great deal more than I, it's the principle of the matter that is of concern.  No one should have to endure this kind of dishonesty and criminal action.

										After being approached by a Super media representative several times, I have decided to give it a chance on media marketing to help grow our business.  Supermedias aggressive, elegant, and outspoken sales representative, Anthony Haddad promised lots of business and great results through their well experienced management team. Unfortunately I have spent more than 17K and all I received in return is a few mediocre internet clicks that resulted in absolutely no business. I have exhausted my efforts in providing Super Media tools to help make their job easier and more effective. I worked with Brett Forester, campaign manager for several months evaluating and reevaluating our campaign. I provided him with many tools about the counties and cities that can result in a better outcome. In addition to completing web optimization and an issued press release about my company and how we can save clients money in this security. I finally discovered that their knowledge about my industry was very poor and they were not able to help me with any effective internet campaign. Campaign manager, Brett Forester has admitted to me that he has never managed a campaign in our line of work and or business. Are you kidding me??? I believe that I should have been addressed with these facts before hand so that I can make an informed decision on whether or not to move forward with this campaign. I was completely misled about the results and the outcome. And now there is a lump sum of money spent without any business obtained.  I was clearly promised effective Internet marketing and advertising strategies but received none. And now Super Media is trying to collect on 3 months of service after I cancelled the account.  
 
To add more insult to injury, On April 4, 2011 one of my clients has alerted me when he Google my company name, a competitor company, shows up. This means that Supermedia, campaign manager has listed my companys name as a key word for a compatotior company. My company's name is a registered trad mark. I was out raged to learn about this incident particularly because I learned that the competitor company happens to be one of your clients. As I still investigate the matter I have no idea how long has Supermedia been stealing traffic from my company.  And why on earth would your campaign manager add my companys name as a key word for a competitor company? 
 
I contacted a Supemeida to allow them the opportunity to investigate and rectify these serious issues. I sent a brief email to Cliff Wilson VP, Assistant Treasurer and Investor Relations executive and he promised to for award the complaint for proper handling. I was contacted by executive client, Chuck Agee who took two and half weeks to investigate the matter. On May 13, 2011, Chuck called me and said he was unable to verify that I was a client. I asked him if that was a joke and he said no sir I couldnt find anything on you or your company.

										After being approached by phone for a special into offer of 29.00 - to set up a website, I should have known better than to give my credit card info to this company, but did and could not cancel - or get a refund after they charged 158.00 on a Saturday (the day of my anniversary/deadline to cancel).  Asked numerous times for a manager and got nowhere.  They claim that I received an email for confirmation of this no contract agreement and would not fray from their repeated stand of a 3 day before anniversary to cancel argument.  Total ripoff!  Website was embarrassing and very unfriendly.  I could not get my money back and had my credit card company call the same day as the charge was put through.  I will dispute it, but unlikely that I will get the credit because of their sneaky ""email"" confirmation - which is nothing like the verbal hard sales pitch.

										After being contacted by phone by a salesperson  of BankCard Empire ,I had a long telephone conversation with with a junior sales person regarding  becoming an affiliate to promote bank card proccessing equipment for Bankcard Empire on Dec 16 2008 . Being that it was close to the Christmas Holiday season I told the sales person that I could not afford to spend close to $800.00 before Christmas.The junior sales person  then transfered me to a senior account representative who said that he was authorized to pass on a ""one time offer "" of $195.00 ,if I signed up as an affiliate to represent their ""products as he described their services"" , on that evening . I kept telling him that I had to do my ""due deligence "" and research their  company's track record on the Internet. His next argument was that representing the major credit card companies, all their activities were beyond reproach because if there ever was a ""charge back "" this would result in a negative report in regards to BankCard Empire . After outlining the renumeration plan of a successful 
marketer  and after numerous demands to signed up now as this was ""a one time offer"" I was Bullied into giving him my Visa number . Again he mentioned the fact that being a company that proccesses credit card transaction my Visa card info was safe with them .   After being welcomed as an affiliate of such a highly regarded card proccessing  company I was told that my welcome package and information in regards to the Website I was suppose to promote would be mailed to me before Christmas . He wished me a happy holiday and gave me a name of one of their ""mentor"" who would be calling me within the next few days .The ""mentor"" called me within a couple of days and again the same rethoric started , saying that what I had joined was a ""business "" and as a businessman I was responsible to advertise their product . He then proceeded to outline how they collected their ""leads"" and that those were available to me at $3.00 each . I told him that I would not do anything till I got my Info package , he acted surprised and said that he would personally ensure that it would be forwarded to me by overnight expedited mail . This time I did not  back down to his demands of $9000 for an advertising blast to be done within the next week . I replied that nothing was going to be done on my part till I got the Website package info and my welcome package . Again he tried to get money from me by saying that he realised that $3.00 was a little steep but that he personnally had another source of leads that would cost only $1.00 each if I could give him permission to bill my Visa again for $3000.00  to start my ""business "" now . I did not authorise any more charges and decided to wait for my info package and affiliate  website  .This phone conversation transpired around the 20th of December 2008.To make a long story short, it is now Friday January 30, 2009 and I have not received my welcome package and affiliate website yet , even after contacting their customer support department numerous times. 
My next step was to contact my Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Visa card supplier and explain to them what had transpired . The Visa card representative then informed me that this was not the first time someone had complained about BankCard Empire and that the charges would be reversed and the funds would be back in my credit card account within 48 hours .I know that most transactions on the internet are ""buyer beware"" however if anyone is scammed like I was, their remedy should be to contact the credit card Companies as soon as you nrealise that you might have been scammed . Most of the credit card companies have a policy in place that favours their card holders over companies that try to scam you !!!Frank

										After completing what appeared to be legitimate training for real work I signed on with Becker & Associates. I was assigned to Lori French who lives in Ohio. Lori told me that she was my manager and she would train and assist me. She told me that if I wanted to I could be working in just a few days and Lori did contact me regarding work. 
Lori sent me a contract from Equasystems in Texas. I was to perform computer/telephone marketing for this company. I had a contract stating that I would be paid $12.00 an hour for all work completed and emailed to Lori. Lori told me to plan on spending $1.00 an hour for long distance telephone calls. Once I began to do the work I was then told that the time I spent on the phone with Lori, which was sometimes hours, was not paid time. Additionally I was paying the long distanced charges to call Lori to get answers, training, support and to troubleshoot program problems. After performing about 11 hours of work I was offerred something else much more lucrative and I did not have to spend hours on the phone for unpaid work. 
I called and told Lori and she basically said it was okay and they would send my check. After not receiving the money I was owed and receiving a long distance telephone bill of more than $125.00 I started writing and emailing Becker & Associates, Lori French and Wes from Equasystems.
 Finally Lori called and said I was not going to get paid as I had to complete the contract in full to be paid. As an independent contractor I should be paid for the hours I worked and as a contractor I can stop working anytime I want. Of course the BBB's don't want anything to do with this. Becker & Associates looks legitimate but they did nothing for me when Wes at Equasystems would not pay me. 
Lori French lied about me getting paid and now avoids me. If anyone is thinking about working for this ocmpany make sure you understand that you have to complete the ENTIRE contract to get paid and check out how much your phone bill will be BEFORE you start.

										After filling in the information on the rebate receipt from CompUSA in July 2004, TCA denied payment for the rebate on a new monitor indicating an altered or incomplete receipt. Nonsense. An Email to CompUSA Customer Service, however, resulted in an immediate reply to TCA with a receipt verification and a 10/22/04 payment date.  We'll see.
At the time, I only had one rebate pending at TCA.  Today I find I have a second rebate, but the second posted record is dated August 2002 (for a NetGear router rebate submitted ages ago) and a denial indicating ""STALEDATED CHECK RETD TO CLIENT"". It was submitted within the timeframe with all necessary information (as was the CompUSA rebate) but was not posted at TCA until three years later. This is absurd.
I'm filing a complaint with the FTC as my next email.

										After placing the order, they state the refund guarantee is good only for those who try their program.  Just conveniently late information.  You need a website to work their program, and a product to sell.

										After reading many of your reports I can see that Likom has a company policy of avoiding payment of rebates.  Unfortunately, I couldn't read your report until I was lured by Fry's advertising to buy one of Likom's monitors.
Like many previous complainants, Likom stalled on the phone, promised to call back but did not, pretended to be doing ""research"", and finally denied receiving the forms.

										After responding to a very misleading advertisement on the radio, I ordered a computer (Way over priced by comparison with a comparable product and other retail companies) thru Guaranteed Consumer Funding in January. I was asked to provide copies of my pay stubs, a copy of my actual driver license, a cancelled copy of my personal checking account and current gas bill among other verifying documentation.  Aside from these requirements, I was also required to make an up-front payment of $99.00; I was also told that after 5 payments at $29.99 per week (that's $119.96 per month) the computer would be sent me. After the 5 payments, I called Guaranteed Consumer Funding to see when my new computer would be delivered.  
After a long, long wait on hold, I was told that my computer was being built specially for me (give me a break). I have made 25 weekly payments since and was told that my delivery date would be the week of June 9 through 17, and no computer.  The weeks of June 9 through 17 came and went and still no computer.  When I call to check the status of my delivery date I get nothing but a runaround and no computer. 
The wait time when I call the so called customer service is typically between 45 to 50 minutes.  I don't dare leave a message; since I am confident I will not be getting a call back.  
This company is a fraud and geared only in retrieving their payment, which they are very good at; nothing else.  They prey on consumers with weak or no credit.  
Don't even attempt logging into their shell website, all one will get is advertisement and non congenial information, together with no log in capability.  Unfortunately, their customer service staff is illiterate and in my experience, only women, and I'm sure underpaid and easy to teach to answer questions with lies such as Dell is having delivery problems and make promises they don't even know how to keep.  
I called this company so as to CANCEL my order all together, but as I suspected, I was on hold for 52+ minutes with various teases leading one to think that someone was answering, then the artificial voice recording and back to that cheesy hold music.  
Here is where it gets better for this company.  I finally spoke with a customer services representative.  I explained to her that I wanted to cancel my Loaded Payment Program, and that I wanted a full refund of what I have paid to this company thus far for something that I didn't receive.  
She graciously put me on hold, when she returned she told me that my payment plan had been cancelled and that they could NOT refund layaway plans.  I asked her to connect me with a manager and she could only take my number and said that someone would be calling me.
A layaway plan means that product is being held at the store until full payment is received.  This is not the case with this company. I was told that Dell was building my computer especially for me, and that it would be delivered on a specific time frame.  I took time from my work days to ensure a seamless delivery of the ghost computer.  The company failed in their agreement I am now out $700.00 and I WANT MY MONEY BACK IN FULL.

										After viewing Blue Hippo's advetisement on television I telephoned them to get information on how I could purchase a computer thourgh thier company.  I was told that if I made 7 payments in the amount of $71.98 by debits from my checking account I would recieve a computer.  I was not told that I would recieve a cheap basic model computer costing about $700.00 but I would have to pay Blue Hippo $1,764.11                                                             I recieved thier shipping verification form stating that all payments were non-refunable. I called the company and insisting that the debits from my account cease. I was told that the debits would stop but my account was still being debited by Blue Hippo it resulted in my account being over drawn. I had to close my checking account to stop Blue Hippo from repeatedly debiting my account. I wrote the company and demanded to have the 6 payments that were debited from my account refunded.   I was told flat out I would not be given a refund                                                    
The customer service personal stated that I aggreed to this when I ordered the computer. This was a false statement Blue Hippo did not inform me that any pre-payments made towards the purchase of the computer were non refundable when I placed a order for the computer I am out of $431.88 and I want my money back.  I am prepared to take the company to small claims court if I do not recieve a refund.

										Although it took about 4 months and several phone calls, I received my gift from Internet Opinion Group.  Using their email contact form isn't very effective, as email response is slow and sporadic.  Phone service is, however, effective.

										Amy Amsden make's the claim that she can help you build your revenue, but what she actually is doing is taking you along for a ride to help build HER revenue. 
She is the most Deceitful person Ive ever had the (mis) pleasure of doing business with. It started off going to one of her lunch seminars, where I met with her and a group of other enthusiastic ebayers such as myself who wanted to see what she had to teach us. What did we learn? We learned that we could pay for her to teach us what we paid for in the first place!
I was intrigued with her telling me how she made all of this money on ebay that I decided to stay after to get into contact with Amy. She told me for another payment, she could go over ebay one on one with me.Well, after paying her again (not smart do NOT give this lady a PENNY!), She told me she would get back to me. I kept calling trying to get back into contact with her to have her come back and tell me that I had only paid the initial fee, and needed to pay her the rest before she could help me. [continued below]....
									
										.....  I then began to investigate this lady, Amy Amsden whose ebay profile I found she promotes herself as this grand ebay seller, but what she is? Is a lady who couldn't GIVE away products. Her ebay methods are outdated, and are in books that I could find on the internet for free. She is a scam artist! She never called me back until I was ready to offer her money, and when I finally gave in she would never call me back. This lady is an internet pirate; she took me for a ride. I tried to then, give her the benefit of the doubt for a refund because her and I hadn't spoken but magically she ignored my phone calls. I had to call my credit card company and file a charge back dispute which, she had the audacity to file back on saying she had performed services for me. Preformed services? More like she performed robbery on an unsuspecting victim. I will post my story everywhere so my fellow ebayer's and those wanting to get into the field will not be swindled by this liar and look elsewhere for your ebaying needs! You are safer with trying it out yourself then letting this woman fifty feet near your log in page who could tell if she would try and steal that too.									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										An employee of ZipWeb.com called late December of 2007 offering a 30 day free trial for a no-risk web marketing campaign to help our business gain exposure on all premium web search engine sites which included Google and Yahoo. I agreed to the free trial but being skeptical I confirmed with her that if I was not satisfied with the services, I could cancel all services within the 30 day trial period by emailing her. After failing to live up to their claims, I cancelled services by sending the ZipWeb representative an email and didn't think much about it since they did not record a credit card number and the email didn't bounce back undelivered. To my dismay after an internal audit of our company, I have found out they have been erroneously charging my land-line account (AT&T) $74.95/mo. for 10 months ($749.50) through a third party company called ""The Billing Resource"" on behalf of USA Business Directory (ZipWeb, Inc. 800-586-3900). I have forwarded a copy of the email I sent asking them to cancel the free trial with specific date and time stamps and have also volunteered giving them copies of my phone statements reflecting the charges. I have also asked them to cease and desist all further activities and a complete refund in the sum of $749.50. I have filed a complaint with the FTC (Claim #20622467) and my next step is to proceed and file a small claims action against them. An operation like this should be put out of business and the owners should be jailed for wire and fraud charges since other people have been scammed across the nation.

Dear victims of Pantheon Holdings and other Florida scam artists
I have been watching these posts appear for several months now and one thing never ceases to amaze me. It's the consistency of the reports. These scam artists have found a formula for their activities that seems to immunize them for the interference of state and local law enforcement agencies in the state of Florida. How can this be? Through my own research I have concluded that S. Florida is the Mecca for frauds and scam artists. 
I have personally tried with little or no success to get anyone in a position of authority to listen to me. I have called every type of agency I could think of, be it law enforcement or consumer protection, and no one has ever tried to contact me or even respond to my emails, letters and phone calls.
Something in the state of Florida stinks! It starts at the top with Gov. Jeb Bush and drips down the maze of other feckless bureaucrats and incompetent law enforcement agencies. I have not found one person with the intestinal fortitude to investigate this company. That my friends, is the secret to their success.
I know many of you are saying to yourselves. How can the governor of a big state like Florida be expected to know everything that takes place within it? Simple. It's his job to know. With a single word or the stroke of his pen, he can have these lowlifes shut down forever. This begs the question: Then why doesn't he do it? Answer: Because there is nothing in it for him or his administration. Or maybe he doesn't want to step on the toes of some very reliable campaign contributors? 
Currently I am involved in a law suit against these quasi-humans. I would like to offer a challenge to anyone who cares to look. Investigate on your own what political contributions may have been made to the campaigns of local and state officials in Florida from the corporations and individuals named as key players in this theater of the absurd. Then post them on this thread.
There is one clear lesson that I take with me from this experience. In Florida, you don't need a gun to steal lots of money and get away with it; just a briefcase.

According to Jack Love, president of Internet Retailer's parent company Vertical Web Media, the firm gives its conference attendee list to no one.
The list being marketed is not a legitimate list of [conference] attendees. We do not sell, rent or reveal that list to anyone, said Love. It's our most valuable asset.

On April 30, 2004 I attended a seminar presentation for StoresOnline, Inc. in Medford, Oregon.  During this full-day seminar I had the opportunity to discuss my online application with numerous individuals in your employment.  I was impressed by your methods and operation; your presentation sold me on your ability to meet my online solution.  I discussed my application specifically with Mr. Bob Schnuk (Mr. Schnuk was one of your speakers); he suggested I discuss it further in depth with StoresOnline employees present at this seminar.  
I was concerned as to whether or not StoresOnline could actually provide an online solution for my specific application.
I met with Ms. Laura Olsen; I discussed my online application with her in detail.  I showed her my application online at www.AutoPartMart.com, explaining that I wanted to use StoresOnline to be the web server for my application as described during the seminar.  I would use the tools and knowledge available to me through StoresOnline to increase the performance of my web sites.
Laura brought in another two representatives (Jeff Johnson and Duane Barney) to discuss whether or not my application was feasible using the StoresOnline system.  We discussed that I would initially open six stores using different websites with online auto parts sales using my existing drop-ship vendor with which I presently had an ongoing relationship.  I could then manage and maintain these six sites through StoresOnline.  
I already had my own merchant processing set up using Authorize.net as a gateway and Online Data Corporation for merchant processing of online credit card transactions; however Laura told me that StoresOnline preferred using a different solution, so she gave me a $999.00 discount to offset the ECI Real-time Internet Setup and Configuration Fee which I felt was unnecessary and unneeded.
I left the April 30, 2004 seminar a happy camper with the understanding that very soon I would have six unique internet websites up and running allowing me to market new replacement automobile parts on the internet in a manner similar to what I was already doing at www.AutoPartMart.com.  After all, I had discussed my specific application with representatives from StoresOnline and they had assured me that it was no problem.
About a month later I was approached by a StoresOnline representative on the telephone concerning an opportunity which would help get my six websites up and running faster.  This service included educational material, executive mentoring sessions which would be specific to my application and pre-paid internet promotion packages for my websites (pay-per-click on Overture was specifically discussed).  
When I received my invoice I noticed that I had been charged $25.00 for shipping and handling (I was told it was included) and $1495.00 for Links for Trade.  I immediately notified StoresOnline that I already had a Links for Trade www.Links4Trade.com account established an in use, so I did not need nor want to pay for this feature.  In August I received a refund from StoresOnline for $1520.00 to reimburse me for these unnecessary expenses.
I first contacted Mr. Andy Louder with PMi Coaching for an executive mentoring session on June 8, 2004.  He looked at my existing website www.AutoPartMart.com online; we discussed what I expected to accomplish with StoresOnline and how I intended to have StoresOnline be my server for six unique online applications each site centered around marketing new replacement automobile parts using the online database and cataloguing of my vendor.  Andy told me he had to show and discuss my application with the StoresOnline data programmers.
On June 22, 2004 Andy informed me that the StoresOnline data programmers required an API Integration Guide from my vendor in order to synchronize the StoresOnline software with my application.  I contacted my vendor, IMC (Interamerican Motor Corporation) and discussed this with their data operations manager who informed me that they required a confidentiality agreement to be completed prior to allowing the release of their API Integration Guide to a third party.  
This became a sticking point with StoresOnline for a few months since StoresOnline refused to sign such an agreement.
Finally StoresOnline agreed to sign a confidentiality agreement.  Now we learned that IMC had not yet completed an API Integration Guide so IMC was unable to deliver this information to StoresOnline!  Talk about frustration - right about now I was becoming extremely frustrated and disappointed.  I had spent all of this money on a business investment and I was getting nowhere fast.
Andy and I kept loose contact over the next few months.  Finally on November 12, 2004 I forwarded a completed API Integration Guide from IMC via email to Andy; I followed up with a telephone call to be positive that he had received it.  It now seemed like maybe we were beginning to accomplish something.
During this time, I talked a few times on the telephone with employees from StoresOnline / PMi:  Any Louder, Kurt Becksrom, and a gentleman named Boyd.  Kurt told me that he would discuss my situation with Andy.  No new news.
On January 24, 2005 I received a telephone call from Andy Louder.  Andy informed me that StoresOnline was unable to provide an internet solution for me; StoresOnline was unable to interface with IMC so as to create the six online web sites (stores) which I wanted.  I was disappointed and expressed to Andy that I then deserved a refund.  Andy told me I had to talk with Kurt.
I did not talk with Kurt.  Instead, I am writing this letter today.
With all good intentions I properly and completely expressed my goals to the employees of StoresOnline at the April 30, 2004 seminar in Medford, Oregon.  I specifically told Lisa, Jeff and Duane what type of web sites (stores) I was interested in developing.  I was assured that StoresOnline was my solution and that creating, developing, monitoring, and updating my sites would not be a difficulty using the StoresOnline infrastructure.
I have learned that this is not so.  In fact, StoresOnline is unable to offer me a solution for my application.  I am returning all documentation included with two Complete Store Building Packet folders which were given to me by StoresOnline at the April 30, 2004 seminar in Medford, Oregon.  Included with this are:
1)	One Certificate for Special Workshop Offer

										Apparently Jennifer has scammed more people than us. Our story is pretty much the same as those already reported here.She contacted us via telephone to pitch her services of Lead Generation and Appointment Setting for our business. We spoke with her over half a dozen times and she ""guaranteed"" six qualified leads per week of service. She couldn't accept payment via Paypal (should have been the first warning sign) and asked that we send her a check for $360 for two weeks of her time. We told her we would pay half up front, to make sure she did come through with the leads she promised, and then she was supposed to do her next week of service and provide the leads in order to receive the balance of payment. We mailed her a check on 5/14, along with a list of leads for her to call! She emailed us once, on 5/24 to say that she was ""working"" the leads and would get back to us. She has never called or emailed back, and hasn't returned any phone calls left for her, even though we told her we would be reporting her to any and all fraud agencies we could.If you have been ripped off by Jennifer Coburn, please visit the USPS website and file a mail fraud claim against her www.usps.com/postalinspectors.

										Apparently this company has been trying to reach me. It is a 727 area code. Today, I answered. They told me I had won $400 in airline vouchers and $100 card for gasoline. They even had my bank routing number and wanted me to confirm my account # Red Flags immediately went off. I told the operator #103 that I would not do that. The supervisor who  must have been listening got on and wanted to assure me that they used the safety feature of verisign - sp?, but I know that many companies use this as their security system. As I was speaking to him, I got on-line and checked out the company name and it came up along with several other of your rip-off reports.
I want to say thank you for your service, it confirmed my gut feeling, but what I want to know is how they have my bank routing number. They also said it was because I was a good customer of Citibank, so I will be reporting it to them also. Again, Thanks.

										April 13, 2009 I received a phonecall from a man who said ""Jonny"" had asked him to call - I responded ""Jonny who?"" He said ""Jonny Andrews"" (an internet marketing personna, from whom I had purchased a ""course"" some months prior). Since I was out of town at the time, he said he'd call back the next day, but didn't.
Late afternoon of April 22, 2009 I received a phonecall from a man representing himself as ""Jonny"". When I said he didn't sound like the individual I had seen in a video online, he said that was because the online man is an actor hired to do commercials for him. Both phonecalls originated from the same area code and and set of company numbers. 
He professed interest in how my internet marketing business was going, and when I said I was frustrated and needed to know more about altering websites that I have and tracking advertising, among other things, he said he could ""help"" me to get the business into a profitable position within 2 weeks to 6 months. He said he would ask just 2 things: 1) that I promise to never reveal or sell his trade secret marketing methods, and 2) that I send him a cheque for $5,000 after my business made $50,000. 
He asked how much credit I could access, and how. I told him I could use credit on a credit card. He asked which one and claimed to check if they would extend my credit. He then said we could get started immediately and his GM, Ted Molina would send me a non-disclosure/confidentiality agreement to sign - that it would have to be done quickly because it was end of the day and his employees would be gone for the day shortly.
I saw nothing in the agreement to indicate they would be putting an immediate $4,500 charge on my MasterCard (there was a partial number there and the name I go by, not the name on my card), and consequently considered that the inclusion of my number was a fair assurance that he would be paid when the deal was complete, so emailed it back. The paperwork did not mention ""Jonny Andrews"" by name - there was a company name of Push Traffic Inc. 
He said there would be phonecalls confirming our agreement and setting times for the mentoring sessions the next day, and that he would call. When I called my credit card company the next morning they said that Push Traffic had put through 3 separate charges, totalling $4,500US. 
As promised, a woman named Christian phoned that afternoon to set up times. She had sent me emails detailing what preparations I needed to make. The emails said I must choose one of the provided website templates that she could ""customise"", and that I would need to arrange for domain name and hosting, as well as other services. When I refused to choose because (as I told her) I already had, and had paid for, websites, domain names and hosting, as well as the other things mentioned like autoresponders, she just replied that I needed to choose a template so she could begin work. 
It was obvious that I was not being offered the help I'd anticipated - ""Jonny"" had been saying whatever he thought would ""sell"" me. They had taken by misrepresentation of intent $5,713.05CAN, and were providing me with what other companies had given for no charge. I would have to come up with additional funds for anything one can't access for free online ie: hosting, autoresponders, tracking software or service and, most importantly and expensively - advertising. Christian said she would talk to ""him"" about it and he would call me back. 
I heard nothing that afternoon or the next morning, so decided to exercise my right to cancel the contract (3 day clause). I emailed the cancellation Friday, as well as sending a hard copy by registered mail that day (April 24). 
Mr. Molina emailed me Sunday (April 26) night instructing me to ""be available"" Monday when he called because I was ""implying"" that there would be more expense and he didn't see where. I replied saying I would be available every week day, and forwarded Christian's emails to him to prove my point about the additional expenses I'd be responsible for. He did not call then, and has never called since. 
The registered letter was picked up April 30 in Los Angeles, and the signature card (signed by A. Black) was returned to me. I have since sent a second email requesting a refund, but they have not responded; nor have they put through a credit to my account as of today, May 28, 2009.

										As an attorney who specializes in intellectual property for the entertainment industry, my practice is based in Hollywood, California.  In 2007 I was initially intrigued by the emergence of a new company who represented itself as having ties to major studios and television networks for the purpose of advertising. Believing that perhaps we could do business together, as we were bound to have overlapping clientele, I started my research. 
The company goes by the name Pliq (internet/mobile marketing), and is owned by Dieter P. Abt who also owns Meteor World Wide, a product placement agency, (well sort of, as they only represent one company really, which is Puma). This, despite Abt's claims of representing many companies. Well, sure enough one of my clients voiced interest in working with Pliq for a mobile campaign and asked what I knew of this new startup company. 
Imagine my surprise when I uncovered the blatant and fraudulent business dealings of the owner. While self promotion is the norm in Hollywood I have to draw the line when a company is founded and mismanaged by the same individual who, as it turns out, ripped off City banks in England by lying about family, business, and personal affiliations in order to mislead investors and prospective clients. Abt tells people he is Swiss born and related to the Nestle family, which has been proved in court to be a false (see article below). 
Dieter boasts of his Hollywood relationships with the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Suzanne Somers, Martha Stewart and Joan Collins. I wonder if any of these people who obviously take pride in their personal reputations are aware of Abt's shady business dealings and the utilization of their celebrity status to boost his self promotion. The fact is, Abt was arrested and tried with fraud in1993 for misleading bank officials into believing he was a multi-millionaire who possessed property and collateral he didn't own. I believe this is Abt's established pattern of deception and bears a remarkable similarity to Abt's management of his current companies. Word in the industry (Hollywood really is a small town) is that Pliq is strapped for cash and is seeking a second round of funding, due in no small part to Abt utilizing company funds for the purchase of property in Beverly Hills and expensive automobiles. It's a shame that the company which is staffed with sincere, hard working professionals are being misled by a charlatan who is not worthy of their trust and loyalty. It is my sincere hope investors do their own due diligence prior to funding Mr. Abt's house of cards.
Abt tricked banks, court told (26 July 2001 13:58)
Former Town & County Catering chairman Dieter Abt allegedly hoodwinked City banks out of 2.75m (4.8 million U.S. dollars) by posing as a multi-millionaire with a distinguished history, the Old Bailey heard last week.
As the fraud case got under way last Thursday, the prosecution alleged that Swiss-born Mr. Abt - who falsely claimed to be part of the Nestl family - turned to dishonesty in 1988 when he began lying to obtain bank loans and overdraft facilities.
To add substance to his aura of wealth, Mr. Abt set up a trust based in the tax haven of Liechtenstein. He gave managers of the trust a bogus list of his assets, which included paintings said to be worth 10m, property around the world, a collection of cars and prestigious company shares. 
The bubble burst for Mr. Abt when the manager of the trust discovered he had been misled and resigned, the court heard. One of the banks then called in the police and Mr. Abt was arrested in 1993. 
The court was told the loan to purchase Town & Country was legitimate, but John Woolfenden, private banking director at Guinness Mahon, claimed Mr. Abt conned the bank into lending him 600,000 using fake collateral. 
Mr. Mahon added that it was Mr. Abt's lack of administrative skills which had contributed to the downfall of Town & County. 
""He was a networker, he knew a lot of people and how to attract publicity, but he was not a good business administrator, which may be part of the reason why the company failed,"" he said. 
Mr. Abt was charged with four counts of obtaining property by deception and four counts of obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception between 1988 and 1991.

										As business owners, we hesitate to post anything negative about someone elses organization. However, after diligently trying to make Yelp work for us, we feel obligated to share our negative experience, in the
hopes that others may learn from our mistakes and refuse to play the Yelp ad game. 
In 2012, we were curious about Yelp. So we contacted a sales rep to inquire about advertising. Although the rep was extremely reluctant to share prices (which is odd, considering the fact we needed to know how much Yelp advertising would cost), we finally received a hefty quote of $450 per month with a six-month minimum contract. We negotiated that rate down to $350 per month and were eager to see how the Yelp program would provide leads for My Cleaning Lady Referral Agency. 
Even at the start, we were disappointed with the results of the campaign and contacted our sales rep numerous times to ask for suggestions about maximizing the ad buy. [continued below]....
									
										..... The agent assigned to our account after we signed the contract was extremely difficult to reachfar more so than the one whose job it had been to sell us the program in the first place. 
Numerous emails and phone calls finally led us to the original sales gal, who suggested we ask clients to write honest reviews. So, when clients praised the efforts of our domestic referral agency and associated
housekeeping services, we encouraged them to click on Yelp and write reviews.  Finding people who were eager to review was not difficult, as we have a 99% customer satisfaction rating.
After paying $2,150 over our six-month contract and realizing only a slight bump in Yelp profile views, new website traffic and very few new customers booked, we decided not to renew the contract. It just didnt make good business sense to continue to pay $150 per lead for advertising with Yelp when other methods produced far better results. 
After fulfilling the contract, we canceled and, at the time, had a Yelp profile with nine visible, positive reviews. So it struck us as odd when shortly after cancelling our ad-buy, six out of our nine reviews mysteriously disappeared into the Yelp Filter. Our efforts to contact a Yelp sales rep about the filter were frustrating because no one would return our calls or emails except to say we do not provide customer service for free accounts.
Finally, we reached someone who told us to write to Feedback@Yelp.com. The auto-reply was a description of the filter, along with a note explaining that they cannot do anything to retrieve reviews out of the Yelp Filter. 
Anyone who owns a business understands that it is virtually impossible to provide 100% customer satisfaction. But when we drop the ball, we do our best to make things right. And we have a very high approval rating as a result of this commitment to superior customer service. So it is extremely frustrating that our reviews on Yelp do not reflect this philosophy. It doesnt take a rocket scientist to ascertain that something is fishy about the correlation between Yelp ad campaign cancellations and disappearing positive
reviews.  
But dont just take our word for it. Here is a small sampling of links posted by other business owners who are dissatisfied with Yelp business practices:

										As many others that have experienced this ripoff, I begin by saying that I was drawn to a National Grants Conference back in September of 2003.  At the end, there was a short seminar about internet marketing, and I stayed and took notes and got all excited about it. I signed up for the follow-up seminar a few days later.  I paid something like $129 for that, and it was, admittedly pretty good, it was promoting the Unimweb basic business website, and offering some extra websites as well.
A few days later, I was contacted by a Unim representative, offering me a position in some kind of ""pilot program"" to use their product to create a site to promote their product and service, and including all kinds of incentives. The pitch I got was: unlimited supply of the Upgraded Web Site CD's for life, a package of 125000 opted-in emails to market to, a 12-week telephone coaching program to help me build and promote my site, and a copy of Corey Rudl's ""Insider's Secrets"" course. Well, I got the Rudl course, and the coaching program was OK, but everything else has been pure crap...  the CD's are outdated and dont even have the right info on them about hosting costs. The templates are CRAP, the tech support is non-existent, the expenses revolving around the merchant account and gateway were never revealed at the seminar.
I was charged a whopping $7440 for this package of useless crap, and I was assured that I could ""easily"" resell these websites at $999 a pop, so all I would hafta do is make 7 or 8 sales to recoup my expenses.  I guess that makes me pretty damn gullible, and for that, I feel stupid.  But these folks are *SO* slick, they make it sound like pure gravy-train, when instead, it's all coming out the other end, if ya know what I mean....

However I was not able to access the online catalog to view these items until after I paid the fee. I also was told that my $7500 credit limit would be reported to credit bureaus and help build or boost my credit.
After paying the $80 and receiving access to the web catalog, I find that the majority of high end quality merchandise can not be charged to my $7500 credit limit but must be paid for upfront because these items are supposedly at a Membership discounted price. A quick search shows that most of these ""discounted"" prices are actually higher than at other stores such as Wal-Mart,Sears,Best Buy... ect. 
All of the merchandise that I am able to charge to my credit line are cheap in both quality and value. Things such as board games and cheap jewelry and cologne and old DVD's. I mean what good is a $7500 credit limit if the only thing I can charge on it is Scrabble or the movie Batman, or Barbershop? 
I spoke to customer service to opt out of there supposed ""Elite Membership"" for 19.99 a month which includes roadside assistance, prescription drug benefits and unlimited access to my credit information. When I cancelled she mentioned to me the ""11000"" yes Eleven Thousand items that I could charge to my card so I go to the website again and look and all I see is about 110 Items I can charge to my card and none of them over $60 in Value.
I feel this company is a Scam using false advertisement and marketing schemes to prey on people trying to rebuild there credit. What they are really doing is charging people a monthly fee in exchange for reporting a $7500 line of credit to credit bureaus. But they may not even do that for after I paid the $80 and recieved my ""welcome package"" I noticed that it said "" USA Credit reserves the right NOT to report your credit to credit bureaus. I have checked my credit report and so far there is nothing on there from USA Credit, but it has not been over 30 days since I bought into the service So I dont know.

										Beginning of MY recent nightmare / Phone solicited by First Web Search as SEO internet marketing in April, 2008 by August, 2008, (I am a small in-home based business PROMISED first page placement on main Search Engines) I was finally convinced that I was being jerked around by this company call after call, email after email, month after month and dollar after dollar. First they fraudulently billed my credit card ($2495.00) for work that they had NO intention of doing for me. Meanwhile, i would call to verify that they were GOING to sometime provide the service, given several different people claiming to be the boss receiveing excuse after excuse, all my phone calls were treated with rudeness and full of lies by them.
My site was not being taken care of as promised and they even had the NERVE to place me on their ""Client Success"" page.......ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
First Web Search representatives were telling the new prospective > FRAUD VICTIMS > to call me so I could tell them how great they were: I told the parties to check my KeyWords and see for themselves. Needless to say they declined ther ? services of First Web Search...SO, I personally received a threatening and vicious call from a representative ROBERT BRADLEY who said he would destroy me and my business. August 26, 2008
08/26/08 one hour later.....I filed a complaint with the Las Vegas, ""Better Business Bureau"" against them. (one of many other victims) 09/09/08 ROBERT JENKINS apparently received notice of BBB complaint
KEN DANIELS (aka KEENAN DANIELS of BUREAU 24) latest I.T. Manager for FWS...who was reponsible for completely destroying my Website and my Home business (while working on my website they had intergrated their codes everywhere).......I am guilty of being trusting and very dumb to give them access to my information. Also, since they had began this scam from the first contact, I wonder ""what would happen when I did not renew my contract"" more BLACKMAIL!!!
09/09/08 Owner ROBERT JENKINS phone threatened me of further destruction, (what more ?) was very verbally abusive, and was proud of his POWER.....when I ask him ""WHY"" he was destroying me? His answer was
""because I can""
Any doubts - phone the Better Business Bureau of Las Vegas, Nevada (of which he is not longer a member) 
I offer my story to help prevent others from being so abused and hopefully stop the scamming company.

										BEWARE - Do not bother to do business with this company- they are eager to sell you their special website on Amazon R400  once you receive the product  they call you to advise that you could invest large amounts of money for them to do advertising on your behalf   $6000 if you want to make money quickly  the smaller the amount the longer it will take -  or  you are on your own.
Their paper work state that you need to talk with a customer service before returning the product- you have 14 days--- Left approx 10 messages  personally and on the answering machine- only problem is nobody take calls  . NO ONE RETURN CALLS!
After  about 10 messages  in 4 days  I called the  number  on my bank statement- I spoke to Jeff who tried  to convince me to keep the product- I was adamant  that I wanted to return the product and he eventually  told me to send to the address on the top of the Invoice. .By now  I was obviously annoyed and had  a bad  line, so I could  not hear him thus asking him to please repeat as I  can't hear him  AND asked why did no one return  my call to tell me that by now??? 
He actually told me You're RUDE don't ever call our company again and put the phone down in my face.
If I had a choice I would not call or do business with a company that is so unprofessional again. 
I mailed the product back with a letter explaining my frustrations- and are still waiting to get REFUNDED.  I left more messages on both numbers and eventually the Director of Customer Services called on the 07/30/2008 (John George) but I am still waiting for a call back to resolve the issue and get my REFUND.
In the last 2 days I left 4 messages on their machine no reply! I reported the case to my bank today to try and solve the issue.  The time wasted makes this a real bummer - BEWARE!

										Beware - Do Not sign up  - do your homework - CityGrid Media - this company is a rip-off!!!!Signed up with their service mid December 2011, and of course the sales rep encouraged us to enroll at the highest spend level for ""prime exposure"", but stated we would not reach the peak or top out the maximum spend target for several months, as it too quite awhile for all the internet listings to get into effect and reach maximum exposure.  Well come January 15, 2012, guess what they did!!!  Automatically took the highest monthly level out of our account, stating we had hundreds and hundreds of ""connections"". If so, then why did we never get one single phone call if that many people were looking for tree work during the holidays!!!!  Report said we got high traffic connections on December 23, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Years Eve and New Years Day - Get real people.  Only reason you would look for or even need a tree service on those holidays would be if a tree fell on top of your house!!!!!!!!!!Contacted the sales rep Robin Nelson (our only connection) to express our shock at the immediate high bill and he quickly washed his hands of it.  Questioned him about his statements during the sales presentations that if we were not completely satisfied, we could cancel at any time and owe Zero, yes he said many times during the presentation we would owe $0.  Now that we are unhappy and do not believe the ""reports"" and cancel, he quickly states he turned everything over to his manager to handle.   Yes thats right, pass the buck, wipe us off his customer list, absolutely no, and I mean offered Zero efforts on his part to come to a resolution to salvage us as a customer.  He passed us off to his manager, who we have never talked with before, said Andy Popwell would be handling everything from now on.  Now this sales rep claims he never said that we weould owe Zero. (Liar) He mentioned it several times during the presentation, it was more than 5.His manager did call, but offered Nothing, saying thats just the way it is!!!!!!!!!!  Said he would have his customer service department look into it and run reports and would call me back that afternoon with the results.  Told him of his sales representatives statement that if we were not happy, we could cancel at any time and owe absolutely Zero. He brushed this off saying they don't do that. (Because they steal your advertising/marketing money)  He demonstrated no interest in solving this and did not offer any adjustments or do anything to attempt to keep us as a customer.  Amazed that he would so quickly just brush off a new customer that had the potential to be a long term client.  Guess he must be used to dissatisfied customers cancelling, because he certainly did not care.After they drafted our account for over $600, (I cancelled the card to protect ourselves so they could not take more money), we started our own internet search to see exactly what had been done by CityGrid Media to promote our business.  In a few places where we had already been listed, they now included their ""claim"" to that site.  Furthermore, we have tons of great reviews on the net and one false negative review that was either a competitor or fired employee or was supposed to be placed on another tree company and landed on our name.  We have never done what this bad review says, so we know it is false.  Anyway, here we are a new customer with this CityGrid Media company, and the Only Review they pull across sites is this poor service review!!!!!!!!!!!!  I don't know about you, but if I were the data entry clerk at CityGrid Media, I believe I would look at what I was doing, you know like read!!!!!!  And for a new customer would you want to at least try to do your very best for them, why not take a couple minutes and search the net for the large list of great reviews of the company your setting up and make sure they are shown.  Like Do Your Job, customers advertising dollars pay your salary!!  Talk about No Service and Not Caring about your Job and companies growth!!!!!!!! They should be fired immediately as well as the sales rep and manager.  (It takes time and lots of $ to gain a customer, looks like to me, you would want to keep them instead of having them disappear immediatelyAbout 2 weeks have passed and the manager Andy Popwell has never ever called back as promised.  Guess he washed his hands of us to. Hind site is, as they say, an exact science.  My business partner/son had recieved the initial sales call from Robin Nelson, and they had many conversations.  Based on all the ""claims"", Robin convinced him this would greatly increase our internet exposure and have a large impact and increase to our business.Well, just the opposite with only the negative review they put everywhere!!!  I told Andy Popwell to remove everything they had done and all connections with our company on the internet, and to date, this has not happened.I should have looked here first.  My bank officer (when I cancelled the card) said this company had done the exact same thing to another company that banks there.I should have researched them myself and found this site.  That would have saved me all this cost and frustration.Warning - Buyer beware - this is a rip-off.  If they were a top of the line media marketing company, the sales rep would have done something, offered anything to keep us and make things right.  If they were a top of the line media marketing company, the manager would have done something, offered anything to keep us and make things right.  Guess they were both absent from class the day Customers are the life blood of any company and positive customer service is the major key to long term relationships were covered.We know it is a scam now - not just the ""no contract"", but we received no paperwork of any kind during the sales presentations, only a business card.  No brochure, no marketing materials, nothing.  But what makes us know this company is the bottom of the bucket is absolutely Zero effort was extended by either person that represent CityGrid Media to come to a resolution.  They both washed their hands of us.  In the long run, they will lose more than they gain. ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										Beware!  I ended up in this nightmare because I ordered a bottle of acai berry pills from a third party site that was linked to usaveonpills.com.  I thought I was ordering 1 bottle of pills, period, for a fee of 7.95.
First, I checked my credit statement a few days later and they had charged me twice.  They refunded the second charge.  Several weeks later I received a random email stating that my ""final shipment was processed and that I was automatically being withdrawn from the auto-ship agreement per the terms and conditions of the offer"".  
I then checked my balance again thinking that I would see another charge for 7.95.  Instead, there is a charge for 89.95!  And for what?  I have no idea, the product hasn't arrived.  I truly wonder what I paid for, was it nothing?  So far it looks that way.  I cannot imagine what kind of package I would get with 89.95 worth of pills in it.  I never saw anything stating I would be charged later.  Had I seen it, I'd know what I was getting in the mail.
My husband signed for the 1 bottle of pills last month and when we opened it, there was no insert, just a pill bottle in an envelope.  Never received emails stating I was signing up for anything, never even saw thier website until I looked at my statement and saw the double charges.  Still don't know if they even have an email address!
This is how I ended up here, I saw a report from another person who was scammed, I followed her lead, contacted the Attorney General in my state, filed a complaint, disputing the charges, cancelled my credit card and set up a fraud meeting with my bank for next week.
Their actual website doesn't have any active links so I don't think anyone is purchasing directly through them, they don't even advertise the acai berry on the site, it truly is odd. 
Buyer beware, stay away from freebie offers, that is how I was scammed into this.  I wish I could remember the third party site I was on.  It was a site that said ""read the offers from the following people, chose two offers and win a free gift card"".  After completing two offers I was taken to a new page that said I had to complete three more offers...that's when I realized something was wrong and I ""X"" out of the site.  At that point I thought well, I am done about ten bucks, learned my lesson.  
Boy was I in for a shock when the new charges came to light!
Never tried the pills, don't plan to, they smell like hay.

 b>HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the chargetruth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics still worshould k. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										BlueHippo lied from the beginning. When I called BlueHippo Funding to inquire about their offer, the first thing they did was get information from me. When, however, the Salesperson told me the payments were bi-monthly, I insisted I could not participate because I am paid semi-monthly, and usually my bank account is depleted before pay day. I work for check to check. I asked her again and again about this point. She told me in no uncertain terms that she would set up the account so that it will always fall on my payday and not prior.  I said again are you sure. She told me that she was absolutely sure. She lied. After giving me the run around for several months, on February 28, they gave me a ""shipping date"" of March 30, 2005. They said I would have my computer on that date.
On March 30, 2005 they debited my account and it was returned NSF. I get paid semi-monthly, the 15th and the last day of the month! I could not believe this. Now I knew why they gave me the run around. When I say run around I mean: 1. They debited my account two days after I spoke with the sales person. She told me there would be no debit before I received the written information in the mail. 2. When I received the mailing, I signed it, because they already had my $124.00. 3. They sent me another packet a week later. I called about it and they said I had to have a checking account. I had plainly told the salesgirl I did not have a checking account and she said savings was find. They made me go to my bank and get a letter and fax it back. They said after this I would get the computer; I didn't. 4. They then said I had to wait for two more payments to clear the bank and I would get the computer. I didn't. 5. Then they said they could not see my picture on my driver's license and would not be able to do anything until they got a clear picture. (Keep in my they had this information for over a month and never mentioned this.) 6. I faxed back a clear picture and they swore that now I'll get a suddenly ""shipping date."" February 28th the told me absolutely on March 30, 2005 I will have my computer. That is the exact day my account came up NSF. A COINCIDENCE, I think not. They knew I was paid semi-monthly, because I told the girl in the first place.  
I do feel like a fool, but I know that the law will be on myside. You don't get to take someone's money and give them ""nothing"" in return.
These people have scripts they read from. The salespeople speak perfect English. The customer service representatives seem to barely understand English. I have filed complaints with the Internet Fraud Division of the Department of Justice, The Maryland Better Business Bureau, The FBI and the State of Alabama Attorney General. They lied to the Attorney General's Office using half truths, and misleading documents. There is much more, like I said, to this story. These people have complaints throughout the country. They were ran out of the northern states and now are concentrating on the South. I should have looked prior to calling; however, even though I didn't, stupidity is not a blank check for predatory lenders. I will not stop untill they are brought to justice and I receive a full refund. By the way, even after I demanded my money back, the debited my account two more times. Please write if you can help.

										Brandon Clark called me and offered me a program called members-disounts.com. It is suppose to give you major discounts at big retailers like Walmart, sears, lowes, also restaurants Applebee's, max and ermas ... All I have to do is pay $2.99 then $19.99 a month for the program but if I pay the $2.99 for shipping and signing up he would send me either a visa gift card or a Samsung galaxy tab 2, so I chose to pay the $2.99 and accept the program and opted for the Samsung galaxy tab 2 after a couple of days I received the program info. But nothing about the tablet, so I called the 800 number back 18772127592 and Joseph York answered he said to me we have some issues with some of our departments but I promise you I will send the card you need to sign for the tablet and you will have it before Christmas, and he gave me his personal number 8155015811. A couple more days pass and nothing came so I called his personal number and told him nothing came. [continued below]....
									
										..... This time when I spoke to him I knew something was wrong because he was very rude. But he again assured me I would receive the tablet before Christmas. So a few more days passed and of course nothing came so this time when I called his personal number there was no answer, so like anyone else I left a message. I did not get a retuned call. After several more messages and attempts to contact them it was quite obvious this was a fraud and a scam. The old bait and switch. Or bait and scam I should say. Ultimately I have never received a call back so I filed a fraud report with the BBB (better business bureau) and am currently in the process of filing a complaint with the Illinois attorney general. So if any one gets a call from JLK Telcom hang up as quickly as you can they are liars and thieves. I don't understand why people set out to rip consumers off but there should be stronger laws against consumer fraud.									","  Internet Marketing Companies, Computer Marketing Companies ",0

										Business Services Online, LLC discretely added a charge to our phone bill and sent a coordinating letter of approval to the terms of their business.  However, it is a complete scam.  One of our associates was contacted and asked if we were interested in their services and we replied with a no.  However, once the charge on the bill was discovered we called to cancel the service and the company stated they had recorded the previous phone call and had evidence of our acceptance to enlist in their services and that the charge was due.  However, upon listening to the recording it was clear that the audio file had been tampered with and edited to sound like we had agreed to sign up and use this company's service.  It was very obvious that the audio file had been tampered with due to the formatting and responses that were supposedly given by our associate.  Please be aware of this company, and do not be afraid to cancel the services due to any leverage they may pull regarding the audio file that they edited and saved.  It seems legit at first, but it a clear scam upon further investigation.

										Can totally relate with all you other disgruntled folks; the difference is, I still have $800 that they want.
To Shop NBC, thank you for notifying me that my credit card turned down your recent attempts to draw any further payments. 
I went to great lengths to ensure you could not access any more of my money until I am completely satisfied.  
As I told ShopNBC customer service representative on the telephone, When I receive a personal call from Jim Peterson at Viscom USA (the same slick dude who does not deliver on his promises), I may pay the balance  The nightmare began 11/27/05 as follows:
11/27/05 Place order.  Told 7 to 10 business days arrival.
12/06/05 Shipment arrives  only the webroot internet essentials software.
12/18/05 Large box arrives with components, no hard drive CD tower.  What is up?
12/19/05 Spoke to Andy at MicroInnovations about wrong keyboard. They will send the correct one out ASAP  
(PLEASE NOTE:  To date (April) I still do not have the keyboard that was represented on the television with the toggle on the upper left  instead, sent me (2) different keyboards with ""programmable"" keys.  CHEATED !!
12/21/05  Sent LCD back, wrong support posts could not be inserted. FedEx due to arrive on 1/6/06.
12/23/05  FINALLY receive CD hard drive V2 Premier tower, but cannot set up total package until the LCD screen returns.  WHAT A JOKE !!
1/12/06	Set up total unit, only to discover the Word Software DVD had not been sent, it was installed at the factory but the DVD cover has the 18 digit password to register Word.  Can not use WORD software.
February  Call Viscom software support 877-882-4562. RE: unable to register WORD software.  They say they will check into why I did not receive the DVD and send it out.  TWO WEEKS transpires.  Received the first letter saying they are unable to honor my request because my problem was past 30 days.
March	Called Viscom immediately after receiving first letter. Representative said Oh yes, I see they shorted you the WORD 2006 because they did not have any when your shipment was sent, we will send it right out.  (Now I am really incensed that older 2002 version had been downloaded to begin with .. major MISREPRESENTATION).  
April	Wait another two weeks to get another form letter just like the first dated 1/31/06, Sorry we cannot honor your request.  Now I'm losing it folks.  Some $2,300 later and you cannot (or will not) honor my request?
Called Viscom again.  This time the conversation becomes very heated.  I am sure they have a tape recording on file somewhere.  Am told there is nothing they can do for me about the software and is there anything else they can help me with.  Add insult to injury?  I think not.
FYI:   I am also insisting on a duplicate of my extended warranty spelled out in detail.  It should not just state: MONITOR.  If the additional $299.00 only covers the monitor, I was duped Mr. Peterson.  ShopNBC can definitely cancel that part of the order if I find that to be the case.
Had I known that all the different components would have to ship back to their individual manufacturers and that all Viscom was is an assembly line, I would have never gotten involved.  
Having said that, I've informed ShopNBC that until (1) I receive Microsoft Suite 2006 and the DVD case to download and register it; (2) the correct keyboard that toggles on the upper left side as represented on the TV, and (3) a brand new one year warranty from the date of my satisfaction on all negligent issues as stated above, no further money will be forthcoming.  
They can call my phone 100 times a day if they'd like (and they do).  Better yet, if they'd like to refund me every dime in advance of sending UPS or Fed-Ex to my door, I will send their entire shipment back and buy local. Let me see now, HOW DO WE SPELL CUSTOMER SATISFACTION??  
I Thank God I did not pay for this in one payment as I had originally intended.  I pity the other customers who have no recourse.  Now put your money back guaranteed promises to work Mr. Peterson.  
ShopNBC said they turned my name to the 3 credit reporting agencies as of May 8th.  I turned theirs over to my attorney(s) about the same time.  Also the BBB and State's attorneys offices.  EVERYONE follow suit, DO get mad and DO get even.

										Captures.com is trying to scam my business out of $7,100.00! Back in February of this year, I signed a contract with Captures, to design my website and to provide us with Internet Marketing Services afterwards. The next day I decided to do a little research on the company and found they had a lot of consumer complaints on them from the BBB and here on Rip Off Report. 
This made me change my mind in doing business with them. I was told I had 10 days to cancel once I signed the contract, so I immediately called my Sales Rep named Greg and told him to cancel the contract and that no work was to be done on our website! I even have two emails I wrote them back in February as proof I tried to cancel!
I asked at that time that our down payment of $3750 be refunded back to our credit card. I was told everything would be canceled and I thought nothing more of the situation. Eventually, I ended up having to dispute the charge with American Express because no refund was given. I won my case and received a refund back to my credit card. Today I received a letter from Captures telling me I owe them $7,100.00, or they are sending me to collections. 
This is the first time, I have heard of this since I closed my contract with them back in February. I contacted them today and they told me that my contract cannot be canceled through Sales, and that I had to cancel with the Accounting Department. I informed them that I had canceled with Greg in Sales and that he never informed me of this at the time, and I was under the impression that this whole time my contact had been closed. Their excuse for this was ""Sales sometimes forgets to tell customers this information and the Sales Dept. often forgets to report cancellations to the Accounting Department!"" 
Long story short, they are trying to hold me in a contract saying they never received my cancellation request, from one of their employees. To this date no services have been provided, there should be no reason why they can't close out this account. It was their employees fault and not mine that he never gave them my cancellation request! They need to train their employees better and quit trying to scam innocent consumers into contracts with them! Bottom line, I canceled my contract within the specified time frame! No money should be owed and the contract should have been closed! 
Update: To this day they are still trying to bill my credit card for a monthly service fee, and sent my so called account to collections, but the funny thing is, they have never once provided me with any services. I am contacting their States Attorney General's Office next and am interested in speaking with anyone who has had similar experiences as myself, as I am looking into legal matters next.

										Certain persons are assigned through this site to organize a plane pyramid where there is a pilot position, two co-pilot positions, 4 1st class positions and 8 coach seats. All seats cost $1000 to board and in 3-4 weeks you are promised to be promoted to the pilot seat and rewarded $7000.
I bought a $1000 seat and was fortunate enough to start off in 1st class but it took 2 months before that board split.  I am now co-pilot and wish to exit the plane and get my moneys back.
Before I boarded, I was told that I can exit at anytime and get my money back.  Now I am being told that I have to sell it.  The planes are not moving resulting in lost monies and growing frustration.  I brought two people onboard with me (my keys) which qualified me to become pilot.  According to this business, I should have piloted and reaped my benefits by the middle of June.  
I've invested $3000 USD in this process and now they are telling me that I am stuck with losing my money.  I simply want it back.  If they want their money, they'll give mine back.  That's all I have to say.

										Checking my bank statement one day I find withdrawels for Hudforclosed.com and some other housing group.  Together they have withdrawn $90.  Of course I call to fix this problem, seeing as I don't recall signing up for these services, and I'm told well your information was entered online and there is nothing we can do, other than refund you this months money however the other times we have taken money from your account can't be refunded.  So, ok I'm going to take a hit but at least I'll regroup some of my money...
They give me my cancellation number and I'm off on my merry way, UNTIL, the very next morning, THE DAY AFTER, I check my account balance at my bank, and find out they have submitted for payment again!  So its back to the battleground.  Now I'm going to have to cancel my card because I can't trust them to keep to their end of the bargain.  The sad part is that I don't even know how they got my information in the first place and now my life is a mess because my bank account has gone into overdraft because of this withdrawel that was taken after I received my cancellation number.  
So please read the small print and if you run into any problems -cancel your card.

										Clixgalore are a bunch of freaking thieves!!!
 I was a merchant with them for about 3 years and just recently decided to close my account with clixgalore. I sent them a very nice email asking them not to withdraw anymore funds out of my bank account as I was having problems with several unauthorized withdrawals and my bank account was seriously overdrawn. If anyone is a vendor with them then you know that they take funds out of your account to fund your clixgalore account in order to pay your affiliates. 
When you have a low balance of $50 they will take out an extra $75 from your bank account to make sure you have enough money to pay your affiliates in case they make a sale for you. Well I had 2 sales that occurred so they wanted to withdraw the usual $75. However, I still had $50 leftover in their account after my affiliate were already paid, so I sent them a pleasant email asking them not to do the usual $75 withdrawal as I wanted to close out my account and to have the remainder of my funds ($50) deposited back to me.
 Well I never heard back from them and next thing you know they went ahead and withdrew the $75 anyways and overdrew my account even more which I was trying to avoid. I explained to them the situation and told them that I would be charged a fee for the withdrawal if they did it and run up the balance of my account even more. Obviously they did not care. So now I'm a ticked and I send them another email requesting again to close out my account and to give me back my money they have which was now about $125 minus their fees. 
No response, letter 2 - No Response, letter 3-4-5, no response. I ended up sending them about 9+ emails with absolutely NO Response. Mind you now it is going on 2 months! So I email them again telling them I am going to report them and so on and I did contact the BBB and they were contacted from them. Still Nothing!
 It's funny that I had emailed them several times in the past for questions and so on and never had a problem getting a quick reply back, But as soon as I asked for my money back now they don't know me? It's not like I owed them money or owed it to my affiliates.  This money was mine so it is basically theft.
I know it's not a lot of money (thank god) but it put me $110 more in the hole.  
 From what I've been reading on the net it seems they do this all the time so I would advise EVERYONE to STAY AWAY from clixgalore as well! They are obviously thieves and don't give a crap about their customers!

I called the billing department and asked them to please discontinue, they claim they are not ""authorized"" to close accounts - they say you must talk to an account manager.  They put you on hold again.  If anyone in the account manager dept. finally takes your call, they are high pressure, slick talkers to get you to stay with them.  If you still insist to close account.  They will only close if you pay another $79.00.

										Consumer incentive promotions make promises of FREE gifts if you meet certain requirments. The requirements are to sign up for products or a credit card. You need to fulfill six requirements, two on each webpage.
I have met all the requirements in Feb. 2005, but when I go to check my status on the website it keeps saying that the last two have not been met. One was a Discover card and you needed to charge something on the card the other was a purcase of a supplement.
All the requirements have been met and everytime I email them they do not respond. I also called the number provided but you talk to no one; you get to leave a message. After leaving a message I did get an email but it directed me back to the site that keeps saying my requirements were not met.

										Consumers Beware!
I went to an online site to order magazines supporting my nephew's school.  A promotional box highlighted ~ to receive a discounted coupon for your order click here.  I clicked and received a mini pop up box that required you to click on another box stating what I thought was the standard ""you agree to the terms & conditions of the site."" I agreed and was directed to an online form that required personal information which I also completed. I waited to be directed to the site that would allow me to review the discounted information, but the site just kept sending to the form that I had already completed.  So, I concluded that the site was having technical difficulties, as I had to go out of the site three times. Eventually I was able to the order the magazines without using a discounted coupon, as that part of the process was never completed. 
Imagine my surprise when we received a bill from Embarq (telephone company) stating that we owe $14.95 + taxes to Email Discounts.  My fiance contacted Email Discounts and wanted to know what the charges were for.  Email Discounts informed him that I had authorized the billing for their services.  Since the phone is only in his name and he did not give me permission to add charges to his phone, they had no other recourse but to cancel the charges.  When my fiance first confronted me about the charges, I had no idea what he was talking about nor did I have any clue what I had purchased.  
When you contact Email Discounts directly, you get the run around.  They are very guarded in giving you any information, but are real expressive in letting you know that you did approve the charges when you clicked on the box. 
Evidently in the extreme fine print (of the mini pop-up box) you not only agree to the terms of the site, but agree that Email Discounts can bill your phone company a monthly fee of $14.95 for an uncertain period of time. When I first entered the online site it appeared to me that the promotion box was part of   site and I am not totally convinced that the owner of the site isn't a sharer of the scam.  Please note that to date I have not received any details of what I had unknowingly purchased from Email Discounts, just a bill. 
According to Embarq  the federal government allows companies like Email Discounts to charge against your phone bill.  The only thing a consumer can do to stop that from occurring is to place a block that keeps any company from charging anything against your phone bill without your consent first.  I strongly encourage everyone reading this to place the block, it is free and can serve as a great protection in the event this should unknowingly happen to you.

It may just be me but I always wondered why some people on the brink of a mental break down, thats always on the special news report, just snaps one day and runs into a business and begins shooting at anything and everything.
After seeing it, reading it, watching it I can't say I know how they feel I could never break like that, but I kind of  understand why they do it.
There seems to be...no there is companies out there that can not make an honest living they MUST trick you into giving your money to them, it makes you wonder what stops there are, how far will they go to get $5.00, $10.00 from you.  I was raised to make the customer happy so they will return their business, not to take them for what I can and kick them to the curb.
Is this what America has come to?? Though this is what seperates humans and Business from the animal world...Simply Money.
What gets done? Nothing! Authorities walk in one of these offices, sit behind closed doors and nothing is ever said about it again...what do you think happens?? $$$.  You would think that we could use the judicial system, but it looks as though the Law now protects the criminal in every way.

										Dan Stalfire owns SEO One, Inc.  He appears to be very friendly and helpful with your website design issues, and SEO desires.  But what he doesn't tell the candidate is that he doesn't know very much much about SEO work at all.
When I first started working with Dan I wanted to know what he was doing for my site.  He said that he was going to be hooking up a linking pattern on the site, clean up my site, and work on the meta tags that I had already established.  All sounded good and I hired him to help me with the SEO work on my website.
After a month no one called me to find out what the passwords were for my current server.  He had never been into my website nor had any of his employees.  All he wanted was a check for that months work.  Being a little concerned I started to hound Dan about the work that was suppose to be done on my site to improve the SEO ratings.
When I started with SEO One, I had 36 keywords listed on various search engines.  As his staff started to work on my site I noticed that they would make an adjustment that screwed up the dimensions of my site.  The lettering was all screwed up and there were misspelled words on my site.  It looked terrible and I started to get dropped from websites.  With alarm I called his office to find out what was up.
Dan told me he had never heard of W3 schools or to validate a site.  This is simple SEO work and something that every does that works on site.  Since he had no knowledge it further became apparent that Dan didn't know very much about SEO.  Since I had been doing the SEO work for my site for 5 years I knew pretty well what the rules were.  I hired Dan to take some of the work load off of myself.  But now I was having to pay his company and do the work.
The following month I dropped further off of the search engines.  When I asked Dan about it he wanted to know how I knew I was falling.  I told him that I had SEO software to track the progress and knew that he wasn't doing anything on my site but mess it up.  H argued with me and wanted a copy of the report.  Hence, I sent him the copy of the report thinking....he owns a SEO company and doesn't even have the SEO software to follow the progress!!!  
The next month I further dropped off the search engine radar.  I was now down to 12 key words and not placing very high at that.  The site had CSS errors, spelling errors, grammer errors, and other things that would of been easy for a knowledgeable SEO company to fix.  Instead, he allowed his employee to make the ""global"" changes to my site without even seeing if the changes were good for my site.  They were not and I would spend all weekend fixing what Michelle had done to my site.  
That was it!  I told Dan that I would do it myself and was not going to work with his company.  My website is a website business and missing out on valuable SEO coverage was costing my company hundreds of dollars every day.  It was a necessity to get back listed and make the changes to the site to get me in the higher rankings that Dan was unaware of.  
Since I discontinued my relationship with Dan he is now trying to bill me for a years worth of work even though he never did the job.  It is my firm belief that he is a simple web designer, with some knowledge of his server and trying to pass himself off as a SEO manager in order to get money thinking that the business wouldn't know any better.  
Beware of this company.  Unless of course you enjoy spending your money on a shabby job and false promises.  Currently, Dan has one of his staff harassing me for money and threatening to send me to collections.  I think every should know before engaging in any type of business deals with this company so they can make a sound judgment if they too would like to end up in this predicament.
Anyone thinking of hiring someone for SEO work it is my advise to learn it yourself.  Google makes it really easy and frowns upon companies like this that has butcher tactics.

David Will has been explicitly been informed of this. So instead of solving his problem the right way, he creates a website using ernestzoller.com and slanders me as a Wannabe Marketer and spammer.

										Dealtaker.com is not a legitimate site. It showed me a coupon that was supposed to save me money off an item that I wished to buy. When I clicked on the link, a box popped up asking me for my personal information. Assuming it was all valid, I filled the box and hit submit. I never got my discount and on top of that a few months later someone was making purchases using my credit card number. It was all tracked back to this evil site dealtaker.com
I made several requests for them to help me but noone ever answered my emails. I finally contacted the BBB but no help was given to me either. Please please stay away from this site. You will get your personal information stolen. 
They were even mentioned on some magazine for being a phishing website.

										Dear readers,I am writing you to let you know that the buisness worldprofit operated by sandi hunter and jeffery lant and george kosch is a pyramid scheme.The company is borderline scam because george mentions in the bootcamp videos that a person will not get rich right away.This statement relieves him and the company of the responsibility to render effective profit margins immediately.However,the credits that are offered are not delivered and the active safelists will become non functional shortly after your order is completed.You will be sent to support tech for every single question you have and you wont get specific answers for days after.You will have no live customer service rep though there is a phone #780-444-7477.The safelist mailers will use your creative articles and bounce your emails if they so choose.The company is a complete start up company,meaning all advertising  tools will be performed at the expense of the new arrival.The only sales you will get will be the ads that you place directly into the traffic exchanges and they will be few.The safelist members of world profit will visit your site twice if your lucky.That visit will be from just one or two members.You will not ever own the website or its marketing materials.D.Jeffery lant is literally unheard of in the buisness marketing world.You could actually rent a brainhost website for 10.00 month and create your own amazon and clickbank accounts,join safelists and traffic exchanges and blog on wordpress and blogger without the world profit network and pay far less for your advertisement.Most importantly of all, though you will have good placement in the search engines you will not have a strong keyword term that will lead prospects to your world profit website without paying some other company to generate the search term for you and the higher the priority the term the more it will cost.basically to sum it all up,your associate sales and commissions may go on  unreported and you would be marketing exclusively from the hopes of the integrity and honesty of the companies up lines.

										Dermagist (formerly Dermajuv) is a complete consumer ripoff internet site.  The Better Business Bureau rated them an ""F"" on an A to F scale, for the complaints filed against them. They offer a ""Money Bank Guarantee"" but fail to disclose a $7 per item restocking fee for each item returned, even if the item has not yet been opened/used. This quite curious since they would be banned from reselling returned items by health laws, so why the so=called ""restocking fee.""  Many complaints have been filed online about this fee, as well as super-slow crediting back to customers credit cards for returned items.  These fees, together with return shipping and insurance costs, make doing business with this company a really expensive experience. I am returning 8 items - 3 of which were unopened - but am being told by their ""customer service"" department that the charges still apply = that would amount to $56 in restocking costs alone!  What a scam.  Don't do business with these crooks.

										DO NOT give them your credit card information.
We used Expedite for 2 different email marketing sends for 2 clients (I work at an online marketing firm; however, we don't have large email lists).  Everything seemed great throughout the process...affordable, good service, ok results (if they weren't manufactured), and so forth.  After our first time using them, we used them again a month later.
Anyways, over a month later our Credit Card company flagged an attempted $475 charge from Expedite.  We called them, finally got to talk to a manager because David Pierce was ""out"".  He's been out of the office every time we have tried contacting him...I don't think he exists.  Plus we called at 2pm and he was still ""out to lunch"".  Push come to shove, we got lucky the charges never went through but now have the pain to close the credit card account.

										eocal has been harassing me on the phone for 9 months now! My name is Chuck Jones and I own a plumbing company here in San Diego - Sandiego Plumbing and Drains / Cheap Rooter. I have received over 300 calls from elocal within 9 months. I am also a webmaster and SEO tech with my other company Website Publishers. I do the very same thing for FREE that elocal wants me to pay for. I have told them several hundred times that the answer is NO. I do not want their service! They still continue to hurrass me on the phone. 
Even though I tell them over and over and even show them that I have existing local listings in the 3 major search engines they still fight me and continue to try to get me to sign up with their program. They call me several times through each day either from Temecula ca or now here in San Diego CA where I live. I have given them my phone numbers at least a dozen times and asked to be put on a do not call list. 
They do not abide by this list! They continue calling me. The last episode was 3 calls today from a Mike from San Diego Tel 619-220-7902 and he each time posed as a customer needing plumbing work for Poway. I asked whom he was and each time he said he was from elocal. I am FED UP with them! Can anybody stop them? What they are doing should be considered CRIMNINAL.

He told me that I could get contractor leads for the rest of the month on Jan. for 99.00. He told me this was under no obligation. He said after the 99.00 trial, I could recieve leads for 500.00 per month about 20 leads. I said that I would decide after the trial was up. He ask me for a credit card number and I gave it to him for the 99.00.

I tried to email her back but the address was not valid. I then called Eric(CEO) and left him 3 messages that I was misled and ripped off and he wouldn't return my calls. I emailed their online contractor help line and told them what happened and all I wanted was my card credited back. 
I also told them that I would contact the local news crew to tell them how I got ripped off. I got a responce from Jeremy saying this was ligitimate and that the news crew would'nt be interested in my problems. ""Just sign the contracts and start recieving leads! "" What do you want to do? Be a TV celeberty, or make money? "" Thats what this guy told me hiding behing his computer. All I want is my 99.00 back. I know times are hard but scamming people isn't the way.

										Everything seemed ligit at first.  I got a quote for selling my old laptop.  Then I got a prepaid FedEx box to send back my laptop.  After sending back my laptop, I got an email indicating my laptop had been received.  Then I got an email indicating my check was being sent.  Then, after following up after no check had arrived, I got an email saying they had gotten very busy over Thanksgiving, but they would follow up immediately.  I played this game for several weeks, then I heard nothing.
I guess I should have noticed at first that their email address was a gmail.com address.
I've also checked with the Nevada State Corporation Commission, and they have no record that this company has ever filed to operate a business in Nevada.
Since I've had great success previously with online companies like Gazelle, I'm really pissed that these folks at LaptopChick.com scammed me.....and I'm going to do everything I can to report them to the authorities in Nevada and help prevent others from being ripped off like I have been.

										EXTORTION. Plain and simple. VistaPrint.com is not a safe site!  They are sharing your credit card information with third parties in return for a commission that they receive from them. They are fully complicit in allowing third parties to trick and deceive the consumer into unwittingly enrolling in some bogus marketing scheme.  I made an online purchase at Vistaprint.com who I ordered business cards from then in April 2007 and a year later I find out that my credit card has been  charged $14.95 a month by 24ProtectPlus and $9.00 a month by WLIReservationRewards between April 2007 and November 2007. Both jumped in my wallet while i was on VistaPrint.com.
This is how it works.  They pay a commission to the retailer, in my case Vistaprint.com which gives them full access to ALL my personal information and credit card information if i so much as click in the wrong place or don't de-select an option on the web site.   Usually it's very ambiguous so you are not even aware you have fallen into their trap. ! I am always very careful when  purchasing online so these creeps are very clever. 
Apparently that action signs you up as a subscriber to a business you've never heard of, don't know what they offer, and with no consent. Then...............i was told that they mailed me something that i was supposed to sign and mail back to them if I wanted to stop service. !!!!!!!! 
By the way, I was NEVER emailed or called or mailed to tell me that I was signed up for this stupid service, and the only reason that payments ceased was because I cancelled my credit  card in Nov. 2007.  The scammers never even informed me that payment had ceased. A REAL company would have immediately notified me that the credit card was refused. These crooks don't want to draw attention to themselves and have to issue a refund so they just quietly move on to the  next victim. 
Guess what ? All the following companies are under a giant umbrella organization called  VERTRUE.  Prior to 2004 it was called  MemberWorks. It is an umbrella organization for these so called 'businesses' such as Simple Escapes ,HomeWorks, Plus DealPass, PrivacyMatters ValueMax ,YourSavingsClub, and of course my personal favorites: 24ProtectPlus WLIReservationRewards , and many more I don't even know about. 
What is it going to take to STOP this!! Nearly every state in the country has a lawsuit filed against them. Every Attorney General in every state knows about them so WHY are they still around year after year after year. 
If this happens to you, don't worry. You WILL get your money back. That is their dirty little trick. As long as they refund the money they have stolen and cancel subscription then they skirt the law and are able to trap other innocent people.  The salespeople are trained to be very 'nice' and they profess ignorance. Do NOT take NO for an answer. By law, (at least there's one protecting us) they have to cancel your subscription and offer a full refund. 
Hello Consumer Protection ............ !! Are you even listening..........? I've been reading complaints exactly like mine back to at least 2002 by the same company! 
And get this people. More than one Consumer Protection Website displays, Google Ads that advertise Vertrue , SimpleEscapes , etc. etc. The very companies they say they are protecting you from. Look for the Google Ads on the page. You're may see the very company you're complaining about !!

										FACTS
-             
Aundre Morris and Sean Mohammed was offered $49, 500 per year, per person as sales manager for new initiative with rental site and then in budget draft it was dropped to 48,000 per person per year plus bonuses with a letter of intent.
-             
Aundre Morris and Sean Mohammed were fired from their job at Viewit.ca as word got around because of the fact of doing leg work for new initiative for VSM and it was found in conflict of interest and both Aundre and Sean was released from employment as of Feb 2010.
-             
Aundre Morris was released from his job at Viewit.ca when he had a kid on the way and has his other three children to look after.
-             
Sean Mohammed was released from his job at Viewit.ca after having his third child, also having to struggle with a medically sick wife and 5 year old son who are both still medically is not well to this date.
-             
Aundre Morris and Sean Mohammed were assured by Virata Gamany and Tom Napiontek that this initiative will begin in the next six to eight months from Feb 2010 as mentioned in conference calls that were recorded.
-             
In this period of time Sean Mohammed and Aundre Morris had weekly conference meeting with both Virata Gamany and Tom Napointek where Sean and Aundre also engaged in many meetings to get budgetary items in place.
-             
Aundre Morris and Sean Mohammed spent time in trying to acquire an office to begin this new project which was all turned down by Tom Napointek.
-             
Aundre Morris and Sean Mohammed also had meeting with many property managers to acquire listings for the new rental site initiative. 
-             
After time the property managers did not have the faith in Sean Mohammed and Aundre Morris as Tom Napointek and Virata Gamany keep pushing back the start date for project.
-             
Sean Mohammed and Aundre Morris also meet with all of the associations dealing with property management as requested by Virata Gamany to acquire the accurate amount the company will be spending to be a part of: Again faith was lost in both Sean Mohammed and Aundre Morris as to the starting date kept getting unsure.  
-             
Sean Mohammed and Aundre Morris also met with several advertising firms as to start for the new rental site initiative, the start date at this time had become unknown as Tom Napointek told Sean Mohammed and Aundre Morris that the
site had barely even begun production as this was now in October of 2010 as in recorded conversation.
-             
Sean Mohammed and Aundre Morris had contacted Virata Gamany and Tom Napointek via phone conference on the ending of 2010 where we were told that they are going to holding on doing anything with the new initiative for VSM as they had other priorities at this time.
-             
There was absolutely no contact for months from Virata Gamany and Tom Napointek despite some email requests from Sean Mohammed and Aundre Morris. 
-             
Early on this year of 2011  Sean Mohammed emailed Tom Napointek and told him I am speaking with lawyers he then  where Tom Napointek response was basically well we did not give you a confirmed date.
-             
It is now October 2011 and Tom Napointek has contacted Aundre Morris and requested a meeting Aundre Morris and Sean Mohammed on Friday the 7th of October 2011.
Tom and Virata has not contacted us back to make amends the fact that Aundre and Sean has been victimized and used by these two individuals for information to start up a company as Aundre and Sean will head up. 
Bottom line Sean and Aundre lost their jobs and has not been given any compensation for the work that they did and was left without jobs and their families to deal with.
 
These are the facts of the matter between Aundre Morris, Sean Mohammed and two VSM employers Virata Gamany and Tom Napointek.

										Financing Alternatives, INC. took my money over time every two weeks like they was surpose to with no problems. When the payment was paid in full there was not computer. I don't understand how a company can take someones hard earned money and not give them any thing in return. I have tried many of times to contact the company but still no response. I heart hurts because that computer would have been a gift for my daughter to go to college with but that did not happen. Every time i think about this it makes me sick.

										First I was suckered in by a advertisement. It said local mother from my state that had made thousands of dollars working from her home. Showed me many testimonials of others that have made thousands also. They even showed me canceled checks with the accounting and routing numbers blurred out. They first wanted a 39.95 fee to send me their information package. I clicked the No thanks box, and they changed it to 12.97. I again clicked the No thanks box, and they changed it to .99 cents. I thought for .99 cents I would look at what they had to offer. I even printed out their conformation screen and it never said anything about a $139.95 membership fee to be charged after the so called 3 day trial period. Checked my credit card balance online 3 days later and noticed a pending charge for $139.95. Called my credit card company and ask them what it was for. They told me it was from ICM Websites. I told them I DID NOT AUTHORIZE THAT CHARGE AND TO BLOCK IT! They gave me their number and said I would have to call them and ask them for a refund.Of course when I called them their operator could not help me with a refund. She could only cancel my fradulant membership. She would have to transfer me to the billing department. John from their billing department said my 3 day free trail period was up and he could not give me a refund. I told him I Did not agree to that charge! He said yes you did twice when you clicked the I agree  box on their website.I have never encountered such a DECEITFUL AND IMMORAL COMPANY IN MY LIFE! WHAT A JOKE OF A COMPANY! They never have been in the business of helping anyone. I'm sure their's laws, rules and regulations they are breaking. I will be Disputing the charge with my credit card company and will include a copy of this with it. I will also be advising them to look at ICM WEBSITES on RIPOFF REPORT.COM and ask them to block any more charges from ICM WEBSITES with all their card holders. I will also be contacting the BBB, the attorney general in my state, any my local media about this FRADULANT COMPANY.  ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										First of all I need to say that when and if a seller charges fees for services in which fair exchange is provided, I'm fine with it.
Also, if there are favorable reports to file on this company, let them be shown.  I've found 3 here on Ripoff and I'm adding a 4th.
A friend advertised Guru to me and I've since cautioned him about the ""gotchas"" in the agreement, which freelancers only discover AFTER a bid has been accepted.
In setting up my profile I was never asked about membership fees or advised about fees.  No law is broken as no law specifies anyone, including Guru. must be up front about such matters.
I got a project approved via Guru only to find that when I went to set up payment that THEN they wanted 10% of the reward.  I considered this outrageous and emailed them to that effect.  Note, I can't and won't put the text of that here as I don't know if minors may be reading :)
This, combined with what I'd owe the IRS and State of Ohio, along with Escrow fees and the like, would have taken far too much of the funds.
I let them know in a hurry this was a rip off.
Beware, Guru.com does NOT provide you with informed consent.  You MUST use their pay system or this CONSTITUTES A VIOLATION OF THEIR TERMS OF SERVICE.  Get that one!  You MUST use their service.  Or your account will be cancelled, should you be caught.
And here is another gotcha, if you don't believe it fully read the terms of using their pay serivce.  They want fees even when and if you get further business from the client.  They want this even if it was not bid via Guru!
When someone wants 10% of what I'm producing, I'm sorry.  They either need to be the Government or be on my development team.  
I'd be eager to hear, and welcome, any GOOD news as to Guru.com saving the day for someone, watching an employer's or freelancer's back.  DO give a rebuttal to this report if such exist.  I'll welcome it.
However, when charges and fees are not explained up front, I'm suspect as a result and NOT encouraged or comforted.
My advice is to write them and let them know you're not happy about such non-disclosure, about this total surprise as to terms of service.

										First of all I realize how stupid I was to fall for this.
I looked into their home business offer and went for it before doing my homework.  I paid them $149.00 via credit card.  That was my second mistake.  
Then after the fact,  I investigated the phone numbers I had for them and they turned out to be duds.  They already charged my account before I could call the company to stop payment.  
They have a very elaborate presentation on line and on the phone and they may have gotten me, but I sure would like to be part of shutting them down.
Any advise you can give will be greatly appreciated.

										First-time published writers, beware of  Rob A. Wilson, NLP coaching and his cohorts at BeFirst, Inc,. All-tied up productions and The Writer companion publishing.  These people have been Internet, computer and website hacking me in excess of one year.  I was a first-time public writer, though with a teaching background, insurance background, and having been writing poetry and professional correspondence and form letters in all of my career, I was no amateur to be fooled or to be exploited.  
I have contacted Yahoo, as my Yahoo accounts have been compromised with keyloggers on my name as well as on theirs.
I have contacted Facebook, as they literally stole personal information from my Facebook friends and made it into advertising material.
They work with a published author, who is a plagiarist and constantly chops and rehashes and rewrites my articles for profit.
They work with another lady that is a graphic designer and computer savvy, though always liked to insult me on Twitter for no reason.
Tom Ski, aka TOM SKIBOWSKI, arrest records call him Charles C. Skibowski, he has been arrested for you guessed it written art theft and for being a con-artist along with Bruce Mower. Tom has stolen my poetry and passed it onto other companies like Harrison advertising and various other companies.  He works with another lady and they have rehashed and stolen so many articles that I have written on thesop.org  Also, Staugnews.com roadtrekin.com orangechiefs.com and there are so many places that they have posted my personal writing, I can't keep up.  They have received several Cease and Desist orders/via email to no avail.   They copied two underwriting articles and designed the whole Greenregister.com after 3 of my underwriting articles that they never even printed.  
Rob A WIlson, still harasses me on my computer, websites and stalks and steals my written text.  I was supposed to endorse him, but he did not want to pay and then he reprints my endorsements without compensation and he also stalks me constantly.  Rob claims to be an NLP coach, but he does not practice his own logic and I found him to be an insanely jealous man that is constantly copying my work and the work of others and he boasts about copying my work in his daily commentaries that are just undecipherable. I never signed up for his mailing list and he sent me mail everyday for the better part of 2 years.  
I have gone through 4 computers and counting with the expense of paying to reformat and clean and add security to each one. 
Ladies and gentlemen, these folks are the worst people that you could communicate with online.  They actually believed that they could possess me and my writing ability for their own profit.  
Report them, especially be aware of ROB A WILSON as he is a major stalker with his blog talk radio show, cowboy-wisdom, and he stalks ladies for months at a time.  
Report these people as soon as you can to make the world a better place.									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										First, I purchassed an order of 1000 guaranteed signups for $899.00 because it was a good deal on November 4, 2011. I have his website saved and can show where their guarantee states that the guaranteed signups were not incentivised to sign up, and that they were real people signing up on their own. When the signups began to sign up for my free program, I noticed that the ones from thewebtrafficwizard were coming in alphabetical order (last name). I immediately emailed scott (owner) to ask him to pause the campaign until I found out why this was happening, because from what it looked like to me was that these were leads bought for a low price and were being stuffed into  my account from a list manually (the alphabetically ordered names is what gives them away.)
It turned out after a day or so, Scott said that it was my system that was placing them in that order (It's still quite clear in my backoffice where you can see the names began coming in alphabetical order) and denied it. I proceeded to ask for a refund, but was denied. I filed a dispute with netspend (my cc) and they investigated it (somehow) and accepted scott's word over mine. He provided NO PROOF that the order was completed, but I have proof for the whole world to see if needed.
I was denied a refund, and was told to take this up with the merchant. I tried everything, from cancelling the dispute (only to re-open it after the order just stopped and was never completed )even though the guaranteed signups were all bogus.) Nothing.
I have all the email correspondences, receipts, a copy of their website at the time of the purchase, receipts, and can also provide access to my backoffice to prove otherwise. Even though the leads were bogus, I only received around 250 out of the 1000. They were supposed to deliver within 1 month or they are guaranteed to give your money back! It's been over 2 months. The system of mine either verifies by mobile number or email. None have responded to my emails, and all the numbers that I call are out of order or wrong. 
As a seasoned network marketer, It is obvious that Scott and his company are purchasing dirt cheap , outdated leads, and stuffing hem into unsuspecting customers' programs and making huge profits at the same time. I would like to provide all the evidence but this form would not support all my details. Please let me know if you need the finer details.									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										For weeks I have been receiving emails from Steve Iser, an internet based company, known as Instant Passive Profits, Commission Cruncer, Social Paradigm Inc and I am sure there are more companies.  He says he will make you a multi-millionaire overnight.  Writing that now, it seems crazy that I would have fallen for this.  I have a master degree, and should never have followed it.  But I did.  I just want to stop you from doing the same thing.  
He kept sending emails every few days.  His pitch says he can give you the secret to millions of dollars.  All he wants is a one time payment of $47.00 Canadian so he can 'pay back' those who helped him.  Once you pay the money which is supposed to be guaranteed for 60 days by clickbank, he immediately asks for another $247.00.  I stopped there.  I contacted Clickbank and paypal to cancel the payment. [continued below]....
									
										.....  Because it is the weekend, I have to wait until Monday to see if I can get the money back.  Initially I said to my husband, I want to try it, what have we to lose?  He replied, ""food"".  You see we are living on our pensions, and don't have even $50.00 extra, but I had to try.  
I was a fool.  Don't you be.  Please, unless you don't need the money, don't do this.  It is a scam and ripoff.  I don't know what happens after you pay the extra $247.00. I expect he will continue to ask for more and more.  And he doesn't tell you what the secret is.  My guess is that the secret is the initial payment, and then almost blackmail asking for more, in order to give you the software.  That is his original request as well.   
This is a scam, maybe even fraud, promising one thing, and never giving it.  I also suspect he has a loophole where he doesn't give the original money back either, even after saying in writing that the money back guarantee is for 60 days.  It was about 2 minutes after paying the $47.00 Canadian, that he asks for more.  Please for your own sake do not do this.  I don't want you scammed, like I have been.  									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										FX-MAILS, SUNNY-MAils,and Maystromails was a great disappointment to me.When I signed up, I decided to start as a free member just to see how the companies were. Well, when I got to the point where I'd earn enough to cash out (which took several months),it was a different story!
FX-Mails Pay Out to Free Members is $20,000. Well, I've got $20,700.00. I requested payout and email them through their contact email address several times.  Probaly after the third time, they emailed me saying that there are no payouts to free members anymore.Most of their members had upgraded so if I wanted cash, I would have to upgrade my membership. Does that make sense? Fx-mails won't give me the money they owe me in the first place, so I am definitely not going to give them money to get money that is owed to me. They offered me advertisement packages instead. I don't want advertisement packages, I want my money!!!
For Sunny-Mails, automatic cash out is $11,000. I've already made $19,975.00. I've been emailing them like crazy however I've received no response from this company.
As for Maystromails, cashout I believe is $16,000.  I've earn $410,000. I requested payout but again to my disappointment, no one has emailed me back.
I am so glad that I can report these dead beat PTR Programs. At first, I thought that I was in the Twilight Zone until I came across this website with people who have similar complaints as I do. So, I too, decided to voice my complaints. I know there are plenty of you out there that has been duped out of your time, so complain, voice your opinion! Maybe we can get together to file a lawsuit!! Let these PTR companies know that they did us wrong civilly!!
Two months I've been emailing the other 2 companies. Still no response! Two months ago is when I decided not to read anymore mails either. However, I have not cancelled membership yet because I want proof that I've earned those cashout amounts.If I were to cancel my membership, then I would forfeit my money earned. I am not forfeiting anything! I am ready to fight legally. My gloves are on!! Come fight with me if you have been a victim of nonpayment by these PTR programs.

										GettingBookReviews.com Is An Absolute Rip-Off! Stay Away From This Company AT ALL COSTS!!!
Okay, so I am fairly new to the self-publishing business so I can’t claim to be much of an expert on any of the involved aspects. I’m sure I’m not the first self-published author to experience a good deal of disappointment upon discovering how difficlut it is to find any reputable organizations that are willing to even consider reviewing self-published debut authors. I guess it made sense to me after I thought about it, but it was still a disappointing reality.
I’m not into buying good reviews to trick people into buying my book. To me, that just seems backwards because the readers probably won’t enjoy your writing and are then likely to write negative reviews and avoid your titles in the future if only for the fact that you made them feel misled or tricked. This is not good for any of the parties involved.
So after searching high and low for places to get reviews for my self-pubbed title, I stumbled across Kirkus Discoveries for Indie Books. This was exciting to me, since Kirkus has a long company history and is a trusted authority in reviewing books ever since it was founded back in 1933. Like me, you might be wondering what the catch is? Well, it’s not cheap. Their Indie Review program charges a hefty $425 fee for their standard service alone! The standard service only offers a book review of about 200-300 words. 
That’s over four hundred dollars for a couple hundred words from a reviewer! I don’t know about anyone else, but this is a lot of money to me right now. Even if the reviews are outstanding and worth every penny, I just can’t afford to shell out that much money for a review at this time.So, I had to pass for now. Besides, there is always the possibility that a review would be negative or say things that you don’t feel best represent the writing that you put so much work into. 
That would really put you in a bad position —  you’d have essentially wasted hundreds of dollars just so that someone you don’t even know could insult, belittle or devalue your art. That seems really sh*tty to me.
For the time being, I gave up the search. My determination and generally stubborn attitude wouldn’t let me just sit around all day hoping my book would get some good reviews and more people who wanted to read it would end up buying it as a result. That just wasn’t going to happen, it’s unrealistic. Upon searching for book review services (hopefully ones that were a bit less expensive than Kirkus) in Google, I happened to notice an ad in the right sidebar of my search results page. It was for a site called GettingBookReviews.com.
I clicked the link and checked out the site. It seemed to be new from what I could tell, since it looked like it didn’t have tons of developed content available. The copy was written somewhat well and the vision described on the site sounded very similar to the concept behind the Kirkus Discoveries service. Lots of emphasis on how your book would actually be read and then honestly reviewed. This site even claimed that distributing the review to a couple thousand different media organizations was included in the service, similar to press release service packages.
Then, I thought I found what was good news for me (or at least my budget…)  —GettingBookReviews.com was offering this review service at a much more reasonable rate! For only $99, they claim to provide all of the following:
300-word book review on Amazon.com, BN.comReview 
submitted to 1,500 websites
Review submitted to 5,000 media contacts: newspapers, magazines, radio, TV
If repeated, subsequent outreaches will feature themes unique to your book
Sounded great to me! I could afford that, so I spent a few more minutes visiting the rest of the site and reading carefully through ALL the information posted on any of the pages. I then decided to go for it. I ordered the $99 package, then filled out and submitted the requested forms with all the details of my title.
The following text is directly from their website:
“1. Go to the home page and scroll down to the bottom of the page. Click on the Buy Now button of the service you wish to purchase. 
2. Once we receive notification of your purchase, we will respond with a request for you to complete a questionnaire and email us a PDF or Word document of the book.  Pre-final edit versions are acceptable as we are focused on content.  You may also snail mail a copy to:
AFTERWORD MARKETING GROUP
Attn: Todd Rutherford
9731 East 54th Street
Tulsa, OK 741463. 
Once we receive the completed questionnaire and the book, your review/press release will be completed in 7 to 10 days.
4. We will submit the review/press release to you so that you may approve or suggest changes.
5. Once approved, the review/press release will be posted to Amazon.com, BN.com, and scheduled for distribution to up to 1000 websites and 5,000 media contacts.”
Pay special attention to number three, which I have made bold.
The date of my order was January 12th, 2011. After payment was processed, I was redirected to the form, filled it out, and it generated a message upon submission that the details were received successfully. Since nothing happened after that, I decided to email him the next evening and make sure he recieved my order and asked him if I should email the PDF of my book to his email address.
 His response was quick, but he told me to complete the form that I had already filled out. I informed him that I had already done this, and attached the PDF to my response since he had instructed me to do so. After that, he replied with “thanks” and I figured I’d hang tight until he’d had time to read it and write the review.
On the 19th of January, I decided to email him and check in to see what was going on. I had honestly forgotten what the website had specified as the expected delivery time for the package I ordered. So I figured I would just ask him, which is exactly what I did. I was very polite and asked him to excuse my bad memory, since I knew the information had been available on the site. He told me he aimed for between 7-10 work days, just like the site states. Okay, so I thanked him and said I was looking forward to reading it when he was finished.
On the 23rd of January, he emailed me the press release/book review so that I could read over it. I thought it was acceptable and was basically satisfied with it, so I responded the very next day (January 24th) to inform him that I approved of the review and he could carry out the next step of the process as soon as possible. He replied by telling me that he would schedule it for distribution.
By January 29th, I hadn’t heard a word from him since our last emails were exchanged. The press release/book review was nowhere to be found on the web that I could see and I had received zero communication from him about what was going on. I thought this was highly unprofessional on his part, but I like to give people the benefit of the doubt so I simply emailed him and asked him when I should expect the release to go live? His response on that same day was something to the effect of “I should get to it sometime this weekend, I’ll keep you posted.” Okay, so I tried my best to remain patient at this point…
By February 10th,  he hadn’t emailed me once and the review was nowhere to be found, other than my inbox and his outbox. I was outraged at this point. About a week prior to that, I decided to carry out a little experiment, to get an idea of just how angry I should be about his quality of service (or lack thereof, rather).
I found a nifty little site called (((competitor's name redacted))) a while back, where people can post tasks they’re wiling to do for a fixed rat eof $5. My experiences with the site had been awesome, both as a seller and a buyer. I did a quick search on the site for “book review” and tons of results came up, many of them offering to review self-published ebooks on Amazon and so on. I checked a few of them out and went with one that had tons of great feedback and was offering not one but TWO Amazon reviews (each from a separate user account). Couldn’t resist, so I paid the five dollars through Paypal and provided them the details for my book (Amazon product page, ect).
Now, none of what I’m about to say is exaggerated or made up at all. I ordered the two reviews from (((redacted))) on February 1st, 2011. Just a few hours after I ordered it, the seller/user wrote to me to let me know that the first review had been posted and they were waiting to post the second one because Amazon sometimes detects something fishy going on when too many are posted in rapid succession. 
I hadn’t expected anything this fast, so I went on over to my Amazon product page to read the review. It was 100 times better than I had figured it would be. You could tell that the person had really spent a few minutes checking out the information about my book and getting a feel for it before just diving into writing a meaningless review.
I responded with a thank you, and by the time I had finished writing and sending it, I already had a message from them telling me that the second one was now also live. I excitedly revisited the product page to read the second review, only to be pleasantly surprised yet again by the outstanding quality and the obvious few minutes that the person had spent becoming acquainted with my writing. I was at a loss for words.
(Side note: I was fairly certain that it was obvious which of the two reviews on my product page were written by the sellers on (((redacted))), but sometimes they appear out of order, so I requested that he provide me the usernames of the accounts that were used, so I could distinguish them from unsolicited reviews, and he replied by saying he should have thought of doing that to beign with and he promptly provided the info. I was amazed.)
You do realize what this means, right? I just spent a measly $5 for two fantastic reviews on Amazon that were delivered in a matter of about four hours or so. And….over two weeks prior to this, I had paid almost $100 for one review that STILL wasn’t even posted on Amazon or anywhere at all for that matter.This really pissed me off! But since I usually try to avoid conflicts, I kept my mouth shut for several more days as I hoped Mr. Rutherford would manage to complete my order to my satisfaction in the VERY near future, making a conflict unnecessary. However, this did not transpire that way at all.
Finally, on the 10th of February 2011 (almost a full month after my initial order), I emailed him to let him know that I received a far superior service for only five dollars and that I was quite unimpressed and dissatisfied with his level of communication and the quality of his service. I asked him to just cancel the distribution (if it was even scheduled) and requested that he just refund my money and we could be done dealing with each other.
He responded that same day, telling me that he “would not refund my money,” and informed me that my review had now been posted to Amazon. He offered NO explanation WHATSOEVER as to why it hadn’t been posted on there before I wrote this complaint. I was in disbelief that it seemed to require me initiating a conflict in order to motivate him to hold up his end of the bargain (though posting it to Amazon was hardly enough to do this, especially at this point).
Incredibly angry and feeling cheated out of my money, I responded to him by assuring him that refusing to refund my money after failing to deliver the promised services was just fine with me. I told him that I intended to tweet to my 7,000+ followers on Twitter that his service was dishonest and out to scam their customers. He gave me some lame response about how he would distribute the release, as stated in the package…blah, blah, blah.
I think this clearly illustrates one thing about Todd Rutherford and his website,GettingBookReviews.com:They are a pathetic excuse of a business service with no ethics whatsoever, and even moreso than that, they are a waste of your hard earned money. They have no respect for their customers and they don’t lose any sleep at night over ripping people off and failing to deliver the services they promise to their customers.
The moral of this story is obvious: avoid using this website AT ALL COSTS!!! I don’t think of myself as stupid or gullible, but I suppose we all end up here a few times in our lives, no matter how smart we are. I just wanted to share my experience with others because I think it’s outrageous that they can just do this and get away with it, while disrespecting their customers and showing no shame at all. 
Todd Rutherford is a SCAMMER!!!! sorry, …allowing you to give a competitors name would instigate others to just file against their competition, to only come back later to suggest their company, ..plus, if you post a competitors name more than likely they will show up on search engines as a Rip-off! - - your comments on this policy are welcome.

										Got a call from Jayme at Consumer Base offering their email marketing services to drive some business. We purchased 10,000 email addresses which they said they would send for us.I didn't read the complaints online about Consumer Base until after the contract had been signed (Sigh). The campaign was a total bust. Results showed 113 ""Estimated Opens"", out of 10,908 emails deployed. Out of the 113 opens, 27 actually clicked and went to our web site. That's 27 out of 10, 908, a whopping .24%. We are running a hunting apparel sale and have had really good responses from our other mailings. I assigned a different coupon code to this promotion so I would be able to track sales. To date, Consumer Base has generated ZERO sales. What a TOTAL waste of money. Looks like the other complaints are justified. I complained and received this response. I have to laugh at the part that says, ""We are unable to guarantee the conversion rate"". Seems like 0% is common with them...What we are trying to do with email based marketing is to drive the traffic to your site hoping to help the increase of your ROI. However, just as it is the case with every and any advertisement technique we are not able to guarantee the conversion rate, in other words, we can bring a visitor to your site but we cannot make him/her purchase your products or services. One should be aware that there are many factors that will influence a conversion rate, such as the content of the webpage that the email deployment recipient has been sent to, an incentive offered for anybody who makes a purchase or leaves his/her information, the overall content and the setup on the website (if it is an easy site to navigate through, get all the info etc).

										Got email from PCH telling me that I needed to respond as a winner would be announced August 31, 2005 definitely.  Again, it states on there that no purchase is necessary.  Click on to complete your entry and it takes to a ""corporate letter"" from Ellen Linmar stating that they have no record of me ordering from them online.  
I do not have to order, but here's my chance if I wanted to.  I click to continue my registration (as their usual sites do) and it takes me to an order screen for magazines.  At the bottom of this screen it still tells you no purchase necessary and has a submit button.
Click the button and it tells me that I have not placed an order.  In order to get past the dang thing you have to place an order. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE NO PURCHASE NECESSARY?  Any way on the order page it also says that if I fail to respond to this bulletin then I forfeit all prizes that may have been awarded to me.
Called the PCH at 1-800-645-9242.  Gal there said that all their stuff is no purchase necessary.  She referred me to 1-800-476-4724 stating that since it is an online thing, that is a completely different division.
Called the second number only to reach a closed office!, hmm? RIPOFF!!!!

										Have you heard of this company? CityGrid? They are taking advantage of unsuspecting business owners like you every day. How are they doing this? The company claims to help you advertise your business, by asking you to pay to list your company on their directory. Once youve paid a minimum of $319 to post the listing, you are told they will drive traffic to your listing which will help your business grow. This high number leads you to believe this will seriously benefit your business, that only larger businesses with more advertising money can actually afford to pay this and really take advantage of this... So as a small business owner, you are looking for some credibility and want to help your business grow, you have a quality product or service, so you want your phones to wring or the emails to start coming in. So you put aside some funds towards things like this that would help your business grow. You bite the bullet and pay to get your company listed, little do you know-- you are about to get sucked into a nightmare that could cost your business everything. One month goes by and you check results, you visit their website and on your shiny new profile you see that a handful of people have been viewing your little profile, but not nearly enough for the amount of money you paid. Surely they visited your website? Looking at the Google Analytics tracking you included on your site, you notice that not a single visitor has come to your website. Furious at the poor results, you decide to cancel your listing and request that a refund be given due to poor performance. Unfortunately your emails go unheard, so now its time to call support. Upon calling you are told that you cannot cancel until the end of your next billing period. You say this is ridiculous and that they should cancel the account immediately, its insulting how much you paid and how bad the results are. They say you didnt complete your profile, but you have 99% of what is up and posted. They say this isnt how IT works, you have to wait until the next billing period before you can cancel. You ask them politely to please cancel your account now and refund you. They repeat the same thing over and over... they can refund you and cancel your account as soon as the end of the billing period comes. So you foolishly take his/her word for it simply tired of fighting. When the next cycle comes, your bank account shows yet another $319 has been debited, you call and say you would like to cancel your account now, and you fight for your money, but unfortunately nobody is on your side. By signing up to the service you agreed to pay them $350 for cost per click ads on their advertising network that supposedly send people to your profile that you have no proof that these people even visited or exist, since the stats are all provided by CityGrid. Finally another billing cycle goes by and you are charged another $319. Youve asked the credit card company to stop allowing any payments and they are happy to comply. But CityGrid is not, they want to steal more of your money, so they start sending debt collectors your way. Thankfully you told the bank about this and youve only paid $319 more than you should have. But now CityGrid claims you owe them. Without my effort to fight the last two bills, I am told I would have had to pay them over $1000 for them to have done absolutely nothing for me except give me grief and waste my time. When you start a business you need as much help as you can get, you need people on your side who can support you and help you grow. I now have debt collectors calling me and calling my credit card company telling them that I owe money and ruining my credit score, all because I signed up for a shitty service that did nothing for me and because they refused to cancel my accont and refund me for such a poor performing service. Im putting up this website to help warn others of this terrible scam of a company, so that you may not have to go through this ordeal as I have, I wish the best for your companies success, and hope you dont have to fall into the trap as I have done. I wish there was more that can be done, but unfortunately companies like this go about their scammy ways unchecked, and from what I can tell things like this are only going to be more common in the future.Do not use the services of this company, you will be sorry. If you wish to inquire about the accuracy of this account, please contact me at contact@citygridreview.com - I will happily provide proof of all accounts. If you have had the same experience, I urge you to write a report here as well right now.									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

My name is Jason. I hired Jose Figueroa from the internet. His web site is http://www.jfigphotodesigns.info. He was such a sweet person on the phone and we trusted him. He send us an estimate of 1800.00. We sent him 900 dollars as a deposit. Well after 2 weeks we did not hear anything from him. Their phone number on their web site is bogus, it does not connect you to anything and my emails were ignored. So basically they take your money and give you nothing in return. Do NOT do business with these or this person, you WILL get ripped off.

										Here is the partial letter I received from Constant Contact compliance Department on August 27:
<<______,
Your account, login name: ""______"", has received an unacceptable rate of spam reports.  Our guideline for complaints is 1 per 1000 emails delivered. Your last email produced over 1 abuse complaints on just 84 emails delivered.  
Additionally the account is being cancelled due to non-compliance with the terms of service of your Constant Contact account. The industry in which your organization operates is not compliant with the content policy outlined in our terms of service."">>
After being with this company for a year and not even using there services since last May I wrote back. I then received a phone call about my letter. The person I spoke to offered to keep me as a client but couldn't guarantee I would not be tossed at a latter time.  According to their stats, (and I have no doubt) my business has a high number of them.  So rather than waste any more time or money on this and because I should not have even been allowed to use their services in the first place, I asked for a full refund. I thought that was a small price to pay for all the time and money I had spent learning and training someone to use this system. He explain that because I had used the service I was not entitled to a full refund.  However, according to their TOS my particular business category was not even supposed to have been eligible for services in the first place. 
There TOS Agreement section 5.5 reads as follows:  I have emphasized the part as it pertains to my business:
5.5 Prohibited Content. Constant Contact prohibits the use of the Products or web site by any person or entity that:
Provides, sells or offers to sell any of the following products or content (or services related to the
same): pornography or illicitly pornographic sexual products, including but not limited to magazines,
video and software; escort services; dating services; adult ""swinger"" promotions; illegal goods;
illegal drugs; illegal drug contraband; pirated computer programs; instructions on how to assemble
or otherwise make bombs, grenades or other weapons.  Displays or markets material that exploits children, or otherwise exploits children under 18 years of age......
Revised October 2009  This is a Partial Section 5.5 TOS
Apparently I got ONE spam hit on an email from someone who had to opt in in the first place from the email I sent out back in May. Constant Contact is just now informing me of this?  I'm sure someone just got lazy and didn't want to bother to do the multiple click through it takes to be removed so they just hit spam.  It was also stressed to me that because of section 5.5 I did not meet their requirements to engage in their services? 
So after a 2 month trail period which started back in August of last year, whereupon I immediately enrolled in and which have been auto debiting my CC ever since, I am just now being told my business does not qualify for their services? If their threshold for spam is 1 per thousand emails  then how could I meet their threshold when I only sent out 88 emails? If I'm not an acceptable business then how was I even allowed to engage in their services in the first place? Why did it take them 3 months to cancel me, without any prior warning notice?
After all the money and time I spent learning how to use the product along with the 20+ times I spoke with them, at no time ever did anyone mentioned my business was not acceptable to their TOS standards.  Even though I had been asked by several people, including the sales rep who sold me the service, what type of business I was in I was always happy to explain tell them.  It wasn't like I was trying to hide what I did.  In fact the first mailing I sent through their services during my trial period was an invitation to a speed dating party, which they helped me create! 
So, while the letter from CC indicated they have already refunded August payment they will only agree to additional refund for 2 months of service since I haven't used it since then.  This doesn't  it doesn't come close to a years worth of paid for services, which I am/or wasn't even entitled to in the first place. We won't even talk about all the time I spent away from doing my business just to figure out their program, set up templates and send out the few emails I did. There answer to that is because I used their service they could not refund me. 
They have misrepresented their services, cost me time and money and now have left me with no way of contacting my clients in the same manner as I had been doing. I now have to spend yet more time, to research other services or hire someone who can create emailing templates for doing performing similar tasks. I don't think asking for a full years refund is asking too much here, given the inconvenience and disruption it has caused to my business. 
Buyer be ware: Constant Contact is only out to build their client list and customer base first at the expense of smaller start up business. The sales team was very aggressive. Their tech support wasn't always as knowledgeable about their products as one would expect, and getting through for help always required several attempts. This can be extremely frustrating when youre in the middle of generating an email on deadline.
Personally I would not recommend any company that feels they can have it both ways especially when their competitors do the same thing for less and offer the user to store a larger list before being bumped to higher price level. 
Constant Contact is nothing more than a money hungry corporate big brother organization who because of the canned spam act is so scared to have any spam reports they will cut you off for just getting one. Or perhaps they are just so unorganized they only review these reports randomly.  Not sure which one it is but their definitely not worth the hassle!									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										Hey, just letting everybody know that Emarket is ripoff!  I've called and sent emails to their support service numerous times and had not one response.  I'm supposedly waiting for a PS2 and according to the website, I have completed all the requirments.  I'm sure the place is run by a bunch of cowardly scumbags too scared to respond.  
I should have known.  If you've signed up for one of their scams your only hope is meeting one of these losers on the street and... well, the rest is up to you.

										Hi
Im writting because I recently signed up for Doba Drop Shipping. Thinking ok Im going to make a little bit of money. Seen the wholesale pricing after I Signed up. And I did some research to. Not only online but made phone calls as well. I contacted all the Distributors of products provided by Doba suppliers. And they are truly ripping us off. 
I found companys that manufacturer the items themselves and are selling them at retail that Doba claims to be giving us a 45% discount NOT!!!!!!!!!!! more 10% There customer service is non exsitent, they do nothing for you. But they sure bother you until you sign up. Now I dont ever hear from them. I have brought this up a number of times to Doba they just dont care. In fact they cancelled my account for complaining about it.
 I invested alot of time and money in a web site design and catalog listing all a waste. Every Item I looked at was selling on ebay for less than what I can get it for thru Doba. That tells me they are getting it cheaper somewhere else. I want to sue these SOB's!!!!! for all the time and money I have wasted with this company. They will not let you talk to any supervisor. And they hang up on you. Thats just one supplier!! (CARBON they call it) when in fact they are MimoUSA. 
they are selling there products on there on website at retail for what doba says is wholesale. Which is supposed to be 45% off. So If My MSRP is $989 and my wholesale is $450 and the Manufacturer is sellng for a retail price of $480 were is the 45% off coming from?????? How can I compete with that?????Doba will not do anything for you about any complaint accept take your monthly payments. And if they dont like what your saying they cancel you. CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT ANYONE?????????????

Standford Who's who is a fraud! They phoned me up telling about the advantages of becoming a member and checking that it was so expensive they convinced me to do the basic plan which was  $118.00. I haven't received any payment confirmation and (any email from them after) a month later my statement had been charged $345 in small amount, and I am afraid that they will continue.
I phone them up and and Carla (costumer services) said she cannot cancel my membership once is already paid. They haven't published my profile and even though sent me any confirmation of payment. Now she doesn't answer my phone call! I phone my bank and reported this company but not sure if they can do much. I wish this never happen to you!",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

Dear Player,
Thank you for contacting Acclaim Games, 
I would like to inform you that your current balance for the account -""

If the number of coins are less in  your account than the number of coins deducted, then this deduction makes the balance  in negative. 
Reversal is done by PayPal for various reasons including suspicious activity/fraudulent transactions/ unauthorized/security measures etc. Only PayPal can give you the exact details and reasons for such reversals.
As of  now, your account remains blocked.Please get back to us if you are willing to make a transaction and we would be glad to unblock your account form the website to make the transaction.
As soon as the coins are credited for the new purchase, first of all, the negative balance will be adjusted and the remaining coins can be used by you to purchase Acclaim Cash items.

I hope this clarifies your issue.

										Home Improvement Expo (HIE) is an online contractor lead referral service operating out of Lynbrook, NY.  On November  24, 2008 I entered into a contractual agreement with CIE to become their exclusive Kitchen and Bathroom remodeling contractor In Zip Codes:  07666, 07078, 07076, 07041, 07921, 07924; and their Home Addition and Remodel Contractor in zip codes:07928 and 07940. (Exhibit A)
Within weeks of signing the contract, Erik Buckiewicz acting on behalf of HIE engaged in a practice of phone slamming my assistant and fraudulently charging my credit card, she was panicked over the occurrence and in the course of trying to rectify the situation, he maligned, mocked and taunted her. We protested directly to HIE, emailing the owner Avi Klinger, but it was only after we contested the charge with the credit card company that HIE relented and credited me back for the $800. At the same time we asked that they release us from the contract due to their unsavory business tactics, abusive treatment of my female assistant, and the fact that they had not yet consummated the deal we had made with so much as even one business lead.
They refused to allow us to withdraw and instead held us to the contract and offered to make up for their bad behavior and out and out lies by providing additional exclusive zip codes at no charge; I have attached the email indicating so (exhibit B). HIE further acknowledged that they had refused to honor their pre-contractual promise that once we were a client we would be able to exchange our zip codes at no charge, and offered to now provide this service.
We accepted the free zip codes: 07853, 07945, and 07960 without prejudice to our rights, stating that we intended to further protest the validity of the contract based on their illegal business practices. 
While the issue remains open at this time, we have new information to augment the file which we feel must be considered, additionally please note we have still not received any valid leads from HIE. And if you refer to exhibit A, which is the latest accounting for us, you will see that despite the email from Chris Bahamonde on 12-17-2008 known as exhibit B, the company never followed through with their promise to assign us  Long Valley and Morristown, and none of the three additional zip codes were ever included in our account profile.
Last week a random test of the service revealed that Home Improvement Expo had removed us from their site in all territories, and in our place have been matching other contractors to service requests in our purchased area. When I made online requests for remodeling in the areas I have exclusive contractual rights to through HIE, I was given the name and contact information of another contractor in every Zip Code except for Mendham and the information were simultaneously transmitted to other contractors who called me immediately to provide service! This is a complete breach of the contract terms and I have printed out the lead sheets associated with my test of the service.  (Exhibit C, D, &E)
I have spoken with several of these other contractor's, who called me after receiving the lead I submitted, many of whom had similar or identical experiences with HIE. They volunteered to me that their credits cards had also been  falsely charged, they were promised the same flexible terms prior to contracting with HIE that we were promised, and were also subjected to different terms once under contract. One contractor in Fairfield, NJ indicated that he was given our Zip Codes for free to keep quiet after HIE had mistreated him and he threatened to dispute his contract through the credit card company(Exhibit F). Others said they had bought our zip codes outright. Both circumstances constitute an egregious breach of our contract and should be immediately remedied by a return of our funds.
I have printed out the lead sheets with the other contractor information; they were auto generated at the time I made the service requests in my territories. I would note that after Home Improvement Expo became aware that we had tested the service and unearthed their latest criminal act, they called my office and threatened to sue us for filing test leads in our own territory, then had their attorney, Greg Stohller call and request our attorneys contact information, and then they immediately began reprogramming our contact information into their lead referral system so further contractor inquiries are now redirected back to us.
This organization is no better than a band of thieves, and from  what other contractors involved with them expressed openly to me, I am not alone in that sentiment. The language these men were using to describe their account representatives was vulgar and there was anger in their voices, all described having been duped or ripped off, some for eight and ten thousand dollars.
The facts speak for themselves, we purchased exclusive territories for a fee of $2000 and Home Improvement Expo has resold the exact same areas at additional profit, and reassigned them at their discretion, this is a breach of contract, and we should be credited back immediately. I would expect this happen swiftly and will be happy to provide any additional information you may need as well as the names of other contractors who are willing to make their own statements to that end.
I would love to hear from others who have had bad experiences, please visit our informational site at http://www.homeimprovementexposucks.com

										House Values  is the ultimate Ripoff/scam.  They scam realtors by making them believe they have quality leads,names of people wanting to buy or sale residential real estate. House Values gets these name by advertising, mostly on national TV that they will let a owner know the value of their house, or if not an owner listings of all the houses that are available in the area the viewer wants. 
House Values  then tells  realtors, that for a fee it will sell them quality leads names of people ready to do real estate transactions. It is all high pressure, you have to decide now.  These leads are not people ready to do a transaction. They are junk leads, fake names, people phishing,who don't know their name has been sold to a realtor. In some cases they are other realtor pretending they are buyers or sellers. the realtor does not know this and has to enter into a one year contract. They promised me that 1 of 10 leads would generate an immediate sale and they would provide 10 leads per month. Most months they didn't provide 10 leads and no months did any become sales most were just junk leads, that it took countless hours to work sending out listing and correspondence to try to get the business. After they maxed out my credit card at $250.00 per month $2,750.00 I would not give them another card now they are threating suit to get another $500.00. Realtors stay away from House Values. The Kirkland, Washington, Better Business Bureau  (BBB) reports that in this year alone, it has had more than 178 scam complaints against House Values.

The reality: they take your money through papal (which can do little to nothing about it) and RIP YOU OFF!
Again I say ______________----------
This is the website - do not give them money as they are only there to RIP YOU OFF... There are a couple of fake persons that will answer an email here or there if you contact them through support@digitallinkpoint.com but it is all a front to take your money. 
They claim to offer lots of SEO services and the like but there is nothing to their claim.  IT is a scam website.  Please take it from me do not waste your money as Paypal will not help you to get it back.  Paypal is as bad as the scam sites when it comes to restitution as they will not hunt the money down for you OR shut down the scammers accounts and IP addresses.

										Hy my name is Joseph on December 15th of 2008 I got a call from an individual by the name of Charles Howe who talked to me about starting a home made business. He talked to me about making for 3 to 10 thousand dollars a month. By the way the phone to this scammer is 1(800) 4058582 ext: 1054. So to keep the story going after asking me many questions to qualify he refer me to this other scammer in which I consider scammers by the name of Chandler Ridding his ext is 1094.  After a long talk he told me the same things other people on my position has been told. In a month you are going to have a site going and make allot of money plus you are going to have your own web designers to help you design your site. (YEA bull crap) he never mentioned the 3 day money back guarantee that others got, but still got scammed like me. So to continue Mr. Ridding asked me to give a 1500 dollar down payment in which to be honest is where I consider myself stupid for giving in and I did. Then Using a accounting service called Universal account servicing I took a 4000 dollar loan. Now when I started everything seem soo different from what this scammer told me. I hardly got any help from the coaches, I definitely never got web designers help. And it seems I was spending more and more money plus they teached me wrong strategies such as one time I asked this coach How to get a security seal and he told me the following ""Just copy and paste the picture from google thats what I do."" Yea what a copy right infringement is this, from there I got a clue that this company is not legitimate. So I realize this cost I paid is not worth it. I called and asked for a refund and they responded in inappropriate manner saying "" You have to pay us no matter what.""  Whats funny is that I did an investigation on this thiefs by going to bbb.org stands better business bureau http://www.bbb.org/ and wrote in summit group.  Now go under summit group of Utah and see their rating its a D plus which that should be an F. Most of all is not an bbb accredited company. By the way whenever you try to call them they hardly answer the phone due to the fact that they know they are doing a wrong deed to honest citizens.  I have filed an FTC report and know I'm talking to my bank.    So who ever suffered from this decrepit thiefs please email me at jospin@bresnan.net and from there I can give you my contact number if needed.

										I also had high hopes of making money through the e-currency exchange profits system until I ran into a question with one of the videos.  I called and left a message for a call back and Carlos twice called back at the end of the day, when I wasn't available.  I realize that was probably only because it was within the 45 day money back period, but looking at other comments I doubt I would've received it.  I've submitted tickets, left messages, you name it.  The videos aren't as easy as they make it to understand in regards to wire transfers and digots.  I even signed on for the cool new business (sucker!) and can't even find my website.  Since no one will answer my questions, I'm doomed.

										I am a single parent of five, and was looking for information on obtaining a credit card, and next thing I notice is a charge of $149.00 on my bank statement and the bank did say that they would have to wait to see what the charge is for and then they could and would reverse the charges, it has never been done, and I have been in the negative on my checking account since then, I am on a very strict budget and can't have any anonymous charges showing up on my account. I contacted Consumer Trust Financial and asked them who and what they were, and they basically told me that I would have to deal with it, because i signed up for their card, and to this day I do not have a credit card from them. I am really upset and would like something done so no one else who is struggling won't have to deal with people who are just ripping them off, and does not have any intent on helping them.
Rhonda
Sugarhill, GeorgiaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										I am also one of the many that has been ripped off by this company named Product Research Panel a.k.a. too many aliases to name. 
I completed the offer for the Dell Inspiron 1000 many months ago and have run into problems in every attempt to remedy this.  I sent the voucher in numerous times and received no response until I found this site and started calling the various numbers on this site.  I have only received a response from customer service twice.
The first time, someone named ""Eddie"" called me and told me that there was a computer problem and that they had actually received my voucher and I did qualify and the laptop would be sent out in three to four weeks.  Eddie called and left a message on my machine, which I still have, saying it would be shipped in a few weeks and the company also e-mailed me stating the same. 
I gave it six weeks to be safe.  After not receiving it,I began calling and e-mailing again and did not get any response other than talking to the receptionist at the above number and who would take a message and tell me that someone would get back to me in three to five days.  
After looking at this site, I decided to threaten filing a complaint against them and once again called the office and gave a message saying that I was filing.  Someone called me within three hours saying, again, computer problems and they were sorry, blah, blah, blah. 
This time it was ""Jimmy"" I talked to.  Jimmy told me he would get me a tracking number in a day or two and I should receive the laptop in one or two weeks at the latest.  I told Jimmy that I wanted both phone and e-mail confirmation and he told me no problem.  That was three weeks ago and I have yet to receive any phone or e-mail message and still have no laptop.  
I decided to file a complaint with the IFCC, Florida AG, and Palm Beach Consumer Protection.  I also figured I should write my own rip off report to share my experience. 
My experience is not unique, rather it is the same one you will see on this site from this company and its many aliases.  So, as of right now I am waiting to see what happens with my complaints and to see if anything comes of them.  I'm not counting on it, but we'll see.

										I am another victim,one of many thousands of  this operation. We had seen his commercials for a long time and in fact it is reportedly the longest running informercial of its type. 
We are in need of a new computer so we checked out the products  which were being advertised. I thought I did my homework and thorougly checked out Micron and couldn't find any significant 
problems. 
I ordered a unit and all the extras for $1896.00 in early March 01. Several weeks later our local TV station WBRE  ran a consumer alert on VCS .   
The next day I tried unsuccessfully to cancel and found the attorney generals site from PA and saw where he had sued for just about every reason imaginable. 
The next day Video Computer Store  files bankruptcy. I began to 
do more investigations on this company and have found complaints going back almost two years. The company is run by a man named George Capell who also apparently is involved with other companies D2TV  and direct to you tv.  
I have filed a complaint with the PA Att GEN  and will be filing a claim with the PHIL BANK Court. I have also called the FBI today although they are not involved they are aware of the problem. What irks me so much  is that this guy wasn't even registered in PA to do business, advertised Micron  computers 
and Micron did nothing to discourage them  even though I have email from them stating they no longer do business  with them because of lack of payment. 
The fact that so many people dropped the ball on this ,I feel the govt should make restitution if VCS cannot. The more I look the more I see that the computer industry needs far more regulation than the used car market. There is just so much bait and switch, internal componants arent what they're supposed to be, they are not matched properly, there is little real 
knowledgable help for tech support and the list goes on and on. What is worse there isn't any place to turn.									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										I am at this point royally ticked off with this company. now, as I did pay them with Credit Card, $100.00 U.S. funds to have a Web Page setup, thinking that I was going to make money even if I do not do anything further. Then I find out later, that all the advertising and pop under ads etc. cost extra. I was not informed of the extra amounts of money that I need to spend in order to have my web page advertised. 
Now to further ad to this, I am from Canada, and I was seeking a reliable company that would be able to do all the Web Page work for me as well as advertising.
I became suspicious when the different Silver and Gold packages seemed to be more of a focus to this company, and trying to get me to buy into it further.
I went into my website at stageoneonline.com that they setup, using a back door in their server system, and made a copy of all the information related to the structure of the site altogether.
The coding and design of the site was not put together by World Market Systems, it is in fact designed by a 3rd party company, which World Market Systems had purchased on a plan bases, and implemented these so called ID numbers that link to the person who bought the plan. These sites are all identical. The advertising is done by cues. All the agent needs to do is type my ID number in their system and it automatically cues either 1000, 5000, 10,000 e-mails, or pop unders etc.
Also.. the advertising is done by: Traffic Designs at: (((Redacted)))which is another 3rd party company.
If you are already with World Market Systems, and are making the money they promised, well then God Bless You.. But chances are, they are making the money off of you.Beware..This is a Company that Hooks you into a Website, but then in order to make it work, they need more money to Advertise it. And then you won't see a nickel of profit.

I submitted 2 rebate forms. The process is complicated, requiring filling out online information, printing out more info and sending in. 
After not receiving $25 in rebates, I called and was told I did not sign the forms. While this was true, given that the submission required an online registration, there could have been an email note to me about the error. Or, as good companies as JVC do, a way to resubmit.
Instead I was told there was absolutely nothing they would or could do, since I made a mistake.

										I am reporting An Seo Company, based in Perth, Austalia. 
Here is their website - An Seo Company - http://anseocompany.com.au/
My friend and myself were scammed from their ""seo service"". The owner, who calls himself Bob Jones, is one of the most unprofessional and arrogant guys I have ever come across.
We decided to use one of their services a couple of months ago, in the hope that we would get on the ""first page of Google"" on their website. To our shock and amazement there was no ""movement in the search engines"" as their staff constantly ""promised"" over the phone. So after numerous attempts to contact the owner it was also bought to our attention that the owner has a double life - he keeps a blog about certain people online who he has had ""wars"" and likes to launch personal verbal attacks on them. [continued below]....
									
										.....
Here is the link to his blog - www.bobjones.nl.
Please stay away from this company. They have a number listed on their website which forwards to another phone. They will not answer the phone, or bother to pick up. Bob Jones will happily take your money and scam you but he will not provide you with the promises. 
The services that they list on their website promise big things but they do not deliver their word. I have been lied to by this company and the $2000 that I paid for from my pocket has now been wasted. I have had no choice but to report An Seo Company and their owner, Bob Jones to Rip Off Report. I will be happy to post more details on them soon.
I have already decided to take legal action against An Seo company and I strongly advise you not to fall for the fake testimonials on their website. The owner has had a history of using fake reviews by using sites such as Fiverr and Odesk to pay people to post a review.
This company will not fulfil their promises and they are simply out to steal your money. The owner Bob Jones will not bother to reply to your emails :( He starts threatening you and threatens to blog about individuals on his blog. This guy needs to be stopped before innocent people are scammed.
I urge anyone not to use this service and report him to the relevant authorities before it is too late.

										I am the Director of Operations for a local Pay Per Call company. We had contractual agreement with Medicquire to drive quality drug rehabilitation calls. Terms were a 60 or 90 second connect and payment of $40 or $75 for a qualified call. 
Over a 3 week span we drove 385 qualified calls ($20,000+) to Medicquire. Like all call companies we record our calls. Much to our chagrin Medicquire was having its' operators take a phone number from the caller, disconnecting and calling them back to avoid the call qualifier. This occurred roughly 90% of the time. Needless to say when Medicquire was confronted about the issue, they went radio silent or parlayed ridiculous excuses. They have been sent to collections, but I am certain this will need to be written off as bad debt since these dead beats have no intention of paying.

										I am writing this in frustration.  I signed up for a $1.00 free trial of NICK MARKS Rapid Business Growth Magazine and DVD and cancelled it the day before the month was up.  I got charged $39.95 plus $11.95 postage in January and tried to email the company to let them know I had been charged in error - My mail was returned saying their inbox was full so I tried the website and did actually get confirmation that my subscription had been cancelled.  
I then got billed again in February and called them - I was bluntly told I had to contact my bank to organise a refund so I have lodged a dispute.  This is now March and I have been billed yet again and all of my emails over the last two months still keep coming back.  I tried to call them again today, 28th of March and got a support person on the phone and was cut off.
I am angry and frustrated and would like to warn other people not to deal with this company.  They are impossible to email and their telephone support stinks - plus they keep on charging you.  If you are considering signing up with them, my advice is DON'T

										I am writing this post in disgust towards AnSeoCompany.com.au who scammed me recently for a social media job. The owner Bob Jones was on the phone to me offering me a free consultation but little did I realise that he signed me up to a pyramid scheme that involved me shelling out $500 a month for simply a single website. 
Here is their website http://www.AnSeoCompany.com.Au and they are based in Perth, Australia. 
They call themselves an SEO company in Perth, but they should be called Criminals in Perth.
Here is Bob Jones Facebook page where he constantly talks about people.https://www.facebook.com/anseocompany
Here is his website where he often blogs about random people he meets from Internet chat rooms; thus making false stories up in the process. [continued below]....
									
										.....http://www.bobjones.nl
I called Bob up a few times asking him to cancel this service but here was his reply.
Bob: You knew what you was signing up for. I have many clients, please dont waste my time.
Me: Cancel my account, I didnt ask for this.
Bob: Tough. We do not really offer refunds, please note that after 12 months your membership plan expires. I have lots of work to do and I am very busy. 
*Click*.
He hung up. After a dozen phone calls to his company and calling his office number I was amazed to find a voice mail service. To my dismay he keeps blogging about his customers and is launching vicious attacks on anyone who wants their money back.
Guys, I honestly want you to avoid doing any business with Bob Jones, of AnSeoCompany.com.au because he will suck you like a leech.
He blames his problems on other people as he is a well known former chat room addict.
You have been warned to stay away from this company.

										I am writing this report to warn all individuals of Shoy Computer and Evolution Financial Services. The owner of Shoy is the same person that didn't ship computers to customers of Financing Alternatives Inc. (Please read all reviews posted regarding Walt or Walter Pollard - Kurt Dinkelacker - Michael J Shrader - Javier Palomarez - and Steve or Stephen Hamilton.
FAI withdrawled money from customer accounts and never sent those people computers. Shoy Computer and Evolution Financial (Americaspurchaseprogram.com) is the exact same programs as FAI had, run by the exact same people that screwed everyone at FAI. Evolution Financial Services was started up by the CFO Kurt Dinkelacker, while he was *supposed* to be taking care of FAI, instead of competing. FAI has since been sued and put out of business by the State Attorney General of VA. Evolution is not far behind.
Pay-o-matic in New York City is letting Michael Shrader and Kurt Dinkelacker use their stores to take more peoples money.  If Payomatic don't know about Michael Shrader and Kurt Dinkelacker they should.  These two ran Financing Alternatives for TWO years and didn't ship alot of people.  These two, with Walt Pollard paid a lot of insiders big money- and now they all started a new company called Evolution- and they are living on money they took from FAI- while they were putting together another company behind everyone's back- including the attorney general (who did not know) and the owner of FAI they were supposed to be covering all the bases for.  BAD BAD BAD mojo- those guys got it coming.  Hopefully PAYOMATIC hears about their bad business- GOOGLE them- This is a PATTERN.  
DO NOT put any money towards these company. TEll PAYOMATIC TO STOP ASSISTING THESE GUYS WHO SCREWED A LOT OF PEOPLE.  Tell them to do a background- a good one- on Shrader and Dinkelacker.  Ask about IKON or SPECTRUM. Big companies especially honest and ethical ones- don't deal with people they know are like this.  Let Payomatic know a few little stores testing what these guys stole from FAI is not worth it.  They don't want the publicity.
PAYOMATIC headquarter number is 718-778-4300
Kurt Dinkelacker somehow got a new job as CFO at RETRIEVEX.  Not sure if Mr Pierce know the facts either.  If you look at Kurt's resume on RETRIEVEX- no mention of Evolution Financial (big secret) and not a peep about nearly two years at Financing Alternatives Inc IN CHARGE OF THE MONEY WITH 1765 CUSTOMERS PAID INTO COMPUTER BUT NO MONEY LEFT BY KURT TO PAY FOR THEM. (KURT NEVER MISSED HIS OWN PAY $200K) NOR HAD ANY QUALMS ABOUT A LEISURELY *PAID* VACATION.  THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE MONEY- KURT DINKELACKER ALLOWED IT ALL TO BE SPENT- including loans to insiders and BONUSES.  Bad bad mojo.  Then, develops a new company, while being paid by FAI on payroll, recruits FAI employees, and starts in business while still deciding what to do with FAI customer money.  He's got his coming- can't do what he and Shrader did- not legally not morally not ethically.  He is a CFO he will answer to someone. OR maybe he is not really an accountant after all?  Have we seen credentials?  Hmmm... If you're deally with Kurt- you might want to have a REAL CLOSE LOOK.
Anyway, the money that is made off of it will be more likely put towards legal fees and fines by the courts than towards your computer or tv purchase.
For more information GOOGLE the names listed above.
I can only stress to all who read this, please do not use these company. Do not give your information away.
DANGER, DANGER, DANGER!!!!

PS:  ATTENTION:  Michael Shrader- Kurt Dinkelacker- Walt or Walter Pollard- Steve or Stephen Hamilton- Javier Palomarez- Richard Sawyer (developed Shoy Computer and Evolution Financial business plans using stolen FAI models while on FAI payroll- as  a trusted insider) Ferdinand Jamais, a marketing person who had the common sense to ditch these unethical losers so probably will get a pass, and a few other minor players:
People want you in jail.  People want you in court.  People want YOU on TV.  Your day is coming.  Enjoy your new companies for now.
You cannot promise to protect and manage a person's business (for huge salaries), then ""oops"" run it into the ground, and then ""oops"" accidentally steal the person's business secrets, forms, scripts (didn't change yours quite good enough) employees, FAI data from servers, customer lists, marketing methods, vendor relationships, and inside proprietary information you all only gained by being ""trusted"" insiders and use it for your own profit to the harm of the customer you just screwed over and against the owner who trusted you to do your best.  IT IS AGAINST THE LAW AND YOU WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.  What you allowed to happen to FAI customer, in the end benefits you personally?  Not cool.
Your choices will forever be connected to your name in as many places- and in front of as many people as is possible.  This will follow you for a LONG LONG time.  What you've done wrong- and a lot of people know EXACTLY what you all did at FAI.  You all are wrong.  Michael, pray about stealing- God will show you it is wrong to take from FAI to TRY to benefit yourself when you're telling others around you including the AG you're staying at FAI and won't fail. People trusted you Michael- and in the end- your true colors came through.  No formal resignation- no apologies- just a quick back door escape to the new business built on the back of FAI and all those customers you screwed.  You failed Michael. If you can't make FAI work- when all the REAL work happened LONG before you arrived- unlikely that you will have success with a model stolen from the one you so miserably failed at- yet take no accountability for.  Funny.  
Walt- putting out resumes, running a yawner called Shoy, buying into a dishonest unethical Evolution. How's that working for ya?  You got some return love coming back atcha real soon.  Just FYI
Everyone who ever does business with any of you will get personal notification about FAI Evolution Telespectrum IKON and in the case of FAI- likely by subpoena for a Federal Lawsuit.  Kurt might actually have to spend more than 2 days a week in Chesapeake, only this time around FAI won't be paying him a full salary for it.
Nothing personal.  Just the facts.  People are beginning to see the REAL truth. Court is a coming...

										I am writing to advise anyone who is considering using the services of NetMediaReps to refrain from doing so. The person who runs this so-called company, Karin Gamble, will woo you in with promises of your advertisement going out to over 600,000 people. She'll tell you how great your ad is, how great your product is, and how great your response will be. 
I let her fool me into believing that what she said was the truth, and paid $350 for my advertisement to go out. I received a grand total of 31 visitors to my website out of that audience of over 600,000, and 5-10 of those hits were the result of me clicking on the ad to try and figure out why her linking code caused my website to take 25x the normal amount of time to load. 
It's more than obvious that she either lied about the size of her audience, or failed to send the ad out to more than 20 of them. 
So I urge you to not allow yourselves to be scammed the same way that I was. When you are looking for a way to advertise your business, please do yourself a favor, and look elsewhere.
NetMediaReps is a SCAM!

										I am writing to let anyone who works in the lead generation business, particularly in the education vertical, to stay away from Debbie Fiorentino, aka Debbie Usery, and her fraudulent company, Vergo Marketing.We are one of a dozen companies that I know about that provided marketing services to Vergo over the course of 2 years.  In the beginning, we would be paid, albeit late, and albeit a reduced amount because they would reject half of our leads for bogus reasons.  We made the mistake of letting them fall behind on their payments to us.  When we pushed Debbie for payment she would tell us the check was in the mail.  When the check never arrived, she would say she was sending a wire, never mind the check she promised was sent weeks prior.  Debbie Fiorentino the SCAM ARIST and LIAR owes us $75,000 of confirmed invoices that they approved!  She would answer emails maybe once out of every 10 times and shed never pick up the phone.  She has a made up accountant name Jim who strangely never returned an email and has no voicemail.  Now she refuses to reply to any phone call or email altogether and is cowardly avoiding any debt collectors, though Vergo still operates.To anyone who is buying leads from Vergo, know that they dont pay their bills to their actual vendors, they keep all of the money.  In addition, dont believe them when they say they generate their own leads.  Debbie Fiorentino is an absolute liar, cheat, con artist and every name you can think of.  DO NOT DO business with Vergo OR Debbie Fiorentino.  Its people like this that ruins the lead industry and create skepticism among lead buyers. Debbie Fiorentino and Vergo RIPPED US OFF! 									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										I am writing you to find out what you are going to do about crediting out credit card accounts.

I am being very patient with you and do not want to go through the legal process of recovering out money. I am sending you this to let you know I will be sending you a certified letter with ten days notice before I file legal means to get our credit cards credited for the amount you charged us. If all else fails, you do not want me to contact the media and explain how you tried to force two senior citizen Into a contract beyond their means. I want you to do the right thing, but If  you choose not to,  I  will use all legal means to recover our money. I hope you will do the right thing and we do not have to end up In court. We looked at your program after we got it and It just was not going to work out, there was to many expenses we did not know were going to be extra and we are both on fixed income and just don't have the money. I don't even know If we would live to pay off the credit cards. I am 70 and my wife Is 73, both us are on social security and we just spent $5000 for six websites. I will have to pay $25.00 a month and that figures out to $1800 a year for six sites.

St. Albans, West VirginiaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										I applied on line for the Dell preferred credit program-- NO interest until January 2006 for two Dimension 8400.  Only to know that I was not approved for the $5K and that I my order was to be shipped on 1/13/05.  I further than asked questions to the person on the other end (which it was VERY hard to understand they English) and I was told that my credit approved was only for 90 days same as cash.  I asked what happen to the Dell preferred credit program NO interest until January 2006?  I was told that I did not qualified for that, I ask why?  I was never given a reason and I further ask if there was a problem with my credit report in which I was told no!  So, again I asked why?  
After a while I just hanged the phone up because I just could not understand the person on the other line (their English so not very understandable).  I followed up with another call and this time I was able to get someone that I could understand a little better (but still has problems understanding what they were saying).  Still, I was unable to get a reason and no computers were mailed.  The same day I contacted a credit bureau company (a fee of $29.95) and received a full credit report from Equifax, TransUnion and Experian (the same day). 
In accordance's with their report there's ""No Credit problems"" in my history, everything paid on time and with VERY high credit lines from numerous companies.  Some paid off and still some with balances; bottom line is that my credit is good condition.  Called a second party company (which is my credit union that I dealt with for many years) and asked the loan officer was there any problems with my credit.  His reply to me was that my score and credit references was very good!  So I asked the Dell person ""What is the problem with my credit.""  
He told me that I was approved for $5000.00 and I can use it, but only for 90 days (same as cash), but I did not qualified for 12 months interest free.  This MAKES NO SENSE TO ME AT ALL!  Some computer makes up the credit scores and this is how Dell qualifies you for the preferred credit program in accordance's with one emails that I recevied from a Dell Customer Support Rep. (named: Tina Charles) in the Dell Financial Services L.P.
My two computer orders are on hold until we resolve this issue, which now I am thinking of filing a complain with the State of North Carolina Attorney General's Office and also under The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) if It qualifies.
I believed that this company has this bait (as I called it); 12 months--Dell preferred credit program, NO interest until January 2006, for consumers to get hook on and then order their computers, only to be hit with this HIGH interest rates.  What a Rip-off, especially in this country, America, where we are known for Right and Justices.  But, I feel that I was not granted the Dell preferred credit program--NO interest until January 2006, because my credit lines were paid on tie or before time!  So, in order words, the company has nothing to gain from me!    
My suggest to others, leave DELL Computers alone and go with Gateway. Maybe they might be better in this department.  I purchased a few computers from them in the past and they stood behind their products, services and their purchased orders to include any programs that were in their web site.  I went to Dell because, we in our office (federal government) are purchasing so many computers from Dell, I figure they were good; also they have a employee purchase program for Federal/local government.  But I know better now, so those employees out there for the federal/local government BEWARE and don't be taken by these folks! 
If I can attached all my email from DELL, I'll will.  I have nothing to hide.

										I attended a free 2 day seminar about internet marketing.  It was terrific, useful info.  But then I got sucked in (they use a very persuasive promotional 30 min. speech) to buying their $9000 mentor program.  I WAS PROMISED THAT I WOULD LEARN HOW TO BUILD A WEBSITE AND ADD ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES TO IT. THAT I NO LONGER WOULD BE HELD HOSTAGE BY A WEB DESIGNER...
What i got were 6 months (60 minute/week appointment with an assigned ""mentor"") of how to use wordtracker.com and excel  to find a suitable--one that makes money--internet business.  Finding an internet topic is very very difficult. I spoke to other IMC mentor students and they said they had the same problem.
 We spent 3 of the 6 months on this step.  I finally decided on a topic that might work.  When i complained about not learning about web design as i had been promised i got 2 seessions on how to use a free website builder and a quick review of Dreamweaver.  Nothing about e-commerce other than you need it, no how to add stuff.
Around the 4th month I asked about my free website that should have been started earlier.  I was told that the free website was not included.  
Turns out that my $9000 account was mislabeled in their computer to NOT include the free website that was part of the $9000 package.  This took several weeks to get fixed.
Oh, yeah, in the beginning, i did NOT receive any emails after the first one.  It seems my email address had gotten   ""blacklisted"".  It took me a week or so to get my email address ""whitelisted"".
Eventually I received an email with links to several products included in the $9000 package--eBook Pro, Hover Ad, Associate Trac, etc.  All useless software, that proved extremely difficult to use.  There were many CDs of success stories--boring and not very informative.
With my $9000 pkg i has 6 months access to the Secrets to Their Success private membership site.  Each month they had 3 very long stories (about 40 pages each or more)about how a handful of the thousands of customers actually were able to use IMC stuff and make money--$2000/month maybe.
These stories were too long to read in one sitting and i was unable to find the necessary 3 hrs or more each to read them while i was busy with the mentor program.  Finally towards the end of the 6 months i saw that there was some info to be had, but the prior months stories had been removed.  They were archived somewhere, thou.  After 6 months i was unable to get into the stories at all.
All in all this is a poorly run company.  The mentor was nice enough but did not give me any information that was not already included in the $197 IMC manual.  Read this manual, follow it, save $9000 on the mentor program.
Once the mentor program was over you have limited access to him to get your questions answered.  Mentor had moved on to a new batch of suckers. 
Customer service was difficult to get thru to.  After a few minutes on hold you get forwarded to an operator that takes your number for a call back.  It never happened.  I finally sent an irate message to the mentor who had someone call me back.
My total experience was an extreme waste of money and time.  My advice: DO NOT BUY THEIR MENTOR PROGRAM OR THEIR SOFTWARE.  There is better software out there--Adobe pro for ebooks, a decent shopping cart--i use 1shoppingcart.com which includes autoresponders and hover ads/popups in your monthly cost and a great customer service dept that you can easily reach.
Don't bother with the Internet Marketing Center other than attending a free seminar and/or buying their ""Insider Secrets to Marketing a business on the internet"", written by Corey Rudl around $200.  I bet Corey is rolling in his grave watching what has happened to his company.

										I attended a webinar on the 13th Oct. 2012 and paid for listlaser pro from Sterling Valentine. He spoke as if his list building program would be able to make squeeze pages for one's website. It turns out that he only had a few squeeze pages in specific niches, none of which I am in and would not want to get in. Also in the package I was meant to get access to his secret group. I was given access to this group 3 months later. It is called marketerlink.com. 
Shortly after I paid for the membership I got an email with this info in it: 
We're going to be sending you more info during the next 24-48 hours, once I get the info I need from Jason.
Return that to us asap because we're going to do a special webinar just for all the folks who purchased today.
You'll be able to get all your questions answered, and I won't leave the webinar until you're satisfied and you've gotten the answers you need.....

Two days later on the 15th October I recieved the same email again but this was a Monday, so there should not have been a weekend excuse! I also got another email trying to sell me another program. 
I filled out the long and detailed registration form and did not hear back from him until 28th Oct with another ""offer"" for a video making course. 
Then on the 10th November I got a heartfelt email saying that he had experienced a dreadful experience with a hurricane and apologised for not taking care of his customers and promised to start sending out every day free ""Actually Helpful Stuff"" and keeping more in contact with his customers.  The next day the 11th Nov. I got an email offering some ""Actually Helpful Stuff"" the free report that came with the offer on the 28th October  No other ""Actually Helpful Stuff"" ever came. On the 13 Nov I got an email offer to buy yet another program called the PLR shuffle. 
I then got several times a week for the next 6 weeks invitations to attend a webinar to join a program guaranteed to get me 500 subscribers and other other webinars offering to make me over $1,000 every week. I attended 3 of these before realising that they were all adverts for his new program Turbo Team 90. I signed up and paid for the advertised Turbo Team 90 program on the 24th Dec 2012. This cost 3 x $97. On the webinar he stated that this was a 90 day program that he was running before his live event in New York in April. He said it was a highly discounted personal course that he would use as info and statistics to present at his live event. He announced that the member with the best results would be given an all expences paid trip to the Live event in NY in April and be invited to give a talk. I was very inspired by this and this was one of the main reasons I signed up for the program. 
On the 20th nov. he sent an email offering to give a few lucky subscribers 100% resale rights to his newest course. We were told to submit a support ticket requesting this. I did and got no reply to it. 
On the 13th Dec I got an email with this: As part of your auction webinar purchase of the List Laser Mega-Pack, I'm going to need to speak with you briefly about setting up the traffic campaign part of your package for you.
There was nothing about the private group marketerlink.com. I arranged a time to speak with him on Skype but he cancelled it after a few minutes as I had no idea what we should be talking about as I still had not access to listlaser.com or marketerlink.com  The reason I had not complained about this lack of info was that I had been very ill since buying the package on Oct. 13th and did not notice the lack of info. 
On the 3rd Jan and the 8th Jan I recieved requests to fill out the long and detailed registration form for Turbo Team 90 which I did. On 11th Jan I tried to get access to listlaser.com but could not even get access to the free membership as it never accepted the password. Even trying multiple times to reset the password. 
On the 16th Jan I received an email saying that Turbo Team 90 group coaching would be launched the next night 17th Jan. on a live webinar. I was unable to attend as my son was very ill. I later heard from members who did attend that it was plagued with technical faults and not much was spoken and no questions were answered. Members had still not received any info about the program. We were meant to have a schedule, access to the course, given an accountability partner, (another reason I signed up for the program).
I wrote a support ticket on the 22nd Jan here are my questions and the replies:  
Tue, Jan 22 2013 4:11am
Hi Sterling, I was unable to attend the opening session of the Turbo 90 due to illness in the family, but I have no other info. No schedule, website, anything? I have filled out the registration form twice now. 
I left a message for you on Skype yesterday and got no reply all day so then tried to get on lazer list, could not would not accept my password. Then tried password reset and nothing came. 
Anyhoo! I am really desperate to get going with Turbo 90 and am keen to be picked to attend the live workshop in april, it will be awesome :)

Hi Pauline, A recording of the webinar you missed will soon be available. We will notify you as soon as it is. We have reset your ListLaser password for you. Here are your login details:
Wed, Jan 23 2013 7:09am
Hi Sterling. I not received yet any info on Turbo 90. On the register page it says:  As we get closer to our start date, you will be receiving the following:
1) The schedule of our group coaching/mastermind sessions with registration links
2) Your 90-day action plan calendar
3) Access to our community site at MarketerLink.com
4) Instructions on how to track your 90 day progress
5) Info on the accountability partner part of the program
6) Some REALLY COOL unadvertised bonuses and perks Ill tell you more about that soon!
I really want to get started with this program but so far, there only seems to have been the opening session on the 17th that I missed. Can you please send me schedule, access to the masterlink.com community and all the other stuff as soon as possible. 
I filled out the registration form in detail on the 4th Jan but on the 8th Jan I got a message saying that you had not received it yet. I filled it out again, but I think perhaps you have not received that also or I would have been sent the info about my accountablity partner and the the other stuff. 
If you  need me to fill out the application form again I can do so and make a copy of it to post here so that you definately get it. Looking forward to catching up with the program as soon as I get the details.

Hi Sterling, I finally was able to get access to listlazer.com and was confused when I saw that all the squeeze funnels were about online marketing. I thought I would be able to choose my own topic. The niche I am going into is .......... It does not look as if this is the right program for me, but I want to hear your expert opinion. 
BTW I still don't have access to marketerlink.com it is asking for an activation key, which has not been sent to me or the Turbo 90 program. It is 1.30am here in Iceland and I am waiting up to hear your weekly live Q&A webinar. Hopefully you can answer my questions there. 
Thu, Jan 24 2013 4:50am - Sharleen G.
Hi Pauline, We checked from our end and saw that your MarketerLink account has already been activated. Please try it out on your end then let us know how you get on. Did you get to join the webinar? Were you able to ask Sterling your questions?
Mon, Jan 28 2013 4:43am
Hi Turbo 90 has been running for 12 days now and I still have not received any information about it. The only thing I have is access to marketerlink but no: (see 6 items listed above)
On the 22nd you said that there would be a recording of the opening session but I still have not received that. I did manage to ask Sterling my questions online and he said he would answer them but I have not heard back from him. Basically I was dissapointed that the squeese pages were preset and not in any niche I am in. 
I have paid for the Turbo 90 and the list lazer but so far have not been able to use either of them. I am also having a problem getting back into marketerlink. It keeps asking for an activation code, which was never sent to me. I did get in somehow but now it keeps rejecting my password and even if I reset it, it keeps rejecting it. 
this is all very fraustrating. I was hoping to get really into the Turbo 90 training but there has been no info. I really wanted to have an accountability partner. I have been so inspired with the webinars that Sterling has given and attended several of them staying up to the wee small hours in (my time zone). Sadly I am getting no info or feedback. I am thinking therefore that if I don't get the info soon, then I will just ask for a full refund, but I would really like to have been given the info as I am sincere in my desire to get my business up and running.
------- end of support messages
I finally got access to marketerlink.com on the 23rd January 2013 and noticed that a couple of members where asking if anyone had heard anything about Turbo 90. I replied telling them that I too had got no info. over the next couple of weeks I discovered that there were at least 4 of us who had received no info about Turbo 90. I wrote perhaps 3 or 4 replies altogether and made only one post myself asking for any postive testimonies from any member regarding Turbo 90. No one replied to it. I sent personal messages via that site to 2 members telling them more of my story and one of them told me that she too had been treated badly with Turbo 90 and another program. We both had not heard from Sterling in almost 2 weeks. We decided to make a paypal compaint to get our fees returned. 
That same night after we had both put in our complaints to paypal we were finally given info on the 6th February 2013 as to where the Turbo Team 90 site was and told that Sterling had been trying to get in contact with us to let us know the address of the site.  The site contained a short intro video, some bonuses of recordings he already had and all the Turbo Team 90 stuff was all ""locked"" they were just images. This looked as if it had been thrown up in a hurry. By now the Turbo Team 90 coaching program was meant to be 20 days into a 90 day program and still nothing was available. 
From the intro video on the Turbo Team 90 program it seemed to me that Sterling Valentine was going through some personal problems and I wrote to the list on marketerlink.com encouraging members who had known him for a long time to send him letters of support as perhaps he had taken on more than he could handle and needed support. 
The next day I received a refund from Sterling Valentine via paypal for the 2 Turbo Team 90 payments but not for the listlaser pro payment that I had also requested. He also banned me from the marketerlink.com site stating that I was banned for being a spammer! This was totally untrue. I had only made about 4 public replies. One of the members who also was upset that he had received no information actually stated that he wondered how long we would be allowed to stay on the list as we were exposing the bad service. I am now locked out of the site even though technically I should still be a member as I still have not been given a refund for the listlaser pro membership. I am therefore unable to find out if Sterling Valentine has refunded the other members. 
He continues to ignore my requests for a refund for listlaser pro. I asked the company that did the joint venture with him on the 13th Oct if they could refund me their part of the joint venture payment and they informed me that they had not been paid, but they did offer me a refund in the form of a credit towards any of their products. This was customer service at it's best. This is something Sterling Valentine could learn from. I would still like a full refund from Sterling and then be able to put a happy footnote on this ripoff report telling the world that he finally did take care of his customers as he so often says he does: 
Sterling Valenting: 
We're not hiding from our customers like some of theseshady marketers [I call them ""sharketers""]. You can always reach me PERSONALLY - I wouldn't volunteer that if it wasn't true, would I? The reason why is because our customers are my favorite part of this whole business! There are too many people getting ripped off and confused out there, but you're not going to get that here. So don't be afraid to get in touch.
I was very niave and believed his sweet words both written and on the webinars, but the reality is far from what he describes above. It was very fraustrating waiting to hear back from the support tickets for many days, up to 2 weeks. I want to warn people to be careful before they hand over money for these courses. From talking with other members on marketerlink.com I found out that I was not the only one paying for a product and not receiving access to it. For some products it might not be much of a problem to be given access to it 3 months after you pay for it, but for a 90 day program on a deadline then this is just a waste of money. He is now not taking of awarding an all expences paid trip to his live event, instead he is saying that anyone on the program can come to the live event and give a report on their experience and he will video record it and you can use it as a promotional tool that you were invited to give a talk at a live marketing event in NY. Completely different from what he announced on his webinar in December. ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										I believe I am the victim of an internet scam where the company concerned is based in Utah.  I will explain the situation and hope that I can stop someone else suffering.
A few days ago I received an email newsletter pertaining to be from a marketing expert that I have signed up with. His name is Jeff Alderson. The email directed me to a site where I entered my name and phone number in order to possibly be one of 50 people selected to take part in a mentoring programme.
Yesterday evening I was contacted by a Craig Johnson claiming to be working for Jeff Alderson saying that I had passed through the initial round of selections and was being interviewed in order to get onto a shortlist from which the 50 'lucky' people would be selected. I was asked a number of questions relating to my experience, the amount of time I had available to work with them and also if I had credit card funds in order to fund the advertising budget etc.  After answering these questions I was told I had passed that interview and would be transferred to a person called Anthony Seagin who would go through things in detail with me.
Mr Seagin is an extremely proficient salesperson and didn't really let me get a word in edgeways. He told me that my money would be safe, I was guaranteed to make back at least my initial investment within 2-3 months and that I had 3 days to cancel if I changed my mind. I was told that the cost would be $4100. I gave Mr Seagin the details of 2 credit cards to fund the amount. I was passed to an associate to confirm everything. A contract was then emailed through which I signed and emailed back. The contract confirmed the 3 day cancellation period.  The amount was debited from one of my cards immediately, however the issuing bank for the other card put a stop on it, thank goodness.
After getting off the phone I started to get a little troubled when I thought about some of the things that Mr Seagin had said. He claimed to be working for Jeff Alderson and also a Michael Glaspie (another internet marketing expert). I have since been in touch with Mr Glaspie and he has denied all knowledge of these people. The company that the contract is with is Education, Sales and Marketing LLC. They appear to be a child company of Shanklin International. I have carried out some research and it seems that both of these companies are 'dodgy'. 
There are tales of people being ripped off, not receiving goods/services paid for and not being able to get refunds. The other concerning thing is that they use an email address which looks like it is part of infowest.com.  InfoWest is a hosting provider and their site doesn't say anything about internet marketing courses. I have contacted them to alert them to a possible misuse/misrepresentation of their company and email.
This morning I contacted Anthony Seagin using the phone number he gave me (435 652 4670). He became extremely agressive on the phone, swearing and generally being abusive. He told me initially that I could have a refund minus an administration fee of $600 and that it would take between 10 days and 2 weeks for me to receive it. I asked him what would happen if I hadn't received it in that time and he became more aggressive, saying that now he refuses to cancel my agreement and that I can't have any of my money back. I have not received anything from this company, and I believe that I am unlikely to do so. Mr Seagin has suggested that in order to recoup any money I need to start fraud proceedings with my credit card company.
I have contacted the Utah Attorney General with full details of my situation.

										I bought a 17"" X2gen monitor from MacMall on 2/24/06, naturally being pleasantly attracted by X2gen's $99  rebate offer. I mailed the rebate form to the Wood Dale address on or about 3/1/06. After about 14 weeks, I called them, and was told ""The Rebate Dept. isn't accepting calls. Send us an eMail."" I did just that, and got a prompt eMail (un-signed)  reply asking me to re-submit a copy of the form. I eMailed a copy that same day (6/5/06).
They have never replied. I've sent them at least 3 more eMails, and have even tried to enlist help from MacMall, to no avail. They'll go down on my book as ""Just Plain Crooks"" unless I get some satisfaction from them ASAP!!

										I bought a HP multi-function printer several months ago. On 6/17/02, a lady from Synapse called me. She told me that she was calling me from HP, and would like to send me the Readiris Pro software for 30-days free trial. If I would not return this item, my credit card would be charged $59.95 on the 31st day. 
But my credit card was charged on 6/18/02, and the amount was 98.89, including a 1 year maintenance fee I never asked nor was told. I requested an RMA number to return it. This item has reached Synapse over 10 days, but my credit card is still not credited for the refund. I am really sick of such dishonest business conduct.

										I bought a KVM from TigerDirect to which there was a $20 rebate offered with the sale.  Because I don't like rebates, I prepared a letter to send to this rebate center(Worldwide Rebates a California Company) that included a copy of 532 (a) of the California Penal Code(Theft by false pretense).  I specifically told them in the letter that I wanted only the $20 stated in the ad, and that I did not authorize any charges against this rebate or production of any product or service.  
Recently I received a notice that I'm going to be soon receiving a visa credit card with $18 a credit on it.  The letter I sent had been colorized with a big red box around 532, and it was witnessed by one of my fellow students.  I'm a criminal justice major, and I wanted to see if they would perform a criminal act, and they did.  The witness is a cop-want-a-be.  He mailed the letter not I. He too signed the letter!  It doesn't matter that the ripoff was for two dollars; it wouldn't matter if it was for one penny it is still a theft.
Any rebate is a ripoff.  That's the whole point to the rebate.  They want to make it difficult for people to get their money back.  In this particular case it appears that this company is stealing a small amount (10%) from many many people.  That makes their act an expression of greed because 100,000 rebates is a profit of $200,000.
It is illegal to threaten a criminal action in a civil case, so I've decided to do nothing!  Also I do not wish contact from TigerDirect because I can't identify their mens rea.  If TigerDirect knew that Worldwide is habitual, then I would be interested.

										I bought a web site for affiliate market,heard nothing for six months had many phone calls wanting some return on my money,nothing,then I got a check for 321.45 that was no good and my bank charged me 12.00 for their check.I called many times ,talked to the attorney general of Az.,no good,talked with B.B.B and there is nothing they can do either.So stay very far away from this company and if Wadell calls you ask him if he is goin to fix my check?? b**tards!!!EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder

										I bought the trial size of Acai Berry for shipping cost of $3.98. All the transactions are on top of the web page and small print terms on on bottom of page. I didn't read the fine print at the bottom of the page. In 15 days a full bottle of AcaiBerry supplement showed up in the mail and $90.02 was removed from my checking account. I had to call and raised cain about the unexpected charge. 
These people never said that more charges from other affiliated websites were coming. I just stumbled on a deduction from my account for $8.51 for a company called PriceLimbo. This deduction has been going on for 3 months. I do not check my account every month, but now I will have to. These people will not refund all of my money. I guess that I'm lucky that they will refund anything at all. Another charge of $29.95 may pop up from another affiliated website anyday called Fit Factory.
Monday a.m., I am off to the bank to close my account and open another. I have learned my lesson. I have also contacted Brian Ross with ABC news. Hopefully somthing will be eventually done to prosecute these parasites.

										I bought this Internet business to make some additional money, to help take care of my family of five, because we were living from paycheck to pay check. At first I was so exicited because this seem to be the break that I needed. Boy was I wrong, this was a big disappointment. I was robbed.
The merchandise that I was selling, was marked up so high that no one in their right mind would purchase trem. You see these products were selling for a lot less on other websites. I even tried selling some of these products on EBAY, but I end up paying instead because no one bought anything, and I still had to pay to list these things on EBAY.
To this day I am still trying to pay off this credit card bill of $700.00. This is the amount that Internet Speedway swindle me out of. It is an under statement to say that I was robbed, I wish there was a way to recover this money. If there is a way, can someone please tell me.

I wouldn't buy Tubeinator from http://www.tubeinator.com, or from Revolution Tilt at: http://www.revolutiontilt.com as noone calls you back, noone emails you back, and their activation system does not work. They just take your money, and do not help you. Michelle Macphearson has several websites out there, and support for these also ends up in the toilet. These websites are: http://www.30minutebacklinks.com http://www.socialmarketingmedia.com http://www.michellemacphearson.com and many others. Again I have tried unsuccessfully to get any help at all for the products I have. Be very careful about their so called support policies, procedures, and so forth. Noone will ever call you back or respond. They use several squeeze pages, affiliate program generation pages, and viral marketing pages to trap clients. Though some of the pages are good, and offer good products, Michelle Macphearson and Revolution Tilt, and much of her other websites do not get you anywhere but having a major headache.

Then in 4/1/06 I called to cancel people totally. They were having computer trouble as the man was trying to take care of it and we lost connection. I called many times after and was always told they lines were too busy and to call back later. I sent emails with no feed back. 
Today I waited on phone till I talked with someone. Was told everything would be taken care of and money refunded. Then manager came on and she said all we would get back was for the month of Oct.2006.

										I completed an online survey and got a pop-up saying I was entitled to choose a year's subscription to 3 magazines for only $2 each. Although I should know better, I went ahead and signed up. The originator of this program is Magazine Customer Service, www.magcustomerservice.com, and the website shows an association with Synapse Group Inc out of Stamford CT. 
I agree to the terms which indicated that the subscriptions would be autorenewed annually and charged to my card, but I am a frugal enough person to cancel before that point and that was my intention.
About four months later when I had been charged $6 but had not yet received ANY of the magazines, I called Magazine Customer Service, waited the 20 plus minutes to speak with a live representative, and eventually was told that the magazines had been going to the wrong address...my old address from graduate school where I have not lived for TEN + years. When I signed up for the offer I obviously listed my current address. The ONLY way they could have gotten this address wrong was to somehow have accessed credit card records, or some such private financial information. Right then I should have realized something was very wrong with this company. But we fixed the information, supposedly restarted the 12 month subscription cycle so I would get my full # of issues, and went from there.
I did start getting the proper magazines about a month later but also soon started getting letters from the publishers asking me to renew...""you have only 3 issues left!""  How could I have only 3 issues left if the year subscription just started? Well I let it go because those publisher notices don't even have any contact information on them. 
THEN I start seeing something very interesting. For the last 2 months, my credit card is being charged by Magazine Customer Service. $2 in May, $4 in June. And there are also credits from them, in odd amounts like 1.17. When I call their 800 number and use their automated service to inquire about a charge, I am told that one of the charges was for a magazine renewal I authorized as of July 3. I haven't authorized anything from this company since April/May of this year.  I then asked to speak with a live rep and had them cancel everything. They said I would continue to get the magazines I had ""already paid for"". I had him repeat several times that I would not be charged anything further. I did not bother to try to figure out why these charges had been appearing unauthorized on my card as the rep did not seem to speak English well.
In summary, Magazine Customer Service, and by association Synapse Group Inc, is a participating in some very suspicious business practices.  From my view I'd call it a scam. They hook you, get credit card information, and then start sneaking in charges and it's very difficult if not impossible to figure out why. I'd feel sorry for anyone who did not pay close attention to their credit card statements, or any older person who'd have a very challenging time navigating the cancellation process, as they would be completely taken advantage of by this, in my opinion, unethical enterprise.",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										I desperately need your help.
I need an Attorney to investigate, ""not just tell me, so you happen to have the same idea as some one else, Big deal?""
On March 13 2007 I came up with the idea of a flavored water system. This system is a faucet mounted water purifier that delivers a variety of flavors.
On March 13 2007 I went onto the U.S. patent office website and did a search with no results, so I had a patent attorney do a search who was recommended by the invention company that I called and sent my idea and non disclosure to. This company is called inventionhome.com
I got my patent search results in the mail from their patent attorney dated March 22, 2007
I wish to pursue legal action against inventionhome.com for leaking out my idea. (my family was so excited about this idea that no one said anything to anyone.)
I have every email that I have sent and or received from this company.
Inventionhome.com has a business association with proctor and Gamble so I know this is where the leak came from.
Please help me as my understanding is that in the United states is the first with the idea is the true inventor and not the first to patent the idea.
Please help me prove my case on a contingency bases as I don't have a good job or much money.
Non the less prior to getting my patent search done by a registered patent lawyer I visited proctor and gambles website and viewed all their products to ensure I wasn't going to patent or try to patent an existing  product and I have visited often since then, however on May 11th about 1130 P.M. I saw there new featured item.
Since I submitted my idea to inventionhome.com on March 13th and the Patent search was  done on March 14th and I got the results a couple weeks later  dated March 22nd with a statement  from the Patent Attorney that the search was conducted  on March 14th.
That being said, there is no way I could have gone to their website to get the idea.  However, considering the dates involved and how closely their new faucet mounted water purifier that produces filtered flavored water resembles mine, I must come to the conclusion that my non disclosure that I have with inventionhome.com i.e. Jacob Enterprise has been violated and I have informed them of this fact.
I realize taking action against a huge company such as theirs would be very difficult, but my hopes and dreams have been violated and smashed.
I would certainly appreciate your help and advice on this matter as I wish to take action against inventionhome.com  A.K.A. Jacob Enterprise and proctor and gamble.
As I stated before, I have all dated information that dates back to March 13th.
Please help me correct this injustice.

										I don't even remember signing up for this program (""simple escapes""), although I vaguely remember looking around on a website with that name.  In any case, I called the # on my credit card over 6 months ago and cancelled, as they had been billing me for many months without my ever using it.  As my husband looks over the VISA bill, the $18.95/month was below his radar screen so he did not ask me about it.  when I realixed they had continued to bill me I contacted them and was offered 1 month's credit.  
Companies like these should be held accountable for ripping people off who have no recourse to recover money that was taken in bad faith. I hope this company has a class action suit lodged against it.

										I entered into a agreement with IncentiveRewardCenter (Emarket Research Group) for and Apple 40G 4 generation Ipod well over month ago. The offer looked to good to be true but after reading the ""Terms & Conditions"" it appeared to not a scam.  Very far from the truth!
The offer sounds easy. Simply sign up for 6 products and services to get an Ipod sent to your door for free. I completed their online survey then began signing up for the 6 required offers. 6 offers, 2 from each page. I signed up for all 6 offers in a week or less. Slowly IncentiveRewardCenter marked 5 out of the 6 offers complete. Like everyone else who has dealt with the scam / company knows that the last offer is the hardest. For me, xoom.com was the last and final offer I needed to complete. I used xoom.com to send money for an eBay purchase from a gentlemen in Singapore
This was about a month ago and I have already received my item from him but yet the final offer does not go to the completed status. I understand, in the ""Terms & Conditions"" is states that it could take 4 to 6 weeks. During this months time the xoom.com link on their 3rd offers page disappears. Placed a phone call to make sure the offer I completed would still be honored.  A nice lady said that even if the offer is not listed on the site it would be updated once they received the proper information from xoom.com. I've waited a month but it has not changed to completed.
After all this, today I went to their website to see if my xoom.com offer was completed and I got this:
We are not able to find the following email address in our database at Incentiverewardcenter. 
It just goes to show, even if you read the fine print you can still get screwed. I have completed all the offers under the ""Terms & Conditions"" set by IncentiveRewardCenter but they have yet to live up to the their end. Over a month and a half of time, money, and energy spent essential on nothing. Stay away from IncentiveRewardCenter at all costs because the headaches the cause is not worth it.

										I filed a several reports for  PapercheckPayday loans with banking and state agencies and the FBI for electronic fraud.  Investigators revealed that they were also associated with a company/bank LLC, a web site out of Canada, and the states of Delaware and Illinois.  There was no physical address with the company despite one posted on their website.  
All mail was sent to a P.O. Box.  As soon my bank returned my money, then I immediately was bombarded with emails from all their companies for more payday loans, grants, etc...Within that week some of  my outgoing logins for accounts began including a box that I must provide an additional login and password in addition to my account login and password. 
The web addresses initially included PapercheckPayday and now Network Solutions (http://www.nuext.com).  This would be classified as a phishing type of fraud because they are trying to obtain my login name and password.  Conicidentally both paperpaycheck loan and network solutions also include an affiliation with LLC.  Network solutions sells domain web names and web developing and business services.  
Contact sites for Network Solutions coincidentally includes Canada, Illinois and Pennsylvania and a corporate office in Virginia.  I plan on exploring this further with the state and banking agencies who are investigating my initial complaint with PapercheckPayday loans.  Despite investing in another Virus protection software, I have been unable to delete them from my personal accounts.  Stay clear of any payday loan companies and don't every give out any additional passwords.

										I first came across Global Resources LTD a week or two ago on a craigslist computer gig claiming $17.00 an hour to do inventory for three days. Being close to Xmas i thought i would give it a Shot. I m in the Kansas town of Topeka, The capital city but there really isnt much going on in this town and the population is small fot a capital city.
I was contacted by Global Resources LTD and they sent me a packet of papers to sign and return Background checks credit checks personal checks they even wanted permission to talk to Friends family exctra basically free rain to do what ever they want. and also be able to release the info to potential clients of thiers
the called it a subcontracting position however the wanted me to fill out the 1099i and return it to them. they want me to apply for a chase pay card formally bank one you know chase lets not advance the money we promised and put a large group of hard working Americans out of Work.
Then i move on as im reading threw thier so called subcontractor contract (now keep in mind this is only a three day contract) willingness to sign a no compete contract But does not go in detail to what this no compete applys too.
so I emailed them back with my concerns also that I didnt like chase Bank That I would still do the job however i wanted paid by check to be sent out within 24 hours after the job was finished in subcontracting this is called negotiating. Some one forgot to tell them that. I get a very rude response aout how if i dont agree they will simply replace me that if i didnt abide i couldnt work for Global Resources LTD hold on what happened to being a subcontractor now im an employee ok.
I responded they were right there are so many companies out there that some little company in Trinton NJ Can be just as easily replaced as I can Be
Ive been in the computer field for almost 25 years Ive Had to deal with some idiots but this companies wins first prize. I Still have the original emails Just didnt want to Insult anyones intelligence By posting them 
one finall Thing i told them i walked away from corprate america on the basis that people are more important then Money.
In closing I cant say if its a scam but at the very least a very arrogant unpeople oriented company that doesnt give a dam about there Contractors or there concerns 
Just o note on the funny side i sent this as my final response to global (The corprate world did nothing to me I found I had a heart and a Conscience. As you so easily Explained There are a lot of companies I'll simply replace you.) 
There finall response will replace you  I felt 3 years old in the sand box  I can just picture them stamping there feet while sucking there thumbs

										I first found out in January of 2012 that Premier Membership Club STOLE $99.49 from my checking account. I called my bank to dispute this, & they said they would send me paperwork but never did. Life happened, then I called the bank back in March, asking what was going on with my dispute. They said they couldn't dispute checks over the phone & I'd have to go to the branch. I went, waited, & was then told it was denied. Premier Membership Club has caused my account to be overdrawn for 3 months! I finally got everything straightened out today, March 21st, 2012. Be careful how you use the Internet!! Places like Premier Membership Club can ruin your life!!EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder

										I found this company after searching long and hard for a company that specialized in Opt-in email marketing. These are people who want certain kind of email marketing sent to them. 
I bought their $99.00 package. It falsely promises that they have 300,000 current email addresses of people who like to shop online. After a couple days I started getting traffic to my site. The grand total was 183 visitors all of which had the same IP address. The visits were brief and not one single person bought anything. The next day the traffic stopped and two days later I wrote these clowns and demanded a refund. Still waiting on it.
As a rule only about 2% of persons should have responded. That would have been around 2000 people. When I confronted these liars they told me that only one 10th of a person responds. So why are they promising so many more I ask?

The most scary part of this is, I had already canceled my Membership, and credit card once.

										I had an incident with this company also. An employee had called me about an offer inregards to our payroll with the greatest vitamins. I told him that I would let him know because right now I don't have the funds. 
 Well the employee had pulled out $675.00 from my account without my authorization. I spoke to his boss and the boss had refunded my money and it was credit back into my account in 3-4 days. The boss had given me 1 month to come up with the $675.00 so I agreed. 
About 2 weeks after our conversation and agreements with the boss. $425.00 was taken out of my account again from the tax club. I had spoke to a different manager explained the situation and she said she would call us back in 1 hour and no phone call. We called back and no answer left messages after messages,after messages. 
Finally 2 weeks after the situation I had recived a phone call from the manager that my money was being refunded back into my account in 7-10 business days and her last words was please get in touch with THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU to let them know that we have recived our refund. That was really funny. 
If you are searching for any help on getting your money back from any company you feel is ripping you off tell them that you have filed a report with the attorney general and the better business bureau and make sure you do make a report that is your right. No one should be ripped off the way that plenty people like me have been.

										I had been searching for information on how to start a home base business on the internet and was very skeptical about doing so, because of being scammed and ripped off like everyone else.
I was looking to get as much free information as I could from someone and I found Keith Wellman - FX Marketing Inc. offering a free audio cd called The Recycler and all I had to do is pay $1.99 for the postage. Well that was a lie, because little did I know they've been billing my credit card every month in the amount of $29.97 ever since then. Totaling $59.94 so far. 
I've called FX Marketing Inc. in hopes to be able to resolve this situation and have not been able to get anyone to return my calls. I want them to refund my money to me immediately. 
someone really needs to stop these type of people from ripping off consumers and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law. shame on them, God don't like ugly. Some of us out here in the world are just trying to make an honest living, unlike you thieves, that make it bad on everyone.
all I can say to everyone that uses the inter-net, BEWARE of all the scamming websites that are on the inter-net to do nothing but RIP you off and there is a lot of them out there doing just that.
Someone out there, PLEASE put a stop to these crooks. Everyone of them should be locked up and the key thrown away!!!!!!

This form was dated 1/26/09.  Nothing came, heard nothing.  Continued to contact them.  They said that now they were experiencing delays in cash back fulfillment, and the discover of ""inconsistencies"" and there was toing to be a full audit of certificates.  They didn't know how long this was going to take.  This was in May.  Then in June they stated that they were finishing up the audit and then checks will be mailed.  Again no time line.  Today 8/7/09 this is what I recieved:
Thank you for contacting us.
According to our records, you may be a claimant of USA Survey Group.   Active Respons e Group, 
Inc. (?ARG?) is the parent company of USA Survey Group .   As you know, many businesses have been hurt badly by the financial downturn and the credit crunch that followed the collapse of the subprime mortgage markets.   ARG, like many other firms, though not involved in any way in those activities, has seen its revenues drop dramatically.   As a result, we found ourselves in very serious financial difficulty. 
Despite taking various steps to reduce our costs and preserve value, we became unable to make our debt payments to our senior lender, Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. (?Hercules?).   Hercules had lent ARG $10,000,000, which senior loans were secured by all of our assets.   Since we were unable to pay our current payments, Hercules declared the loans in default and began to exercise its rights under the loan agreements and State law to recover its loans outstanding through an agreed upon asset sale process. 
Through this process, ARG is working with Hercules to complete the sale of all of ARG?s assets in an auction.   In the meantime, Hercules has agreed to permit us to use its collateral t o fund a bare bones operating budget in order to allow ARG to continue enough operations to be able to still seek a buyer of ARG as something like a going concern.    Unfortunately, since any claims you might have are unsecured, and therefore in any liquidation scenario would be junior to the claims of Hercules, who holds a valid senior security interest in ARG?s assets and any proceeds from the sale of ARG assets, no funds have been allocated in the budget to satisfy any consumer prize claims. 
Hercules? agents have scheduled the bidding on ARG?s assets to end on July 23.   Only after the results of all of Hercules? and ARG?s Management?s efforts to sell our assets and business are determined will we be able to say whether there will be any funds left over after Hercules applies the proceeds of any such sale to its loans outstanding.   At this juncture, we cannot determine whether there will be any surplus at all.   However, if there is sufficient interest by a sufficient number of bidders, it is still a possibility. 
Should you have any questions, please contact us via email at support@cs.Brandarama.c om . While our customer service center is no longer in operation, if we are in a legal and operational position to do so, we shall try to keep you informed of material developments in this process. We are of course very disheartened by this turn of events, as we know you must be.   We thank you for your patronage and wish you the best. 
Very truly yours,

										I had gone to the bank friday to get my check cashed and the bank teller asked if I was going to make a deposit because I was overdrawn. I asked for a printout of my account. I saw a POS Debit of 109.95 in august and 109.95 in sept. I showed the printout to my sister today and she looked these places up on the internet and found out they are known to rip people off.

										I had just gotten my Social Security Disability Benefits.  I had fought for these benefits for three long years; when I finally received a lump sum of money.  I wasn't enough to go out a purchase a house, so I decided to invest.  It was around the holidays, Thanksgiving & Christmas 2007, when Mike Spencer called.  I just new that God had sent this opportunity to me, so I invested a BIG portion of my disability lump sum, $4,499.99 for NATIONAL MARKETING CONCEPTS, LLC & another $204.95 for INTERNET STRATEGIES GROUP, LLC not knowing, at time that they were the same company.  I just pray that they get the punishment that they truly deserves, they have caused me and my daughter great hardship.

After I didn't hear anything from this company I called and asked where my computer was and was told that they didn't have an order placed. 
I told them I wanted to cancel since it had been so long that I had to wait and was told they would get back to me. 3 weeks I had to wait for anyone to call or send me a correspondence. After finally getting a hold of someone they said they would have my monies credited back to my account at the end of November, and still nothing. 
I contacted a detective and gave him all my information along with correspondences from e-mail and my bank account information to show where they had taken the money out. The detective contacted someone for this company and was told they didn't have anything on record for me and didn't know what he was talking about. The detective told him that he had the bank statements in front of him showing where they had taken money out of my account and that's when they somehow found my information. 
The detective was told they would have the money in my account two weeks ago but as of yet they haven't and now he can't get a hold of anyone and neither can I. No one will return correspondences through e-mail either. I am at my wits end with this company. Their phone # which is a VOIP has been issued a subpoena and now it's a waiting game.

										I had used Ron in the past and thought I could trust him with taking my new company to the next level. The main goal for him was to market my website which he never did. He did not do proper tagging, keywords, or SEO information for me. I paid him for linkbacks on other sites and they were never done. When asked if I could have a list - he lied and told me no. I do not come up in search engines, as promised. He created a fake facebook account with fake likes and will not give me username and password. This fake facebook is linked to my personal facebook and blog and is causing problems because I can not access it to transfer over my real likes. I have tried to reach him for the past 2 months and was forced to find someone else and pay to have everything redone. The only correspondence I received was today because I told him that I was going to report to the BBB. One of his ""support"" people told me that they have no information and that my account was hacked and they are not responsible. Liars! He has obviously done this before. I researched him and found that he is affiliated with many other sites and some of them questionable at best - Escort Sites. This was not revealed to me. ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										I have been paying for this computer since Feb 2008.   When I call they tell me that the computer will be sent in 2-3 weeks.  I thank them, hang up and call another person at Blue Hippo, I am then told it could be 6-8 weeks for delivery.  I hang up and call yet again, and am told that they are waiting for a confirmation number from DELL.
I then contacted DELL and was told that they have never built any computers for Blue Hippo nor have they ever been affiliated with them. Now that I have only approx. $300 left to pay on a $1918.00 computer, I finally realize I'm being taken advantage of. 
With no way to get a refund out of these people and no merchandise that looks remotely worth the costs that they charge for it, my options are to see if there is anyway for me to recover the money that they have taken out of my checking account.

										I have been ripped of by the company edpreporting with out even knowing what was about to happen. I applied for a credit card and I figured if I did not complete the last two parts that nothing would happen. 
Well that is not true. They say I completed the application and it does not matter that I did not want it and I have ask them to cancel it and return my money they say tfs. That there is nothing they can do and I can cancel it but I still have to pay a fee for something I do not have and did not want. 
The operator I spoke with was rude and hung up after she told me there was nothing I could do. I have reported this to La. BBB. I have filed criminal charges with the financial institution to try and get my money. Just a word to others. Do not trust this company as I did not even know what company I was dealing with until they took money out of my accaount.

dubois, PennsylvaniaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										I have been with this site since last year, in that time I have had thousands of votes taken away.  My sister had votes taken away and so have four of my friends.  I've called many times only to be told that there is a clitch in the system and there is nothing that can be done.  I was told that they would make a note of it.  On the 17th of this month I again lost 576 votes.  I again called picture.com and asked for the supervisor.  I was told he was out to lunch, I left a message and he never returned my call.  I called on the 19th to follow up on it and was told he was out for at least a week.  
I sent $100 to have my picture put in the Endless Journey Photography book,  $75 for the picture and $25 for a write up.   The write up was never put in.  I called and was told that they didn't have a write up from me and I would recieve a check in the mail.  I have yet to receive that check.  
I won an ipod on one photo and was told I couldn't have it because I had already won on that particular photo, then they shouldn't have listed me as winning again, I was so excited for nothing.  I was going to give that one to my son.  He was so happy, then I was told I was disqualified-- it was their error not mine and they should have made it right.  They didn't.  I just want to make people aware as to what is going on with this particular site and not to get their hopes up for nothing.  
They also tell us that we have been nominated to be in the Photography Hall of Fame for a sum of money and that we have some awards coming to us also at another sum of money.  Thats great to be nominated but why should we have to pay to be in it if we have been nominated to be in it.  They use our photos for their book, which they get paid for when they sell them, therefore, shouldn't we get some royalties or something because they are using our photos.  It doesn't make sense that we should have to pay to have our photos in THEIR book.  
I still haven't been able to talk to a supervisor to rectify my problems.

										I have been working online for several years now and for the last 4 years had been using traffic wave as my auto responder service.I recently was in between moving so I was temporarily staying in a hotel. After 4 years of everything going fine and paying traffic wave monthly for using their serviceall of a sudden one month my card was declined. I contacted them and they said they had upgraded their payment software and the system detected that my home address and credit card address did not match. I did not want to put a hotel address on my card until I had made my permanent move, however I was forced to do so because of this new system change so I did.After I did this traffic wave still insisted that The addresses did not match. After several emails and getting nowhere with them I decided to contact the bbb because due to them closing my account, this  would cause me to lose thousands of clients per month (about 20,000) that I had built in my opt in list. This list took me YEARS to build, I built them through the traffic wave auto responder, however traffic wave had nothing to do with me pertaining the list. I built it with my own advertising techniques that I paid for totally separate from them. Anyways so funny how this happened but as soon as I contacted the BBB miraculously my card went through (hmmm) fishy. You see during the emails it got a little heated so my guess is they wanted to close my account but when they were contacted by the BBB they didn't want the complaint on their record. Anyways so I thought everything was back to normal and dropped the bbb complaint. Now as of this past month I did my final move and this whole thing started all over again with the address thing. I made sure to change the address in both systems however all I got was arguements from traffic wave stating that my information did not match and my account was closed.At this point all I want is for them to let me back into my account for 1 day so I can retrieve my list that I personally built and my letters in their systems that I personally wrote and transfer it to a reliable auto responder service. I told them this was going to cause me to lose lots of money by losing this list and literally BEGGED them to just process my payment one more time and make sure to check so they could see that they did match but the owner of traffic wave Brian Rooney could not care less and after all these years just locked me out of my account so hopefully no one else will make this same mistake by joining traffic wave and risk losing their entire list. Brian Rooney and staff have been nothing but rude and unreasonable and I did tell them off and curse at them after several upon several of rude emails later. I think the average person would do the same if they were standing to lose money that they depend on every month as a single parent in this economy.Anyways I want to report them to others to make sure this NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN to anyone else.

										I have paid money for their course but cannot access it as the password does not work. I have sent six emails to the help address all of which have been ignored. I have contacted Clickbank for a refund but they will not give me one as it is more than 8 weeks since I paid for the product. They informed me that they had sent my complaint to profit lance but still no response. All I am asking for is the access I have paid for but it appears that there is nobody rep[onding to emails !!

										I have recently been doing contract work for a small web and marketing company in Anderson, South Carolina - Six Degrees. We were working on a hand-shake deal in which I would provide approximately 10 hours of work a week and be paid $1000 per month. This arrangement began in the end of November 2011. I was paid on time for the first months work on December 21, 2011. I have worked steadily for this company since, often working well over the agreed upon hours per week. January 21 came around and no payment was made. I contact the company and asked if I could pick-up a check. It took several days to get in touch with the company, when I finally did the company only had $250 of the $1000 owed for January's work. I pick-up the check. I did not receive another check until the end of February, which was only for $500. At this point, $1250 was now past due, I only received $750. It is now towards the end of March and no further payments have been made.									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										I have seldom had the dishonor of dealing with a company as incompetent as Traffic Geyser. The concept of their product is excellent but is marketed as something quick and easy, neither of which is close to being true.
I was curious and decided to signup for their free one-week trial (I later found out about the free 30 day trial) and had multiple problems from the start. The problems were made worse by slow response of their customer service and techinal support employees, only one of whom made any attempt to solve a problem.
After 6 days of trying to make sense of a disorganized web site and even worse training videos, I decided this was not a service worth $97 per month. I sent an email on the sixth day requesting cancellation of my account.
The following day, I received noticed that my credit card had been charged. Needless to say, I immediately emailed their billing department, where the sender has four options regarding the priority of the email: low, medium, high, and urgent. I sent one in the morning, marked high priority, and another in the afternoon, marked urgent. Two emails, two phone calls - NO RESPONSE!
A company that ignores the desires of a customer is a company that does not deserve my money. I could not recommend Traffic Geyser to any one under any circumstance.

He is unkept, colors his hair black, had a lot of roots showing, a bit gruf as a sales man.

										I initiated a (free) offer for a google pro CD, (on the pay page, they said, ""You are purchasing:  Google Pro Kit  Your credit card will be billed: $3.88).
I thought that this was the actual Google Company, (which I trust), but realized that 9 days later, when I received an over-draw notice from my bank as a result, I had been again charged by the false-named company, this time for $72.21.
When I contacted them, they said they could cancel, (this is where I realized that had I not taken action, I would be charged this amount every month), but would not refund the $72.21.
I feel this is a very underhanded way of conducting a business under some else's business name.

										I just wanted to warn everyone about the site: www.thebacklinkbuilders.com. The services by this company are a complete scam. I was enticed by this company from a few advertisements and have been desperately trying to get more visitors to my website. The site looks legit and I regretfully bought two of their 10,000 back link ""packages"" for my websites. I payed close to $49.99 each for both of the packages and was not surprisingly ripped off. I do realize it takes a while for back links to be crawled by search engines but it has been nearly four months and I have not gotten a SINGLE new back link that is linking to my site. I have used numerous different SEO tools and as said before have seen NO new back links whatsoever for which I was promised. DO NOT give them your credit card information. I was however very surprised that these guys did not somehow re-bill me or sign me up for random monthly subscriptions like other scammy websites so to be fair they are more honest scum bags than the normal lot but nonetheless this is a scam.

										I just went thru three ink cartridges to get one that is sort of working. It started with a call from the sales person stating these Kelly cartridges are much better than standarded cartridges because they don't use ""blue filler"" and that they print blacker and twice as long as standard carts. She said I could order a minimum of four, so I did. A couple weeks later I get a call from another man from Kelly notifying me the other eight are on the way. When I explained I didn't need them he said the first shipment was just to make sure they are the correct ones and I had to purchase the other eight. I had been using the first one and it seemed alright so I said go ahead. I have been tracking the cartridge life and found no difference in the life of the store bought HP cartridges. But now I'm starting on the final eight and low and behold I got an error nine days after installing it that the cartidge is not the right one for this printer. Installed the next cart and it doesn't  print, next one doesn't print, and again. After the forth one it prints but I'm not expecting much. These caridges are remanufactured which I wasn't aware of until getting them. Do not buy this inferior product! 									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

Notes from my Better business complaint:
I will copy and paste e-mails into this form SO THERE IS NO CONFUSION, other correspondence and read receipts and cell phone records are available upon request. Please note that these e-mails have not been altered in anyway, ALSO Please notice the DATE and TIME that the E-mails were sent and received. Travis called me the next morning after receiving my cancelation letter and sent e-mails AFTER my cancelation! 
Not only was I CANCELLING my account, I wanted additional reimbursement for being lied to by the initial sales person. Travis accepted my cancelation and sent me Yahoo information to settle initial discrepancies and reimbursement request which I conceded to.
It is preposterous to even think that LinkTech Solutions now believes that I cancelled my account in December and has no other records of my cancelation. 
When talking to Travis Ayotte, Customer Support Manager, he was quick pull my information up on his computer, see previous phone calls, e-mails, including the cancelation e-mail and other correspondence he had noted. He even argued the point that I had to fax in the cancelation letter and I forwarded him the ""agreement"" that allowed an agreement to be cancelled through e-mail.
I do not think that LinkTech Solutions is acting in good faith regarding this matter, and LinkTech Solutions has either not spoken to their Customer Service Manager Travis Ayotte or examined the resources that were available to Travis at the time of cancelation.

End of above e-mail-
I have already provided LinkTechSolutions with All correspondence and e-mail read receipts indicating they had read the e-mails after their initial denial of receipt, and then I provided them with their cancellation policy after they found the e-mails and informed me that it had to Faxed and E-mail was insufficient. (There policy does include e-mail cancellations.) Once I provided enough information for them to recognize that I had canceled my account, followed their company policies and asked for a refund, it was suggested that I sue them for the $100, that we didnt have a contract, we simply had an agreement and the court fees will out weigh the $100. Although Travis did offer 50% because it was the Christmas season.
Besides having to take the time necessary to resolve this issue with LinkTech Solutions, I have had to close my bank account to prevent LinkTech Solutions future debits. This in itself has cause great inconveniences. 
LinkTech Solutions has made no attempt to resolve this issue with me since I open the dispute.

(More) On 7/11/07 I began a month to month agreement with linktechsolutions for $50 per mo. On 9/11/07 I cancelled our agreement through e-mail. On 9/12/07 Travis Ayotte replied to the e-mail and we spoke on the phone regarding placement statistics and click through discrepancies via yahoo and my site host. We ended our call in disagreement; never the less cancelled my agreement.
November 2007 I discovered that linktechsolutions had continued to charge my bank account monthly (total $100) and I sent them an e-mail showing our original agreement, correspondences regarding my cancelation and requested a refund. Again I spoke to Travis and although he recalled our previous conversation through notes on my account he refused to refund the unauthorized charges, then he offered to refund 50% since it was the Christmas season. I denied the 50% and demanded to be reimbursed for the unauthorized charges. 
Since this call I have not received the reimbursement of $100 and there has not been any additional correspondence. While the value is minimal, I am disappointed that I followed the rules of our month to month agreement regarding payments and cancellation a they did not.

										I noticed a charge on my Business account for 79.00 I did not reconize and went to my bank to dispute the charge. I was told that the charge came thru on my credit/debit card number. Being a business account and not insured they told me I would need to recover my money form the company that charged my card the 79.00. When I went to the internet to find Premier Global Media in Beverly Hills Ca I saw this website and that they had been reported as a scam. I have had to change all my account numbers and am still out the 79.00. The owner of this company needs to go to jail for his actions.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder

										I noticed a charge this month on my Business Visa Card for $79.00 
[Posted Date: 02/07/2012 Description: LINKTECH 800-5826200 CA Debit:$79.00]
I did not recognize the company or the charge. When I called, it turns out that they have been billing me since sometime in September. 
The past few months in my life have been ""busy"". 3 deaths in my immediate family, and an extended deployment to SE Asia in November and December. 
They apparently sold me an SEO service and a website back then. It was one of those set ups where you give them the credit card number, you get a month free, no fees if you cancel, month to month all that. What's the risk right? 
Well, I never got any follow up from them. The number they had called on disappeared from the callerid. A company name was not searchable, and think about it.. how generic are their DBA's!?! And, there are other valid charges on the card for technology companies, so this one just blended into the crowd.  
So, this week when I sat down to get caught up on the last 2-3 months of statements etc, I spotted it, called, and found out they had been billing for a service when I have not received any service at all beyond a halfway finished website with only my name on it, and I don't even have a link to it, no login info or anything else to enable me to use it.. Meanwhile, they claim they have been promoting my name and company to google search. 
Wonderful.. I can only hope they did not promote my name since the site they direct people to was not approved by me nor complete judging by the description given to me by the Customer Service Rep Shawn.
Shawn could have been nicer, but.. he was not allowed to credit my account. He was a heck of a sales guy, doing everything he could do to save my account, but he never did offer to make things right. He never offered to reset the account and apply the previous payments to moths going forward and to rebuild the account as it should have been done to begin with. He was not able to refund the payments made when no service beyond a half-baked placeholder website were out there damaging my image. 
All he could do was cancel the account. I had to convince him to remove the placeholder webpage to as he was striving for it to remain up and running. 
They wanted to schedule a call with a manager, but he put me on hold so he could speak with one, so why couldn't he have had the manager who is obviously nearby, jump on the call? Besides, they apparently have my number. The manager can call anytime during business hours, but I am not going to schedule an appointment to speak with a vendor that does not provide any service at all. It's the principal of it. 
All told they have taken us for $316.00 and have only delivered a placeholder website that they went LIVE with without any input, review, or approval from our side. And then they claim to have promoted us on Bing and Google, but have failed to provide any form of proof they did this. 
Since the site is not representative of us, ironically I really do hope they are lying about promoting our business on Google. At least then fewer people would see a broken web page as representative of our company, a broken website they published without our approval. ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										I ordered 2GB PC3200 400FSB DDR (1GB x 2) Memory Dual Channel Kit W/Lifetime warranty (HD)  
Only one chip works. They ignored my emails, I finally called them, and they b*tched at me for submitting a bad review at PriceWatch, where I had responded to their ad. They insisted I go back and change my review, which I could not because PriceWatch only lets you submit 1 review per month for their stores. 
They issued an RMA, but I had to pay for shipping. I did so, and they returned what I think is the same chip to me, it doesn't work either. I called them again, they said a technician would email me in 1/2 hour. I have not heard from them, I tried calling back repeatedly but the phone has been busy - for hours.

										I ordered a (what they said was refurbished) Laptop from this company. What I got was a 15 to 20 year old scratched up old outdated laptop.
When I called them they told me I could return it, but they would not refund my shipping and handling. It cost $61.86 for them to ship it to me so I am sure it will cost about the same for me to ship it back. So I will be out about $120.00.

										I ordered a Compaq laptop computer July 18, 2006 with Rebate offer.  In good faith, I filled out the OnRebate forms, carefully submitted all the required documents, bar codes and data to the address listed on the rebate form.
Checking the OnRebate website, I found it was received on July 23, 2006 and accepted for payment August 24, 2006.  I was informed the rebate would take 8 to 10 weeks, and when I checked two months later in October, it showed payment pending.  
Checking again the first of December it showed payment had been sent but did not show a date.  Since I did not know the date of payment, I attempted to call OnRebate, only to be left ""on hold"" for over a half-hour until I gave up.  E-mail queries to their support@help.onrebate.com have not been answered and a followup to that e-mail address today comes back ""address not found"".
Sounds like a rip-off to me.

										I ordered a refurbished laptop from a dealer on Ebay Oct 2010.  Received it in less than 2 weeks and issues started with laptop immediatly. Everytime I would push it away or pull it closer to me it would shut off and restart.  I emailed IZOOMUSA about the troubles I was having.  I was given the run around through email.  Returned it in Nov wanting my money back.  They wanted to give me another one with an upgrade for my troubles not a refund.  I only wanted a refund I was scared of there products.  Did not hear back from them for weeks.  I had to constantly call and email them to find out where my refund was.  I was given one scenario after another on why I had not received it.  By this time my 45 days consumer protection had run out with Ebay.  Ebay wants the consumer to handle it with the dealers of which I thought everything was going to be ok.  I had never had an issue with anyone I had made purchases with up to that date.   Here it is Mar 2011 and still they refuse to answer my emails and when I get someone George or Dan on the phone they lie to me about why I have not received my refund.   They never took the initative to call me or email me on there on.  I had to give them my tracking # from UPS so they could see that I had actually sent it back to them.  It showed that it was received by someone at the desked named David and received on Nov 19th.  But, that was not even good enough.  Now they say the UPS bill states .5 lbs was the package weight.  Another reason to not give me a refund.  UPS policy never charges less than 1 lb for any package.  I don't care how big there warehouse is!  Its not my fault there employees can't file returns correctly so IZOOMUSA can handle complaints from customers.  They advertise 100 percent customer satisfaction on there web page and Ebay.  I only wanted my money back on that broken laptop that was all.

										I ordered a set of EzCombs, because of seeing an infomercial on TV in November of 2008.  The charge was to be $10.00 per set.  I ordered 2 sets.
With S$H this amount was to be $26.99.  I waited until the middle of December, and when I did not receive anything called.  I was told I did not have an order?
I then placed another order, telling them if the 2nd one shows up to CANCEL.  I checked my bank statement in January, and saw a charge from them for $88.91.  I called, and was told I ordered several sets, to which I replied, NO I DID NOT!  I was then told I could cancel for a refund. So on 01/28/09 I did.  ON 01/30/09 I was credited $81.92, a difference of $6.99.
Today, 02/02/09 I called again.  I was hung up on FOUR times before someone actually answered.  She told me I was credited.  I tried to explain the $6.99 diff.  Finally I asked her if she knew how to add and subtract?  
To this, she told me she would request the additional $6.99.  WOW, what an experience.  I am going to wait until Thurs or Fri this week, and then call my bank and request the item be placed into dispute.  
Just think, if they ripped me off $6.99, and do this to over thousands of people, they will be rich just off of this.
This company has the worst customer service ever, and believe me, I have worked customer service.

And read (above) that they are going to automatically bill me for more every 90 days. So I called them at 1-888-769-7873, at 3PM EST and asked to have the automatic enrollment canceled. They said on the phone you are canceled and were going to hang up when I asked for a confirmation. They gave me a confirmation number  and then I had to request to get an email confirmation of the cancellation - this is evidence they sent that they did cancel me as per my phone request but there is no confirmation number, account number, or description of what product is being cancelled.

My problem with this is that the whole process is deceptive advertising and in all the advertising of the free bottle there is no mention of signing you up for automatic billing for more product for life (before you even receive the trial offer), and where it is mentioned it is easy to miss because there was no mention of it at all, on radio or the website page advertising the free offer so customers are not aware of additional charges of over $100 every 3 months - free means free, not free with strings attached. This approach especially takes advantage of inexperienced or handicapped individuals who are most likely not able to afford the lifetime subscription like the young, people on fixed incomes, elderly, disabled or ill. It also leads me to suspect the product's claims to be bogus or they would not resort to deception to extort money from those among us who are the most susceptible to scams and can least afford to be taken. In addition to all this, when I said I wanted to cancel they offered to cut the price of the next 90 day automated purchase nearly in half if I remained in the program. This is not a sales ploy. I recognize a sucker play when I see it.
I am assuming they will honor my cancellation but I wonder if they will - I must report the card number missing and get a new one to be sure they cannot take money out of my bank account in the future without my authorization. Free has turned out for me to be more trouble and anxiety than it was worth.
Something needs to be done by regulators to stop these aparent Charlatans and protect honest, deserving Americans and that is why I am filing this report. If they are not Charlatans they need to stop behaving like Charlatans.

When I ordered the coffee they said the total cost was approximately $14.95 for the two pouches.This was supposed to be a one time offer and order. I was billed $38.95! Four days later they billed me another $38.95! The next day I recieved another shipment of coffee. I never recieved a notice of shipment from them AND I never ordered the second shipment. As others have reported the second order put my account in the negative and I was charged for that overdraft. After calling them they said the did send a welcome email. They did not! I searched over 2700 trashed and samed email looking for any thing from them but to no avail! They told that they would give me a full refund after I returned the order.

										I paid Expedite for 1,500,000 e-mails to promote my business.  They were supposed to send out 500,000 per week for 3 weeks.  They also offered a 30% guaranteed open rate.  Incredibility enough the open rate on the stats provided to me every week was EXACTLY 30% not 29% or 31% but exactly 30%.  I had more opt-outs per campaign then supposed click throughs.  I also contacted my affiliate manager to verify the click throughs that they reported and the stats were false.  I did not get 1 single customer from 1,500,000 e-mails.  I have been trying to contact the company for 2 weeks to explain why I out of 150,000 opened e-mails according to their reporting I showed only 48 clicks throughs again according to their reporting. The company will not return my calls or e-mails. When I checked these reported numbers with my affiliate they stated that the click throughs that they were reporting to me were inaccurate.  This company either provides old, un-targeted (I paid for target e-mails), or not as many as they state.  I can also prove they lie about the stats. I would not recommend doing business with this company unless you have money to waste!  Also, do another search.  There is at least one other person in this database that they ripped off also.

										I paid the 34.95 registration fee to ""instantly"" receive access to surveys online.  When you complete a survey, you receive $$.  
That sounds all well and good, but after you get the confirmation of your $$ being accepted, you receive a link to click to access the surveys.

										I participated in a 3  question survey for which I was to receive a  watch for $5.99.The survey was completed on 12/32012 and I was billed $7.99 which included  a watch case and shipping charges.  I received the watch on 12/10/2012 and it was not the one I ordered . I was then charged $98.00 on my credit card on 12/16/2012. I contacted them at Billing  on 12/19/2012 and they said  it was past the 14 day trial period and they would not issue me a  RMA  but they would cancel my subscription and I would not be sent any more items.  I returned the watch to them at my own expense on12/19/2012.  This company is taking advaantage of people as no where does it say say you have a 14 day trail period which includes the shipping time.

Two days ago I look at my bank account and this company did a charge back of the services I provided. Now I have fees as well as negative money to make up. I called Ronni when I noticed the charge back and asked what was going on. He advised me that he would call me back with Simon the VP on the phone because he was the one working with me.

The service provider repeatedly ordered the wrong parts causing a delay in the repair. In early July, I was promised that my computer would be picked up, repaired and returned to me in about 10-12 days. It is now August 21st and I have yet to receive my computer. In fact, no one seems to know its whereabouts. When I called ShopNBC's customer service, I was told that I was On my own after the sale and that there's nothing ShopNBC can do for me.

										I purchased a Proccessor AMD from this Company Monarch Computer System almost fours Month's ago
Item         Description            Qty  Unit-Price 120273  AMD ADA3700BNBOX Athlon64    1     $329.00

SubTotal  $344.00
Shipping Charge   $39.95
                                       Invoice Total  $383.95
They proposed me only two Shipping Method, the first one, by Fedex International Economy for $133.13 (taking 3 days to receive my Purchased) and the other-one by US Postal service for $32.10 (taking from 7 days to 10 days to receive my purchased) That was all as information that they told me about the shipping method for international. so I thing it's Ok to wait for 7 or 10 days, but it cost only $32.10, anyway My Invoice date was May-11-2005, after 2 weeks I haven't see anything comming, I sended an Email to ask how-come I haven't receive my Order, and they reponsed me, that (Typically they have seen orders shipping to Europe taking 2-3 week's) but than after 3 week's still nothing happened, I tried to Emails and called, but No one give me any reponse, all I get as an answer, it was (Look we shiped out your order, if you haven't receive it, there's nothing we can do about it) and they told me to check with the French custom, but for right now they don't have any control about it,
 So I tried to called to the diffrent French custom's, But no-One can tell me what's happened to my Order, I asked my Father who living in California, to check with this Company, and they told him, and me, that they can't initiate a trace for 30 day's, But then 5 week's and then 6 week's and I'm still waiting for my Order, when I Email them they never reponse me, and if I called, or they puted me on hold into I'm tire of waiting then hang-off, or I get to the diffrent's person, who can't give me any answer concrete, about my Order, so I told them I want my Money back, but No answer.. 
Finally, after two months awaited, the package got to me, and the Factor told me, if I accepte this parcel, I have to pay almost $80.00 for the Custom feed, if I don't want to pay, then the Factor can not give to me the Parcel. But I refused to accepte it, first I have a doubt that they sended me a wrong parcel, and I don't know what may be inside, so I told the Factor just send it back where it came from, but I'm not gona pay him $80.00 for something I may not wanted, So I call the Monarch Computer company and, and I told them, why I refused to accepte the parcel,and (I think, I have the right to refuse it) now all I wanted is my Money back, So they told me (Now you have to wait from 4 to 6 week's, before we can do the refund to you) I told them, that's fine, I will wait... 
But now is more than 6 week's already, my Father and me called them up yesterday, and ask when they gona pay back my $383.95, they told us that they haven't receive the parcel back yet, so I told them I don't care, that's your Company problem,with the Poste service, and they said that, as long that they haven't get it back, they can't refund me my Money...I told them that, You can only do it like that, if I accepted the merchandise, or the parcel, and then I send it back because I'm not happy for a reason or another, But it wasn't the case, I did not accepted the parcel from the Factor, I did not signed a receive or anything I did not payed for the Custom Feed, I don't even know what is inside the parcel, so that's mean I am not responsible for this turns over parcel, If something happened to it, that's their problem with the Poste service, they have to claim it with the French custom or the US Poste service, where they sended it from. 
And then they said is was my faute, because I choosed the $39.95 US Post service, now if something happened to it then is my Probleme,the company do not take any reponsibility for it.. it is indescribable which a company,Well- known like (Monarch computer system) has employers not professional, and inefficient, they do not inform their customers correctly about their Shipping method, and refused to take their professional missconducts, and now they want that their Customers to pay for them.
I'm not gona let this company Rip me off my Money, I have put my car for sale, so I can get the Money and send it to my Father, so he can go on and get an Lawyer, I want to get a Lawsuit to this Company, and even if I must spend out  thousands dollars for that. But I will not leave this Company get away with my money, If there's out there any Good lawyer, who think that he can lawsuit this company, Please contact me I'm in France for rightnow, but I have all my peoples and my Family in (Texas Houston & Californie Orange County) who can represent me for this matter.

										I purchased List Laser Pro through an online auction (not directly from Sterling).  I had no problem with that product or any of the other products that he sold as part of my purchase.  
I had a bit of difficulty with logins but he fixed them within a few day through his support portal.
He and I had an hour long conversation on the phone discussing my goals and such and he sounded very sincere and caring.
In Dec 2012 I participated in a webinar where he was selling a course he called ""Traffic Trainig Bootamp""  He made the course sound appealing and promised to start it in January of 2013.  I also mentioned that he had a link tracking system that he would include at no extra cost in this course.
He gave us assignments to do in the meantime and said he would be in touch with each of us to help him plan his agenda.
In January, I put in a support ticket to see if he had a date set and I received a message that he would be in touch.  That was the last time I received any reply.
I have left several updates on his support site and even opened an additional ticket.  I left a phone message as well.  But so far have not received any response.
I finally asked PayPal to refund the money and after they did their investigation they denied my claim stating that since it was a ""virtual"" product they can't refund.  
I don't know what is more upsetting....the fact that someone can use PayPal to sell bogus web courses or that PayPal allows it.  I am sure PayPal makes a commission from each transaction, but it can't be enough money for them to condone this fraud.
Today I attended another of Sterling s webinars in the hope that I could get a message to him while online.  He did see my posts and responded some of them as thought everything was fine.  He had the advantage of being the only person who could see my posts, so the other attendees were in the dark about my problem.
He remained calm and cool and said he would look into it, and I hope that he does.  I am still hoping that he will make good on his promise, but am slowly losing confidence that this will turn out well.
I did not look into his past dealings or ask anyone in the community about him, so he has not blocked me from using the sites I paid for.  I will refrain from any further negative press until I give him a little longer to make this right.									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

I have had problems communicating with my printer. Sometimes the software dose'nt reconize the usb port therefor can' find the printer.
I have also had many compatability problems with software that is supposed to work with Windows XP but dose'nt.
You name it I have had it.  I am well past my 30 days so they won't even consider a refund or replacement.
The last problem was in the sound system and they sent me a new motherboard and had a tec. install it just yesterday.  Needless to say, it didn't solve the problem.  I've very upset,since I can't afford to replace this system with one that works.

										I purchased the Telepc in March to develop my mortgage business. The promise of 30 to 40 loans a month being developed out of this system sounded promising. I (being conservative) figured 5 a month which would still be pretty good. 
I received the machine and immediately had to wait for 3 weeks to get support because Andy, my sales man, had a trade show to attend. I figured out how to get the system up and running myself but still had some questions. After one full month, I received my first technical support and got some kinks worked out. 
Since that time, I have placed somewhere in the vicinity of 10-15 calls for support to ""Andy"" my sales rep and as far as I can tell the only person at AMT Group, Inc. I have received 1 call back to help me. Immediately after that call I had another question and Andy had mentioned he would be a trade show again and leaving the following day. I called back on the tech number and paid for my long distance to recieve one more bit of information to be again greeted by an answering machine.
I have never heard from Andy again. I have called repeatedly and never received on call back. I paid $9900 for this system which he generally sells for $20,000! I guess once Andy gets the money he forgets about his customers. Well, I don't forget when I spend that kind of money and if you are thinking about buying this product, don't expect any service afterwards.

Is it the usual practice of this company to harass independent contrators at this time in the morning. Puerile egos would dictate an overcoming urge to gain information at 2 a.m., when financial whoes are indicative of a poor company structure, (and their administrators) to relate and resolve sales matters with their independant contractors.

I asked them to return me my money, but they staooped answering my calls.

Is there any way I can get it, or, at least, part of it& I would be extremely grateful to you for your help since I badly need this money for my daughter's doctor (she really needs it because of her health issues!).

										I received a call from this company in February 2008.  I had been looking for an online business opportunity and this seemed ideal.
I spent over $5,000 on ""promised"" advertising, guaranteeing over 30,000 ""hits"" to my website.  I was given a user name and password, which worked just One time.  When I tried to reach them, I never received a return phone call.  I entered into a dispute with this company regarding what they had promised, and what was Not delivered, in an effort to obtain a refund.
Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful with my credit card company.  I was never able to reach this company again to, at least, get a correct user name and password.  Consequently, the original website they set up was Never changed, and I had no opportunity to change any of the ads as I was told I could.
I am hoping that Someone will get involved in closing this company.  It is the ultimate ""Rip-Off"" ~ As with many companies, once they get your cash, they suddenly no longer offer the wonderful technical support they promised.
What a shame that there are people in this world that are able to do this to those of us that are just trying to make a living and they have no conscience whatsoever.
Watch out for this company!!!

										I received a call one day from a representative of Economic Freedom Corporation.  I don't believe he was from the company, but was a paid  salesman.  He told me many wonderful things about how much money I could make.  I asked a lot of questions, but was convinced by what he said. I purchased the program and was mailed a glossy package of information that seemed to have little to do with what I was told. A day or so after receiving the package, I received another call. This one was from F Marketing.I was told that if I wanted to make money more quickly, I needed to sign up for their marketing program. They would have me in profit in 30 days.  They would do the marketing and I should get my money back in 60 days. With the extra profit I could order more leads. I purchased 6000 leads with the guarantee in writing that they would complete fulfillment within 30 days and if they did not they would run the campaign again. Leads would be uploaded to the back office and/or mailed to me within 30 days. This was on July 28, 2010. I have heard nothing since. The last time I looked several days ago I had received 13 leads.  I never heard from F Marketing again. I sent emails to Economic Freedom Corp support only to find out it was not a valid email address. I did talk to someone at Economic Freedom Corp and he told me that he would contact F Marketing and have them contact me. It never happened. I have left messages several times and my calls were never returned.These are not companies to be trusted at all. The whole thing is a well planned rip-off.",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										I received a phone call from a telemarketer telling me that they will advertise my small business for free on a ""local"" search engine. They told me that they would be sending me a blue envelope with all the details within one business week. They had called me again to ask if I had received my packet, and I hadn't. 
I finally received a letter in the mail four weeks later with no contact info, thanking me for my subscription that would cost me $50 per month. They left me with no way to contact them in this packet. I received another call from them asking if I was happy with my subscription. 
I had not received any hits to my website or any phone calls and during my last phone conversation, I mentioned that I would like to cancel my service with them and at this point I was told that it was a free service and that I would not be charged for this subscription. On my next phone bill, I was charged the $50 for my free subscription. 
To this day, my business is not listed on their website. I searched on Bigcityyp.com for my business by name, type of business and address but nothing comes up. I feel that I was grossly misinformed about the cost(s) and type of service and have still not received a single phone call from this service.  This is a very misleading service.

										I received a phone call from a very friendly and what seemed like a genuine guy who wanted to sell me advertising space on Facebook. While I am slightly dubious about online adverts I thought it might be an interesting thing to try given the fact Facebook had just listed. I was very wrong and quickly realised this was a scam. They ask for your credit/debit card to take the first month's payment and then do not answer any phone calls - you just get a recorded message saying they are busy. The replies to emails are very sporadic and not in line with what you have written. I don't believe the advert they say they have created even exists and there is no evidence that it goes on Facebook. The contract they send is very dodgy with ridiculous clauses for getting out of the contract - clearly aimed at trying to trap you. They ask for a recorded letter stating that you no longer wish to receive their services and this must be done 2 days before the contact expiry date etc. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CARD DETAILS. I had to cancel my card and have asked my bank to now help get the money back. 									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										I received a phone call stating I asked for more informatin on working from home.
They gave me all the information and prices and I was to look it over and get back to them. 
The names of the busineses were Ebay, Amazon and Pharmacy RX and the prices were a little steep so I chose two, received a call back stating I could get all three for $100.00 more totaling $299.00.  I then gave them my credit card number.
Theysaid they were going to send all the paperwork, they did and I filled it out and sent it back and I put delievery confirmation and my first response was: no such address but days later I checked again and it was delivered.
I tried calling them and only get a busy signal.  Went online to see if I could find anything and I saw ""scam""  all over the place.

										I received an email from Yellow US Pages today with an invoice for $892.59. I was contacted a few months ago to try a free 60-day trial of the service and was told that I would be contacted when the free trial was over and would be able to cancel my trial at that time if I decided to do so. I was never contacted and apparently, the free trial ended and since I did not cancel, I was billed for a 1-year contract. 
I received a phone call later the same day from a blocked number from their collection agent Jennifer Morrow. I informed her that I was told I was to be contacted at the end of the free trial and she said that they do not offer that service.

										I received an email stating I could win multiple park tickets. 
After looking into the email, I found that it required submitting to a survey.
I opt to submit to the survey and found that I was also required to commit to two purchases within the survey. By accepting the two offers, you would have completed the survey and thereby entitled to the original offer of free park tickets.
After completing the required steps, the offer was never finalized. I have submitted several emails and each of the responses were the same. 
The company assured me they would ship the tickets; they were just short on tickets and it would take longer than expected.
I have a confirmed ship date on May 3, 2007 and it states to allow 6-8 weeks. This is now the middle of August and I have not received the park tickets.

										I received credit voucher offer towards purchase of a laptop computer, and I mailed check# 6666 for the balance of $239.95. On Sep 23, 2011, I received a letter from the Sweepstakes Clearing House that my check was returned. When I went online to check my Bank of America account, I found out that the said check was in fact paid/posted on Sep 22, 2011. 
On Oct 3, 2011, I got impatient waiting for the laptop, so I called customer service at (214) 915-7100, talked to a ""Wally"", and he requested me to send him a printed copy of Bank of America's posting information and actual picture of the check. On the same day, Oct 3rd, I emailed him the information.
Today, Oct 17, 2011, I called again customer service and was able to talk to a ""Terrence"". I referenced to him the Oct 3rd email where I enclosed a printed copy of Bank of America's posting details and picture of the check# 6666. [continued below]....
									
										..... Terrence told me that he cannot honor it, instead, he wants me to send copy of my bank statement.
I consider it ridiculous for 2 reasons: 1st, I don't want to send him my bank statement, as I consider it private information; and 2nd, they have accounting/office staff who can immediately reconcile and check on their company's bank account to confirm that in fact my check has cleared and posted in its account on Sep 22, 2011.
Is this just a ""delaying tactic"" on their part? I responded to their offer on Sep 4, 2011, and it has been over a month now, and I have not yet received my laptop.",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

Darlene
Muskego, WisconsinU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										I received my phone bill today and to my surprise there where two charges that I did not recognize.  One charge was $12.95 from a company called Coast To Coast Voice, and the other charge was $24.90 from RSN Enterprises.
When I phoned the numbers listed for both companies, they immediately asked me my name, address and the phone number I was calling for.  I believe I was being recorded, but I was unable to verify it.  After speaking with representatives from both companies I was advised that someone, went on the internet and input my personal information, which authorized them to charge my phone bill.  I was completely outraged and expressed it to both companies then phoned AT&T to inquire why charges are made to my account without my authorization.  AT&T did not have any answers other then to tell me that they can't control third party charges.  I suggested they implement an email system for charges that are made on the internet by third partiies, be verified prior to being charged to the customer.  I was told to write the public utilities commission.  I don't agree that customers are responsible for paying for charges that they don't authorize.  I was advised by both companies that I would get a credit in one to three months, but in the mean time I have to pay the current bill, how is that fair.

In May of 2007 I get calls from Superpages, regarding 'my account'.  Seems like advertising calls so I ignore them.  Big mistake.  They send my 'account' to collections.

He tells me that the 'account' is in arrears to the tune of $1900.00.  Outrageous!!  Apparently as he and those at Superpages idearc explain, the account was set up as a paid account, a credit card number was used that was declined.  According to an Idearc rep, the terms and conditions apparently state that if a card is declined that a bill will be sent anyway to the listed address.  (I don't recall ever giving them my CC and when I ask for the number they have, they do not respond.)  The address listed was my home address except that the city was wrong so these 'bills' are never received by myself.  For a year and a half they apparently send these 'bills' without ever thinking to cancel said UNPAID account.  just letting them pile up for the final coup d' grace!  My dealing with Anthony Oden of MB&W is difficult as I am so outraged that I try and argue my case with him and he keeps hanging up on me.  A tactic I'm sure he is taught to confuse and unbalance.  He finally gets me on the phone with a Superpages rep and I begin to explain the emails and my lack of any proof of financial liability.  The gal brings up the fact that a CC number was given, I ask for the number and Anthony Oden begins laughing at me, ""You gave a CC card and you didn't expect to be charged?""  I ask again for the number and there is no response.  The rep is purposefully unhelpful and keeps repeating the Terms and Conditions mantra over and over like a parrot.
Finally, I paid the entire $1900 just to be done with the harassing calls and to preserve my credits good standing.
I believe Idearc media Superpages is deceptive and begins to charge those who sign up for it's 'Free' business listings.  Their terms and conditions more than likely state this. People don't expect to be charged for something they obviously had no intention of buying in the first place.  Terms and conditions should not be the hiding place for subsequent charges to a free registration.

The gal brings up the fact that a CC number was given, I ask for the number and Anthony Oden begins laughing at me, ""You gave a CC card and you didn't expect to be charged?""  I ask again for the number and there is no response.  The rep is purposefully unhelpful and keeps repeating the Terms and Conditions mantra over and over like a parrot.
Finally, I paid the entire $1900 just to be done with the harassing calls and to preserve my credits good standing.
I believe Idearc media Superpages is deceptive and begins to charge those who sign up for it's 'Free' business listings.  Their terms and conditions more than likely state this. People don't expect to be charged for something they obviously had no intention of buying in the first place.  Terms and conditions should not be the hiding place for subsequent charges to a free registration.

										I registered with a company on the web, www.surveypro.com to do what they called paid surveys.  A Michael Hetzer from surveypro mailed me to say I had earned an ipod and asked me for my mobile no.  Within seconds I was receiving text messages that they have charged 1.50 for.  
They sent one every 2 seconds before I realised what they were doing.  After emailing me Michael Hetzer will not mail me back and just returns my mail.
The money was taken by a company joined with surveypro called celldorado - -www.celldorado.com.  They are also in with a company called Blinck.  They are based in Croatia. Pho: 08453588000.

										I responded to an email about making money online a few months ago. I requested more information and was called on the phone by a man named John, who told me about a ""wonderful"" business opportunity to make money for a company named GNMall by emailing individuals and selling webpages, which the company would design. I was told that any ""idiot"" could do this...it required no skills other than knowing how to email. I was also told that there would be a one-time $3000 investment, but that no other investment would be required. It was insisted that I put this on a credit card and was told that I would be able to make this money back in time to pay the credit card bill. I was also told that the package I would receive would contain a disk with thousands of names of individuals to email about these web pages. I was desperate for money, since I had just gone through a costly divorce and been left with a child to raise and had been conned out of everything I had worked for during the last 30 years of my life. I was also fighting the IRS over a tax bill that was not mine, so I needed extra money to just keep my son and me going. When I received the package, I found that more money was required to just get into this and that there was no guarantee that I would make anything. There was also no disk with names to email. I contacted the company and got no response. I looked up Internet Scams on my computer and the company GNMall was one of the first to appear. The full company name is Global Network Mall and is run by a corporation called Dockingbay. The address is 800 S. Nova Road, Suite C, Ormond Beach, FL 32174. I think other people should know about this scam. I should have known that there was something wrong when I was pressured to sign up right then. I was told that there were only a few opportunities for sales consultants, and if I didn't act now, they couldn't promise me that I could get into it later. I learned the hard way that when something seems too good to be true, it probably is.									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										I saw a sign on the internet saying make 3,000 to 5,000 a mo.  I pressed on the ad.  I then was told by the service person to go to ""www.mycards.com"" and fill out as many cards as possible. I was on the phone with this person the whole time while doing this.  When I got to the part where the card questions asked how much I make a yr.  The guy told me to 60,000.00 a yr. because after all that is what I would be making.  now 
I proceeded to tell this man that I was an owner of 2 credit cards and rarely used them as I am newly divorced with a teenage daughter still left in my care.  I told him that I was an at home mom for 20 yrs. and that I had very limited funds available to get along in life with.

										I searched around on the internet for someone to provide a quality emailing list so that I could put my products in front of dentists.  Listsyoucanafford.com, affordablemarketingtools, whatever they are really called, had a good price, and a so called 90% deliverable rate on their email marketing materials.  A few red flags came up, so I should have known better.  Don was unresponsive and unhelpful in answering my questions.  But the price looked so good!  So I put my credit card in the system, and bam, a few hours later my ""marketing lists"" came over.  The problem was that these lists were NOT what was promised.  My ""Dentists List"" had some dentists in it, however, most of the contacts were not dentists at all.  They were non-professional contacts, admin contacts for companies that were very loosely associated with dentistry... most importantly, the majority were NOT dentists.  I looked at the other two lists I had purchased from this internet scamming company, and they were all chock full of filler as well.  The insurance contacts were not agents, or for the main not even really connected to the insurance business.  AOL addresses, hotmail addresses... NOT BUSINESS CONTACTS.  So I did what any sane person would do.  I sent them an email saying that the lists weren't acceptable, and that I was going to charge the purchase back on my credit card. I'd have left it at that, just another unhappy customer.  Then I get this email in reply, not even a loosely veiled threat to libel my company for being dissatisfied with their bogus product.  They literally threaten to defame my name and my company by ""blasting"" everyone in their database.  If anyone out there receives an email from this company defaming my mailing list company, I strongly urge you to contact ripoff report so that I can be notified, there would be reward in it for sure, as it would be a slam dunk libel case.Stay away from this company, they are scammers of the worst kind, and they will threaten to wreck your company's good name.Here is the email they sent me in reply, copied and pasted:You're entitled to your opinion and your proposed remedy.

										I signed on with this group.  What they claim is that people use superpages.com to find local businesses.   I told them I never heard of them, but the rep claimed that their fees are low compared to google or yahoo and they are going to do a lot of advertising so that they will be able to compete with them.
Bottom line, its a pay for click deal.  The tag line they used for my business was idiotic!  I asked them, at least 3 times to change it.  They failed, all the  time!
I am in a highly regulated field, and the smallest detail in advertising can get me in trouble.  I explained that to them, or rather tried, and they ignored me.  Eventually, I was forced to freeze my accounts.  I gave them ample opportunity to do so.  
The contract I signed forces me to pay them $40 a month.  I was paying this big company $40 a month for NOTHING!  If they delivered what they verbally said they would, I would be grateful.  Instead I am here, telling anyone and everyone, that pay for click is a big waste of money, especially with superpages.  Superpages is a very dishonorable company, and I am sure they outsource their jobs to India.  How else can a person explain the broken English for my tag line?!  
 When I asked, they claimed that they do not outsource to India, yet I have called customer service at times and sometimes hear that Indian accent.  Nothing against Indians, this is about how they hire people who do not know American English well enough to convey my tag lines ad verbatim!  Instead they write gibberish?!?!

										I signed up along with several partners with StoresOnline just recently. I have a lot of background technically speaking, but no effective Internet marketing aresenal, so the presenation was impressive to me.
The examples were plausible, but impressive, and the presentation was positive and informative. The people were very kind, and put on a beautiful front for the company. They all came across as happy company people, even speaking of their own personal successes using the company's products.
They spoke of Overture's keyword suggestion tool and other tools for internet marketing that are very useful and impressive.
I noticed shortly after going online, I couldn't repeat their examples from overture, and had no success with their www site examples, besides one that was mentioned about ink jet cartridges, but that site was barely even functional from a user standpoint.
This still didn't phase me, I sluffed it off as a time issue, what with the speed of the ether and all.
I browsed through their ""exclusive marketing resources"" which were helpful, and informative. I tried using their interface, which was a bit ""clunky"", read the manuals, etc. 
They boasted an additional training session with signup, but when I called to sign up they said I ""just missed the one in my area"" I asked for a schedule of them in other areas, as I do travel consistently, and they could not provide one.
The support representative kept insisting I tell them where I am going and they will tell me if and when one is occuring there. They then said there would be a DVD and promised to ship me one.
The release date was said to be ""Mid April"". Still no sign of it. Calls to their support number land me either a dropped call, or a recording. The online support is useless. 
But despite all of this, having invested upwards of $5000 for 6 storefronts, I bit the bullet and worked through it, managed to get a storefront up and online, advertised, and actually making money! Already visions of being a success story for this operation. Been up 2 weeks, with substantial growth and growing sales.
Then this. Wednesday I see from my statistics screen in their interface (which does not give page counts or even tell you which pages were visited, according to support) that I have 0 visitors. I check my marketing and know this to be untrue. 
I chat support, they claim server problems and insist its 
""being worked on and should be fixed by the end of the day"". I let this go, and then Thursday receive an email from a customer stating they could not process their credit card transaction.
I contact ECI, who apparently are a joint venture partner. (Storesonline claims to have special discount processing rates via a deal with ECI) After testing, they insist it's Storesonline, and even go so far as to say that it happens often.
I believe the above gives sufficient background to the following chat transcript from a few minutes ago.
Started: Sat 19/Jun/2004 10:40 A.M.
Ended: Sat 19/Jun/2004 11:24 A.M.
Hello and Welcome to Customer Support. For Privacy and Security of your account, may I please have your Customer #, or VIP #? 
851416 , *address*, *phone*
Kindly hold on as I check on your account. 
Thank you for the information, please address your concern. 
My storefront has not been able to process sales now for 3 days. Probably more. I am told by support each consecutive day that it is being worked on and should be fixed by the end of the day We are dead in the water. We can not process credit card transactions. Heck, I can't even see my statistics. This is completely unacceptable.
We greatly apologize for this, Joseph. We had a server error these past few days and the storefronts are affected. Please provide me the license# of the site concerned and I will have this noted for review. 
I just told you the license number, AND I entered it into the form before I clicked chat. It's still 851416
I appreciate your position, Jean, and I do not fault you or support, obviously it isn't directly your fault. If it takes 3+ days to fix an error then I have further questions about your technicians. Yes, the error lasted for three days in a row and we apologize for this, if you want some details about this, you may call (801)227-004. 
The point remains, I still can't process transactions. Will that phone call tell me when it will be fixed?
Storesonline is a public company is it not? What is the ticker symbol? ""I may call (801)227-004""?? Do I have to guess the last digit? Sorry for that, the number is (801)227-0004. 
All I get at that phone number is a recording.
A recording telling me that support is closed and that I can leave a message for the next business day. Does this mean that my storefront will be down at least until monday? We are a brand new store, just live 2 weeks ago. We have seen increasing traffic, and have had growing sales. This downtime is doing irreparable damage. 
Have you checked this issue with ECI? 
Yes, twice. They insist it's not them. And I believe them. The issue seems to be that my storefront is not allowing a connection out to ECI.
I get an ""authorization failed"" page almost immediately. 
It's as if the connection from the storefront out to ECI is dead. Whatever that might involve,  connection strings, hardware, etc... I thought it might be our setup, except that we have run tests in the pass successfully, and have successfully processed transactions and sold goods. We have not touched that part of the storefront  At least not since we set it up and tested initially. I believe that this is because of the server error, I will have this noted immediately for review. 
You speak as though this error is fixed, but as of 15 minutes ago I still could not process credit card payments on my site. I need more than review notes, Jean. Is there someone else I need to speak with about this that can help me?  I am sorry for this but the Changes and Department is off on weekends. 
Above all, it angers me further that I had to be informed of the problem by a ""potential customer"" and surely a ""lost customer"" who sent an e-mail berating the fact that our site credit card processing does not work.
Changes and Department is off? Does that mean that my storefront has absolutely no chance of being fixed for another 2 days? You may want to have a manual process of the orders as of now. so noone is even working on this problem?
My storefront has been down now 3 days+, I have numerous support chats on record for EVERY day I was aware of it, I was told it was being fixed EVERY day  by support, and now I am told it will NOT be fixed because people are
off? 
So, you just leave servers broken on your days off?
Is this the kind of business I invested a lot of money into? What is the name of StoresOnline's parent company?
Galaxymall. 
I am now trying to order form your site, please hold. 
I suggest that you make a manual transaction with your customers as of now as I have no way of fixing this for you. I will try my best to have this checked later by one of our programmer. 
When later? 
I will try my best to have this checked today. 
I thank you, Jean. Though you should let your superiors know that I am one very unhappy customer, and that I will let others know about this.
I apologize for the inconvenience, Joseph. I will have your request noted. 
Please email me as soon as you have any information for me. Email me at scaffoldsales@aol.com

										I signed up for a free trial for a home business kit, knowing that I'd have to cancel in within 7 days. I put my credit card number in expecting a charge of $1.95. 
One day later I recieved a phone call from this company saying that the charge of $1.95 never went through and could he please have my credit card number again. I said no, and that I'd changed my mind. Since this person said it never went through in the first place, I never had reason to think I needed to cancel it. 
Lo and behold, my next credit card statement showed a charge of $1.95 AND $69.95! I immediately called the company and explained the phone call I recieved, only to be told that the person who called me was a telemarketer and has nothing to do with them. They said they would not refund me! All of this is extremely suspicious, as if the company has designed ways to ensure everyone is charged that $70 initially.
After numerous calls and messages to supervisors, the best I was able to get was a partial refund of $34.50. If this has happened to you, do not let it go!!! Be assertive and threaten to contact the Better Business Bureau. Constantly leave messages for supervisors or demand that you speak with them if they are available. A partial refund is better than no refund. Never do ""business"" with these scam artists!!

										I signed up for Instant Paid Surveys using Click Bank to pay as was the only option. I was immediately given access to many survey sites, but did not have time to begin survey taking. I tried to access the Instant Paid Survey site one week later to begin work, but was unable to get anything but the Home Page. I was given an address for help with Instant Survey, but the Home page to sign up was all that would be available.
 After trying many times and being very frustrated I found your site where I read that others had the same issue with these companies. I called the number for Click Bank given by one of your writers 208-489-3300. I spoke to Rex at ext.3343 who assured me that Click bank has a 56 day refund policy, that I could have found the 800 number if I had continued on the pay page for Instant Survey ( I hadn't looked), that they were sending an e-mail to Instant Survey for me, and that the reason that I could not reach the support site for Instant Survey was because it is an e-mail address, not a web site ( I am new to computer use) Rex maintains that I should hear back from Instant survey in 48 hours and if not, I can call him back at Click Bank and get my $34.95 refunded.
If Rex is not lying, I expect to have this matter resolved. I will write back in 3 days or so and let your readers know the result.

										I signed up for Paul Cohen's Credit Defense League Debt Elimination Process. Mr. Cohen had assured me that his process works and he has had 100% success. That statement could not be further from the truth.
From the start of his debt elimination process, he stated that I would not need an attorney that using his process, I would be able to stay out of court. Since using his process, I am in financial ruin. His process has racked up another $15,000 in penalties and fees. Paul Cohen is one to not be trusted, he will lie and cheat to get at your wallet.
Stay away from Credit Defense League and Paul Cohen!

										I signed up for the 3 offers required for the Playstation 2 and there website said I qualified and to print the voucher and send it to them.  I mailed it to them and the website changed to saying they received my voucher and they have shipped the Playstation 2. The website changed back to needing to send my voucher again after less than a week.  I've sent them multiple emails and have never heard anything from them.
I would say this company is a huge scam because they never respond to email and there phone number is just voicemail.

										I signed up for their product then decided the next day I did not want it so I called and cancelled. They said they had sent the product out, and when I recieve the product, just send it back to the address on the email. Then I would be re-embersed. 
When I received the product two days later I sent it back to them unopened. I basically refused delivery. Which I know other businesses know when they get a product back. Why don't they?
It has been over a month ago and still nothing! It cost me $49.00 for the product and $5 S&H. They say that you pay for shipping. Thats fine! I just want my $49.00 back.
I feel that I have been scammed and that upsets me. Their isn't any good people out there.

										I signed up in good faith with this company, in the hopes that it would allow me to earn extra income while working from home.  I worked with them for over 2 months until I became sick and had to be hospitalized for an extansive period of time.  Because of this situation, I would be unable to have access to a computer.  I called the company to ask for a refund of my investment and to be released from their activity list. They refused, even I explained my situation.  Several days later, I received a call from them saying that they would not release me from my contract with them.  They would only put my account on hold.

										I signed up to join an internet home business with  Jay S Schrader on Tuesday 17 April 2012, paying US$97.95.
Once I had done that, a response came via the internet suggesting that a further sum of money could generate further opportunities. I didn't like that, nor did I like the 'spiel' given in the video with some man advertising all his excessive material gains.
As a result, I responded to the addressee, Jay S Schrader, saying that I didn't want to join after all and would like a refund under the terms described in his internet literature. I also said that if he wasn't the right person to action this, then to please pass it on to the appropriate person.
Yesterday evening,18 April,  I received a telephone call possibly from Jay S Schrader confirming my membership. I said that I had changed my mind and for cultural reasons wanted a refund. He agreed to this.

I signed up for that and only had to give my Visa card for shipping and handling ( $ 3.87 ).  I later noticed a charge for $49.67 from a Sellers Lounge company, and $39.95 for a SUBMIT SOLUTION company.  I didn't want services from these companies nor did I authorize additional charges from these companies.

										I signed up with Skyway last Nov.  They represented installation service for CA. at $149.  After taking payment for a year they could not come up with someone to install.  I had to install on our three story house.  I find the cheaper download service to be very slow.  Tech support never returns calls.  I am unable to upload a lot of files as they do not have the right so called ports in their system.  I use MobileMe for six years now and with Skyway it is structured to where I just cannot upload share photo files.  They refuse to refund any unused service on my cancelling the contract.  Yet they cannot provide what I always had with out in the country phone line internet service.  I just never knew that there were servers that did not have the required so called ports which limits the sending out of files.  I cannot use my MobileMe share file service.  Skyway cannot provide what forever has been normal satellite service yet they refuse to refund my year of prepaid service.  I should have caught on when they required a one year contract.  Sign up with them and you are stuck.  Cannot wait for the year to be up and move to another service.  The required one year contract really says it all.  Spend a few bucks more and get far better service.

										I signed up with this company the beginning of 08. In their first initial letter to me stating act now they were looking for 75 distrubutors in my area.  for 147.00 I would get flyers new letters a outfit and other materials. well I did get all the paper work, but the outfit was actually a tee shirt. When I called and told them they made a mistake, the female told me it was no mistake they send all their clients tee shirts. It plainley stated outfit in the advertisment package they mailed me, to show the quality of their merchandise. 
As far as their leads go it's a bunch of crap. Alot of the leads they sent me for an additional price had nothing to do with clothing. Plus the female was rude and unconcerning, plus once these people get your money, you hear nothing from them. Only when you call. I think their gimmick is the kit and nothing much else. They also had the nerve, about 6 months down the road they to sent me another letter stating the same thing. I said well d**n,  don't they know who who was foolish enough to signed up with them the same pitch. This company is truly a waste of money

										I signed up with this company to produce SEO results for my company. They have a great phone sales pitch and the online walk through sounded great. Unfortunately I have never found my company in a online search. I was told during the sale there was no contract and when I tried to cancel my service they will not let me out because of a 12 month contract. I spent $500 for a customized web site built for me. This is the most generic website I have ever seen and I have found 2 other sites with the exact same layout, pictures, comments, etc. I had another company come in and look over the website Synergy built me. He showed me the back coding for my site and there was nothing! I found these other sites from friends that posted their own address on Facebook and I clicked on it. I could not find their site in a search either.
As for my add words, they decided to use trademark names in the add words which is illegal. Now I can't get Google to show results for my company at all. These guys are hard to get in touch with and even harder to get results from. If you are thinking of going with them your better off flushing your money down the toilet, at least you won't be stuck in a contract. 
I regret ever doing business with them and hope you are smart enough to go with anyone else.									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										I signed up with this company under the promise that I could access an unlimited number of leads for my personal use.  I verified multiple times that I could download as many as I needed, however I would need to check off as many as I needed on a one by one basis.
I saw no issue with this.  As a sales person who needs tens of thousands of possible leads monthly, this seemed like the perfect product for me.  I agreed to sign up and paid the initial fee.
After about two weeks, I noticed that after downloading 1000 leads a day the system would slow down.  At first I thought it was a computer issue, so I called and they told me it was, and that it would be fixed.  I then tried again and miraculously the problem was fixed.
Then a couple days later, the same thing occured.  I called again, spoke with a different person.  They then explained to me that the system was designed to only disperse 1,000 leads a day, so if I used more that I would just have to deal with the slowness.  Since I was in a 12 month contract, I decided I would just do as they said- deal with it.
A month later, they claimed they were doing ""Updates"" to the service.  It was about this time that I needed 10,000 names for a mailing I was doing.  I then started clicking through all the names I needed.  Once again it started slowing down.  Then it started some new thing- a ""compiling list"" slowdown page.
Let me give you a tad more background that helps explain this better.  On this site you can only select 1000 records at a time, then download them, then select the next 1000, and so on.
Ok, so I got to about 4,000, and it slowed down again.  This time it had the ""compiling list"" message I stated above, with a progress bar.  I waited, and it took almost 10 minutes each time.
Then when I hit 8,000, it did it again, only this time it did it on a continuous loop.  I thought I would humor it and see how long it would take.  It ended up taking almost 8 hours to realize it would not let me download it.
I then wrote and complained.  They then stated that in the contract I signed, under the very small print, that they had the right to slow down service, and the right to stop downloads if they deemed it excessive.
Now correct me if I am wrong, but I had an implied impression when speaking with the sales associate that I could get all the leads I wanted as long as I clicked on each lead.  Secondly, everytime you log in, it specifically states ""Unlimited Sales Leads!"" on EVERY page.
If they have the right to slow down and essentially stop the transmission of leads, how is this unlimited?  Is this not deceptive advertising?
Therefore, this company is a scam, a waste of money, and definitely needs to change their marketing practices.

										I signed up with this PeerFly company, and was only going to do some marketing. I got approved, and since I'm fairly new, I asked some questions, and proposed some ides. What I was doing is information that I don't necessarily want to share with everyone, and I gave him a skeleton scenario of my BASIC strategy. No matter what I said, he was unusually interested in exactly what I was doing, and I can see why, but it's MY information and I didn't want to share the whole process, so I gave him a little more. It became increasingly obvious that he was REALLY curious about what I had planned, I knew because he was lying to me and interpreting things in a way that would ONLY benefit his greed. I got sick of it, and said ""look, if you want to work with me, just help me along, otherwise there's no point in having an account if there is absolutely NO form of free advertising that you allow"". I hope he NEVER even sees his ROI, much less a profit. Now I'm thankful that he did cancel me. I asked him to, and he just ""suspended"" the account, like his mindset was ""well, if I can get back on his good side, maybe I can get more info out of him"". I promptly said to CANCEL the account. I posted a little about my story on his ""blog"", but evidently someone was already out of bed and deleted it, like little punks do when they can. I say that, because I called him yesterday and he could barely even talk, like he'd spent an all-nighter doing SOMETHING, and this was about 1 - 2pm.

										I spent $150 for a web site which I would receive commission from buyers through my site for Amazon.com, Hotelclub.com, Windows Casino.com, and As Seen On Tv.  I received my web site, but they waited until I got my site to let me know I would have to pay for advertising and they had several packages to pick from ranging from $1000 to $20,000 depending on how many visitors you wanted guaranteed to your site. 
He discussed what he thought was right for me, but I told him I would have to discuss this with my husband.  He was supposed to send info in the mail but instead, he sent me an invoice for $6000.  Of course I didn't sign and return invoice, and tried several times to contact them.  
In four months I was only able to leave a message on their voicemail once.  They have never contacted me.  It's like they blocked my calls or something.  Part of the deal was to receive customer support and advertising manager 24 hours a day, yet I've yet to hear from them since the invoice.  I even sent a few e-mails and no response. 
I did not authorize this charge to my account and want my money back!  They already had my credit card number from the $150 charge for the web site.  They told me they were a member of Scam.com but when I checked on them I didn't see a list of names of legitimate companies; Only scammers.  I guess they were members of scam.com alright!

										I spoke with Shelly and she offered me four different options in advertizing my site.  She was a very smooth talker.   She convince me to buy a $10,000.00 plan that included 30,000 online advertising, 30 television commercial spots and 10 radio commercial spots.  She said if I didn't make my money back in 6 months that my money would be guarantee and I would get a full refund.  When I got the guarantee it said if the advertising company didn't fill there part in 6 months that I would get a full refund but I couldn't file for the refund until after 1 year and 1 month.  First month went by and I had over 2,000 hits to my site but made no money.  I called Dale Witcome and told him that I had brought on my site.  He said you did!  He said for me to e-mail the receipts and he would send it on to accounting.  A friend that works with my husband bought a apple I-Pad which cost over $400.00 and I have not seen any commision for that.  I think they are false hits to my site and anyone who buys from the site they keep the extra money.  Also there is Chris Potter, who is Quality manager,  he said I have been getting hits to my site and I now have TV commericals up advertising.  When I asked what stations he couldn't tell me and said he is waiting for afivadative from the TV sites and when he receives them he would send them down to me.  This has been over two months.  He send me a cd of my commercial but it had no sound to it so I asked for another and he has yet supplied me with one, even after several phone calls.  I have basically made nothing from this company and I am out of $10,239.00.

Unless you can give your Web address to someone to enter the links directly from your site, you will never receive a penny. It cannot be found by any other means.

										I thought I was the only one out there that thought I was ripped off and mislead about Omni Business Solutions.  I am terribly disappointed in how they suck you in and then spit you out and take your money and run.
I had signed up for a program that was for paid emails and they had there ad on there.  I was curious and signed up for it.  I got a call a few days later following up on my sign up.  I told them what I wanted.  They made it sound so good and so easy. So the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that it was a 4000.00 down payment to start. I told him I couldn't afford that.  So he dropped it down to 2000.00 and needlessly told me that they didn't do this for to many customers.  So I was very unsure about things and said okay gave him everything he needed to set me up with to start.  I knew that I had three days to decide whether or not I wanted to do it.  The very last day I was feeling very uneasy and wanted to back out and get my money back. I was going with my gut feeling that it wasn't a good idea so I called in telling them it just wasn't a good time for me and I would think about it and maybe try it in the future.  The salesman said ""you could be making 250,000 dollars by the end of the year"". I was mislead right there 250,000 dollars in one year come on.  You would have to be an expert at making websites and really know how to promote it.  
I was lead to believe that they would call you every week for one year and to help you succeed with getting your website up and running. She basically took me through the basics on how the web builder worked and taught the basics I already knew. I was totally shocked after 5 weeks that I was pretty much left on my own to swim with the sharks.  I was told to email, look at the SEO Guide, or contact the live chat.  The times I did call my coach after the 5 weeks I don't ever getting a phone call back to get help.  All I got was email with a bunch of links to take a look at.
It is now July and I started in January and I have made not one dime and nearly spent 5000 to 6000 dollars in the past 7 months.  I am very disappointed how companies like that can be pretentiously dangerous to the people like myself who dream of working at home spending more time with there families and they are taken advantage of and made to feel like they failed to the people around them that they love the most.  I know I feel this way I was taken advantage of and companies like this should have the decency to even refund you if you can't get the help you need.  This is completely wrong and bad for business.  
I hope that somebody else out there shares the same feelings as I do. I lost thousands of dollars to dishonest sales people and to a company that is making millions off of misleading information

										I thought this program was something I could do from home on my computer.  Because I am disabled, multiple sclerosis, I was unable to do all they asked of me.  I thought it was going to be general jobs on the Internet, but what I found out was we had to advertise our services in order to obtain work.  Unfortunately, I could not find this out until I paid the $42.05 and had access into the site which explains in detail what we had to do.  If I had known this before hand, I would have never paid $42.05, because I would have realized it was not something for me.  So, I called them repeatedly, sent numerous e-mails and got no satisfaction.

										I to was caught by this fraudulent company. However there was a way out in my case. The FTC ( Federal Trade Commission )has a 3 day cooloing off rule that applies in this situation. Because the product is being pitched as training or a instruction concept it falls under the cooling off rule. I received a cancelation confirmation letter from the company releasing me of  any obligations. Hope this is helpful. Good Luck

										I to was contacted by this company to earn money from home promoting both Dishpronto and Rapidsatellite. They were promising a good income and a really great price to get my websites up and going for a fee of $19.99 a month. I was told that if I wasn't satisfied I could cancel at any time. I called to cancel within 14 days and they stated that I would not be reimbursed for the $49.95 start up fee because that was stated in the buyer's agreement. I said fine then I want to cancel the web-hosting charge of the $19.99 a month and then they said that that would not be possible because the contract stated that I was in this mess for a year. When I had first spoke to the rep he told me I could cancel at any given time and I asked if I could cancel the web-hosting at any time he said yes you can just call our customer service department and they will take of that for you. Now of course they deny saying that at all and now I'm stuck paying a $19.99 monthy fee for the next year. Does anyone know if I could contact my Credit Card company and tell them not to honor the charge on my card? What would happen then and could that be done?

										I too just dealt with these scam artists.  Somehow they got not only my debt card number, but my work phone number, and charged me $4.95 for a ""Quick start home business kit"".  They left me an automated message on my work voicemail congratulating me on my purchase and advising it was in the mail. 
I called the 800 number left (800-497-4988) and after a long wait spoke to ""Sandra"".  I advised that I had never ordered such a product nor ever heard of her company and I wanted to know where they got my debit card number, address, and work phone number.  Like the person who posted before me, ""Sandra"" said she could not tell me from what source my information came, but that if I file a police report then the IP address that was used can be released to the police.  What?!?!?!  Obviously, my IP address was used, and these slime balls got my info from another purchase somehow.  She told me she did not know what web site was used to get my info as they use several, to include pop ups, etc.  
Bottom line--she says she cancelled the charge, but now I have to cancel my debit card, dispute the charge, and go through a lot of headache due to this dishonesty.  Who are these people???

										I traded referrals with someone who needed a free360xbox.com referral.  I needed a freeipods.com referral.  I clicked on his link xbox360s.freepay.com/?r=22674252 from an email he sent me.  I completed my offer and was credited for it, but his account didn't show that he was my referrer.
I contacted Freepay via their website, asking them to credit my referrer.  After beating-around-the-bush, they told me that I should've signed up via Interent Explorer, not Firefox, EVEN THOUGH THAT WAS NEVER MENTIONED IN THE TERMS & CONDITIONS.
After all, I had cookies, java, and html all enabled.  I signed up for the offer just minutes after signing up for free360box.com and was eventually credited.  This shows that this was NOT a browser problem on my part.
To add insult to injury (and cover their own rear ends), they added that I might have mis-typed the referral link EVEN THOUGH I CLICKED ON IT - THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR HUMAN ERROR.
I'm guessing this was a hiccup of their computer database, but I wouldn't put it past them to deliberately avoid giving credit to prevent my referer from getting his XBox.
They claim that their system hadn't had any problems, even though on January 21st @ 7:58PM (several days after I had signed up), I recieved a System.Data.SqlClient.Sql Exception error when trying to access their websites.  I saved the webpage for documentation purposes.
Their behavior is inexcusable - I had to open 7 separate inquiries on their website to even get a half-baked response shirking any responsibility.  They kept closing the message thread every time, even before the issue was resolved.
Thanks for your time.  I would appreciate any  advice or assistance you have in this matter.

There is no web page, the phone number I got from the Vistaprint customer care person was not right.  I am not having any luck with the cancellation process, and I'm beginning to think that there is no easy way out of this.

										I used Skyline Marketing's Lead Cloud program to source out the SEO of my company back in January of 2011. They had a 100% guaranteed refund if their customers weren't happy with the service. I decided to cancel it in May 2011 after getting no ROI. I received an email the 1st part of May stating that it was cancelled and placed a phone call to them about the $300 refund. Erik at Skyline said I would receive a check in 3-5 business days. Now it is July, I've contacted him over a dozen times and have received nothing but excuses from him.The initial excuse was they had my address wrong, then one month later it was that they had switched banks and were having problems issuing the refunds. I finally resorted to filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.The last phone call I placed to Erik at Skyline was the first week in July, informed him that I filed a complaint and that I would be hiring an attorney in their city to file suit against them.I would highly recommend not using Skyline Marketing. I'm trying to give as much exposure on this poorly ran and scammy company as possible.Just to reiterate, I have talked to Erik on the phone over one dozen times about the refund on the services I use and get nothing but excuses on why they haven't received the refund. I also gave them my bank routing number as they said they could do a direct deposit into my business account, that was about one month ago. My business takes credit cards so I gave him the option to refund me by card but he stated that they could not do this.Beware of Skyline Marketing located in Temecula, California.

										I used to work for the company, Financing Alternatives, based in Chesapeake VA.  I was fired for lack of performance, but I really didn't care because I didn't believe in thier program any longer.  They sell low end dell systems, the Dell 3000 series models, for 3 times its price to those who supposedly can't get approved through Dell.  Thier verbal contract is legal, but for it to continue, they have to have the written contract signed. Refunds given before on the single recording was for everything, minus the first payment.  They broke it up into three seperate recordings, so they could hold on to more money, so those on monthly payments got screwed the worst.
They prey on low income house holds, people on disablilty and those on SSI.  They mainly focused on low income black and hispanic communities, mainly in Alabama, Mississippi, Bronx NY, Georgia and southern parts of CA.  They attempted to run in high society white areas, but found that the marketing there was a waste.
I will say thier system/program is better than that of Blue Hippos (don't get fooled by them either), but it is still such a shame.  A 399-499 computer system, being sold for 1871.  Most people marketed to, have never owned a computer, and therefore, know no difference, but what the sales reps told them.  I, myself, was told by the company that these were top of the line computers valued at over 1500 dollars cash.  So they lied to me in the beginning.  Had I known this beforehand, I would have walked away.  I guess they have to keep a steady flow of people in.
I began doing research on my own, and found out alot of terrible things, but I could not lose my job, because I have my own family to support. I apologize to anyone to whom I have set up in this program.  I regret my blindness.  Please forgive me.
Financing Alternatives not only continues to debit your account after you cancell (they tell anyone ""up to 30 days to stop"", when anyone well knows it takes about a week for bank transactions to stop with anything).  They tell the customer it will be shipped out within 4 weeks after the 3 months of payments has been met, but it usually takes 6 months from the time of your first payment.  They are backed up ordering through Dell.  Should you continue into the program and finish your 52 weeks of payments, they will still continue to draft your account until you tell them to stop.  If you don't, or don't notice,  they will not inform you, and stop after about another month or so, and won't refund it.  The camera is not Kodak, nor is the printer Lexsmart. The go with what is cheapest and available.  Thier ""free"" programs can be found at computer stores...in the 5 dollar bin.
They promised all employees of 6 months or longer that they would recieve a free computer.  Of course they would tax us for 200 dollars on it, but that is Virginia Law.  I was there for 10, and never recieved a computer, even though they even had the newspaper do a story on it.  
I believe they lie on purpose, so that they can get people in the seats, and then every 6 months or so, wipe out the ""non-believers"" in exchange for new hires.  I was fired a week after a large job fair they had, where they hired 60 or so people.  I had no warning.
The company would use an automated call service that would call people and leave messages on thier machine stating that it is a pentium computer, when we were told to sell the celeron.  The recording states also, that ""call now. your computer is ready to be delivered right to your door"".  No mention of the 3 months. A little decieving, right?
There are a few word of mouth things I have heard, like the owner, George, is a huge coke fan.  But, I don't have any solid proof on that, other than he looked the part.
All in all, I advise people to not call in.  I am in a low income situation, and now have no job at the current moment.  I put myself in the place of all the people who have called in, and felt anguish over what I have done. Again, I apologize to everyone.  Financing Alternatives is not a great place to work, and advise anyone to just save up your own money, and purchase a system.

										I was called by US Online America Group one evening and was presented with an offer to set up some websites selling satellite services. It was high pressure, with them haggling over the fees to set up. When I requested this offer in writing, they refused and said I had to make up my mind then and there. When I was assured that I could cancel the order if not satisfied I went for it. How could I loose? I received an agreement that I had to sign and return ASAP. They sent emails to remind me to send them in. I even got a call with the bait that I had some sells go through but without my documents I wouldn't get paid. I had already sent those back. That's when I should have gotten out. But I was stuck, I looked over their contracts that I was sent and saw that I waived my right to cancellation by agreeing.
I did some waiting on the ""free coaching"" that I was to receive by reading some wasted bits of email. (Really generic) What sent me over the edge was when I got a call from my coach..a little later in game than I expected but whatever...he advised me that I can get my site advertised and should see a big jump in my site revenues(none yet according to him) What? What about my 2 sells that I had missed? We'll the technique for the advertising was the same as the initial call that got me into this predicament. He offered site traffic at the range of $1600-$6000 for packages that would drive higher exposure of my websites. I was another take it or leave it proposition. He could not supply me with any details in the form of an email or a webpage. He then began to argue with me over the whole matter. I began to realize to late for my own good that this was a scam. How would I ever even expect to get paid by these people when they didn't shoot straight? I know it my own fault for all this, but I am here to warn of this company and its practices. caveat emptor!

I was then told it would be a catlog to order my computer out of.  I infrormed the rep by the name of Lawrence barrow i wanted to cancel.  After being persistant for a minute he told me my order had been cancelled.
On July 8 my account was debited $299 and I followed a paper trace to a company by the name of Client Care Relations that told me I was supposed to call them to cancel.  They cant give me Future Com 's number. I was told by one of Client Care's supervisor's that it was illegal and unethical to debit my account after so long. 
He said that the company has a time frame to debit even though there was no record of a cancellation for me.  What happened to my cancellation request I dont know.  But Something will be done.  I do plan to contact an attorney.

It has been nine months & I have not received any payments and/or heard anything from the company. I was told that I would recoup my $6500 within a year if I followed their advice -- which I did!

										I was contacted by phone while at work for about 2 to 3 weeks until I finally was convinced to join this online business the man at phone#877-449-1621 stated he will teach me about market leveraging involving the use of my credit card & that it was better to use someone else's money to start this business & then pay it back every month as I made revenue from this site that will receive direct marketers & traffickers who are already proven to make purchases on line. 
I am a single parent going through a divorce & I was looking to find some extra  income 
to help at home with my new mortgage amount of $3,500.00 a month, and to also help with my (2) children's school expense.
I agreed to pay the $5,000.00 when he originally wanted $8,000.00 which I was not willing to take the chance with.
the site was a replicated site named www.onlinebizexpress.com that had three other sites for shopping, health, traffic & casino. where I was given the ID#10035 , & I was coached through the online process to see site hits & revenue created, product vendors & given a task of filling out the words associated with the browser.                  
Starting in the month of march, I was to start looking out for income from the month of April, there was nothing.
every month there after on the 16th of the month was when all earned revenue was to be posted, there was always nothing & every time I would call I was given a story from receptionist Michael & other women who covered for him during the so called lunch period.
A video was added they said to help visitors stay on site long enough to make a purchase. Then months after they added additional sites called drug store & vacations.
To this day I have not received a penny, I also received calls from another man who tried to calm me down when I called numerous time expressing my displeasure & have threatened them to return my money when I was told if I did not make my money back , the site will be advertised for another year at their expense stated in the original agreement.
Since 2007 started they have become non responsive & changed their number & stopped all activity at the sites.
I have also spent numerous hours creating a jump site to these sites that are no longer active or accessible.
Because I began calling them every day & they became upset over that.
I have in the past spent an additional amount of $500.00 printing fliers, cards & other forms of advertising for the site which yielded nothing in return, so $5,500.00 total spent & cant even contact them now so I am filing this report to allow others to be ware of this marketing solution business fraud.

										I was contacted by the company midday from a person named Kelly who said she was calling from the Facebook marketing department. She said ""You know Facebook you would have to live under a rock not to have heard of Facebook. Right?"" She went on to explain that my business had been selected in my area to represent the wedding industry on Facebook. I asked where she was located she said our offices are located in California in all the fun and sun. She said that they would make a Facebook fanpage  and that different ads would be made with my approval to go out to 3 million people daily. This all sounds great I thought. And what an honor to have Facebook pick me to call. Right? The price would be $150.00 per month for all this advertising.  Well the next day when checking my bank statement I noticed a $150.00 charge from Wholesale Internet Solutions and an additional charge of $50.00. I call the company back to speak with Kelly who tells me she's sorry that she forgot to mention the $100.00 set up fee which is billed in 2 installments but that she would credit it to my first months bill.

										I was contacted by U.S. America Online Group from Tempe Arizona. The salesman offered me a home based business oportunity by selling Dish Sattelite Services. He said it would involve setting up my own website which they would use to connect to their site adress the www.buymydish.com.
This stage was fairly inocent, costing my website the DOLARFASTSATELLITE.TV about $50.00/year and the affiliate site www.sateliteamerican.com/23105 about $19.98/mo.
Nothing happened for about 3 weeks when I got a call from Mr Chris Hagan and introduced himself as my future advertising manager. He said the present set up not likely would bring me any income and if I want to make money I have to spend money. He said they allready have a flash advertisement set up and they could run 7500 per six months for $3500.00. The ads would be connected to hundreds of retail stores such as Future Shop and other electronic outlets selling TV-s. He said he used to work for American Television Broadcasting. He said they would not give any guarantee but he known it works. I could not afford the kind of money he asked, but he talked to his boss Mr Burt Munney and the 7500 ads were sold to me for $1000.00.
He said I should not worry because even just 1 out of 100 will result in a service package buyer than I more than make my money. When more than 600 ads were delivered and I did not see any income I try to contact them but nobody was awailable to talk to me. Four E-mails sent to them were unanswered. The problem is the ad quite atractive you can view it yourself at buymydishtv but no sales made after near 2000 ads gone through.
It is posible that the sales actually made but pocketed by USOAG.
My Internet Knowledge not good enough to able to track down what is going on between the American Sattelite and USOAG and living in Canada made it harder.
I have spent more than US$ 1100.00 so far based on the words of salesmans from USOAG and resulted 0 income. They given me no opportunity to talk to them as soon as I wanted to discontinnue my ads. They would not reply my E-mails either.

										I was contracted by to do a site that was to be 'close to' an Aussie Internet marketing site. I realize making an exact copy while doable just wasn't cool. So I used the same layout and color scheme but made original images. Sorry I do have ethics.I even told him about this before hand and said this site will be similar but not exactly the same. I finished the site in about 3 days and email the man. No response. Email again several days. On Friday of last week I get strange notifications so I checked the server logs. Apparently he had hired someone else to clone MY site and then the put on a generic wordpress theme. Same content. Same Images. I confronted him in an email he didn't even deny it. I even asked WHY. I could have changed things.. he simply said 'I didn't like this'. Uhm... we had a CONTRACT. (Which I learned with Odesk.com as about as enforceable as toilet paper)While sending this issue to a collection agency is unworkable (I STUPIDLY relied on the Odesk.com contract system), taking him to small claims court is an option but he's across the country and I would have to BE there for small claims court.  Basically I was out the work and content for this website. I asked him repeatedly to remove my content from his site and he REFUSED. I finally had to go after Odesk.com (the job broker site) and his web-host (Go-daddy). After the better portion of three days raising all sort of ruckus. I got work he had removed my content from his site. I am still out the money. I repeat : DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS MAN. HE WILL SCREW YOU. After looking on his Odesk.com account (which really isn't easy to find ... and probably why he has uses it over other more legitimate sites (again hindsight is always 20/20).  He has posted 96 jobs and actually hired 13. When a contract is canceled (and it can be canceled by either party). It does not show as completed successfully. I STRONGLY SUSPECT that he has done this to other contractors many times. Although I cannot prove this. Result: Obviously I am switching to job brokers and changing my practice to ensuring there is NO WAY this can happen again. Namely no client as access to HTML and images (watermarked photo-shopped images of a web page and flash amimation only) until payment is made. I am also contacting a lawyer to make sure any NEW gigs have a contract that IS enforceable / iron clad and CAN be turned over to a collection agency. Again I repeat DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS MAN. If you are web designer or freelancer - Make SURE you have a contract and deposit before doing ANY work.Odesk.com (and I suspect most others) aren't worth a damn!

										I was first contacted by a telemarketer describing a great investment opportunity. When asked if interested was transfered to so called regional manager,called himself Kenny and Sarge, who said my investment was fully protected and I could get a full refund if not satisfied. I gave him a check by phone for $1200.00. I was then told to sign and fax in an authorization form that he e-mailed to me. He said he needed this form before he could get the website built and membership started. I never signed this agreement nor faxed it back to him. 
When I read this agreement, which is very vague and didn't say what was promised, I decided not to sign. I then did some digging and found that this company has had numerous complaints and accusations of fraud. 
As this happened on a friday, by the time I got to the bank on monday to stop payment on the check, it had already cleared the bank. To this point I have got nothing but runaround on my refund, even after faxing a refund request and returning the equipment within the 30 days alloted by Horizon Technologies for refund processing. 
This company may be legitimate, if they are they really do buisness in a sorry way. Any body looking at this company as an investment should be very careful. Just to call it as I see it, A snake in the grass, is a snake in the grass.

										I was frauded by New York E-Commerce Exchange slick wheeling and dealing and stealing company, headquartered out of Irvine, Californ-i-a ! Internet deal gone West, literally! It's part of the scam. But what really irritates me, is that the NEW YORK BBB refuses to list the complaints that merchants and consumers have filed regarding this fraudulent company.  Looks like they've been paid proper, eh, New York Better Business Bureau ? 
(see BBB Link below)
Here's the scam: Researching ECX for web e-commerce store selling items over internet.  New York contacts me by phone, I accept offer because I want a web site to work with - perhaps make a few bucks someday from it. 
I'm shown a demo of web sites to choose from, assured that when I get my personalized web site, I can re-design look/feel, and place ads on website and post offers for specials on items I'm selling. When the contract is paid off, the e-commerce store is all mine.  NOT!   
From here on everything is a nightmare - everything went wrong, too much to write it all in just this small report. I have now contacted the California Attorney General after digging deeper into the company (now that I know WHO they really are) and have found many similar complaints. Tying this all together started to make sense.  Beyond the obvious treachery - it has become more apparent ECX is getting fatter and richer and more prevalent on the Internet - this exposure due in fact to making LOTS OF MONEY FROM FRAUDULENT DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES.
FRAUDING MONEY FROM INTERNET SCAMS that is the objective of the business statement policy by E-Commerce Exchange. (see: http://www.greensheet.com/PriorIssues-/010801-/8.htm) I learned from New York Agents, they too own the same business web sites that they ARE SELLING. Selling items from the internet- you're in direct competition getting hits and potential sales with the AGENTS working at ECX.  Since they control and host the web site (web site is a joke - merchant is lied to, can't do ANYTHING with it and they don't respond once they pocket your money - which you are also lied and deceived when you get the web site and discover, most of the items you thought you were paying for IS NOT THERE!) This is how they get MOST of their money. 
Agents tell you they made a mistake but rather than go through re-doing the whole contract, - because by now, you have a merchant account from Quick Commerce in Calif. (AKA E-Commerce Exchange). Two different companies sending you material and it's about as disconnected as a turkey bone on a mule. Admits making the mistake and TAKE HUNDREDS more from Merchants in order to get the items that Merchants were shown in the demo and have advertised to sell.  Now that you've been robbed- cannot afford to Advertise anymore. But that wouln't matter, cause if you advertise, your HITS ARE RE-directed, since they control the host server and the web site - which by now, after stealing your money, Agents don't answer phone calls or email. I couln't even change the BOGUS E-Mail's they had set up for me posted on my own web site for WEEKS ! It's a huge scam. 
In an agressive campaign to gain exposure and top ratings on the Internet, ECX engages in ""failure to disclose the facts"", and ""distorting claims regarding the company"", and the ""underhanded and fraudulent method in obtaining funds"" from merchants in order to conduct a business. 
Since my initial complaint, and since the BBB fails to report legitimate business complaints, I have found links at consumer sites which reveal much regarding this company's practice of stealing hits and withdrawing support services to merchants who continue to pay iPayment money, (who also logs a DIFFERENT e-mail address) as well as American Express which is 5/month extra, although I've never heard from them after ECX filled the contract to accept AMX cards, which is automatically lifted from your merchant account @ 104/month for something that doesn't work, you can't advertise, and will NEVER make any money. DEAD STICK! Web Site is dead stick.  
The Manager of ECX New York has called me twice to ward off the complaints that BBB - California sent to him.  He said we were going to work it out and he apoligized to me and said he was sorry it had gone this far and that my site was never submitted to the top search engines as they had said two - three months ago. He said he sifted back through the email to agents(which I had begun to copy him - and never heard a peep from him until I started filing complaints) and that he saw I had some real problems and thought it best if we worked it out rather than me filing complaints. He fixed the ""Contact Page"" so that Text shows up on the web page. I told him we no longer had a business relationship, although, we do, to the tune of 104/month for the next 3 years. And this doesn't atone for the $700.00 that was STOLEN from me by ECX. It'll be 800 by Wednesday.  I've invested with a web site that never worked from the get-go, April 24th. http://www.consumeraffairs.com/business/ecx.html .. this tells an amazing story of fraud and deceipt inflicted on merchants by this company.... there's more

San Diego, California STOP! ..before you think about using the Better Business Bureau (BBB)... CLICK HERE to see how other consumers were victimized by the BBB's false or misleading information. Don't be fooled! It has been reported, when there are thousands of complaints and other investigations underway by authorities, the BBB has no choice but to finally give an UNsatisfactory rating to a BBB member business that is paying the BBB big membership fees every year. When a business is reported that is NOT a BBB member, BBB files WILL more likely show an UNsatisfactory rating, then reportedly shake down that company to become a member of the BBB. One positive thing about the BBB is, either way, if a business has an unsatisfactory rating with the BBB, you can be sure, the business is bad. But what about all those BBB member businesses that had complaints filed against them? Consumers never get to hear about them. What about the BBB advertising to the public? Is this a false and misleading perception they are giving about consumer confidence when dealing with a business?

I was taking my time and checking stuff out the last few days. They not only take out the intro fee they go behind and take out a fee of $149.00 to get started. Then if you decide to work the business, as you are working the business they take out other fees that will add up to over $10,000.  I had decided to not to do the business but, they already mailed the cutsie little video I have not authorized them to send. It's going in the trash. I unsubscribed to the company and they asked why, so I told them what I am saying here. I am out $191.85.

										I was hired by this company to redesign their website.  I have a strict half down and half upon completion policy.  The owners of Destination Areas complained to me how they were ripped off by their previous web designer so I made an exception.  They made a small down payment to cover hosting.  Once I built the site they agreed on, they wanted a site almost 10 times the size of what I had designed for them.  I told them it would cost more and they agreed to new terms.  So I built the site they wanted.Once the site was done, they were wanting changes and updates daily which was not what we had agreed on so I gave them a schedule of fees for the amount of work they wanted.  They didn't have to agree to it.  Basically they would say I need this done to the site and I would give them a written quote before we did the work. I went to check on their site and noticed they had a new host and hired a new web developer without so much as even telling me.Now they won't return my calls or emails and they owe me over $700 for the work that I had done.  They also had a company in phoenix that was providing videos for their site.  They complained that they weren't getting them fast enough and hired a new company to do the videos.They seem to target small businesses that are privately owned so that they can work out some sort of verbal agreement.  We do the work and then when it's time to pay, they switch to a new company.On top of all that, they are trying to charge businesses between $99 and $399 per year to advertise on their site.  No one even sees it.  It virtually gets no traffic and the owners have no knowledge of how it can even benefit anyone to advertise with them.  If they approach you ask them a few basic questions about advertising and they won't be able to answer them.  If you are approaced by DestinationAreas.com stay clear!!!

										I was hired to work as an Appointment Setter, I found their ad in a local free newspaper and thought, great, finally a job, so I phoned them, they said I was just what they were looking for, to come in for an interview the next day.  Of course I was excited, the idea of having any job when I have been unemployed for so long.  I went in and the lady practically hired me on the spot, she said I'd be making such and such amount an hour, I thought great, it's in the ballpark of what I was looking for, what I was never told by my boss, the lady who hired me, was that if I didn't make commissions, my pay would be lowered to minimum wage. I only found this out by talking to a couple of women I was working with, then I confronted my boss and she said quietly, yes, this is true.  My guess, is that whomever is in charge of this place, the big bosses, probably told the hiring staff they are not allowed to divulge this information when hiring someone.  I doubt they would get any  help if they said truthfully what they are up to.  Who can live on minimum wage?  My job was misrepresented to me from day one.  I was also told that they offered benefits, they do not, they only know of a place that offers benefits which would have cost me a fortune to buy on my own, ugh.  If I had know all I know now, I would not have even accepted that position.  I too turned down legimate job offers for employment, regretfully.  The amount of money they charge clients is also a ripoff.  My advice to anyone looking for love, STAY AWAY!  This place is doing some illegal stuff and they are money hungry.

										I was looking to buy a new computor and I found circuitmicro.com wed site. They offered easy finance and low payments. On July 22, 2003 I filled out the application and I received a phone call and all the paper work to sign. I sent it all back when the time
frame and I accepted the bank draft for the 3 down payment for a total of $900.00. Since my computor has been going out I spoke to Randy (salesperson)and I asked if I'd pay my down payment faster would I get the computor faster and he said yes So I allowed them to take out the money from my account. By August 20,2003 they took the final payment of the down payment. I have
been calling them since and have not received my computor.
Every time I call the answer machine is on and they won't return my calls. And when I do talk to them they always say they haven't received the shippment. So I asked to change my computor to a cheaper model and Randy asked me to look for a new one and call him back. I tried to call for 3 days and no one would answer. Finally I got through and he said he'd send me a new
form to sign since I had changed my order. After about two weeks I called and Randy said he forgot but he'd send it right then.
I told him I was tired of waiting and I needed my money back, to get another computor here in Texas. He advised me it would probably take the same time to get my money back, as to get the computor in, and it would be better to wait for the computor.
I asked him questions about the computor he couldn't even remember who and what it was about. I think since I'd been talking to him atleast twice a week he would know who I was by then. To this day I have not received a form, a phone call, or a computor and I'm out $900.00 and no computor. December 27,2003

										I was making an on-line purchase from Newsport News website.After I finished my purchase an insert popped up and asked if you would like free shipping on your next order.I clicked ""yes''.The next thing I knew I was getting a confirmation and congrats for joining some insider pass club.
And the part that furiates me is that they automatically billed my credit card $1.98(small as it is) I did not authorize it!
When you call the contact number,the operator says ,your wait time will be a minute.I have called more than once and held the phone for at least 20 -25 minutes.
It is designed to discourage customer to give-up and say $1.98 is not worth it.
I called Newspot News customer service to report this and they said you can
cancel the membership once you get the paperwork otherwise they will bill my card with some other fee for a insider pass club card.
Why shoul I go through this when I never gave them premission to use my card inthe first place! This a big rip-off on consumers!

										I was reading a fraud report , where a better site was suggested. Forgot the site name, but featured
Angela Bussio. abussio@incomemastersinstitute.com.
Was to post listings for companies on websites? This training was $97 ? I think. Got called back to take more advanced training to build a website, like an online store?This cost $4,895. I was led to believe that was the cost to be "" lead by the hand"" by coaches to eventually earn , maybe $6,000 a month, maybe more. I told the man, Thomas Deshryver?, that I had little experience with computers, the wife and I are on disability, living month to month on soc sec, my computer was old, my provider sucked (internet), all this ""wasn't a problem"".As long as I had ""OPM"" , (other peoples money), Good credit cards.It would be nice to make my own living again. I bought it. On a credit card. I never carry a balance. Not in years anyway. Man, I'm not into writtin like this.!  So the coach calls, fast and furious instructions, about 20 minutes worth, takin notes as fast as I can, find stuff and sell on ebay. Not so easy to buy cheaper than ebay. My computer is old and sucks, took forever to do anything. Accomplished nothin.I'm not well, my is really sick, We both are nervous wrecks. Thomas said this would take 10 to 15 hours a week, try 34 and 37, still aint sold nothin. Nathsn the coach sounds irritated that I'm not doin so well. 
THis has gone on for three weeks or so. I had to buy a printer to print government registration form. Didn't know anyone who had one , $100 , not to bad i guess. Still not able to get much done, on crap computer. Had to buy $50 internet access, gave up and bought a computer,$600, same credit card.OPM!   There's other crap, but I'm tired of writtin bout this. But!, today another ""coach"" called to explain Dropshippers, Need $8,000 to get access to them, don't I have more credit cards??!!, 
They will work with me, OK? I'm not happy, my wife is mad as hell!  I'm an idiot.Possably this could work, or I'm just an idiot.......I just wanted to make life a little better. Not kill my wife, not have another heart attack. Yep , I signed an online contract, but they didn't tell me the truth.This makes me sick, And, I'm an idiot.",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

I wish we could have the crystal ball in knowing what campaigns the mediums love and will take, but unfortunately we dont. The majority of our campaigns do exceptionally well, with many extending their reach which means an increase in their deposit because of their success. We aggressively pitched, promoted and publicized the campaign but for some reason the enthusiasm we have and the acceptance of the medium for a PI run didnt quite match. Each campaign for us is a major investment: getting the campaign posted, promoting it to hundreds of mediums, phone calls, emails, and demos are all part of our aggressive marketing efforts on the clients behalf, the tough part is does the medium believe their investment will pay off. I am sorry that Swiss America was not a fit for our platform, I certainly hope one day we will find the right match.Thank you,

We may never recover our money but we are going to try to do our little bit to put these sleezeballs out of business (not that they won't pop up somewhere else).  These people are cockroaches but cockroaches have been around far longer than humans.

										I was taken by this new Arizona Telemarketing Phone Room!  They will take your credit card and then charge more and more.  Call your toll-free number and get a dispute. I received my money back in full. I had to file a complaint with the attorney General of Arizona nad my state also to protect others.
The owner Phillip Smith has a criminal record (prison).  He came from Horizon Technologies and stole all of their information to make a company that peddles a Chinese car starter.... the only one that makes money is Phil and his gang of fast talking Telemarketers... The opportunity is usless with criminals running the show.  I even found that the location was another Telemarketing room called E-Commerce Exposure... ran for a year and Phil took over them and a small company called electronic intertrade...
Don't deal with them if you've been burnt... call the AG or your credit card ... even the Postal Inspector if the ripped you off for advertising that they get rich on!!
Ask for real referencences or check backrounds... these are the folks that have been taking money over the phone for years... they know what to say and who to blame.
I stopped Debt relief by doing a charge back on my credit card... worked great.
Just don't deal with them ... they will always have a con answer for you!

										I was too late, I did not read the RipOffReport until I was out $10,995 to the Coaching Department out of Utah. June 2012: I got a phone call from Senior DIrector Landon White from the Coachingdepartment.com out of Orem Utah (ALso known as Supplier Source LLC, Ecomerce Support and over 30 other names,). He told me that they were interviewing pople to see if they were qulified to participate in this amazing: ""How to make money on the internet by opening your own web store"". He told me the company had an A rating with the Better Business Bureau, he actually took me to ""their"" web page and showed the A rating, he  explained why they were an A rated company, they always took care of their customers. When I contacted the BBB to check up on them, they show this company as an F rated company. Landon told me that I could make $5000 a month in 2-3 months, he promised me they would work with me and find me a drop shipper, they would build a web page for me, they would provide me with a accounting software, they would give me social marketing package etc. etc. All of this for the amount of $10,995. NOT SO, After 3 coaching sessions with Murray Tucker, where the only thing he showed me was how to sell an item on E-bay, the next guy Brandon Smith called me and told me to be able to get the drop shipper, they wanted another $10,300, on top of that they wanted more monies for marketing, hosting fees etc. I was devestated, How can this be allowed to continue?? Well, if you do just a little bit of research on the internet.. you will figure it out.. Go to the Feds...  Make sure you file a report with the Federal Trade Commission FTC. 202-326-2222. Of course after reading horror story after horror story about these guys, I tried to get my money back, I was told that they would not reimburse me anything, that they would simply send my contract to Utah's  customer protection division and I got the impression from his tone of voice that would be it.

Nothing.  But I was good enough to setup all kinds of sheets for him.  He had the two salespeople selling leads but didn't have what they needed.  People would pay and never receive the data they paid for.  He had me open paypal and then people are filing refunds left and right.  He had promises that my checks were coming.  Yeah, not here yet.  He holds two weeks worth of checks.  Not sure why. He promised me massages and lavish dinners. I didn't believe that at all.  I figured let him think he's BSing me and just listened.  Out of the blue he sends an email at 10;45 at night on a Saturday telling me I am fired.  How he will give me a good reference if i need one.  Really.  I will never use him as a reference.  EVER!  As I am filing this I was also reading what other people wrote and it is the same across the board.  Same stuff going on.  BEWRE OF THIS RIP OFF ARTIST.  He will also tell you people either love me or hate me.  But don't listen to them.

										I worked at Linktech International for over a year. I was fresh out of college and looking for an opportunity in advertising. I ended up, not as a telemarketer, (unlike most of the employees at the company), but in the search engine optimization department, in charge of processing clients and placing their personal advertisements and landing pages on google/bing. When I started, the department was incredibly understaffed, which created a sweat shop like atmosphere, as my daily workload was completely unreasonable and mentally taxing. We had thousands of individual google Adwords placements to create, monitor and optimize, which meant that it was common for Individual clients ad campaigns to go unmonitored for weeks and months at a time simply due to the amount of client requests and lack of staffing to support the needs of each client. I continually asked upper management to expand the department, seeing how we were an online advertising firm and the department responsible for the actual online advertising was incredibly understaffed, which made absolutely no sense. It became clear that upper management was only interested in increasing sales numbers (and collecting credit card numbers) while promising a service and quality of product that we in the marketing department just couldn't live up to with the lack of personell in the department. This meant that I was told to work harder, which often resulted in working overtime. At a certain point, management told me that overtime would not be allowed, which meant the quality of our product would suffer as our clients would not be receiving the service that was initially pitched to them. Eventually, I convinced management to hire more people in the marketing department. Unfortunately, for our new employees, they were greeted with the same sweat shop like conditions I had been enduring considering our department was located in a glorified closet. Again, linktech solutions is an online ad firm that cared very little for the actual advertising department. Under these working conditions discontent grew among members of the ad department not only due to the working environment, but also to the lack of compensation for all of the backbreaking work we did. At one point, discontent had reached such a level In the department that upper management called me into the office because they finally noticed the atmosphere was toxic. Instead of consulting me on how we could change the culture in a constructive way, the president of the company told me that he had a notion just to fire everyone in the department (many of which had only worked their a few weeks) and hire a whole new staff. Upon hearing this I almost quit on the stop due to the unbelievable lack of respect the president of the company felt for his employees. Truly, from the sales floor, to the receptionists, and down to the advertising team all of the employees in these positions were viewed as entirely replacable and were treated as such on a daily basis. However, having said all of this, I wouldn't necessarily call Linktech international a scam business simply because I have seen the google analytics, which has shown how their service had provided leads and results to customers all over the country. However, what the real ripoff is involves the utter mistreatment of 99% of the employees for the gain of a select few: the president of the company and the CEO, who crazy enough, actually made employees take time away from their jobs and make them participate in listening sessions of his bands album to determine what songs his band should promote or use on their upcoming album. It was a surreal experience straight out of the movie Office Space that added to employee disgruntlement, as we all realized that our hard work (for miniscule compensation) was directly financing the CEOs dream of being a rock star. It was a completely ridiculous and unprofessional obligation that we all had to participate in (and almost torturous as the bands music was pretty muchunlistenable). Imagine Nicleback, Green Day and Linking Park had a baby and that was the CEOs band, ""Abused Romance""...just embarrassing. Basically, working at Linktech was truly a bizarre, grueling, and often times an enraging experience. The only takeaway was that I was able to learn Google Adwords and apply that to my own personal business and other career opportunities. Overall, I would not recommend using this companies service simply because I know first hand who is in control of pulling the levers and what really matters to upper management, and it surely it isn't their employees or providing a quality product. It is gaining credit card numbers based off a faulty business model that promotes quantity of clients over providing a quality product. Looking back, coming right out of college, the experience gave me great insight into the harsh realities of the real world, especially the world of business, but this companies complete lack of employee consideration and respect is staggering....even for the ""real world."" Theres a thousand other ad companies who can provide the same service, but cheaper and with more experienced professionals who care about providing excellent service for their clients, while also cultivating an atmosphere of respect and dignity for their employees. Huh, imagine that? In conclusion, my recommendation is that when Linktech Solutions calls....hang up.									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										I worked for Pipeline Media Group owned by Tracee Mcafee Gates as a caller in the call center. I possessed other skills also as a Web Designer and Video Grapher. After a while of working there people started to find out that I knew how to design Websites and edit commercials. My skills had grabbed the intension of one of the company owners.
He gave me a promotion and moved me to a office downstairs and put me to work doing web design. After moving downstairs and getting my promotion I sensed a lot of discomfort. Alot of negative energy derived from other co-worker. Most of my work was claimed to clients as done by someone else in the company. ""Passing my work off as theirs"".
I never said anything because I was so happy just to have a job and having income coming in to take care of my family. At this present time the company was going through a company split. The other owner had decided to sell his share of the company. Co-workers and upper management started taking sides. Which I could care less about, all I wanted to do was work to put food on the table. After the other owner left the situation got worse. On two different occasion I was harassed and experienced racist jesters. 
In the middle of a company meeting Steve Troutman VP of Sales for Pipeline Media and Video for Profit called me a crack head in front of the whole company because I asked a question about something that I didn't understand. 
One morning when I came into my office I had ""Go home, your work here is done, and signed by a individual named NAZI"" with a NAZI symble on my smart board. I wasn't too thrilled about that so, I went to talk to Tracee Mcafee Gates and Mike Lemier the new owner about the situation. 
I pulled them into my office and I showed them what was done and they said that Steve Troutman was just playing around and I said just like the ""crack head "" thing in the meeting? How in the hell is that a joke? Mike Lemier and Tracee Mcaffee Gates told me if I didn't like it leave and then they both  walked out of my office. I told them that I couldn't do that I have 6 kids to feed. They wouldn't fire me so I could collect Unemployment. They didn't even care that I had kids and a family. Mrs. Gates and Mike Lemiere basically shitted on my whole existence. I had no money to take legal action on top of that Tracee Mcafee Gates has millions from home shopping networks and video production, this situation would never stand a chance against her dream team of lawyers. So, I just quit. 
I hate this company with every ounce of my being. I wouldn't advise anyone to work for this company or hire them for any reason. It takes them 4 months to role out projects and most of there work is outsourced. Meaning, not done in the building or designed by them. I'm pretty shore that there are others out there just like me that worked for them and got shitted on. ""DON'T TRUST THEM"".

										I, like many others, signed up for an offer on a facebook app to earn more currency within a game. I signed up for PosterPass because the offer was attractive, buy 4 posters and spend $5. Well, a few days later I get the posters and thought all was good, until I checked my bank account. Much to my surprise, there was charge after charge from PosterPass for $38.90. Obviously I was shocked, and called the 800 number listed on the charge on my statement. Posterpass had debited $39.80 7 times by the time I caught it! They told me it was for orders of 2 posters each that I would receive over the next few days. I told them to stop charging me ASAP and they said I had enrolled in an auto-shipping program. I canceled my account and waited for all the posters to finally arrive. I took them immediately down to UPS (4 weeks ago) and did a return to sender. I had confirmed with PosterPass that a return shipment was suitable to get a refund (I even wrote ""please refund"" on every box as to avoid any confusion). PosterPass had told me it would take 2-3 weeks to receive a refund after I returned the items. So needless to say I called them on the 4th week since I had not received any refunds yet. They checked my account and told me they only had one record of 1 item being returned so far which is BS because I sent them all back at the same time with UPS but they claim they only have one and it could take another month to get the rest back. Then after which it would take 2 billing cycles to get my money back (30-60 days).

										I, too, was ripped-off by Roma Computer Solutions.  My wife and I atttended a siminar on National Grants also.  That is where we came in contact with Roma and Lease Technologies, Inc.  Like everyone else in your reports, we have had pretty much the same experience.  We purchased what we thought was not only a computer but rights to e-commerce sites and software.  We have been paying $137 per month for over two years with nothing to show except a computer which could have been purchased thru Gateway for less than $1,000.00.  
All the promises of e-commerce sites and disk to sell and make $799 profit each were lies.  We were promised that we would make over $7,000 in the first three months of business, however; we never received anything promised by Roma to start a business.  We tried resolving the issue with them for two years with no solutions.  I reported Roma to the Ohio Attorney Generals Office and just today, I received a letter from them that Lease Technologies were relieving us from any further liabilities with them.  
We have not heard anything further about money we have already paid.  Roma in now in receivership in Ventura County, California.  Apparently they ripped-off the whole country!!!!!!!!  We have had contact with several other people who attended the same seminar as we did and one of them was finally able to be released from payment and the other was not so lucky.  The entire amount due was deducted from their checking account at one time.

										i'm relieved to know that i'm not the only one dealing with the same company and issue!
I believe the scammers phished my account details by me being sucked into purchasing a downloading based website for movies, music, etc. 
the site said there was a once-off payment of $30 required in order to become a member of the site for 2 years. i tried logging on to the site, but it didn't work. i eventually gave up and forgot about it.
2-3 months later..
on the 22/04/09, i was charged for $65Au. before aggreeing to become a member, i carefully read their terms and conditions but it did not say extra payments will be taken out-just a once-off! 
i tried coping and pasting the website address provided on the statement into the url, but the website could not be found.
i googled the name of the company 'commercepayice.com' A.K.A cpipay.com and tried to contact them but with no luck.
VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION!
Read the terms & conditions and privacy pages. i tried extracting the privacy terms & conditions page by coping and pasting here but it just appears hidden.

										I've been interested in work from home opportunities because I have small children.  This is the first one that I felt was legit considering I looked it up on the Better Buisness Bureau and there were no complaints.  After waisting  over an hour of my life and them requesting person finance situations, I was feeling uneasy.  Let me tell you, your inner conceince is always right.  They were looking to have me invest $8-$15 thousand dollars for their online business!  Crazy!  I had to cancel my credit card for the initial $99 dollars I spent (which has a 30 day money back guarentee after 20 days...) and told them that I was going to report them to the BBB.  Don't waist your time.  I'd like to file a law suit against these a$$ holes!!!

										If you are looking for a company that provides qualified leads... key word here being .....qualified. This is not the company to go with. Also, do not ever expect any type of refund or partial refund... Once you give your money it is theirs.... forever....    
Two weeks after signing up, and realizing this site was not what they advertised I tried to get a refund.... I had  bought 12 months... they encouraged me to give it a chance and I did... the results were the same... non-qualifed leads.... and maybe 2 or 3 a month, most were from a county that I do not even work in... I could never find my site on the web,..never. 
After getting information from Kendra (no longer works there) of other peoples sites.... I contacted at least 12 different souces... they all said the same thing ..... the leads were worthless and not any one got a sale.... this confirmed my experience... and thoughts...   When I did get a lead I always responded... I am someone who is great at following up on commitments.... (As I promised PromoterOnline I would do for them with my experience with their company).  
None of the leads ever responded back to me by phone or email... this was the same problem the other realtors had with the site... because these people were giving us non qualified leads....   I left real estate... and asked them in the fifth month to refund my 7 months that I had prepaid and they refused...except to say that they would be happy to put my 7 months on hold....  on hold??? for what??? 
I am out of real estate...  I did tell them that I would share my story with others... they did not seem to mind.. so  here it is Darla, I kept my promise after doing all I knew to do to work with you.... I have shared my experience with others.

										In April 06 I was phoned out of the blue by a sales rep, high pressure tactics coincided with my first foray into building an internet business and $6000 later I thought I was on my way to volumes of targeted traffic. They said that 18 to 22 million peole were using their services so I could easily calcuate a solid traffic volume from this base. After three months and little traffic, and that which was was very suspicious as it didn't lead to any one. After a lot of complaints to them, by phone, they won't commit to anything by mail or email, I agreed to an upgrade to a full page spread when my ads opened. When this did not appear I was told they had a policy change and couldn't do it. They flat out refused to return the $600 I paid for this. Now I'm off to the FBI with this, it turns out that they don't have any customer base at all and there are many many complaints about these guys. Good luck every body, I'd love to hear a way to get my money back, I went deep in debt after a year of chemo to these people.

										In April 2005, I began completing the necessary offers to obtain a LOuis Vitton purse for my daughter. As usual, some of the offers were slow to post, but I observed the 30 day minimum time limit posted on the site, as prerequisite for emailing to the website. Upon 30 days elapsing, I emailed and emailed repeatedly, never receiving any response from the site. About 10 days ago, I checked the status, on the site, and was shocked to find that all my offers, in fact, my entire account had been erased, as if I'd never begun the process. Now, I have email and hard copy proof of all the offers and I've emailed and told the site that information. I've called and left numerous messages on the voicemail for their customer service, leaving my email & physical addresses, as well as, my home and cell phone #'s. NO RESPONSE. I'm not going to put up with this, particularly since I'd already promised my teenage daughter that I'd get the purse for her.

										In August 2007 I lived in Michigan and was losing my job.  I started to look on the internet for jobs online or otherwise.  Of course I got resposes from all over the place.  I got a call from a Mr. Brian Thomas from Millennium Marketing / Casey Consultants.  He was so friendly yet pushy at the same time.  I put my husband on the phone to listen to the sales pitch and like a dummy we fell for it.  I was told that is was no risk thing cause if they didnt make my money back within a year I would be able to get some of it back.  I was told that I was going to make so much money that I could roll in it within 6 months, doing a online mall with ebay, amazon.com, buynow.com, Target.com,  Officedepot.com plus Liberty Health packages and a pre paid legal package.    Bryan Thomas was going to be my coach and see me through the process.  I was given a name for my online mall that I would have to use for tax purposes and getting paid from Commission Junction and Amazon.com. ( I have yet to see any income what so ever).  That created a web page for my mall and made it look all professional and all.  After a few months that I was told I had to wait to get to the top of the page in search engines so I could start getting clicks and hits on my web page (that never happened)  I was told to be patient so that they could do all the advertising to get me where I needed to be.  So I waited.  Not only did I not get to the top of any search engine, even with me working my butt off to get free advertising on all kinds of crazy web sites, I started not getting any response form Millennium Marketing.  I spoke so often to the receptionist Denise, that she knew my voice and account #.  I was calling and leaving messages for Brian Thomas and they were never returned.  I got scared and was told that he was very ill and not in the office.  Thats when the fun started cause I was calling almost everyday trying to get in touch with someone or anyone.  I was very upset and all I got to talk to was the receptionist.  I left messages for the owner to call me back, never heard from him.  I talked to a few people that did the same as Brian and promised me they would look into the situation never to hear from them again.  I could never talk to the same person twice.  I went so far as going to the web site and having my husband sign up for the service to get someone to call us back.  That call was very interesting cause they gave him the whole sales pitch again just as Brain Thomas did to me.  When my husband told him that his wife was already into this marketing scam the guy got all flustered asked for my account # then went as far as telling him that that wasnt my account number cause it already belonged to someone else a Mr. Nick Fitzpatrick. At that time I did get to talk to a so called supervisor,  he as well was flustered and got very upset with the gentleman that told my husband that wasn't my account number and told me that he was not suppose to tell people stuff like that.  He went on to tell me that he would find out what was going on and that I did show some income on their side, which I never saw or did I ever hear from the manager again , Jason Cole, who was the manager,  I talked to Mike Warren, Jimmie McNight, and several others.  Before I did any of this I checked them on the BBB and at the time they didn't have but very few complaints and they were setteled.  
     At that point I filed a BBB report that went to them and I was informed from the BBB that my complaint went unanswered.  After that I really didn't hear from anyone no matter what I did, calling at least once a day for a month straight.  Then one day out of the blue I got a call from a Mr. Jack Foster saying that Brian had did me wrong and he was going to help me.  And he at least would return my calls.  But still nothing from anyone.  In the middle of all this happening I had to pack my life and move 2500 miles away to find a job cause the economy in Michigan was so bad.  My unemployment was running out and I didn't have anything but a huge credit card bill to pay off from the scam I fell for.  They had me charge $8800.00 ($400.00 for the website design and $8400.00 for the advertising)on my credit card in two different charges one to Casey Consulting and one to Millennium Marketing.  Brian Thomas even went as far as getting on the phone in a 3 way call to confirm the charge.  He told me that at the end of the year I could get $400.00 back if we didn't make it back and I've been trying to pull teeth to get that back and still haven't and it's been well over a year now.  Boy was I taken for  a ride.  Please Help stop this company that is taking innocent BROKE people trying to make a honest living.  I tried to tell these people that I was depending on this business to help make ends meet not put me in the poor house and that excatly what it did. This company deserves to investagated for Fraud and many other crimes cause they are taking people for the ride of their life into bankruptcy.  In this day with the economy so bad people are grasping at straws to stay afloat and this company is helping drown them and myself in more debt.  Please do something to stop it!!!!!

Since then I have called repeatly only get an aswering machine.  I think maybe they have a call ID system so they won't answer from numbers that they view as problems.  They do not respond to emails, phone messages or faxes.
They still have one hundred dollars of mine.  I offered to subsitute items of lesser value to the ones I ordered orginally and buy an additional item but they would not call me back for my credit card info.
I wrote two letters to the owner Thor Johnsen and faxed  them over twenty times - I am sure that they received them.  No response.

										In Feburary of this year (2009) I responded to an ad to become a Certified Laptop Distribution Agent with this company. I called the number and was told it could be done in 12 to 14 days after they recieved my money by Michael Barrington. He also said after I was Certified they would get me amy first batch of laptops with 120 days to pay for them. He stated the economic slowdown was NOT affecting this industry, people were still buying laptops. I sent the money order and started getting emails they called ""Training Modules"" (these can all be found on the internet free) I was told not to call them. Any corespondence would only be answered via email, and I was given a # to put in the subject line when I emailed them. Things went fine at first (I thought) then I stopped getting the ""Training Modules"".
When I emailed my ""Trainer"" Paul Terrence to ask why I wasn't getting any ""Training Modules"" my email was answered by Susan King. She said they were backed up due to the economic slowdown and to send $59 to expidite my Certification Aplication. I chose not to send any more money after their not following through with the original time frame. Still no more ""Training Modules"".
Last week I got an email from them saying the economic slowdown has caused a backup with the manufacturers and they would now be takeing 5 to 6 MORE months to get me the 120 days to pay for my first batch of laptops. But if I would send them $997 by 5-15 as a downpayment/release/ship fee they would get me a batch of laptops and I would have 60 days to pay them the balance (they didn't say how much the balance would be).
I wrote them an email explaining I don't have that much money and reminding them of the promises they had made to me both before and after I had sent my money. 
They state on their web page and in several of the ""Training Modules"" that the economic slowdown is NOT affecting this industry and their associates are makeing BIG money selling these laptops. Yet they use the economy as an excuse whenever they are questioned about not following through on the promises they have made! 
Here are the last couple emails I sent to them and recieved from them just today! 
My email to them On Wed, May 13, 2009 at 10:58 AM,
I have sent a couple emails and received no response. You already know I am upset about how you have handled my affiliation with your business, but you don't seem to care.
Now we are at a point  where I am really pissed off with how I have been treated. You should also know I taped my original phone call before I sent you my money, and I have saved every email I have sent to you or received from you, including all training modules.
The way I see things you have 3 choices on how you are going to handle this situation....
1. You will get me the product with 120 days to pay as promised.
2. You will refund my money.
3. I will file a scam/rip off report and contact the other person who has already filed one and I will start filling reports and claims against you with every business/agency I can find.
If I don't get a resolution to this within the next 7 days I will choose option 3.
I really hope you choose option 1, as I know I would be good at this and could make good money, I would settle for option 2, but wouldn't be very happy, and I really don't want to have to resort to option 3 but I will if you choose not to do the right thing by the people who trust you to do what you promise them you will.

That isn't considered sneaky unless you have something to hide. Obviously I did the right thing by taping the call and saving all the emails, now with this email I really have what I need to file all the claims against you. ANYONE who conducts a ""business"" email by calling people names and swearing at them deserves to go out of business. And to think this email was your first course of action, you didn't even try to talk to me or offer me any other promises before swearing at me and calling me names. This email will help me in so many ways against you. Obviously your ""business"" was just a scam to steal money from honest hardworking people trying to find a legitimate way to make extra income. I will get my money back from you, even if I have to spend money to do it. I will make it my Priority to do so now. Along with that I will also make it my second priority to do everything I can to help you go out of business. I will be filling every claim I can with every agency I can.

It's obvious to me that they don't even bother to make sure who is emailing them before they fire off emails full of cussing and name calling!!! And a ""Threat""??? Because I said I would file rip off reports? or file with other agencies? That is my right here in the USA, and it's what those agencies are there for, people who have been ripped off!
For one I have ever only placed one call to them, back in Fecruary before I sent my money (I can prove it with my phone records), and for two I am not married (I can prove it!), for three I don't think wanting my money back from scammers is hassling, it was 2 or 3 emails, and fourth I have never made any physical threats to anyone affiliated with their company (or anyone else) by phone or email. The only thing I have done that might be taken as a threat was saying I would file a rip off report and file various reports with various agencies if I didn't get what they promised or my money back. That to me is everyones right as a consumer who feels they didn't get what they paid for.
The people who are behind this company want us to think they have power over us because we sent them our money, but the truth is they have no power, only our money. We have the power, and if enough of us get fed up enough and take a stand we can win this fight and get our money back.

										In January, I received a call from a Heather identifying herself as being with CETS.  Heather informed me that I could receive a new PC as a test marketing gimmick, for $284.90.
I initially agreed, but afterwards had second thoughts. I called that same day and cancelled, and was given a cancellation number.  They also gave me a 1800phone number for Olympus phonecards.
A full month later, two charges came out of my account. The first was for Olympus telecommunications for 50+ dollars.  Upon calling them at the 1-800 number CETS had given me the month before, I discovered that CETS had authorized the withdrawal despite my cancellation. They apologized, said they'd withdrawn using CETS's services for numerous complaints such as mine. They promptly refunded my money.
The second charge was for the 284.90, and was listed as CETSSS on my bank statement.  I called them (they have ridiculously long hold times), and spoke to an operator, who asked me to fax a copy of my bank statement with the charge on it to someone named ""Arne"" and that the amount would be credited to my account within 24-72 hours.  I did so, and about 2 weeks later and with no credit to my account, I called again.
This time the story was that I'd get the money within 30 days from when I'd originally faxed the report. When I replied that this was unacceptable, and despite threatening legal action through my bank, the operator smugly told me to ""go ahead and sue us"" since ""federal law and the Better Business Bureau's on our side.""  When I asked to speak to the mysterious ""Arne"" I was told he was at a meeting 3 hours away, and would not be in.
I'm getting the distinct impression that my chain is being yanked, and that they're hoping to just wait me out and keep the nearly $300.

										In July of 2005 I got a phone call out of the blue, I was working on my computer website and it so happened that the guy on the end of the phone wanted to help me get visitors to my site which he said he repesented envisions.com.
 I was apprehensive and did not want to stay on the phone with this person, he been trained by the best, he wouldn't take no for a answer. I can be honest with you that he kept at it like he was a avon sales person, the word no did not exist in this man's vocabulary like that capital one commercial. 
I told him at this point of time I was not financially ready to step forward, he said I was crazy not to, that he promised me over 1000 visitors that month to see my site. I am telling you friends stay far and away from these maniacs from envisions.com. 
I waited and got jumbo stuff in the mail, only two three people saw my site which I directed them too. The numbers did not seem compelling to me, this guy said my site would be overthrowing with visitors. I was dealt badly. 
I called their techical advisor and he said oh yes it takes months to get 1000s of people to your site. I then went to my bank and told them I wanted to put a stop on this charge. Well politics went bad for me and the bad guys won and took me for 124.99 and my bank could only say they win and you lose. 
Yes soon I will leave that bank which is Citizens bank, they stood up for the bad guys and did not even fight for me. I feel a injustice took place and these so called thieves on the Net took me for a ride I won""t forget. Yes a powerful rule of thumb is that they might think they won but my writing this proves I am no guinea pig to their lying tactics. 
I hope that you will take this to heart and stay far and away from this company called envisions.com. I have learned a valuable lesson, say no to scam artist especially from Envisions.com 
I hope when this circulates they will know how to understand a person when he says no, might make them choke on their own medicine when they see I did get the last word in.

										In June 2011 I was contacted by a Global Executive Inc. representative, explaining me their need for help in their affiliate business with Amazon and e-Bay, and the possibility to become an affiliate, working from home, in the situation that they are providing the sites, the training, permanent coaching and support. I was tempted by his proposal and I made my decision, I provided my card and I received a receipt to e-sign. After I sent the signed receipt I tried to read what was written with very small letters and it was a statement saying that I wasn't entitled to claim any of the money paid, and I paid around $2,700. In the next 10 days I received from Fortune 500 Affiliate Group a package containing a binder with some instructions to follow and training material, without making me aware of the fact that Global Executives was just a sales service provider for Fortune 500 Affiliate Group. None of them were according to what I was told over the phone. I spent hundreds of hours trying to follow their instructions, to contact a coach at the phone provided and ask for guidance. I called at least 10 times and no coach contacted me. I tried to email to the support and I received a long list with some steps to go through, to provide them print screens for each step in order to get certified as affiliate, which was again something I was never told about it. I reached the level of having the sites set-up and working on advertizing. I used both free and paid advertizing, none of them brought any results. I called again for coaching, again my call wasn't returned. It appears that their mission finished at the time they received the money and sent that completely unusefull training package. On the top of this, they sold my name to different companies, that want to offer their service packages to help me succeed in my online business, each week I receive this type of very aggressive calls. Lately I checked on Global Executives and Fortune 500 Affiliate Group, Global Executives was created in April 2011, but I didn't find any information on Fortune 500 Affiliate Group, in the state of Arizona.

										In March, 2008, I made a legitimate online purchase of clothing from Norm Thompson, which I had done several times in the past.  However, this time an additional charge crept onto my credit card bill that I did not notice until 3 months later.  This charge was labeled Encore Marketing and was added as follows (similarly to others I now see on this Web site):
The first month the charge was $1.95; after that it was $14.95 monthly.  Since I use this credit card frequntly, I did not notice this fraudulent charge until the third month, and then I promptly contacted the credit card company and had all fraudulent charges removed.  I also contacted Encore Marketing at the contact number shown with the charge, and they finally agreed to remove all charges after I made it clear to them that they are being reported to proper authorities (they originally agreed to remove only the latest charge).
I now see by looking at other reports on this Web site and other places that Encore Marketing (or other affiliated companies) will quietly attach itself to legitimate online purchases by somehow making some kind of special offer while you are making the legitimate purchase.  I pride myself on being very careful what I agree to, and I know I didn't authorize any charges from this company -- it must have been carefully hidden when I checked out my legitimate purchase. 
I have also contacted the company from which I purchased, Norm Thompson, and made it clear to them that I will make no further online purchases from them unless and until they find a way to disconnect from this insidious and fraudulent thief.

										In May of 2008 I purchased a 2008 260 Machoman 250cc, scooter from scooter nitro, The site said that the scooter had a 21hp motor, I found out that it's only a 16hp motor they lied, they also said the high speed was 85mpr another lie just 70mpr three weeks after i receive the scooter the dash went out, the carb went bad, the speedo went also, they did send another one but it was bad also, the seat threads are comming loose, i ordered another seat, they said send pic's i did in june. 
i have been waiting for parts for 7 weeks. But this gets me, the motor is knocking they said send the motor back to them and they would send another but i have to pay for shipping and having the motor taken off, but finding a mech to do that is a different story. When i called about the parts they say wait for china to send them to you. The bike has been in the shop 4 times and is steal in the shop at $50 hr. 
This is a new bike and the braked pads or gone already. I feel that i have been ripped off and not getting the service i should from this bike or from scooternitro.com. When you buy from scooternitro they don't tell you that most scooter repare shops WILL NOT work on rokita scooters, cause parts are hard to get. If this helps anyone you should stay away from scooternitro.com or rokita scooters JUNK.

										In May of 2012 i received a call from SJT Merchants from Brent Blair, for $100. i can get started making money from home few hours a  week. he explained to me the company does service merchants with credit cards, visa and mastercard, how they are cheeper than bank rates, who wouldn't want lower rates if you are a business owner ? I work for banking and said that sounds pretty good. A few days later they called me again and i did sign up. All i have to do is get small business to sign up to use JST merchants they will do the comparisons on the rates to see if we can save them money. when they sigh up I will make money if they need new equipotent, and on whatever they save, i will also make money if they need a cash advance (or a loan). so now we are in July I have not yet booked any business,I get a call from Ron Zink how they can help me, since i am so busy, full time job, kids, ect, they can help me, very simple, we can do all the work for you, we get leads that are businesses that are already looking for this service, people that are already interested in this service, we will do all the calling for you. These leads cost just over $5.00 each but are really good leads and we will do the work for you. So he asks me if I have money in savings, checking accounts, credit cards, I tell him no. He continues to ask if I have a pension, or 401, i happen to just get a settlement from my divorce that was IRA money and I put into an IR, he tells me i can use that money, I told him no thats all I have and I would have to pay penalties on that money if I took it out.Not to worry he says, for $35,000 I can get 6,000 leads good leads, people so interested i would get about 300 people sign up from that. It wouldn't matter if i had penalties this return would more than .I got a call from John Jones who gave me the info to wire the $35,000 to , and off I sent it.  What a big mistake.

										In need of work, I applied to work for ""Versachannel"" via an ad on Craigslist. I met with the ""Alex Cornwell""  ( Aside of that, there were a number of red flags. I have worked in advertising/marketing and sales for a number of years...never have I seen a guy in any capacity not have a computer of any kind. ""Alex Cornwell"" office had a desk, a sizeable cabinet with some sports stuff. Now this is where it gets hectic.
Marketing with no media kits..okay, no problem. No one was in the office, they were all in the field, ok. They say ""professional attire"", I saw guys in courderoy jackets with high waters and white socks with cheap loafers. Ok, dont be a snob. I met with a ""supervisor"" who was to evaluate my pitch in the field. All of these ""marketers"" met at the ""office"" at 9 and rallied themselves into a pitching fervor...discussing their successes on how they got people to sign up for Home Depot services in kitchen resurfacing or other ""clients"".
Now, I dont know what area of sales some of these people trained, but no one walks around saying,"" let me hear your pitch, let me hear your pitch"". They then ""study"" and ""teach"" principles and fundamentals on getting people to sign up for services and continuously preach on how their people were responsible for generating ""millions in revenue"" by dedicated employees of the ""firm"".
Teams were then dispatched to a select group of targetted Home Depot's to speak to people and get them to sign up for free kitchen re-surfacing in home estimates. You are on your feet, walking the store, hawking and ogling, going after customers who are there to do legimate shopping. Now, the service is valid but here is the kick. The appointments must be made over the phone AFTER a prospect has signed, you are supposed to use the house phone to contact the call center, but it is advised you use your cell.....to prevent a fish getting off the hook.
The call center asks questions that DONT coincide with your own and usually kills the deal. You do this from say 11 am to 7, sometimes 8 or later. Then, you drive back to the office to turn in your sheets, and give a breakdown of the day. Then you discuss on tactics to gain more signatures. The second day, you hear the talk of top sellers that are moving on to start their own marketing firms and all this crappola.
The first three days, you are supposed to make $8 bucks an hour (what is that, I'm a grown a** man, but I needed a few bucks to hold me over until another gig popped off), then after three days, you made commission per confirmed signature AND appointments kept. After the second day, unless you are a desperate fool OR a master at getting signatures, you stay on.
After 6 months, you get ""promoted"" to Supervisor/trainer with the ultimate goal of being team leader and eventually, moving on to starting your own ""firm"". Its nothing but a pyramid scam.

										In November 2008 I bought a Lucrative website business and training package from Tenretni Ltd.  They claimed that they only ever sold one of each type of business and yet one week after I bought the site through Ebay I was contacted by someone who had purchased the site over the phone having seen it on Ebay.  Despite this I was persuaded to continue with the website.
In recent correspondence with the company I have highlighted a number of faults with the website and have repeatedly asked for someone to contact me to resolve the issues.  That contact has never happened.  I will summarise the faults with the service that I have received from Tenretni:
* The coding on the site appears to be faulty. 
* In the original advertisement for the service that they provide they spoke of how they provide a full telephone support service from day one on every marketing package that is sold.  On many occasions over the last three months I have been unable to get through to the company with the phone ringing out for several minutes at a time.  On several occasions I have left messages for people and not received a reply.
* Over the same period I have numerous emails to various personnel within the company ignored with me receiving no reply.
 * The website that I bought had, according to the sales page, been developed and extensively tested and then re-tested under the supervision of their expert Research & Development Team utilising the vast programming skills from top flight programmers around the globe.  Despite this fact the site has taken over three months to get to it's present unfinished state.
* Throughout December I was in email and phone correspondence with the company to get Deep Links set up on the site.  When these were eventually done at the end of December they did not work and it eventually took until the 18th January to rectify this situation.
 * I have repeatedly requested by phone and email that a header was installed on the site to give it a finished look.  A header appeared at the end of January in which the company name was spelt incorrectly and the company website address was not only mis-spelt but also gave a co.uk domain name instead of the .com domain which the site has.  This has not been rectified.to date.
* In their advertisement they spoke about the site being fully search engine optimised.  This is not the case and has never been discussed with me.
 * In the original advertisement they spoke of me having the benefit of 17 years experience when it comes to training.  The training I have received to date has been limited to Google ads training and training on article writing and submission.  I have since learnt that the person who was training me had been working within Internet marketing for approximately 7 months.  He spent the first two months of his Internet Marketing life trying to get to grips with Google Ads but then gave up because he considered it a waste of time.  The company has failed to give me the level of training that was promised in their advertisement.  The Internet Marketing Guru Dean Taylor has beed conspicuous by his absence over the entire three month period that I have been dealing with Tenretni.
* No further training has been forthcoming from Tenretni.  I was offered one appointment but then went three weeks without contact before asking for a refund.
 * At the time of writing this, my site has been off the web for four days because Tenterni are changing a server.  I run another business with a hosted website and database and my service provider has managed to change servers without me suffering any downtime.
I have repeatedly raised these issues with Tenretni over the last month and have asked for a refund.  They feel that they have supplied a good enough service to not to be obliged to refund my fees.  I disagree as under the Sale of Goods Act they have failed to fulfil their contractual obligations
I have tried repeatedly to engage people at Tenretni in conversation to try to find an amicable solution to our dispute, originally asking for reassurance that the problems would be sorted out and after being repeatedly ignored I finally asked for a refund which has also been ignored.
The Sale of Goods Act 1979 makes it an implied term of the contract that goods be as described, fit for purpose and of satisfactory quality. As the company is in breach of contract I am rejecting the website and training package and request that they refund the sum paid to themof 1995
these people ( tenretni group | tenretni Ltd | Tenretni ) are pure internet scammers and will steal your money
You have been warned  !!!!

										In order to get a wider presence for my website I signed up for multiple online directories for my company, Citygrid being one of them. When you set up an account they require a credit card number even if you do not plan on starting a pay per click campaign or similar. I should have never gone farther than that, because it has been nothing but a nightmare since then. I was ""auto-enrolled"" in a campaign that had a minim monthly budget of 400.00. I had not even completed a company profile or spent any time with the site. 
About one month later I see a charge for almost $450.00 on my credit card statement. I immediately called their customer service to fix the situation and was met with a scripted response intended to put the blame on me and allow them to rip me off. They told me I had to pay and there was nothing they could do. I had them cancel my account and listing. [continued below]....
									
										..... At that point my only recourse was through my credit card company. 
I had the charges reversed. Now, another month after the first charge I have been charged again for twice the amount as the first. $850.00!!!!!! If they had provided anything it would have been worth something, but I did not receive even one hit to my website. I strongly urge anyone not to get involved with this company. There are many sites online that describe the same situation with this company, previously called citysearch. I hope this helps people from making the same mistake I did.

										In Sept. of 2003 I had saved $16,000.00 I was hoping to open my own business. I purchased one terminal from Nationwide after I saw them on an info commercial. I thought I was securing my future with all the funds that I had to my name, because a lying company and all their representatives assured me and promised me that this was a profitable venture and assured me that I would get a return on my investment. The computers were the best Dell and would stand up against consist use.
I placed the order in Sept. of 2003 after multiple calls from Nationwide (these calls generated after I inquired about the machine.) After the initial order, of course they got my money first, ($15,999,00)I was promised delivery in 45 days.  NationWide had my machine delivered to my home not the location, I had to find a way to get it to the location myself, not as they stated to me that they would take of that. 
They promised to place my machines in the best locations in my city because there was no one else here. I called 7 sometimes 15 times a week to see where I would be placed. I never was. I had to seek a locator's help.  
They robbed me of all I had saved. I am now out of money, out of a income. They lied about the placement. They lied about the income. Hell, they lied about everything. Run, run, don't look back. Run like your hair is on fire. These sleazy ripoffs need to be served , I need justice. I have scrap metal in my garage.

w.lebanon, New HampshireU.S.A. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here. 
Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action.

										In the first week of May, 2008, I signed up with Penbrook Productions for their course on working at home.  They did not disclose that you need a large bank to cover the 'per click' charges to get your ad in a prominent position.  I began asking for my refund that was advertised available for the 90 day trial period on May 12, 2008, it is now August 24, and I continually get the 'run-around' from them.  I have followed up at least weekly since by phone and email.  Now I have to go through fastsupportlive.com, as Penbrook is no longer taking phone calls.  This is an aggravating situation.

										Insurance Agents Beware:  NetQuote (and Insureme.com) markets themselves as a near-real-time lead generation company for insurance agents looking to connect with more prospects.  Don't believe the hype!  They tell you all kinds of bull to get you to sign up; things like only selling the lead to three agents to reduce competition when they really sell the lead to between 10 and 30; or that the leads actually went online to request insurance quotes and you get there info within minutes of requesting a quote -- HA! some of the leads are actually dead!
My FMO recommended these guys and it was an utter disaster.  After 3 months and $1,000 cash, only 2 of over100 ""leads"" were truly viable prospects.  I received leads for individuals that were impossible to reach, hadn't lived at the provided address for 2-5 years, had not actually provided their information to NetQuote within the past 18 months, or were actually dead.  Yet, NetQuote will tell the agent that these are individuals ""waiting for an agent to contact them.""  Don't believe it.  I actually had a lead for a chemical engineer working for ExxonMobil who had lived in New Zealand for the past 12 years, but he supposedly only lived 12 miles away from me.  I know this because it was his father that I spoke with when I tried to contact him!
Bottom line is this:  NetQuote will not provide you, the agent, any more accurate information than you could get from the phonebook for free, but they'll charge you an arm and a leg for bogus information.  These scumbags are perfect examples of why the lead generation industry has such a crappy reputation.  I lost a ton of confidence and respect with my FMO for steering me to this scammer, and they're getting an earful.

										Internet Advancement failed to hold up their gauarantee and their refund policy.  First they did not input the Meta tags correctly (I have an email from them stating they made a mistake) and then they said that we changed the Meta tags they added.  We contracted with them for 3 sites and none is ranked on any search engine.  
Even the Internet Advancement sales person admited that they should give us a refund.  They promise reports after 30 days and we had to ask 6 times to get the reports.  They finally sent them after 90 days.  It wasn't until after these reports that they figured out the Tags where wrong. You cannot get to them via the phone because it always goes to voice mail.  They only return your emails after normal working hours.  Save you money - DO NOT GIVE INTERNETADVANCEMENT YOUR BUSINESS.

										It happened about June 2006 , when these people contacted me and promised that we will have profits for the money that they will be collecting us it seemed too good to be true but will their convincing power and promised we were forced to join. Said there will be refund if we didnt reach our desired amount its like 105% , they will keep on calling you until you will be ready to pay once you paid certain amount they will still call you to put some more money for the marketing and advertisement , at first we gave them $2,000 then they called us again they want additional money for marketing strategies, we follwed what they instructed us to do online but still nothing in return.So called them and  just asked for refund promised it will be refunded but it didnt happen. We thought that the full 2000 will be refunded no they said only the fee they called for $150.00 but still; nothing has been refunded.
They will set up site online which you can start with about casino or shopping.
I still have all the informations with me ,and all the papers , certificates and everything I tried calling them again now I was so lucky to see that there are so many reports about them because during that time when we joined them we dont know how to complain where to complain and we were not sure if they're illegal or what , want some justice and want money back because the money we gave thjem were hard earned money, we risked to do it because of their good promised hoping that we could pay out some debts because of this business but its  atotal rip off Im so happy that theyre close now , can anybosy advice us how can we get our money back ..please!!!
I almost die when I had this feeling that OH MY GOD we been ripped , please somebosy help us how to return our money because Im still hoping that we will have justice..

										It happened in Dec 2005, I got an ad in the mail by: EZ Life Solutions, LLC aka: Global Access Multi Media (went out of business since) to get a ""free website"" and I just have to pay them to advertise it and make good money. I sent 2 checks (first I thought did not go through for I used an old account # with Credit Co.-I was wrong!-cashed!) Made out to ""Performarketing "" who supposed to do all my advertising for my ""mini-mall"" Absolutely Nothing. They put it on the web but never activated it! I called it several times but they were all gone.I dealt with a man named: Reuben and Andrea, who claimed it was her father's business. She said she wanted to help people.Reuben tried very hard to get more money out of me but I told him that I did not have it! He said my webside could be advertised on local buses, imagine that! 
The package cost about 3 or 4,000.00 some even more! My credit card did return the initial $1,099.00 that I was charged for ""necessary information in CD's and books and this was a requirement. Needless to say, since I never received it, my credit card kindly returned my money. However the total amount of $2,500.00 was lost to ""Performarketing Co."" for they cashed my 2 checks.(1,250.00 each) And I am now out of that amount and truly need that $ for I am unemployed and my husband was forced to take early retirement.We are living on a very fixed budget.Please help me if you can for I did try government agencies. EZ-Life Solutions were in Phoenix, Arizona..Recently I received an ad in the mail and had ""Performarketing"" on it, so I wrote them a certified letter, but got no response....

										It sounded too good to be true!  We will provide you leads until you close 12 loans for 1,200.  That could amount to hundreds or even thousands of leads! I researched these guys before sending them money so I did not get ripped off.  This is a warning!  I saw a rip off report stating the same scam which took an innocent insurance agent in Tennessee. Here is the link to the report:

 Select Pro Marketing 
http://www.selectpromarketing.com/home.html   866-854-4272
Select Pro doesn't even have a physical location listed anywhere on their site.
I called Select Pro Marketing and low and behold...same exact voice mail as First Option Marketing. 
http://www.firstoptionmarketing.com  
Violet (so she says is her name) refuses to provide references or a business license, TIN and they do not accept credit cards and their ""office"" location is a UPS Store mailbox. 
31 Home Depot Drive (bldg 262 is what they say but it is actually a post mail box # ) Plymouth MA 02360  Wnat to check it out yourself?  Here is the link to the UPS store at that address:  http://www.theupsstorelocal.com/4762/
Just to make sure I checked the following: Plymouth Town Hall, Plymouth Chamber of Commerce, Better Business Bureau, MA Secretary of State and the MA Atty General's Office.  Nobody knows these companies.
I tried Google and Yellowpages.com.  Nothing there either for these guys.
I called Violet's direct number (331) 309-3076 and it says it is a bad number.  I received a call from her Monday July 20th from 925-456-4998 which this number is not in service.  Since Magicjack uses computers and provides a toll free number I have a feeling these guys could be anywhere and IN MY OPINION, IF they are scammers, might employ someone to pick up their mail at the UPS store in Plymouth.
I have no proof that they are fraudulent, however given the circumstances, lack of transparency, they tout on their site that big names like Wal Mart and United Airlines are clients...why would big companies who hire their own telemarketers use these guys? Denial of references, bad numbers, fake office location and they cannot be found published anywhere except through a website and toll free number it leaves one to wonder.   Be careful out there!

										It was December of 2002 and I was home off work due to a broken tailbone when around late in the evening I rececived a phonecall from a jerk by the name of Ryan Brown. He asked me if I was interested in a homebased business, with my own website and would even offer me some insentives if I joined.
at first I was skeptical and he said that once I had my website up they would have a coach to help me sell their stuff on-line and that I would even get residuals if people signed up under me.
He said just imagine the wealth you could make if your with us and you would have your own mall with thousands of stores, health insurace for the eldely or basicliy anyone who needed it and even realstate if it sounded good.
I ended up paying $4200.00 for the whole thing and yes I was excited and really upbeat about the whole thing I received a letter from  Paul Angel congradulating me on my new found success and that I should be hearing from my coach real soon.
I waited for 2 weeks and nothing and I had to call and had their secretary name kristin train help me in somethings but not enough to do much.
nothing happened, I called and left messeges and they would return my call and say your website is up and it was a joke and still no help from netdirectmarketing.
Oh and here is the fun part.. they offer your money back but you have to wait a year so I waited a year December of 2003 I called them and talked to a women named sheila who tried to help me get my $4200.00 back and all I got was since I didnt sell anything or that I didnt listen to my coach they would'nt offer me my refund.
I guess it doesnt really matter to them I even have the letter they sent me saying and I quote ""If you follow our advice but do not make 100% of your initial investment back after twelve months from the day your site goes online give us a call and we will refund the difference.""
well I followed there advice and since I didnt have a coach to help me get it going I called and cancelled my website and didnt get my money back. 
so if people are thinking about getting involve in a website please check it out before you lose your money

										It was to be a lovely excersion to Moscow, I had went online and bought airplane tickets from Travelocity and had paid for a visa from Visittorussia.com. The same day that the charges were coming in, I saw a charge for 9.95 from a MWI*CNSconnections. At first I thought it was strange and thought that it might have been another charge for shipping the forms that I needed for my visa or for my airline tickets, so I thought nothing of it because I did not know what this company was. 
When I got back home, I was surprised to see that MWI had charged me 2 more times. I disputed this with my bank, and the charges were stopped. The next month, I was surprised to see AP9*connections billing me another 9.95. I knew it was the same company because the contact number was the same.
Thanks to this site I found out that I was indeed being ripped off, which I had a hunch of before... Yeah I am not too quick to catch on to these things. But after reading other complaints on this site I am going to try getting my money back from them today. Wish me luck!

Salem, OregonU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										Ive been in sales for over 25 years and have NEVER encountered a more horrific excuse for a company.  We ordered several magazines back in November of 2006 and to date have yet to receive a single issue.  We've received a ton of other 'free' magazines, but none of the ones we initially ordered.  We we call we are told that a ""complaint"" has been filed and it takes 8-12 weeks for them to look into, not solve the issue.  All the while we are still being billed for magazines we haven't received.  
I placed a follow up call and was informed by one of their phone-monkeys that my account has been flagged because I am rude.  When I asked why, I was hung up on in mid-sentence!  When I called back, the woman told me that she would not talk to a ""rude"" person and hung up again.  I tried to explain that I was upset at the fact that we've never received our magazines but she would not listen.  She just kept repeating that I am the rude one and hung up AGAIN!
I cancelled our credit card to stop the billing and informed the BBB in Florida.  This is one orf the biggest scams I have ever encountered and truly believe that they have no intention of fulfilling your magazine subscriptions while pushing ""free"" subscriptions to other magazines that no one wants.

It read like a infomercial and at the end of the whole ebook, since jason doesn't give you all the facts,  he wants you to buy more of his product at an even more inflated price. He lures you in with empty promises then tries to get you to spend more money investing in his products. The only person getting rich is Jason and Co. so don't buy into it.

Jeff will tell you about all of his new programs including his Midwest Super Conference, Resorts 360, and other Internet marketing programs that are going to make you so much money. 
The reality is that jeff mills will be the only one to make money....don't trust him. It will never happen. from jeffmills.com or www.jeffmills.com 
I have bought into so many of his programs, ALL of my friends too, and not one of us had made a penny from anything he sells or promotes.
One thing I can tell you however, is that he will take your money and then never talked to you again.
Now he's traveling the globe speaking at seminars like the Traffic Generation Summit in London and Portugal other speakers like Armand Morin, Matt Bacak, and Brian Koz. You can guarantee I'm probably the one paying for his trip..and a lot of other people who have also been scammed by him too.
What Jeff Mills will do is introduce some kind of guest speaker with great Internet marketing idea that ALSO Don't work....make you think its the greatest thing in the world....then leave you high and dry...hundreds if not thousands of dollars later.
Jeff also ripped me out of thousands of dollars with a Call Center Scam....where he will try to tell you his call centers will close sales for you! Forget it...the only thing that will happen is you'll lose ALL of your money...and be left in the dark!

										Jerry Nolke, website consultant, persuaded my sister and I that with the services of his company: Captures.com, we would make more money faster and get our stores recognized in more search engines.
Web Marketing Source aka Captures.com, was to build us a store in 2.5 for a better style, also they were to update two other stores we already have online, with the option to update the rest of our online stores.
As of today, 12-4-2006, we cannot reach them by phone, e-mail or carrier pigeon(?).  We leave nessages repeatedly, and e-mail frequently.  Some numbers are no longer working numbers and we are very concerned.
We are a new company struggling to survive and need services rendered for the money we invest.  The cost of this service is $4749.99 initially, with $99.99 to be charged monthly thereafter for each website.  If only we could have some feedback and/or a refund if the service is not to be provided.
Is this a legitate company? Or have we been duped?

										Juicy Leads claims to be an internet provider of quality leads for mortgages and more.  The use SPAM tatics and try to cover this by claiming to use third party companies to collect leads.  They are one of the leading causes of SPAM on the internet.
They use misleading and down right lies as subject lines to get people to open the e-mail.  A representative of juicy leads even called me to confirm that I filled out a form to get a quote.  I informed this person that I followed the link from the SPAM to a site to fill out the form so I would be contacted by a human to trace the source of the e-mail.  The source is always juicy leads.  This person told me if I was not interested to just delete the e-mail or not to fill out the form.  This is how he defends the illigal and annoying use of SPAM to generate the leads.
I also understand they are denying a credit to the companies that call me to solicit mortgage services.

										Just looked at the email that I failed to send to Bill Todd (CEO of capbizgroup) today. Basically they cheated me to setting up one pharmacy website and one casino website for $998 in total, and promised me that I would get back the investment within several months. They even persuaded me not to ask for a refund within 30 days when I felt something wrong at that time. Now after one year I didn't see a penny coming in as comission for those two websites at all.
I feel so lucky that I regret right after setting up the websites and didn't put more money into the advertisement that they tried to allure me into!!! I don't know if I can still get my $998 back, but based on my expereince, anyone please never be cheated by their disguise again and stay far away from Bill Todd!

Hi Todd:
THis was your reply email when I asked for refund last year, you said you would prove to me how all of this works, but I didn't see any proof  after one year. My commission is still $0 after one year of waiting, which means now matter how many visits you sent to my website it doesn't work to mke money for me at all, which was quite different from what your salesman told me before. At that time they said I could expect more than getting back my investment within several months, which was apparently misleading when I am looking back now. I think I was cheated when I entered into this fault business and also when you gave me wrong infomation in the email again to let me stay and wait when I tried to get my refund within 30 days. 
As you promised here, you said I can ask you questions anytime I want to, and if you don't respond to my email this time and figure out all things, I remain all my legal rights to do anything against this.
Thanks,

										Just thought I'd warn people know that Vista Print will sell your credit card information to WLI Reservations - a marketing company.  There are lots of other companies that will do this as well.  Make sure you search the web for such companies.  A simple google search on WLI Reservations fraud turns up tons of links.  When you process an order through Vista Print a pop-up asks you if you want additional services or some such non-sense.  They ask for your e-mail address twice and if you give it to them, it 'authorizes' WLI to essentially steal your account information and begin processing monthly 'service charges'.  I got whacked 3 times for $9 each for their 'services'.  All my wife wanted to do was buy some business cards and some magnets.  I'll never do business with companies that have 'partnerships' with such ripoffs again.  It may be more expensive, but I'm sure my local screenprinter would love to have the extra business....

										Just to see if it was legit, I used a junk email address to attempt to get a Red Lobster gift card from theuseful.com.  After pages of information, I finally got to the page where you had to sign up for at least one offer before receiving your gift card.  Since I was going to sign up for BMG Music anyway, I decided why not here and get a gift card as a bonus.  Well, to make a long story short, I never received the gift.  I called and left the useful a message with no response.  
I finally did receive a response from an email I sent indicating that they had sent me a form to fill out and mail back and that I had never returned it.  They gave a website address which took me to the form with my name and address on it already.  I completed the form and physically mailed it to them in Florida.  It has been about 6 weeks since mailing back the form and I still have not received anything.  BEWARE!!!

										Kaching Kaching is a total rip-off. They do tell you that they will shut down Amazon and that all of their prices top theirs which is a total lie as I checked the prices and Amazon's prices were much lower overall and better than all Kaching Kaching prices. They kept telling us that our site would sell itself, then after they convince us to buy in at $29and $1 per month that we could earn even more because we would actually be business builders!!! The representative who lives in Sonoma County and actually works for the Chamber of Commerce, made many promises, wanted our visa card number over the phone so that we could become business builders. There were no contracts but we were told we could change our minds and receive a refund of our $29.00 within the first month. Now the company is saying they have never heard of Will Brody!!!I realized $29 isn't a lot of money, but my husband was unemployed at the time but the representative knew that at the time and $29 was too much to pay for anything that was worth nothing to us at the time. They are making money from the little guy, like us and profiting from it. Then after he received our money, he wanted us to call our friends and get them to join!!! If we had known that we would have never joined this business!!!None of our friends would be interested in this and we were not willing to lie to them to sell something so that we could make commisson on selling this business idea that doesn't work for most regular honest people!!

										Lakeview Solutions may seem like a dream come true when they contact you, but beware. 
I got a call back the day after I sent Lakeview Solutions my resume asking to come in for an interview. Being that I have been dealing with scam artists all Summer, I decided to do some research. 
I went to their website and not only is it a cheap hosting site (red flag 1), but everything is extremely vague (red flag 2). Usually, if a company is ""a major presence in some of the country's largest chain retailers"" one would logically think that those largest chain retailers would be shouted from the rooftops, so to speak. 
Not for Lakeview Solutions! I called the Human Resources department and the person whom answered would not tell me which chain retailers the company is working for (red flag 3). Human Resources of Lakeview assured me that they're hiring for many positions. I asked her which position I was interviewing for, to which she said I'd find out once I go to the interview (red flag 4). 
I googled the company, and all I could find was the numerous job-finding websites they've posted on (red flag 5) for the past four months (red flag 6). You would think they would be able to hire employees after four months of relentless posting on a cornucopia of websites. 
I would not bother going to an interview with said company. ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										Last May when I was on a plane going to visit my relatives back east I saw an infomercial on the plane which offered ways to make money on ebay and the Internet. I sent for the information pack and instead of paying the $39.95 requested I paid $123.18 including tax and shipping for the upgraded package. 
When I received it and read the material and watched all the DVDs, I realized that there was very very little information that I did not already know.  I figured that I should have known better, and felt good that I only was out the $123.18.  
Well, I noticed on a recent bank statement that I have been charged $29.95 per month since then for absolutely nothing.  I never agreed to any additional charges or did I receive anything additional in the mail. 
After reading the rip off reports on this site, I now feel pretty bad that I did not catch this sooner. I am going to contact my bank and see what if anything can be done regarding these charges and also how to stop these automatic debits.

										Like many others I have read on these pages, I too fell victim to the Incentive Reward Centers appealing offer for a 40GB iPod. From all I have read, I trust that maybe someday I will see my due iPod. It is hard to say.  
I will preface this by saying that it is frusterating that legitimate, good businesses (Blockbuster, USA Today, Columbia House, etc. are aligned with these guys). This is part of the reason I started in this endeavor to begin with... I trusted these companies.
I started filling out offers in late November, early December. I quickly went through the top offers on pages 1 and 2. In fact, I needed some of the stuff, and still use some memberships I joined. I thought it was a pretty good deal.
Page 3 caused some issues, because I did not need anything on the pages. I ended up signing up for the USA today offer. The next day, that offer was no longer on the 3rd page. And the credit never posted. I am not sure what happened... but I have not yet received a USA today, or did I get a bill. I can only assume that something technical happened.
In any event, a few ""new"" page three offers popped up. I thought some of them looked good, so I signed up. First for the webhosting (which posted soon after). I also decided to ""Xoom"" money to Sri Lanka to help with the relief effort. It took me a few days to find a person to send it too, but the local church helped out and my money was on it's way. Instantly.
Xoom turns out to be a pretty neat service, however it is not in all countries yet. Anyway. I was done. Smiling because I knew I had sent money to a good cause, and because I knew this was my final obligation to receive my new 40GB iPod.
Well, that was weeks ago. The website NEVER updated my 6th and final offer. It shows I went there... but never posted that i completed the offer. Incentive Reward Center is dangling the carrot... but just out of reach.
Well, I reasoned there must be a phone number or someone to call. I had already sent 5 emails by this point over a month span with absolutley NO response. I found an 800 number, the greeting sounds nice... but NOBODY calls back. I even found a name and number of a Customer Service Rep who helped someone else... she has not contacted me.
I am now getting very bummed out. I had my hopes set on this iPod. I spent around $200 in stuff (some I needed, some not) and I expected to get my due reward. Instead I get a website that shows 5 out of 6 completes... and NO phone calls or emails back.
I even sent the supporting documentation - XOOM receipt and a copy of the top offers page 3. I might add that the Top offers on page three that I have to choose from today does NOT INCLUDE the Xoom offer or the Internet Hosting. It seems the necessary steps to complete each layer change.
Just like the USA Today offer, the Xoom and Hosting are now removed from the offers.  That is also concerning. The only glimmer of hope I have that I am still ""OK"" is that I cut and pasted a copy of the 3rd page offers into a word document that shows that indeed, at one point Xoom was a top offer.
I am not sure if this rant will help, but if someone has any ideas, I am open. I like to believe the best in people, and I still think that I can get my iPod based on reading other emails. In the end it will be hard to say if it was worth it. We'll see if anyone from this company contacts me. I will keep this up to date, and let you know how I fare.
I am now afraid that my 90 day time limit will run out, and that will be the next ""hook"" that gets me. ""Sorry Mr. Jeesse, you did not complete your offers in time"". I hope that is not the case.

										Like most of you who signed on for this deal (in my case, a free laptop) I consider myself a pretty savy and cautious sort of person. I read all the terms and privacy policies etc. and was impressed by all the legit companies that were attached to the promotion (EXCEPT freebidding.com. I was never able to log on to their sight, they never responded to emails, and I never received a cancellation confirmation, be wary of that one... took my $3.95).
I completed my six commitments, received a confirmation within a few days and now have my prize voucher in hand. BUT there is an official-looking I.R.S. form (""Substitute Form W-9"") that CIP stipulates I MUST complete because my gift is valued over $600. No problem except where it requests my SSN. Now I'm real nervous but I want my laptop by gawd and am willing to fight tooth and nail for it but not at the expense of an ID theft. Anyone have any suggestions?
I contacted BBB but they had no record of CIP, at least in that guise. Now I'm reading all this feedback and I don't trust 'em with my SSN.

										Martin Worldwide is a Lead company that outsources most of there leads but can easily tell you when you call in that whatever you want is available. After i ordered one list from this company, which was all wrong and not even close, they supplied me with a different replacement list.  After that one proved to be worse than the first, they provided another false list.  I had 3 Telemarketers get paid $10/hr to see the quality of this list, My mail also costs me $0.50 per letter, i sent out 5000.  
After realizing this company couldn't provide a good service no matter what, i asked for a refund, at which point i was told i will only get a 50% refund, once i complained about the refund, i got instead a $250 Gift certificate for more leads.  I believe that the woman helping me with this was also on the verge of quitting because of the frustration of dealing with clients like me and not being able to provide them a refund.  This company has not only wasted my time but plenty of my money. And although i wont get my telemarketer money or mailing money back... getting a refund for the leads would almost justify it. But thats not possible with this company, so make sure that if your looking to waste your time or money, or both, Martin Worldwide is the place to burn your money away and add to your frustration.

										May of 2007 I recieved a phone call from a man named Cree of Web Wealth Strategies.  He let me listen to an Audio over the phone proposing a Turn Key Web Based Business that runs itself with proper advertising.  You would make money in Three Categories.   Home Mortgages, Health Insurance and Selling Internet Bussiness Opportunities.   The returns were to be sizable  and with the Health Care portion you would generate a residual income month to month.  The cost was only $495.00 but sold to me for $229.00.  Cree was very much so available during the romance stage to get me into the business.  Always available to answer my questions and concerns.  
Several days later after a little checking  on May 14, 2007 I made the purchase.  A week or so later I recieved my package in the mail showing me the opportunity that I bought.  A very nice high quality booklet explaining how to market your business for huge profits!  I contacted there Marketing Coaching Dept and they set me up with a Company supposedly that had No Affiliation with Web Wealth Strategies.  This company had Supposedly become a Business Partner of Web Wealth Strategies to help their clients market their website.   
June 1, 2007 I was contacted by INCREDIBLE ADVERTISING Coach Shawn Kelly.  we spent approx 3 hours on and off the phone that day prior to me making the business decision to move forward.  I checked the BBB online and checked out the physical address of both businesses during that 3 hour period to make sure that there was a physical location.   Everything appeared to checkout.  
Shawn was offering a 1 year Advertising Campaign for my website that would include a T.V Commercial, Radio Advertising in several markets across the United States and a Guaranteed 150,000 internet hits to my website during that year all for  $48,000.00 but for a limited time he said there was a special for $24,000.00 dollars!   
With this amount of advertising I would be making very conservative $150,000.00 per year Income but more likely $200,000.00 Plus per year in income! He said that I would receive my first sizeable check from Web Wealth Strategies by the end of the month!  And as the months went by the checks would get larger and larger.   Shawn told me that their Website Developer BRAD would be contacting me that day to get the site up and running so those checks could start rolling in.  I never got a call from Brad.  
Finally after several days I talked with Brad and after more Delays my site was up and running June 13, 2007.  Like Cree, Shawn Kelly was very available and helpful up until I made the purchase.  Cree was out ill for the past few weeks and Shawn Kelly was suddenly so busy that he was never available. He was my personal Advertising Coach by the way...I was able to finally talk with Cree again and he seemed like an entire different person.   Not so helpful anymore!Brad and everyone else never knew what was going on and didn't know the internal workings of the company.   
July 1st 2007 came around and I contacted Web Wealth Strategies to find out what happened to my month end report that shows my business earnings.  Not to mention, where is my first check?  No one knew what I was talking about and bla,bla,bla...   
Finally afer a bunch of phone calls between Web Wealth Stategies and Incredible Advertising a man named Carvell of Web Wealth Strategies finally started to talk with me.  He was very smooth talking and spit rehearsed lines from some script he must have made up.  He basically says a whole lot of nothing! He also apologized for not having the information since he was recently hired and was just the person that answers phones there. 
July 10th 2007  again I am trying to see how business is doing and Web Wealth Strategies refers me to Incredible Advertising for these Facts.  Incredible Advertising refers me back to Web Wealth Strategies.  No one is ever available except for the person that takes calls.  All they can do is take your name and number and have someone get back to you.  No one ever does!  
July 18th 2007 Ive had it with the Games at Web Wealth Strategies.  Im insisting on talking to someone in Charge NOW! I get get referred to a Supervisor named Carvell. But Carvell was in a Very Important Meeting and would be Unavailable for the next sevearl hours!  Funny! I had remembered speaking with a Carvell several weeks earlier but at that time he was just another one of the many individuals that just answers the phone and can take messages. Now he's this Supervisor!?!?So I leave my name and Number for Carvell to call me back.   
Immediately I call Incredible Advertising to CANCEL this B/S and ask for a REFUND!  The girl on the phone puts me on Hold for 15min. then Suddenly CARVELL ANSWERS the the phone!?!?! I was shocked! Carvell is suppose to be working for WEB WEALTH STRATEGIES and be in this BIG MEETING and unavailable for the next few hours!!!  But Here's Carvell suddenly on the phone at Incredible Advertising!  
I ask why is he there if the two companies are not affiliated and what happened to the BIG MEETING he was in.  He spits more smooth talk about how I should go out and put flyers on peoples cars, pass out business cards with the website bla,bla,bla.   I tell him I think my $24,000.00 Dollars should be sufficient and that I didn't purchase this TURN KEY INTERNET BUSINESS to Go Out and Hussle around with Flyers bla,bla,bla.  We Spoke for 20min. and Not One of my Concerns was Addressed.  I let him know that he failed to address any of my concerns after that 20 min conversation.  He at this point said that he could not spend any more time with me over the phone and hung up!   
Today July 26th 2007 I have not earned a Penny in Income from this business opportunity.  I have never recieved a Detailed Package showing my Advertising Campaign as Promised!  I have never recieved any catagorized reports showing the pending / approved applications that my business is suppose to be producing!  
For a Turn Key Business thats has been making people money over the internet with a much smaller Budget that I had over the past few years Suggests that this entire Opportunity is a SHAM!!!I want my money back and Im tired of the B/S Games between these two companies.  I am also filing a report with the BBB Online.

Charlie Brown I have a shit load of stuff on the Consoli Gang. Were you aware that they have organized crime connections? We have to figure out a way for us to make a connection, in a way that we are both comfortable with. 
I have done my research and have a lot of information, but I am having a little trouble connecting it all together. I have birth paper copies, death certificate, credit reports, real estate documents, quick claim deeds,etc. 
I am now working on a history research concerning thier movements from New Jersey, Florida, Nevada, and Arizona. I am also researching Passafiume's background. Sooner or later, I will have it all together, and in the end, I will bring them down big time.
I would very much would like a copy of your hard copy of the injunction. I am expecting a copy any day now of the original civil action in Nevada. So put on your thinking cap and figure out a way for us to communicate.

										Michael Brantley left me a message about money I had with his company.  Turns out I had become a free website owner and 2 people had already joined in my ""downline"" and I had $3000 dollars of commission pending with his company.  All I had to do is become a ""Paid Member"" to receive it and until Friday they were running a promotion. 
Instead of the regular $2000 it would only be $500.
I said ""Keep your $500 and send me the balance since its already my commission.""  Thats not how it works.
So I asked some questions,  Company address? Company phone number? Where is the company registered?
The address turned up to be a Mail Boxes Etc in Cape Coral.
The phone number was not registered as a land line.
The Company was not registered in the state of Florida nor was it registered with the IRS.
Then Michael told me his last name was Davis, and told me he worked out of NY from his cell phone.
When I questioned his business it is a classic ponzi skeem.  There is no good or service offered by this company.  Just marketing of ""free"" websites.
BE WARE!!! The purchasers agreement is clear, if you pay the money they are selling you a unqualified list of leads on a CD.  Once you get that, they can keep your money forever.  Furthermore, you're paying for membership to a website.  YOU WILL NOT GET YOUR MONEY BACK.
This guy is great on the phone and in my opinion, he's a con.
Its ashamed he doesn't work in a legitimate business.  He's good.

										Microsoft has issued a unauthorized charge to my credit card and refuses to refund our money after being held on the phone for over half an hour by poor English speaking representatives. They said that when we bought the one month subscription in Jan that we agreed to ""terms of service"" to have our c.c. billed monthly which we absolutely did NOT I saw my husband authorize that charge for a ONE MONTH ONLY subscription to Live.
Yet we didn't get a charge for February so it seems they are lying to cover themselves.  It doesn't make sense, but I reported my card lost or stolen so they can't issue any more charges and I am disputing the charge with my c.c. company.
Anyway, the representative was extremely rude to me, kept saying ""Know this, you will NOT get your money back"". 
I asked to speak to someone over him, and he said I was talking to someone as high up as I could. When I asked for a reference number for the conversation I had with him, he gave me the number the previous representative gave me, I addressed this and he would not give me a new number.

										Mr. James Taylor of Imegre Marketing was performing a free service for a local nonprofit in which I am a sponsor. He was creating their newsletter for a major event and an ad for my business was to be placed in the publication. He at first purposely distorted the ad by changing colors then purposely stretched it disproportionately before sending it to the printer.
While he was working on the ad, he photographed his screen and submitted it to failblog which caused numerous harassing telephone calls and emails to my place of business. On top of that, the ""internet trolls"" who hang out on failblog further attacked other business listings for me around the internet and wrote harassing feedback.
I at first published a message on my site addressing and attacking James for this unprofessional and childish antic. This provoked a telephone call from Mr. Taylor himself who denied any responsibility in the failblog posting. At first he claimed an ""unknown party"" took a photo of his screen and posted it, then after a heated conversation he claimed to know the person but would not release their name(s).
This is not the first time Mr. Taylor of Imegre Marketing has tried to attack me. The last time he tried to log on to one of my websites to post insulting remarks, fortunately my comment system was moderated and I aborted his attempt.
In the incident I am reporting now, it doesn't matter if James Taylor did the actual posting to failblog, as he had control of the artwork and most likely knew of the malicious intent of the photo. I confronted him telling him he most likely had the photo taken to send to a friend so he could spoof the IP address of the posting to which he chuckled as he knew I was right. This indicates that whoever created the post, the whole thing was orchestrated by James Taylor himself.
I offered James to remedy the situation by issuing an apology publicly on his company letterhead for posting on my site. He has refused thus far and stated he is not responsible in this incident. When questioned, ""Who is?"" he has no reply.
I believe my request for a public apology to be reasonable and just. While necessary to exact justice, I find it uncomfortable that I have had to take this to the extreme by posting my complaint on this site.
Mr. Taylor publicly states he is a Christian and uses that as a marketing tool to solicit accounts from Churches. There is nothing Christian about his behavior let alone nothing professional or ethical.
I would seriously hope anyone considering using his services to question whether anything submitted to him might cause their business the type of hardships as I have suffered. This behavior is unprofessional and childish to say the least.
I haveincluded a screen shot of his posting to failblog as well as their comment system where he admits some liability but tries to blame the actual post on a 3rd party named ""Tom"".									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										My brother and I entered an agreement with Brightbuilders April of 2006.  We were promised by their Sales Representative Bob Friis we would make our $8,000. back within one month.  I was unemployed at the time and was looking for a new business venture.  This is one company we should have stayed away from.  None of the promises Mr. Friis made came to pass.  
I worked 6 to 8 hours per day. I signed up with Doba and they never had any of the products I was looking for available.  We had weekly coaching and we were informed we needed to design our web site and find a niche.  We were informed by Mr. Friis we would not need a niche or keep inventory at our home.  We were also charged $38.95 per month for Brightbuilders to maintain our web site.  
They never helped with the design of the web site, even though this was promised by Mr. Friis, nor did they provide us with the tools to create our own web site.  
We continued to explain to our Coach Rick that we were told we did not need a niche nor were we responsible for designing our web site.  The $8000.00 was to include design of the web site since we explained to Mr. Friis we are not ""marketing people"", and he said ""not to worry Brightbuilders would design the web site for us"".  This of course was a serious lie.  Our web site to date is not complete.  
I was forced to go back to work full time as a Manager and have not had the time to deal with Brightbuilders.  I have sent an email to Jazmine and Lindsay explaining all of this in detail on May 8th and have not heard from them.

										My business had a contract with Dex Media for one year for which we paid through our Qwest phone bill. I received a phone call asking about renewing and told them I must speak to my husband/partner. They then called back and we told them NO, we do not want any more advertising with them, just the free, basic listing.
When I received my current phone bill, there is a charge for Dex Media Online for twice the cost as last year. I phoned them immediately and told them I had spoken to rep. and did not want any more advertising. They denied I had spoken to them the second time about denying future ad. and said it was too late, our ad renewed and I had to pay for the full year.
I tried calling their claims number, the rep I spoke to, etc. They said we had to pay and if we didn't, they would submit us to collections.
I have tried and not been able to resolve this. We are a small business that is trying to survive without paying for extra advertising that we don't need. Dex says when you call them that the call may be recorded, but when I asked for them to look this up, they only have 'notes' about the first call.
I have reported them to the Better Business Bureau for which they have an 'F' rating. Please, do not do business with them.

										My experience with Online Biz Marketing is basically the same as all of those that have been reported on this site.  After realizing that I had no idea what the charges on my credit card were for I contacted Visa to dispute them.  I researched the company online and found this website (Ripoff Report).  Still not sure what I was supposed to have purchased, I phoned a customer service representative who explained that the first charge of $1.97 was for access to information on government grants, the next charge of $39.85 was to be a monthly charge for the service and the last charge of $129.85 was a one time administrative or membership fee.  She also referrred to cancellation  being required within 14 days.
Even though I had cancelled the service after finding the charges the representative said she would restore the site for me (at no cost) so I could see what services were offered.  She also sent me another e-mail confirmation with instructions on how to access the site.  There was very little information on the site and the only charge I saw was for the $1.97.  Obviously, they are able to get credit card #s and other billing information when people think they are buying something for $1.97 only.  It is my understanding other charges are covered in the ""terms and conditions"" which is listed on the site in very small and very light colored print...very easy to miss.
Additionally, the confirmation e-mail with your user name, password and instructions on how to access the online resource center website (http://admin.affiliatecustomercare.com/Logon/logon.aspx) could easily be overlooked as junk mail.  It is sent from a different e-mail address(admin@customersupportresource.com).  To confuse even more the website address that sends you to all of this is (workanywherefree.com).
The customer service representative was very cordial and pleasant.  She said her company answers calls for three online businesses.  She stated that all of the information regarding Online Biz Marketing was listed on the website and that some people simply don't take the time to read. I agree with that.  However, it appears that this company works overtime at making this process very complicated.  
It is my impression that the service provided by Biz Marketing includes a list of government grants that are available to qualified applicants to assist them in starting an internet business, resources availabe to help set up a website, and how to link with companies, large and small, sell their products and services through this website and receive a commission for doing so.  Sounds like a fairly simple straightforward plan, doesn't it?  Too bad it is so complex and people aren't aware of what they have purchased and how much it will cost them.

										My first complaint with scooter nitro is the time of delivery. They said it would take 14 days from the time of order, then it changed to 14 business days (Mon-fri) We ordered our on June 18,2008 and it arrived July 28,2008 More than a month later. When it arrived it was damaged, the crate was damage the panels on the scooter was scrapped up and the front blinker was broken. Now the fun part like playing with a broken gift on Christmas day, Starting it.. the first thing was the remote start/ alarm a good selling point right? well when we used ours it blew a fuse, we call scooter nitro and they said it was recalled after we ordered the bike so dissconnect the wiring to the alarm & remote. So I begin to ride the scooter and it shuts off on me as I am riding down the road. I contact sccoter nitro again they said the air screw on the carb may need adjusting OR the fuel pump is going bad? BAD? it's brand new why would it be going bad? The web site is down and no one anwsers the phone. I also inquired about the parts I ordered a month ago from the damage done in shipping, but they did not address that question. This scooter sucks and I want a full refund, but no one is there now! I wonder why? The web site also said it came with a 36 month warranty free of charge, but that only cover parts and NOT labor which is $50.00 and above an hour, IF they can get the parts. If I would have known I would have needed so much labor I would have never got the scooter to begin with, its worse than a car to get fixed.DO NOT BUY A SCOOTER ONLINE FROM SCOOTER NITRO!!!!

										My first complaint with scooter nitro is the time of delivery. They said it would take 14 days from the time of order, then it changed to 14 business days (Mon-fri) We ordered our on June 18,2008 and it arrived July 28,2008 More than a month later. When it arrived it was damaged, the crate was damage the panels on the scooter was scrapped up and the front blinker was broken. Now the fun part like playing with a broken gift on Christmas day, Starting it.. the first thing was the remote start/ alarm a good selling point right? well when we used ours it blew a fuse, we call scooter nitro and they said it was recalled after we ordered the bike so dissconnect the wiring to the alarm & remote. So I begin to ride the scooter and it shuts off on me as I am riding down the road. I contact sccoter nitro again they said the air screw on the carb may need adjusting OR the fuel pump is going bad? BAD? it's brand new why would it be going bad? The web site is down and no one anwsers the phone.

										My husband responded to an ad in the paper and was told that People's Lifestyle Inc. would send him material to assemble things at home, that they were a distributor who worked for businesses like Wal-Mart. He purchased the material, or so we thought, for $44.95. He was told that the fee was totally refundable for two months if he decided he didn't want to do it. 
The next day, I did a little research on the company and thank God I found this site. I called the company to ask a few questions. I asked the lady what we should be expecting to receive in the mail and she said he purchased a directory of businesses. I asked her how to cancel the order and she said the catalog had already been mailed out.
I told her that I would send it back when I received it and I expected a full refund. The lady very rudely told me that the only way I could get my money back is if my husband was denied work from one of the companies in the directory. I told her that things were not explained that way and all she said was ""they should have been explained that way"". 
I'm so glad I found this site because I was able to stop the transaction before these scam artist got a dime from me. I hope no one else gets ripped off like we almost did.

										My Internet Payday is a scam.  They entice you with a $1.00 trial membership, but in fine print not located on the same webpage, they include a $78.27 monthly fee.  There is no email communication about this fee, nor is it located on the application form.  I tried to call and cancel, however the mailbox was full and I could not leave a message.  How are you supposed to cancel?  I tried to get online, however there is no email address or link to a customer support page to walk you through the process.  After using the international number, I finally got through to a customer support agent.  Adonis WIliams #706 was his name and he cancelled my membership, but refused to refund my $78.

Karen1968
warren, MichiganU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										MyPoints offered a credit card last year and for each purchase you were supposed to receive points.  In addition, there was a 2500 point offer for opening and being accepted for the card.  I should have over 6000 points in my account according to my credit card statement, not including the initial offer.  For some reason my points have never been credited. 
I've sent numerous emails asking for help, only to receive a generic computer generated response.  I've left messages on their phones (because there are no humans at corporate HQ), and I've contacted the credit card company, all to no avail.  The credit card holder, Providian, insists it is crediting the points - I even got to talk to a human there who said she would try to contact myPoints for me.  This company is a ripoff! All they want is to capture your personal info so they can get other companies to use their services, pretending that it will increase their sales.  Well, maybe it does but I won't buy anyting through mYPoints anymore!

										Not two weeks after unpacking from our big move, I started having chronic migraines and I mean chronic--these headaches lasted from 5 to 10 days or more..... and I was ill, throwing up, couldn't stand more than a few minutes and then had to lay down. After 4 or 5 years of putting up with my migraines, my husband decided that heavy drinking was the only way for him to deal with his life, so in 2005, we divorced.  
I still had the migraines and had to take the kids to school and back everyday, go to the grocery store, etc... But to be honest, I was so out-of-it from being being medicated most of the time, I could even feel my own skin. Months and months passed and before we knew it, and spring was here. I finally realized that I was a single parent and had to do something with my life in order to make a living. 
A few months earlier I started volunteering at the Healdsburg Animal Shelter a couple afternoons a week with my 2 daughters aged 9 and 11 and we loved it.  We were talking about starting some type of business down in the Healdsburg area. There are alot of wealthy people that live in Healdsburg and many people with pets... Then I started to brainstorm and came up with the idea of a Doggy Hotel. At the time, there wasn't anything like that there. It was perfect! 
     So I started searching the web.... I came accross Synergy Pro Consulting--Wow how impressive their website was and still is. I browsed through their website and made the call. I was immediately drawn into their program (good sales consultants)with all their false promises over the phone. It was June 20, 2006, she gave me the tuition amount and told me that they would not take it out of my account until after the ""last"" coaching session was complete--But 7 days later they took the $4,300 out 6/30/2006 without my permission. About that time I started having really bad migraines again. Just as soon as I was getting over one, I would get another.... and over and over. I was on so many pharmaceutical drugs I couldn't even tell you my name. I even missed a couple coaching sessions.. But I have to say, I didn't miss much.  
     According to the Enrollment Confirmation Sheet I am entitled to 9 Custom Coaching Sessions & 17 Referral Vouchers.... Now the vouchers aren't worth anything unless you go out and market clients for them. Each client you bring in for Synergy Pro consultants (they have to pay a tuition like I did), you get $250. Wow what a deal! That's what I got for $4,300.00. I was totally ripped off. I wrote them a letter a few weeks later requesting my money back and Kate Dalley, Administrations Director put me in my place and told me that I signed the contract and I received what was on the contract. 
     Like I said at the time, I was on so many medications to relieve the pain of my migraines and they knew that. I had to cancel coaching sessions because of the pain I was in. They took advantage of me in the following ways:
-Told me they wouldn't be taking out the $4,300 until after the last session even though they planned on taking it out sooner.
-They knew up front I wouldn't be able to complete all sessions because of my illness, but they took my money anyways--This company was not build on morals at all--I see all the complaints against them on Better Business Bureau.
-Knew that I was on heavy duty medication--so when I demanded my money back, they knew I wouldn't put up a fight.
     I know it's almost 3 years later, but I have my migraines under control now. I have applied for Social Secrurity because it's hard for me to work, and I am still really bothered by the fact that this company took advantage of me and my money and I got absolutely nothing out of it. I don't want their services. I too have a Master's Degree in Business and can receive all the info they offer on the internet for free!! I want my money back. I am raising 2 daughters by myself.

										November 2003- Received Numerous Emails regarding free placement in Internet Malls. Internet Advancment contacted me and told me that if I wanted my hobby to be a real business that they could get me on the top ten in Search Engine searches. Was promised reports showing placment (still to date, not one report)
November 29, 2003 Signed on. Gave them almost $1,000. They had to go in to my site and put in something called a Source Code. I did my website on a template and did not understand what to do.
February 18, 2004 Emailed my salesperson, requested report. Have not had any more hits, no orders, and am falling on my placement. I was on the first page  until signing on with I.A. Received email from technician. He said guarantee didn't start until March.
April 8, 2004 Requested Refund. No reports, not on top ten, in fact can't be found. Was told that I was #18  for Scented Candles. I don't sell or make scented candles. Was told to go in to website and add specific key words on my front page. I did so.
April 13, 2004-- Again Requested refund. Response from I.A. Your source code has been changed and you don't qualify for refund. I was extremely upset, he promised to go in and change the Source Code back for me.
April 16, 2004. Sent certified letter requesting refund and told them they did not have permission to bill my account.
April 28, 2004 Received email from Superior? Who said I had changed the Source code again and didn't qualify for refund.
May 3, 2004-- Was told by another person, That the source codes had been changed and I didn't qualify. Went in to change them again and promised no billing for 3-6 months and to get me on top 10, also reports. (not one yet) He also told me that because my website was built by a template that the Source Codes change automatically within the Template. They had to have known that when I signed up, he knew immediately when I said I had used a template for my website. They went in the template and set up the source codes because I didn't know what they were let alone how to set them up. 
June 9, 2004-contacted Consumer Protection Agency
June 25, 2004-- sent letter to CEO of Internet Advancement to try to get my refund. No response.
August 25-26- received email from I. A that my credit card was denied for services. I emailed them that they were ripping poor people off.
August 30-2004 Received another email that I would be billed for outstanding charges and the Source Code had been changed. Um--- they are the only ones who have changed anything. I don't know how and still don't know what it is.  I emailed them today and told them I would be submitting a letter to the Better Business Bureau and found this site.
I have records of every single conversation, every email, every name, every single correspondence to and from this company. They only have a contract to protect them. They do not live up to their part of the contract and won't give me a refund. They knew when I signed on that it was a template. They were in the template 3 or 4 times. They should have told me then...
I want my money back-- in full!!!

										OK. So after finding on internet, i signed up with Blogsvertise on Apr 11. But once logged in, i was skeptical about quality of service so didn't order anything and logged out..Few days later a person from sales with name ""Jean"" contacted me as below.Hi,
I was checking in on your account with
 and wanted to see how things are going. I noticed that you have not 
made any purchases with us yet.So i asked her about quality of blogs since i was very concerned about this. With salse pitch, she convinced me that she can provide me super quality package (Hand picked blogs according to them) if i sign up with rate of $360/10 blog posts. My requirements were as below.Jean,I 
want to try. But can you ensure me several things. Blogs are real, not 
spammy made for selling links/posts blogs?Without dup content.With
 real domains not purchased PR and converted domains.With 
atleast some pagerankWith dofollow backlinks?Not auto blogHosted by 
different class C IPs?Here was reply from Jean, (April 24, 2010)I can confidently insure all of those things to be true.Would you like me to send you the link to your discount package?How many would you like to start out with? I went ahead and signed up a package with a link provided by Jean. I read notification that i have to wait one month to finish order. I didn't have any problem. I waited for more than one month but no single response found from them so i had to contact Jean again. Two days passed and no response.So i sent another email and she got back to me with report. (June 10, 2010) I checked it and i noticed that every single post was very poor quality. Most of blogs from where my site linked was fully spammy with lots of casino/gambling/penis links too.Obviously, I was disappointed to i asked her why this happened. She wasn't able to reply promptly now. So i warned her that i can file a RipOff Report or something like that against company. She was behaving like a kid now. Here was her reply.Feel free to express yourself on the internet in any way that you wish. Personally I think your time would be better spent writing about something you enjoy. I asked her to refund me AND remove links from those spammy blogs. I understand it can cost company since they already paid to bloggers but what about promise they made. Atleast they were not able to provide good customer support.Till date, neither i received any refund or confirmation if my links were removed. I wasn't really behind refund. I was looking for good quality service and i had many orders to send them but they didn't respect my business. All they're doing is take advertiser's money and run away.If you're looking to buy blog reviews, NEVER buy from this company. There are many other reputable companies out there. If you read good reviews about they, mostly they are from bloggers. Not advertisers. Atleast i had no good experience with them.I usually don't file Report like this.

Santa Monica, CaliforniaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										On 7-1-09 I ordered their Make Money with Google Online program and they billed me via my bank debit card in the amount of $69.90. They were suppose to send me a download link to download the product. Somehow there was a problem with their website and I never received and still haven't received what I paid for. I was not sure if they were going to mail me a CD or what. By the time I called them they told me the 7 or 8 day free trial period had expired. They offered to refund half the fee in the amount of $34.90 and said it would be in my bank account in 3 business days. That never happened and it has been over a week since I called. There instructions were not clear especially about thje short free trial period. 
 I want this company to refund the full amount of my purchase of $69.90. By Federal law all purchases through the mail or online have to give the purchaser 60 days to request a full refund of anything purchased thru the mail or by online means. In addition, I think this company should be fined and reprimanded or forced to cease and desist any further deceptive business practices. I can be contacted at the address, phone and email address shown below if more info is required. Thank you for your consideration.

										On 8/7/07 I submitted a rebate request to ONREBATE.COM.  After several months had passed, I realized that I had not heard from ONREBATE.  After doing some searching I found my paperwork that had my tracking number on it.  I proceeded to the ONREBATE.COM website and entered my tracking number only to find that my claim had been denied.  Reading the document it said that my claim was denied because I had not put the UPC bar in the package and it also stated that an email had been sent to me noting such.  
Well, first thing I did not receive an email, for if I had it would not have taken so long to approach ONREBATE.  I proceed to call ONREBATE and talked to someone there that was pretty firm about me not getting my rebate - they also noted that an email was sent to me of which I had 30 days to resubmit.   However since my 30 days were long past, it was now to late to get my rebate.  I told the person that I did not receive any emails from ONREBATE. Again I was told I would not be able to get my rebate.  
I asked to talk to the supervisor, after much going back and forwarded I provided them with my work number looking forwarded to a return call.  However I never heard from anyone.  After further review of the documents that I sent, I will admit that I sent something else that I thought was the code and not the UPC.  Oops my bad!  However, if I had been sent an email as they had said I would have at least had the opportunity to resubmit my documents!

When I checked on the status the rebate center said I had sent in the wrong UPC for the rebate. 
That's strange because the when scanned at the store the register printed up a rebate form. They said I can resubmit the correct UPC. I have a copy they have the original. I tried emailing the Rebate Center which promises 24 hour reponse. Nothing in over a week. I emailed the company customer service and they said call the rebate center but it is impossible to talk to a human.

After being on the phone for approximately three hours I agreed to subscribe to Web Marketing Source for help getting my website optimized and keywords done that would enhace my chances of being seen by Google, Yahoo, etc. quicker. I was already doing a pay per click advertising campaign. I gave them my debit card # for $1649.99 and then 90 days later I was to be charged monthly $79.99. 
On February 3, 2007 I emailed and ask to please cancel. I got no reply from Mary in the billing office, and no reply from RickTapia whom I signed up with.
I called and left numerous messages with no reply. I was finally contacted by phone, (so there was nothing in writing), in March and told that I could not get any of my money refunded and I would have to pay the $239.00 for the three months that was to begin in May.  The person I spoke with was rude, degrading, mean and threatening.  
In August, they started deducting from my account not the $79.99 that it was suppose to be, but $239.97.  I did nothing the first time assuming that it was the full amount that he told me I would be charged.  Then the next three months I had the same charge.  I called my bank and filled out a complaint from and request for reimbursement.  Because it was a debit card they could not stop the payments from being withdrawn.  I emailed Captures of course and requested a refund and a stop of the withdrawls.  I got neither. I finally had to close my account and re-open it to stop them.

										On February 2008 I received a phone call from ""Freedom Advertising"" a lucrative offer to make money via the internet thru a personal web page to sell presciption meds and pet meds to the public at a greatly reduced price. In return I would earn 25% of the sale. The market would be world wide and they would do the advertising for me. I would be mailed a monthly check.
I told them I was retired and on a fixed income and could not afford to invest any cash ""up front"". Then they asked if I had available credit from a credit card. I said I did not know how much I had. They requested my number. I gave them the Discover Card #. They accessed it and called me back and told me I could use that. By using $10,000 of my credit line I could purchase one of their best advertising packages. Discover would only be charging me about $300 the first month and then every month after that I would have a sizeable monthly income and would soon have it paid off. 
Also, I could make provisions in my will to pass the business on. It would be a nice inheritance. They were unrelenting in their persuasion.
They faxed me papers to sign. I did not sign them right away. I signed tham after repeated calls from them. I did not fully understand what I was signing but trusted.
To date, I have not received any income. I have called ""Jennifer"" #602-454-9606.(a direct line to her desk). My last call was 4/30/08 @3:45pm EST relating my concern. She said she would set me up with a different pharmacy she liked better ""Better Life Pharmacy"". So far I have not been able to access it. Still no income. I have checked the internet.
Because my monthly interest charge from Discover was excessive, I transferred my balance to a home equity loan account which I continue to make monthly payments and am forced to do per diem nursing at an advancing age(69 yrs).  
Dave Johnson was relentless in persuading me into the program. I was assigned to ""Ivan"" as an advertising coach but have not heard from him.
The ""President"" has a MySpace page...not too smart for him to admit he owns Freedom Advertising...maybe we can find out who this guy really is under another name: 
http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=23273274
I have filed this report with Discover Card Services, the Attorneys Generals of Arizona and Maine as well as the Federal Trade Commission.  Don't be taken in by this deception.  
As a final note, wonder why the amount is $9,880.00?  Its a bank transaction under $10,000.00 and doesn't have to be reported to the Federal Reserve.  Tricky, tricky people.

										On Febuaryl 2007 I had saw on the television show of this company from Don Lupree about selling vitamins and getting independent advertisers like me. I was so sure this business was going to work my hopes was so high and so convinced. I was so wrong.
Well the total I had put into this company was about 4,000 worth. 
We had other companies that give us a call asking for more money. Like for example we had THE TAX CLUB and ADVANTAGE CORPARATION. 
 I have been trying to get my refund back since March from Greatest Vitamins and I would always talk to a gentlemen name ROBERT PINEA. He said he would work with me he dropped my monthly charge of $9.95 which he did. He said that we have no other charges. We wont be charged anything else. Which is true. Robert had set us up with our own personal coach. Which he did and the coach was not any help because I was telling her what to do. What is wrong with that? So again my hopes was high again. 
In June 2007 I had emailed Robert Pinea in regards to a refund of my money because since there was nothing being done I have not made one dime since we talked. He called me back saying that the adjustments made to your account, $1000 Media voucher approved, you are now a SIA Member with $1000 media voucher and I went ahead and added 15 people placement (independent advertisers) to your account. You can call coaching for any assistance as well as get to ahold of the media division in regards to runnin some shows. Well guys guess what this Media division had not returned my phone calls to set up any shows on the Television. He said that I was supposed to have 15 more independent advertisers and all I got was 5 for the pass month. 
I have been trying to get in touch with them through email ending of june for a refund again. I got a phone call from THE GREATEST VITAMINS a gentleman name Gordan. 
That is what I had gone through with this company and I really hope this touches more people before they make the wrong choices like I did.
Thanks....

										On January 07, 2004 I purchased a laptop model # 1300 D wireless Notebook priced @ $746.00. The company selling it at the time was BuiltsmartUSA.
I was told by a sales person named Michael that it would be shipped in 3 to 5 days. They charged my account for the amount of the computer.
Five days passed and I had not received the laptop, I called and asked to speak to a manager or some one higher, I spoke to a guy by the name of Damon Jordan supposably he was the company's president.
When I spoke to him he said that they were back ordered due to the numerous sales and to give them another five to seven days.
Again seven days passed and no laptop, so again I called Damon Jordan he apologized and told me that I was next for delivery, I told Damon Jordan that I wanted my money back, he said that it would take 7-14 days to get my money back, but that I would have it posted to my account within that time.
I have attempted to talk to Damon Jordan but have not been able, I have faxed, E-mailed, left voice messages, and to this day nothing. There is a guy named James that answered a couple of E-mails and told me that he would attempt to help me.
To this very same day I have not received my money. I have gone to my bank and attempted to get my money back, but they told me that it has been too long and that they are not able to help me.
I have E-mailed the Attorney General in California to see if they can help me, I have not received any response from them.
I have contacted the media to see if they can help me, they have not been able to help also.
I have attempted to present copies of the reports from other victims to the FBI to see if they could help out in any way, they have not been able to help. 
I have checked under the BBB to see how they rate them and they too show that they have complaints against them, I was going to file a report with BBB but from past experience the BBB doesn't do anything about any of the complaints.
I am in the process to start filing through the small claims court to see if they can help in any way.
If any one knows how to get in hold of these people or where they are please let me know, and if there is anything that we could do to get our money back.

I began speaking with a gentleman name Justin.  We talked quite extensively and he found out alot of personal information about me which he said was necessary to see if i qualified for a ""higher tier"" or ""success coach"" that the program offered.  I was told to write down some goals etc and the next day i would speak to a director who would interview me to see if i was a candidate.  I began feeling uncomfortable because Justin started asking me how much money i was willing to invest into the program to be successful.  He also started asking me information about my bank accounts and where the money was at that would be accessible to invest the money.  Immediate red flag to me. I have not even heard any details about what i would be doing to make money and there he is asking me to give him MORE money.  I want this reported and i want my 99.00 fee back from the company. 									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										On June 16th, 2007 I was contacted by representitives from Ultimate Business Solutions and promised large returns from being set up with Amazon, Target, Toys R Us and other well known brands. Ultimately my VISA card was charged for $10,000 and I was told to only make the minimum payment for the first month after which I would be recieving large receipts  to pay off the balance. Shortly I had misgivings and called VISA to cancel the charge. At first they said there was no problem in reversing the charge but later said they couldn't do that. Upon getting my VISA statement I saw where UBS had split the $10,000 charge into three separate transactions of $4900, $4900 and $200 presumably to avoid having to report the full charge to the government. Some time later I was told that since I was over 80 years old at the time that amounted to 'elder abuse' and VISA should have reversed the charge. Any time I ever called the company  a different person would answer and when I asked to speak with a person that I had previously spoken to I would be told, either that they were in another building, they had gone home for the day or they were on another line. So I had spoken with Richard Romesburg, Shiela, Cindy, Heather, Barry, Brad, Jessica, Jennifer and Denice to name a few of those I got the runaround from.									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										On june 4, 2009 Ben Delanoy dropped his dog off for boarding at our facility and never returned. He made several lame attempts over a month to explain his actions. Our favorite was actually telling us he had been in jail due to a domestic dispute. He went so far as to have another individual call us and pose as his father who would be over to clear up his bill and pick up his dog. during the time frame of his supposed incarceration he was twittering about his workouts and his visit to the coffee shop.What a great jail we must have. Lots of things in this world can be misunderstandings and business as usual, but you cannot explain such a heartless and cowardice act as abandoning your pet. All it would have taken was honesty to work with us but this is beyond the capacity of this man. When i let him know via voice mail, as this type of person never answers a phone call in person, we knew what his deal was that was the last time we ever heard from him. Naturally the dog had severe infection and poor health when it came to us. I am sure he will come up with ridiculous responses but if you read this it is the clearest picture of the character of the individual in question. If in the future he attempts his usual court battle it is clear confirmation of the story as he does not have a dog now and would have no other way to know who we are if we did not have the dog.

										On May 23/ 2008 , I purchased a web site called ""www.Ottawa Skilled Trades.com, from Matt Lapierre of Ridgegold Marketing Inc. in Ottawa .
The agreed upon selling price was $3500 plus $450 for 3 months web hosting for a total of $3950cdn. I must have been thinking about some thing else because I inadvertantly wrote $4950 0n the cheque which Matt Lapierre ( Executive Director ) of Ridgegold Marketing cashed .
I noticed a discrepencie on my account, and the cancelled cheque proved that I had overpayed $ 1000. I informed Matt Lapierre of the mistake ,and he said he would send me out the $1000 refund in a couple of days .
Days turned into weeks and he said he would pay the interest ,since it was money that I borrowed on my line of credit .
After a month, I got fed up with him Lying to me that the cheques in the mail ,so I told him I wanted all the money back($4950)He said he couldn't give me the money back ,but he could re sell the web site for $7500.
I said ok to re sell it.  A week or 2 later he said he had a buyer and it should only take a couple of days to draw up the new contract and obtain the funds .After days turned into weeks , he kept inventing new excuses as to why the deal is still not done.
He then stopped answering my repeated phone calls and emails , and the office and toll free numbers were a useless front because there was never
any body there to answer the phones !
It is now 3 months down the road,and still no action or communication !I have decided to sell the web site on my own and sue him in small claims court, and make his life as miserable as he has made mine.( Through any and all forms of media and goverment bodies )

										On Oct. 5, 2005, this company came of Las Vegas to show the general public proven systems in generating hugh profits selling their products online.  The cost of $3,000 included the set up a U.S. Merchant Account, software, and reading materials. The cost of attendance was $49 and the option of bringin a guest with you free of charge. They indicated that were now considered Executives due to the amount that we paid to get into the program.  No education was needed, just devotion and dedication. I questioned to them was ""Where are the products that we will be selling"", they answer was their on a CD.  No physical product was produced at the seminar.
Their were problems in getting our promised website set up and no merchant account was set up as of yet,causing delays for us to get started selling online. Later, we were called by their marketing department. They wanted to know if we were serious about getting involved and how could we like to know the secrets of success in making hugh profits monthly in the amount of $10,000 or greater.  They stressed that in order to be successful we would have to pay an additional $10,000 - $11,000 for them to work with us. We refused and demanded our money back from the company. The company in turn stated that their not in the wrong.
The contract read that you have 3 days to withdraw from the contract. This is not realistic only because their was no shown activities on their part to begin the process of getting us on broad to determine if we wanted to pursue this venture. 
I searched the website for the Better Business Bureau in Utah and I discovered that this company has a history of violating BBB name and logo policy: and has falsely stated BBB membership or referenced the BBB name in an unauthorized manner. Which they stated that they were a member of. In furthering my search with the BBB website, I discovered that on April 21, 2005 this company's membership in the BBB was revoked by the BBB's Board of Directors due to repeated and unauthorzed use of the BBB name and/or logo. Prior to being listed as Tradeworks Marketing, they were known as EnPower, but apparently changed their company name to hide their unfair practices.
 My home business was to be a partnership between myself and my friend. 
 Like the old saying goes "" You can run, but you can't hide"" someone will find you... Need your help in this matter.

										On October 13, 2006 I received a solicitation phone call from a Matthew, an employee of the Ebay Auction Express team (Not affiliated with Ebay at all) or the Auction Succes Team. Both companies are the progeny of a list of internet scam companies run in Utah-all of which appear in negative fashion on the Better Business Bureau site. 
My ""encounter"" with Matthew was troubling. He had called earlier in the day while I was studying at law school and left a message with my wife. 
Later that same evening he reached me at 5:24pm. I asked him nicely to take me off the call list-he proceeded to talk. I said ""stop talking and take me off your list."" I hung up. Not 30 seconds later, Matthew called back and from what sounded like clenched teeth said, ""Who the f*#@ are you and do you know who I am. What the f*#@ are you doing talking to people like that..."" The explicatives were numerous and waxed threatening as I tried to ascertain where Matthew was calling from. If anyone knows where the 866-547-3229 number originates from I would like to know. 
I'm going to visit the police station on Monday to find out because I'm certain I am not the first to be treated this way. I left a message at the number asking for a written apology and for Matthew to be fired-we'll see what happens. This is disturbing because the calls come from Utah, and I live in Utah with my little family. This guy sounded crazy, but he doesn't know that he is dealing with a U.S. Marine attending law school. 
I want this guy taken care of. Meaning of course fired and sent packing-he's a lunatic and seems to rely on threats and foul language to coax his insecurities. Please, if you have had a similiar experience respond to this posting. For Matthew's employer, this would be an appropriate forum to apologize and tell of the job demise of Matthew at ext.3506.

										On October 20 I placed an order with Trade electronics CO. also paying them an additional $87 to 2 day airship 10% of my order so I could have it by Sat. Oct. 22 for my flea market business.
The order consisted of the following :
50 X-box console game systems $78.39 per Total $3919.50
50 PS2 console game systems $104.46 per Total $5185.00
20 PS1/2 & X-box light gun $16.20 per Total $324.00

80 PS2 vertical stand $1.60 Total 128.00
Air shipping 10% of order $87.77
DHL ground remaining 90% $177.43
Then on Oct. 21st the salesperson Karina R. called me to tell me that at 4:30 pm on friday she was calling the shipping dept. to ask if they had time before they went home for the weekend.  I had sent the payment of $10,626.10 on thursday morning so that the shipment could get here in time for saturday at the flea market.  I heard nothing from them for over a week because monday Oct. 24 hurricane wilma hit Florida.
It was almost a week before I heard anything from them again. I sent them an email on wensday the 26 then of friday Karina called me and said there was no power at the office or at the warehouse sorry they were looking into getting generators to power it so they could do some shipping.  
I heard nothing at all the next monday and tuesday then wensday she called and said she had a family emergency and was not availble the last 2 days. I asked if she was the only one in the office who could address my issues?  She laughed and did not say anything, This struck me as kinda odd.  On the next week begining on Monday Nov. 7th I played phone tag with her up until thursday and she was excited saying that tomorrow the 11th I should get part of my order shipped.  
I called late again on friday the 11th afternoon and she had great news half a type of light guns and some steering wheels were able to be shipped.  Now mind you not the ones I had ordered but different ones of course more expensive.  If I would just authorize the purchase of the more expensive ones the she would try to get them shipped as soon as she could.  Now mind you she did not give me a date for shipment of these.  I was not real happy about this and told her that the accessories would not do me much good without the systems to sell the accessories with.  For over an hour she insisted that I get these accessories they were exactly what I needed to sell and they would sell great.
I informed her that I had both wheels and guns in my booth from another source along with a few game system bundles I thought she was going to rupture something. I told her I was not interested in part of the shipment until she could ship all of it.  This did not set very well with her.  I told her very nicely that if she did not have the products in stock then that was ok she could just refund my money I would order from another company and the when she got some stock in just give me a call and I would order some then.  This is where the business relationship broke down completely.
Her excuse this whole time had been that there was no power to her warehouse that was the reason she could not ship anything.  I also asked her again while she was flushered whether the game systems were new or reconditioned?  She had stated before I placed my order that they were all new systems and accessories they dealt in nothing refirbushed.  Now she stated that it did not matter whether they were new or not.  I stated that I did not want preowned systems in any form.  She then proceded to ask me whether I wanted the older larger version of the PS2 or the new slimline, I asked her if the older version was new systems she stated I would get what they had in stock.  
She then proceded to tell me she was going to send me an email about the New X-BOX 360 and was going to call her warehouse in michigan,  WHAT!!!! ,  Warehouse where??? in MICHIGAN ????? This whole 3 weeks they have been sitting on my money because the hurricane shut down their power and they could not ship.  Now they tell me they have a warehouse in Michigan?  Can you believe that one?  I about fell out of my chair. All the excuses and been nothing but lies.  
To top it all off one of the attachments she sent me was for accessories for the Play station Portable a system I had chosen not to carry at this time due to insuficiant funds to stock them.  She wasted almost 2 hours of my time trying to sell me on buying more products for the PSP from her.  She was really insistant that I not only buy them but send her even more money to do so.  I know this is hard to believe but I swear every word is 100% true.  At this point it was almost 9pm on friday night and I had to go to the flea market the next morning and I am after all 74 years old.   
So I waited until monday and discussed with my son what he thought I should do about this.  He thought even though their prices are extremely good that I should ask for a complete refund due to 2 factors.  One the lies about shipping not shipping the 2 day priority package on the 20th of oct. like I paid for with a wire transfer, and them lying for almost 3 weeks about not being able to ship because of a hurricane when they had another warehouse out of state.  And second the facts of her lying about whether they were new systems or not and her insisting I buy more products when I had not recieved over 10k of products I already ordered.
So called monday morning and left her a voice mail message and I sent her an email in both I explained these reasons and one other; that if I was placing an order now 3 weeks later I would not place the same order due to the release in one week from today of the X-BOX 360.  The older ones will lose some value and will go down in price.  Perfectly legiment reason to politely ask for a refund.  
Now for the best part about 1pm on Monday Nov.14 she called me and I pretty much quote "" you will not get a refund it did not matter how long it took for her to ship the products she did not allow refund on her sales.  I was also told that I would accept the products and do nothing else in regards to uptaining a refund.  The shipment would come when it was convient for them and I would accept that period.  And last but not least I would not waste any more of her time and then I was hung up on.
Now I turn to the better business bureau and websites like this one for help.  I have also recieved a couple of rude emails but I will not waste any more of your space here I believe I have gotten my point of the way I am being treated across.  I think they believe they can bully a senior citizen.  Well this senior might have false teeth but they still can bite back.

										On the 4th  November 2011 while using the internet I received a pop up advert requesting that I call a number on the screen to receive some kind of travel/holiday benefit from Preferred Guest Resorts (PGR).  I made the call and spoke to a man called Caesar initially who assured me this was a legitimate offer and that if at any time I wanted to cancel the transaction that would be OK.  And so on the basis of that sales pitch and without any hard terms and conditions I was sold a package that I reluctantly transacted on my AMEX card.  I say reluctantly transacted because at one
stage when the sales lady took over the call from Caesar the lady asked me for
mysecurity code number for the Amex card and I wasnt sure if this was appropriate to pass over the phone and wanted to hang up or be sent the package in writing.  However I was coerced by the saleswoman and feeling uneasy about the purchase at this stage I gave in and gave the security number to them, and I thought that if I gave the number and ended the call I could call back and cancel as Caesar had said.  I was also not sure of the authenticity of the transaction as I felt the lady at PGR was very insistent about

getting those numbers to complete the transaction, which made me wary to say the least.After completing the transaction and being reassured by them that I was receiving a wonderful package my son-in-law (a policeman) inquired about what I had purchased as he had overheard me talking on the phone and was concerned for me as a recent widow where my husband was responsible for the family finances.  With an explanation and a company name my son-in-law web searched the company and found multiple entries on Google for fraudulent claims by people against this company called Preferred Guest Resorts.  Based on this information he advised me to cancel the purchase, and the first attempt to do this was within 10 minutes of the transaction.  However, I was not able to get through to the number given for PGR by Caesar, and this convinced me that I had in fact been scammed.  Since this time I have received the confirmation letter from PGR and in the Terms and Conditions I am not able to receive the discounted travel (I have paid for $498 US Dollars)  because I am disqualified on 3 accounts in condition 7 of the T's & C's at the time of sale, which were not asked by the sales rep for PGR.  These conditions are: I am not a couple (recently widowed), my income is not over $40,000 US; and I am not in full time employment, I am semi retired at 65 years of age.
This company should be investigated for their coersion of getting credit card details from people.  All this type of activity is doing is turning the western world countires against the USA as a nation and as a country with people of integrity.  They appear to be desperate, greedy, money hungry people, and other countries like Nigeria are doing the same, so do the USA and Nigeria sit at the same Character table? And AMEX has supported this PGR company and defended it's method of obtaining fraudulent funds in my situation, as I have been unsuccessful in reversing this charge on my AMEX account thus far.  But I am still fighting the principle of it as their combined actions are shameful, shameful, SHAMEFUL!!!!",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										ontheweb-offer.com offerred a so-called 'free gift' in return for a survey.  It was made clear from the start that unless the survey was completed, the 'gift' would not be recieved.  
Personal info was requested on the first page, including address under the guise of 'shipping info' regarding the free gift.  I had no cause for concern at this point.  The survey seemed legit at first.  A lot of offers, all able to be rejected.  Several 'submit's later I was informed that I would have to buy a service from not one but three third party corporations in order to recieve anything in return for giving them my personal contact information.  By the time I figured out what they were really up to, they had already recieved my address and phone information with no going back.
I decided to continue past that point in the survey, just to see where it would lead to.  Eventually I came to a window with one box only.  To move on, I had to check it.  To check the box was agreeing that I was a smoker.  There were no other choices other than closing the browser window, ending the survey.  I don't smoke, but since I was curious, I went ahead and checked it.  Immediately I was routed to a survey page asking for my personal smoking stats.  The only way to move on was to check a box agreeing to recieve cigerette ads and listing what cigerettes I buy.  No where was there a choice ""I don't smoke"".  I wanted to move on to see what came next, so I filled in bogus smoking information, allowing them to force words into my mouth.  After that came a mandatory credit card signup form requesting a Social Security Number.  There I stopped.
I will never recieve the so-called 'gift'.  I'm not a smoker and refuse to lie and say I am.  I'm not giving my SSN out to some unknown recipient.  I'm not buying products when I was told I wouldn't have to.  However, now they have my address, my phone number and my name.  That's all they wanted in the first place.  Be warned.

Shawn Graham contacted our business outside the requested requirements,  requesting to do work for our Military Veterans. He came across professional at first. Shawn Graham went on to state that we do not need agreement or contract, and a Verbal Agreement is OK, which we felt uncomfortable with, considering this was a $20,000 contract. We never gave out our banking details, which we are very lucky. 
After are business conducted a business check on Falloutdesign, as we do on all companies. We would like to inform all business, companies and people, that this firm Falloutdesign and Shawn Graham is not registered in any State in the USA or with the BBB, we feel Shawn Graham was planning to rip us off directly and take advantage of our Military Veterans.

										Our company was solicited by CityGrid Media for their directory service.  They claimed that they would get us additonal listings on many of the popular search engines out there as many of them pull from the CityGrid database.  Once we agreed to a directory listing fee, we were then automatically put into a monthly click scheme.  We immediately canceled this service, but the company representative TJ Broadnax would not accept or complete the cancelation.  After repeated attempts to cancel, we had to dispute each of their almost $500 / month charges with American Express.  Thank goodness for credit card charge protection!  The charges were immediately reversed because CityGrid Media had no contract or signature from our company.  A collection representative from CityGrid then made repeated attempts to collect from us via e-mail.  Once we asked for a copy of our contract, he stopped replying to us.  CityGrid then sent ""our account"" to collection with A.R.M.

										Our Friend here Randy Wilbers, an insurance agent in Jefferson City Missouri, recently joined my lead generating service.  Upon joining Randy invested $2000.00 dollars via-credit card, and also received a 10% incentive in free leads ($12.50 per auto, $17.50 per home).  This being said Randy was then sent a contract, stating that his money will be refunded for the amount LEFT in your account that HAS NOT been used towards leads.

                 ""
                   Anonymous,
I am getting concerned with your leads, when we did this origionally it was for the exclusive home leads and I let you include the auto's to help generate volume, to date we have not received a single home lead only auto's.  I am really hoping we don't have to utilize the gurantee of satisfaction for the complete refund of the $2000 Let me know what's up.""
That being sent to I, as Randy's account manager, what would any account manager do? Send more leads, and try to develop more home leads in his area (you can't make leads, you have to generate them).  After time, Randy decided to leave our service, which my company and I had no problem doing, for the amount left in his account.  Randy decided to charge back through the credit card company, making false accusations to receive ALL his money back, not the amount left in his account.  I send this RIPOFF Report out to notify all people dealing with Randy on a business basis.  Randy Signed an agreement stating he accepts these guidelines, but as time told, Randy was an illegitimate agent to do business with, cannot follow his own agreements that he signed to.

										OutRank is a scam company. It is a SEO company. (Search Engine Optimazation) company. If you are a small business owner or just have a website, you could be a target of this company. There are a lot of bad SEO's out there and this is one of them. You have a website and want to be visible on Google (The largest search engine.) You want to be on the front page og Google when someone does a Keyword search for your company. OutRank.COM promises that you will be on the fron page in sixty days. Then when you find out that you are not on the front page and you call the company to cancel your agreement you get transfered around and end up with no one helping you. OutRank.Com hard sells you into paying two months up front (for the 60 days) to get your website on page one of Google. They have a sweat shop set up in Austin, Texas (it has moved a couple of times) with a lot of telemarketers. OutRank.COm was owned by ProfitFuel, Inc.

By looking at the complaints I found on the internet and the Better Business Bureau, I would say that these are bad guys. To stay one step ahead of us and the law David Rubin filed a merger request with the Secretary of State for the State of Texas.

										Pantheon is the mother of all rip-off artist companies.  I purchased six internet kiosks in August, 2004.  None of them have been delivered and none of the services sold by Pantheon have been delivered.  That includes (1) Locating services; they promised to find suitable locations for the machines, but only provided places where you would not want to look at, let alone shop at!  (2) Sign up advertisers; never signed up an advertiser at all, even after I had obtained my own locations.
Furthermore, various employees of Pantheon steered me into expensive DSL contracts with providers that are still ripping me off.
Furthermore, within three weeks after making the purchase contract, and after it had been broken by Pantheon, I wrote them a letter asking for my money back.  I am entitled to do that according to the agreement signed by Pantheon, section 12.  It states I am entitled to my money back in the event of there being any untrue or misleading statments to sell the kiosks.  Not only were there misleading statements, the contract signed by Glaubman), clearly states that the machines were to be delivered by a certain date.  They were not and I asked for my money back.  I was refused.
I would like to see Mr. Alan Glaubman and others of his executive staff stripped of all their assets and thrown in jail.  That is what they deserve.

										Please see details below. I have to try and get a refund by any means now as Matt has ignored all my attempts to get a refund. It has been over a month since I first asked for my money back, and he is showing no signs to do so. 
I hope that you can help to alert others who are trying to get into a business for themselves (especially during these uncertain times) to stay well clear of Matt Lapierre and Ridgegold Marking.
SIGNS OF SCAM: Money given more than 4 months ago for a product that was never delivered, constant lies and missed time lines. He repeatedly used the cheques in the mail type line for sending supporting documents to the sale (which of course never arrived). Not refunding the money paid, and constantly ignoring all attempts to get the money back.
Complaint Description
PURCHASED ONE OF THEIR WEBSITES-PURCHASE DATE: 24OCT08 
PURCHASE PRICE: $4509.75 inc GST 
PAYMENT METHOD: CHEQUE 
REFUND REQUEST: 13JAN09 
Mr. Matt Lapierre failed to provide the following within 11 weeks of the signing date (24OCT08) of the contract: 
(1) A completed working website. 
(2) Any records of the website generating revenue (Even though he stated that he had sent me contracts of the agents already registered on the website, which were not received). 
(3) Failed to meet any set time lines or completion dates/times. 
Over this time, Mr. Matt Lapierre also ignored several of my questions and requests for information. I had to ask numerous times, for various things, and he still failed to reply accordingly. By 13JAN09, having not received either a new website and/or proof of any revenue being generated on this site, I had lost all confidence (and therefore decided this was not the right fit for me) in Mr. Matt Lapierre and Ridgegold Marketing Inc and requested a refund of my purchase price including GST. This refund was requested to be paid by no later than 27JAN09...another time line that was not met! Correspondence was predominantly via email. 
REFUND REQUEST: 13JAN09 but have not received a cent. Mr. Lapierre is also ignoring all communication when I follow up on the delay.
Does SCAM = Taking $$$ and never providing a product, no follow up, no answers to ANY questions,  missing EVERY time line, ignoring emails, ignoring phone calls, not refunding $$$ even though this was written in the contract, and of course no integrity what-so-ever from the Executive Director Mr. Lapierre...I will let you decide!!

I use my own tracker which is totally correct, and I will let EVERYONE know what this company does.  I ordered the $49.00 package on 3/7/08.  This company lists an 888 # as a phone contact, but does not answer it - goes to voicemail.  So far, has not returned any calls.  I will report back any changes.  It appears (as has been reported previously by others) that Emailadcampaigns uses Statcounter to report all of its activity.  Don't be fooled.  Their tracking means nothing.  Use your own tracking.  I also believe that this company (or individual hiding behind a name) is likely posting rebuttals posing as ""other clients"".

										Purchased the ""Adesso Montreal Dark Walnut Oval Coffee Table"" from Cymax and, when it arrived, it was 'Dark Cherry'.   
Called them immediately and they agreed it said 'dark walnut,' and looked 'dark walnut' on their Internet Site.  They would check with manufacturer who made it and would we send pictures to confirm that it was Cherry.  Even though we had three days of dark cloudy skies, we got good enough pictues to show that it was not walnut but Dark Cherry and sent them to Cymax.   Cymax people agreed it was Dark Cherry and called the manufacturer they deal with.
The nice person I was talking to at Cymax figured, like we did, that they had sent the wrong color veneer table.  They talked to the manufacturer and were told that was the only color they had, and the only way they would take it back was for us to pay shipping cost, and a restocking fee.
We told Cymax that their ad listed it incorrectly and we felt they should stand behind that ad, as we would never have ordered it if the correct color of Dark Cherry had been in the description.  Not our fault that the manufacturer doesn't know Walnut from Cherry (made in China of course!), but when a customer complains over not getting what they are told in Cymax ad will be a dark walnut, then we feel they should pay for taking it back. 
We told Cymax that we would dispute our VISA charge, as our ordering was based on getting a Dark Walnut table and we had proven that what came was a Dark Cherry. 
So beware, as what you read and see may not be what you get.   From now on we are a 'hands on' person and will never order furniture on Internet again, and certainly not from Cymax!!!

										Received an e-mail for an oversized delivery of merchandise to be delivered to me. I followed all steps and found my delivery was a large and expensive giant screen tv and sound system. 
Next step was to fill in all information called for. I followed the instructions and was sent to an order page which seemed to be required. I ordered $19 worth of merchandise as instructed. Once the order was placed I had a chat with someone who thanked me for the order and as I had a power failure just at that time my computer went down. I thought nothing of it. 
My debit card was charged for the $19. Two days later I received another e-mail with a spacific number to make arrangements for my oversized delivery. So I played the game and again afer doing what was instructed, I found my self at another ordering page. I ordered again just to see what would happen this time. 
Well after order was completed I again was connected with a representative, When I started to ask questions about the oversized delivery she became nervous and promptly discontinued our conversation. Which leade me to think that this is a real big scam. I will seek to 
get my money refunded promptly

Chris
scottsdale, ArizonaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

My complaints were mainly:
A.  THE VOICE FILES WERE GARBLED.  NO ONE COULD UNDERSTAND THEM
B.  THE EMAILS WERE NEVER SENT.
THEY NEVER FIXED THESE PROBLEMS.  AFTER ONE WEEK, TONS OF LOST TIME AND MONEY ON MY PART, I ASKED TO BE CANCELLED OUT AND my MONEY RETURNED.
I WAS MET WITH HOSTILITY, more excuses AND FINALLY TOLD that they had a NO REFUND POLICY.

										Shortly after getting my website; I was contacted by an individual named David Ferra a representative from eCommerce Advisors stating that they could get me 25,000 visitors a month to my site. These were allegedly TARGETED shoppers already looking for products like those on my site. It sounded like A Gift From Heaven, so I paid $475.00 for a year. I was told that it would take approximately one month weeks for the campaign to be set-up and I would get a email with links, to monitor that campaign and chart it's progress. A month went by with no result and was told ""they would switch up the traffic stream"" another month went by without result and so the ""traffic stream"" was ""switched up"" again. There has never been any thing except for a link with a number tally rolling over on my ""management link"". Since then David Ferra ""has been busy"" and Amy who ""inherited my account"" allegedly went on maternity leave. There has been no answer to any of my phone calls and the voicemail was active until this month. I called multiple times per day for the months of May and June 2011 and have found out late July 2011 that they have nothing to do with the corporation of which I am a member.I am long term unemployed - this was to be my freedom from financial worries and disaster.

										Smc has changed so much over the last three years. I was a member three years ago. Not bad. Just recently got reinstated. I wish to God that I had went to the internet first. I only ordered $246 worth of merchandise. I ordered on May 12th, I just found out that my order will not be here until May 22. For $70 shipping I know it could of been here faster than that. I sent two boxes to Afghanistan, and it was half the cost for shipping plus it got there in 4 days. Please, what are they doing sending my order by pony express.?

The recording also tells you that you can contact them by e-mail by going to smcorp.com and clicking on ""contact us"" there is no such link to click on. This corp is so unorganized. If I were Tom Bosley I would be ashamed to be associated with smc. But then maybe that is where he is making all his money, by ripping us off.

										So my daughter 12 yrs old saves her money to buy a laptop $560 later and buys a Compaq which I tell her good choice because I recommend HP to everyone! 62 Days before the 1 year warranty is up she shows me the screen and it's filled with ink blotches and lines! 
I look it over no cracks no software issues and tell her it's something with the hardware and will send it back under warranty and get it all fixed up for her. 
She treated this laptop so careful and the minute she goes downstairs and the laptop is sitting on the coffee table she comes back upstairs and there is this damage! Never fell, wasn't closed nothing touched anything and the screen just changed to these images! 
However HP treated us like crap both reps one starting with an S and another with an R since I can't post there names would not do anything for us. In fact when asked the question well are you willing to explain to my daughter of 12 that she saved $560 to buy this laptop that she's out of luck they replied back with that's unprofessional and I refuse to talk to a 12 year old about it. Funny though you were more than willing to take her money in the first place and to boot your more than willing to take another $600+ from her to fix it!
She's the consumer she purchased it but you refuse to talk to her about the issue funny I don't remember signs saying you must be over 18 to purchase this product!
I've purchased 3 HP computers within the last 2 years over $2000 spent and not to mention all the hype I've given them to friends and associates, I told them I was willing to give them model numbers of each one so they could confirm that I was a good customer of theirs and there response well we appreciate that you are a good customer of our's were speaking about this one computer and your other's don't matter!!! 
Guess what I might have spent $2 K to get these computers but do you think I will ever buy another HP product again!!! All I have to say to them is thanks for saving me money in the long term! I'm only 33 years old figuring I buy a new computer every 5 years which is conservative and my daughter who is 12 same situation until the time were 70 at an average cost of $550 a computer you just lost over $10k in business over a cracked screen that wasn't the case when it left!!! 
Not to mention the old adage of 1 bad customer customer tells 10 potential customers not in this day and age! I'm going to approach every site every paper and by the time I'm through your at min. look at losing at least 100 customers conservatively which now brings you over almost a half a million dollars lost! Nice work considering you already are the worst in customer service according to Consumer Reports and companies are struggling to survive in the current economic enviroment! 
All you had to do was return her laptop back to the condition it was when it was  working! Which was under warranty! And she had no wrong doing! I always take of my customers maybe you should learn the same!

I said it sounded ok but when he told me the cost I told him I had to think about. He didn't want me to get off the phone and started pressuring me. I told him I was not desperate and that I would like to think about it further. I then told him again I don't have the money now, I am not interested right now and to have a good day. He told me that if I hung up on him I would go to hell. I asked him to repeat what he said, and he again said that if I hung up on him I would go to help because It was disrespectful. I asked him what did he want me to do If I didn't have to money or wasn't interested He started to tell me how I could use my credit card etc. I told him that I might be going to hell but he would be there before I would and then hung up on him. He called back but I did't answer my phone.

										Someone called saying that we had ordered toner for our copier and they had all the information about our copier model number and said they were calling to tell me that the toner we ordered was going through a price increase and they were letting me know we would get it at the previously reduced rate.  They mailed a broken toner to us with no original packaging and sent us an invoice for $487.29.  Toner $439.00 ship/handle $48.29.    The young man sounded as if he was calling me from his living room and then when I told them we were not going to pay the invoice and I had sent the toner back to them, they continued to call and harrass myself as the office manager and our accountant.  I finally told them that i had reported them to the BBB in California and the federal trade commission for fraud.  I told them not to send any more toner and if they did we would make not effort to return it and we would NOT be paying their fake invoice.

										Stacy Norman, about whom there is another complaint here, canceled my service provider account on Guru.com one fine day after a somewhat deranged former client decided that he wanted my services for free. 
On Guru.com, employers post freelance projects they want done, scour through the responses and bids for the best deal, typically, and often attempt to avoid paying transaction fees passed on from the pro by bypassing the system and contacting the pro directly, claiming that this is how they found them. They will also reject the idea of doing their project on Guru.com because they find that the system is too cumbersome, or they don't want to pay the fee, etc. So, even if the client admits they found the pro on the site, they may not be willing to do the project via the system set up on the site itself. After actually consulting these idiots at Guru.com on their usability, I can understand why. Regardless, I had just such a client who found me on Guru.com, but contacted me directly and never mentioned Guru.com explicitly, set up and paid for his project, and we were off. Promises regarding the payment arrangement were broken by the client, the project scope was reduced after payment of the initial sum, and the project became less than what it was intended to be originally. I fulfilled my end of the project, using my associate to help with aspects that were tacked on only after the paltry money down was paid. The client began calling frequently to change the project scope and details, until it became sheer chaos. By the time I began to realize the client had some psychological problems, it was a several weeks later. I tried to resolve it, but eventually, I had to wash my hands. I had actually LOST money on this client, by having spent a ridiculous amount of time and effort on a single project that paid no more than $500, as opposed to $2000/mo marketing deal this was supposed to represent.
Stacy Norman at Guru.com revoked my account, after 6 years of being a PAYING member, after the founder, Inderpal Gugliani actually went so far as to ask for my consulting advice on their own site several years into my membership, and after I had doubtless made them lots of money in transaction fees and member dues. Even though my use of the site was selective and somewhat sporadic, I had made them several thousand and had brought TO them many, many clients among those that used me on their site. That's right, I had brought THEM the clients in many cases, instead of them bringing ME the client. Why? Because I sought to help my clients to feel more secure when they expressed hesitation about starting their projects. I was the perfect, the ideal service provider for Guru.com, though I did not bring in 10K a year for them, I was bringing in 1-2K,m which is still pretty good for a member site.
When my account was ended (Norman said that I had threatened them by saying that I would take actions against them if they canceled my account), I reported them to the BBB and asked for my money back for my membership dues and transaction fees, since the online verification source I was paying for to build was now simply erased completely, nothing left, and basically, this was for something a client did to me, not something I did that would have violated the terms of my use of the site (I stated that I did not know the client had found me through Guru.com, and that was absolutely true, and yet I lost my investment of 5 years and thousands of dollars and all my hard consulting work down the drain) simply because of being the target of the wrath of Stacy Norman and her staff regarding a breach of site terms which was COMPLETELY ASSUMED, against all burden of proof, of which there was zero on the client's side, and many emails from the client on my own side to back up my story (I guess a phone call from an ""employer"" who used their site to find a pro and yet skirted their transaction fees intentionally was worth more than the word of a loyal, seasoned veteran member service provider with numerous (over 40), extremely high client reviews??...).
In sum...I would recommend that pros who get dropped by Guru.com for the egregious actions of their clients, and not for their own conduct, report Guru.com to the Better Business Bureau and everywhere else they can online. Guru.com is NOT a reputable or even sensible company, and they do NOT represent a good choice for the freelancer seeking to build his resume in his or her chosen career path.
Above all, do NOT trust Guru.com with your money or waste your time attempting to build up a reputation via their site. Guru.com has a habit of chewing up their pros and spitting them out with nothing to show for their time, effort and money paid down. What you will end up doing is kicking yourself for wasting so much effort and time on something that can and will be taken away at the drop of a hat, at the word of a lunatic client who could not be pleased, or who broke the rules and then blamed you.

										Started no March 26 04,Bought 5 machines.Assined by Pantheon to a locator known to me only as Ross. Ross was over joyed he had a ""distributer"" in N.J. ""How close are you to Newark Airport are you?"" ""why only 40 miles"" Ireplied. ""oh good,how many machines do you have?"" ""5"" I replied. ""Oh Gee I hope that's enough, Some of our locations require 7 or 8 and they don't like fooling with multipal distributers"" ""well let's see what you get. Then we'll wory about it"" Says I.            
Ross also told me how hard the machines were to get and how valuable they were. Mean while he did get me several locations. One was a 2spot deal. They were all hotels in the Parsippany area which is only 30min. from the house. Great! Thats when the trouble set in. Imidately I contacted the locations and made arangements for machine delivery and location of phone lines. I then called the Phone Co. and ordered phone jack instilation. 
Then I called for a DSL line. Boy was that a joke! Seems a DSL with static IP cant be had anywhare in this area. So I spent aproximately 45 days on the phone with every company in the phone book and every one I could find on the internet. Decision was T1 at $300. per month was the only thing available. The Pantheon papers said $75. for phone and internet. It was totally out of the question.                 
The only one even came close was a motel near the Tappenzee Bridge in N.Y. state. I kept putting in the lines and someone was having them disconected as fast as I could install them. Pantheon had doubled up on distributers. I still have a machine sitting in Madison N.J. It,s been there since July. The man has T1 and is willing to rent mea line. 
To date it has not been Installed and I disconected the phone line the end of Sept. I now have a missing machine that nobody knows where it is. It was in a sleezy bar ie Bayone and was suspose to be delivered to Roxbury. Never got there. nobody knows nothing.         
I have now paid over $4500 in phone bills and I do not have one terminal working. I have never turned down a location so nobody can say I got to picky. Now I am consentrateing on one machine just a few minutes from the house. It has had working phone and internet sinse the end of Nov. I installed the machine  myself and had a tech. at New Edge Tech get it on line, almost. That was around The15th of this month. However it willnot accept credit cards, The HOT SPOT dosent work and nobody seams to know how to put on advertiseing as I have a couple of interested parties.           
Getting back to Pantheon, two weeks after I purshased the origional 5 machines, This guy Sandy Gold[Ha HA] calls me and says he is looking at 5 machines right now. Not only that he is willing to give me a big break in the price. Now, we already know these things are valuable, Hell, Batman is on TV telling me its a turnkey operation,Ross is telling me we need more machines to get the top locations, so I make a deal for 2 more! Hey, I'm a TYCOON of the industry!            
About the end of July I was so desperate to get machines running that I offered Aeril at Pantheon $1000. to get my machines running. He declined but Jeff Cooper AKA Jeff Cuba  Told me that he personally would guarantee a machine up on line and running every 2 weeks and I was gona kiss him. Well, I ain't kissin no Floridia Scumbag. Any how he got me for another 2 machines and totally screwed up most of what I had gotten togeather.            
I've sent numerous letters to Pantheon all are unanswered. I've got half a file drawer on these people and I've filed arbertration in Floridia and I'm waiting. Does anyone know of anyone else in this process or does anyone care to go in on it and share costs? Are there any sucessful distributers out there? I'd sure like to hear from you and make you an offer.

										Starting in July 2005, The people at AWSM kept emailing me and finally I asked for more information. They said they had new technology that was going to make people money. They said buy a website and it would be worth a lot of money in 90 days. I bought one for $99.95. I should have stopped there.
Tennie Mosley kept calling me saying I was missing out on a good deal. That people were already making money with their websites. I should invest $10,000 to make the most money. I told Tennie I could get $4,000 out of my whole life insurance policy. She said great. I did and invested that. Then I kept getting calls from others to invest more in their company. Told them I already went to the max I could.
After 90 days I complained I was not getting any money. They kept putting me off and not answering emails or phone calls. After about six months they called me and said Google chaged their rules and that I should buy a microsite. I adamantly told them I did not have more money. Finally after complaining to the BBB, Randy Kline called me and said they would give me a microsite.
Then all of a sudden they were trying to get me to build the site and I know nothing about it. Even the tutorials were confusing. This was not part of the deal when I signed on. I still have the laminated sheet they sent me. Tim Ley agreed he would take care of it if I signed a paper authorizing him to do it. I was getting a lot of emails but no money from affliliates.
Now they are contacting me about setting up a blog and wanting $60 a month to host it. When will it end? Can someone help me? Has anyone gone to the State Attorney?

										Storesonline seems to be on the up and up and they present a professional looking seminar. They are very deceiving in leading you to believe you will make money right away and gain control of your time. They paint you a beautiful picture of the american dream. 
The real truth is they just want to get you alone with one of their counsolers so they can get you to sign on the dotted line. One counsoler in particular continued to harass my mom to go back and talk with him to the point where one of the other counsolers noticed it and came over to apologize and offer them to come back to the next seminar even though they had not bought the package. 
I was not so lucky I did sign on the dotted line. Don't make that mistake.

I ordered a computer from Computer Personalities on 3-2-01. I paid by check $2,095.00. I thought if I paid in full I would receive the computer faster. Boy was that a mistake. 
Everytime I called I was told everything was ok and I would receive my computer in a few weeks. Computer Personalities never sent my any papers. The only contact I had was when I called. By that time I knew something was not right so, I called to tell them the send me back my money. For the first week I could not get anyone by phone then a recording was on the phone tell me Computer Personalities has filled for bankruptcy.
I sent letters to Computer Personalities and The Bankruptcy Court.
I did not receive any reply from either place.
So at this point Computer Personalities have $2,095.00 of my money. That works out to be over (2) two months of take home pay.
If Computer Personalities start selling computers again don't buy unless you have the money to give away.

										TCA Fulfillment Services, Inc. (supposedly) provides rebate fulfillment for companies like Viking Interworks.  I mailed complete documentation (Original UPC, receipt, rebate form) and mailed it within 5 days.  The product (Viking CF256M) was purchased within the specified time frame.  The company made the following determination about my submission:
INVALID UPC LABEL-NOT FROM PRODUCT PACKAGE\SERIAL#
They are wrong, but they now have the original.  The rebate was only worth $15, but after they do this 100 or 1000 or 10,000 times, they can skim a healthy profit.
COMPANIES CONSIDERING REBATE FULFILLMENT PROVIDERS:  STAY CLEAR OF TCA FULFILLMENT SERVICES, INC.  It will tarnish your corporate brand image and consume your customer service resources when you are forced to deal with scam rebates.

										The Click Agency tell you that they are the best company to go with because they don't charge a service fee. They will tell you that they receive incentives from Google to run their campaigns. They will then ask for a budget upfront (which in my case was $1650 for one month).
   The next step is for them to avoid your phone calls for the next month while your budget is eaten up at $14.79 per click. The whole time you will have no access to any statistics whatsoever and no contact with The Click Agency and no proof that your ads are even being clicked or showing at all.
    At the end of the month you will receive a tax invoice for the exact amount of your budget. You will never receive any true statistics on your campaign. 
   What The Click Agency is doing (in my opinion) is probably paying around $5 per click and charging their clients $14.79. 
I have since been doing some research and finding that there are at least three other people they have burnt.
They will not return my calls, they refuse to refund my money.
They claim that I had 91 clicks. I did not receive ONE enquiry. My website is professional and more than capable of converting AT LEAST ONE click into an enquiry.

										The company BrightBuilders are obviously just in it for the money; they charge a lot of money, for a little service.  I have learned alot more about selling on the internet from other sources which are either free or with a much lower cost and I mean much lower cost.
They are trained professionals in knowing what to say and how to say it, in order to get you to join Brightbuilders and give them your money.  They are very good at figuring out how much money to put on which credit card.  They are very good at making claims of money you can make in three months.  They are very good at denying any claims they have made when a report is made to the BBB.  
I did wonder how I did not see the negative reports on the BBB when Brightbuilders directed me there, as I saw all the negative reports when I looked it up on my own after making a report with the BBB.  As the person said on this site, they direct you to another Brightbuilders company they have set up for this purpose, to make them look honest and good.
They keep you on the phone for over and hour, while pointing out that a business person needs to be able to make quick decisions.
I thought the BBB could do more to stop such dishonest companies, but I was wrong, as Brightbuilders just denied anything I said and made outrageous claims to protect themselves.
I followed their instructions and have put in the time they said 5-10 hours a week and have made in a year and a half exactly $2.29.  I have not made even close to the $5000 in three months that they claimed, a few times I could make.
I would like to help others stay away from this company, far away, as I am sure that many people have been screwed by this very dishonest, money grabbing company! CLICK here to see why Rip-off Report, as a matter of policy, deleted either a phone number, link or e-mail address from this Report.

										The number of scams and lawsuits filed against Cameron Sharpe, aka Barrett Stone aren't enough for him yet.  Below is a link to him pitching his latest scam.  
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBkm5iwgF48
A couple of key points after you watch this video.  
1) every company Cameron has run or been a principal in has filed bankruptcy after numerous charges of fraud were filed against them.  In all cases, the judge ruled on behalf of the plaintiff at which point Cameron filed bankruptcy to avoid paying the judgement awarded in the court.
2) Cameron has not been #1 in his life, as he attests.  He lives in a friends basement in Charlotte, owns no car, does not have a job, and certainly does not own the Maserati at the end of the video.  His ex-wives and girlfriends will give you a rating less than #1 - he was recently found guilty of not paying child support for one of his ex-wives in which he is the father of their children (he has four children from three or four separate women).
3) he indicates he pulled in executives from his former ventures and the best MLM attorneys.  These are two good reasons to avoid doing business with him.  Be sure to read section 6.1 of the iJango Terms of Service.  His attorneys have cleverly drafted this language to avoid any financial liability.  Also be sure to read up on one of his former business associates, Jason Breakey, from his dating service days.
For additional details on Cameron/Barrett's new scam, refer to the below links, which also provide contact information for Cameron.  BE SURE TO READ SECTION 6.1 OF THE iJANGO TERMS OF SERVICE.

Cameron is also posting across the country on Craigslist to try to gain interest in his latest scam iJango.  All instances found are being marked to be pulled from Craigslist.
If Cameron is in an alcohol and drug recovery program, his list of amends is already large and will get larger with his iJango scam.
Anyone that spends money on iJango will never recuperate their money and will only be funding the lifestyle of a con artist.  The best job Cameron can aspire to is to become the new Sham-Wow marketing guy on TV.

										The search engine submission company Blastengine.com uses a deceptive cancellation procedure to trick customers into keeping their service active.
I used this company's service for several months.  I followed the steps to cancel my service with them in July 2007.  Then in January of 2008 I realized that they were still charging my credit card $9.95 every month.  I thought that I must be crazy, because I was sure that I went and canceled the account months earlier.  I went through the whole cancellation process a second time.  
In February 2008, I changed banks.  I was keeping my other account open with a small amount of money in it, and I was planing to close it after I had all recurring charges canceled.  On February 23, I got a notice from my bank stating that a charge had again cleared to my account for $9.95 from Blastengine.com, and that I had $75 in overdraft charges and daily fees because of it.  I was infuriated, and I returned to Blastengine.com to find out what was going on. 
I went through the account cancellation procedure several more times, logging in and out each time, and noticed that my account was still reading active.  I then carefully went through the cancellation procedure again and I realized what was really going on.
The instructions on the web site for canceling your account, instruct you to log in to your account and click on 'Cancel Service'.  When you do this, you are brought to another page that asks you if you are sure that you want to cancel.  It also tells you that your listing will be deleted in 5 days.  I clicked 'cancel my service' once again. 
 I was then brought to another page that was asking me to confirm the cancellation of my service.  I clicked confirm cancelation.  I had clicked 'Cancel Service' a total of three times so far.  The last page that was shown to me was a full page advertisement, offering a different service.  The advertisement was big and red and took up 99% of the page.
I then scrolled down to the very bottom of the page (the advertisement takes up two pages).  I noticed a link in an 8pt font at the very bottom of the screen.  It said 'Cancel my blastengine service'.  The link was not in bold or underline, and it was not in a color that stood out from the rest of the page.  The advertisement did not say anything about it's relationship to my current service.  The company's website did not properly outline these cancellation procedures.
I contacted the company about this.  I sent them several e-mails regarding the problem, and I requested a call back.  I also called their toll free number, which just played a message and then hung up on me. I was able to get them to  refund my $9.95 for February, but they refused to reimburse me for any of the previous charges or any of the fees I incurred.
If you sign up for anything on the internet, beware.  There is very legal little protection in place to protect consumers from this type of fraud and deception. A company that you willingly gave your credit card information to can authorize charges to your account with very little oversight.  Companies like Blastengine.com will $9.95 you to death with no remorse.
If you dispute it with your bank, they will tell you that you have to take it up with the company that charged you, because you willingly gave your credit card number to them.  You will be responsible for the fees.

Colleen m
signal hill, CaliforniaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										THEY ARE A SCAM! MY HUSBAND AND I RECIEVED A LETTER FROM WEST COAST MARKETING RESEARCH LOCATED IN WASHINGTON DC YET MAILED FROM 2506 TUDOR GLEN MARKET, SAINT ALBERT, AB T8N 3V4 (YES IT IS A CANADA ADDRESS), STATING THAT THEY HAVE CHOSEN MY HUSBAND TO BE A MYSTERY SHOPPER FOR THEM. ENCLOSED IN THE LETTER WAS A CHECK FOR 2,895.90.  THIS STARTLED ME AT FIRST BECAUSE THE CHECK WAS LEGITAMATE. WE READ THE LETTER AND QUICKLY CONTACTED THE COMPANY. FIRST THING THAT THROUGH ME OFF WAS THEIR INTRODUCTION BY ANSWERING THE PHONE SAYING""HELLO"" INSTEAD OF STATING THE COMPANY'S NAME. WE WERE TOLD THAT THEY HAVE THREE MAIN OFFICES, ONE BEING IN WASHINGTON DC THAT WAS LOCATED ON THE LETTER HEAD, BUT IT WAS A P.O BOX ADDRESS AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO PULL IT UP WITH THE B.B.B. THEN I ALSO NOTICED THE MAILING ADDRESS WAS ON THE ENVELOPE ITSELF WAS IN CANADA AND THE CHECK WAS PRODUCED IN TEXAS. THEY TOLD US WHAT WE MUST DO WHICH WAS TO DEPOSIT THE CHECK  INTO OUR BANK ACCOUNT AND THEN LET THEM KNOW WHEN WE HAVE DONE SO. THE FIRST AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO HIM WOULD BE 300.00 IN WHICH HE CAN KEEP (FOR THE MYSTERY SHOPPER JOB). THE REST WILL COME WITH HIM GOING TO A WESTERN UNION IN WHICH HE MUST SEND THE BALANCE TO A ""KAREN ELLIS"" THROUGH A MONEY GRAM OR WESTERN UNION. AFTER I DID CLOSE RESEARCH I FOUND OUT FROM SOME SOURCES THAT THIS COMPANY ACTUALLY LETS YOU DEPOSIT THESE CHECKS INTO YOUR ACCOUNT SO THEY CAN CLEAN YOUR ACCOUNT DRY. THE CHECK WILL BE CANCELLED AND NO FUNDS WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED IN YOUR ACCOUNT AND BECAUSE IT TAKES A PROCESS FOR A CHECK IN THAT SIZE TO CLEAR YOU WILL NOT BE AWARE UNTIL DAYS LATER WHICH BY THEN THEY WOULD HAVE ALL YOUR INFO. THEY INSIST ON YOU DEPOSITING THIS CHECK SO THEY CAN TRACE THE CHECK BACK TO YOUR ACCOUNT, COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION AND THEN THE SCAM BEGINS. PLEASE DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT DO ANY BUSINESS WITH WEST COAST MARKETING RESEARCH LOCATED IN WASHINGTON DC. THIS SCAM HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE NOW AND I WANT EVERYONE TO BE AWARE SO THEY TOO CAN NOT BE SCAMMED AS OTHERS WERE..

										They told me that 25,000 potential customers would visit my website.  When the counter reached 43 I went to my site Manager to see if there was 43 potential customers had indeed visited my website.  There was none.  At this time I got suspicious of this so I tried to contact National Marketers on this to find what proof they have that 43 potential costumers actually visited my website.  I got a voice mail box and left them a message on this subject.
My so called counter at that point stoped counting and stoped at 43 it has been at 43 now for 24 hours which in my view indicates that they can not prove that these 43 potential customers visited my website and ended the Marketing campiagn.  I then called them to find out if they was going to return my $1.025.00 to my credit card and of course no answer and to the voice mail box I went.  So I left them a message stating that I would like a refund.  They have not returned any of my calls at all at this point.  
The $25.00 was so they could priority mail my kit that would set this marketing campiagn off and running.  When the package arived all it was, was infomation on how to set my counter on by setting an hourly amount.  I set it a 3 per hour witch comes to 72 visits per day.  All it was, was a counter.  This does not show me any advertisement what so ever.  Anyone can set up a counter to have it count as many as you set it to.  But this counter just counts.  
I payed to have this mailed to me $25.00.  The actual amount shipping cost was $6.60.  I was also promised some personal business cards.  I have not recieved these cards nor was I called by anyone to design the cards.  I have had business cards made and they called me to design them.  No calls was given to me by National Marketers or anyone who prints business cards sent by National Marketers.  I feel that I am a victem of a scam set up by this so called National Marketers.  I have repeatedly tried to contact them and they send me to an after hours voice mail box in the middle of the day during normal business hours.
Send me any inquiries on this.  On Monday I am going to call my credit card company and see if they can try and go after National Marketers to have my Money returned.  I have also been ripped off by other marketers claiming they can do the same or better but was also ripped off by them but my credit card company was able to get it returned.  I have at this point given up on this type of business and will be ending my online business with SMC Emerchant club because they also have tried to rip me off.  But this will be on a seperate report.

										This business is a total high-tech version of a boiler room.  The have telemarketers call business people when they are at dinner and, just because these poor targets use Google or Overture, they get a very high preasure sales call ending in a service contract with substantial costs over a very long term.  
Once it is time for some work to be done, they do nothing and then blame it on the search engines saying that ""results are out of our control"".  Then, when you want your money back, they say that most of your money was spent up front!  Finally, I requested a charge back from my bank and I think these jerks are going after me for it.  
STAY AWAY FROM THESE GUYS - there are so many other companies out there that actually get results.  These guys should be put in jail.

And when I called about getting my full refund, I was told that I would only be refunded $59.00 and that $40.00 of the charge was for shipping and handling to mail me the six or so pages in my materials packet which only cost $6.75 to mail by USPS.

Then a week later they had one of their telemarkera call and try to talk me into using a credit card for a business mentor I specifically said ion their form I was not interetsed in, then the guy hung up on me. A week later I received a charge for $47.90 or $47.80 for what was supposed to be a free trial dvd of the month and magazine subscription, trouble is I never gotten the free dvd, nor the trial, nor okayed the subscription. I then proceeded to send them another complaint after I then filed a compliant with the BBB and they said they would get back to me, nothing since. The BBB is also as good as nothing in trying to get your money back. What I would like to know is how these types of businesses or scam artist are aloowed to do business, and MLM companies?

Either can't find it anywhere can someone tell me if it's still running and if it is what exactly the site name is for the mp3 and movie downloads.
This has been almost a month and a half ago that I signed up and when I saw the first charge of $48 I disputed it with my bank but they needed the web address of the place I signed up at. I knew this was the same company cause I just recieve a second charge of $79 on my account which is interesting seeing that I disputed the first one and i didnt think they could make another.  But not the point.  This now has me quite upset and I'm renewing the dispute with the bank.  Hopefully after I show them these complaints they will take action.

College Place, WashingtonU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										This company called up because they wanted to use a web url of ours that still had Google recognition and would get us loads of orders from a store we had closed. They stated they did not take any fees whatsoever, and they would make a 17% commission on each order and 2.9% for cc processing. That seemed high at the the time, however, I was willing to try if it was productive enough.
Then we signed up and assigned another url we owned to make it twice as productive. That worked and we started to see orders. The web hosting technical support was a nightmare. They insisted that I say that we delivered for free, and I absolutely will not do that, that is lying to the customer because nothing is free.
One day free, I called up and they changed it, next day it was back to free, and on and on for days. I went it and changed my prices to accommodate the change three times and was getting thoroghly aggravated. Then I found out I was never informed to log into credit card processing to be able to receive my money, which by the way, during that process, I discovered they were keeping 17% of my state tax they were collecting and I was paying 100% of my taxes. 
I called to question the tax issue and was told by Rosa that they have always done it that was, Joanna suggested I just raise my prices to compensate for the difference. This is when I decided the business being done here was not ethical and I ended their agreement with my company.
I cannot imagine how much money have made keeping 17% of the state sales tax from all the good, sound flower shops they have enrolled in their program. No one expects any company doing sound business to hold any part of their sales tax, and I also bet no one else has thought to check the figures for that, but they are, and it's wrong.

										This company comes across as being very honest and totally legitimate according to their website. This is a fairly new online advertising-marketing company that offers several affordable advertising packages. One package that railed me in was their search engine submission package, where they promise to submit your url link to hundreds of  popular search engines like yahoo, google, msn, etc for only $14.95 per month and they will submit the url every single month; guaranteed traffic to my website. 
The reason why I say that this company is fairly new, because prior to purchasing I done an extensive search on this company and could not find one negative thing. I even searched this site as well as bbb, but nothing as well. I thought all was well so I purchased the package. Immediately after purchasing I was taken to a thank you page where I would have to submit my information along with my url link, but I noticed that there wasn't a submit button. I scrolled to the bottom of the screen only to find a get started button that sends me right back to their homepage. 
Notice, I wasn't able to provide any log in info so I could not close the page, because how in the world would I continue to set up my acct. I immediately emailed them at support@addyourad.net to only get no response. The only email I received from them was a order thank you email, but nothing else. In that email they provided me with a cell phone (yeah cell phone) number that just goes straight to a voicemailbox. Hours later and I am still waiting for a response. 
I have learned my lesson, I will never trust an online advertising-marketing company again. I will just do my own advertising, because it does not pay to just throw your money away to these fraudulent online companies, and believe me there are many of the same companies out there. I sent them an email advising that I was cancelling my account due to the fact that they have been unresponsive and requested a refund; what's the chance of that happpening. I took necessary action and contacted my bank. 
Just remember if an offer sounds too good to be true, just keep moving.. addyourad.net must be stopped; nothing but a total scam.....

										This company defrauds vendors by ignoring invoices, but in our case we got special treatment.We are experts in high level search engine optimization, and we were contacted because MyrtleBeachNow.com had incurred a Google penalty and was not performing in the search.  We fixed that problem, but were not paid in over 5 months.  When this happened, we threatened to use ethical SEO recourse (like this site) and publicize the fraud when people search for their company or personal names.  They then blamed us for the rank loss, claiming we criminally accessed their servers, etc.Their litigator, Reese Boyd III contacted us, attempting to intimidate us with a ""contract"" that suggested criminality and required a promise to ""undo"" whatever they thought we did (we actually never even had access to their servers).  The unethical motive behind this document was to impose conditions on an existing debt - such a ""contract"" would never hold up under legal examination in any US court. [continued below]....
									
										.....  We insisted on unconditional payment and after pointing out the legal missteps in his inaccurate, libelous and inappropriate document, Boyd agreed to unconditional payment.A month later, still unpaid, we start getting calls directly from Reese Boyd III, basically harassing us and attempting to impose further conditions on payment.  Some of the websites publicizing our dispute were starting to rank, Trey Harris started finding them, and sent Boyd on an errand to intervene.  Never mind the promise to pay unconditionally.  Boyd even told us that the check was in his hands dated a month ago, all ready to be sent, but...  Of course, the conditions now are that the sites publicizing Trey's bad behavior have to come down.We now view Reese Boyd III as complicit with the motives of Trey Harris, DSLmarketing.com, MyrtleBeachNow.com, and Chris Crowl in attempting to defraud us of our fees.  We still have not been paid, and we are aware of other vendors similarly defrauded.",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										This company has been trying to scam us for a couple of years now.  We fell for it the first time, but since then have learned our lesson.  We ordered one cartridge from them about 2 years ago at a great price.  The problem was that the toner cartridge only lasted a couple of weeks.  Then they tried to talk us into buying more at the discounted rates and insisted that we could get really great deals on toner for all of our machines.  We just had to give them the cartridge numbers for everything.  Fat chance.
So, today we received a phone call from them again.  I told him that if they had a catalog or a website, we would be more than happy to look at the information.  The man who called promptly told me that he would send information by mail and then hung up on me.  Good riddance!

										This company is a complete scam. They are well known on scammers on a lot of internet marketing forums. One of their recent tricks that actually ended in horror for me was they uploaded some (Automatic SEO tools) to local SEO message boards. They wrote a few fake reviews about them saying (how good this new software is). So I downloaded the software and began running it while I was working on my website ""as the directions advised"". A few days later i login to my website and find out that they had been injecting links in my website content. I was furious and tried finding their contact information. After a few minutes of searching I found a few other reviews from people talking about how this internet marketing company scams people and than try's to trick people into thinking someone hired from their company. So I actually called them instead of emailing them! They spoke horrible English and everything they said sounded (very scammy). They started telling me that someone named (seoguru1) hired them to work on my website and that they scammed their company for money, so to get back at them they injected links into my website.

I than told them that I would be writing a scam report about them and they said Go ahead and that it will do no good because they change their name every week.

										This company is a total scam and I really don,t think they are in business any more as the phone # does not work anymore. Probably a good thing because I surely was not done with them, if you know what I mean ? 
They got me for $5,000.00, and It was my last $5k I had left to invest to better my financial situation. I raise 6 kids on my own, and Michael Spencer the guy who promised me 6 websites and 100,000 visitors to my sites and a guarantee of atleast $36,000.00 / year just took food of our table for a long time. I got the websites and that is it !
I tried contacting Michael every single day, and the secretary there did a great job of covering up for Michael as I'm sure he could not handle the embarrassment and guilt for taking my money and not helping me one bit.
I sure hope these people have some heart, and a better way to make money than ripping people off, and hopefully they are out of business as I would hate to see anyone else get screwed like I did. Michael Spencer, for your sake you can hope to never run into me!

										This company is a total scam, they promised our storage company a completed website with an online payment option. Long story short it's been 6 months and they still have not completed our site. The website was promised to be complete in no more than 4 weeks, they showed us a rough draft after 2 weeks and it was one of the worst websites I have ever seen, the design was terrible and it looked very tacky and unprofessional, the image quality was so bad that you could see the squares.
They required a large deposit which was no big deal as long as we could get the site we wanted. But they never finished our website and they said there was nothing they could do about it and  basically said their work was done and they could not do anything for us. When we call to get our money back they hang up and won't answer when we try to call again. We are in the process of hiring a lawyer. 
Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this company unless you want to deal with lies and false promises.

										This company is nothing less than a big scam on the internet here is why? I decided to give them a shot to run my campaign. Supposedly they claim that for $399 they will blast a campaign of 2 Million targeted emails. I was suspicious about the way they conduct their business but I went for it. The first time I spoke to George the sales person; He gave me a guarantee that if my campaign doesn't succeed he will rerun it again. The deal was 10% of clicks from the 2 Million targeted emails and spam free. When the campaign ended, I went on Google analytics to check the number of visits that I got from the supposedly 2 Millions emails that Tim blasted for my campaign and I could only see 53 clicks on my website. It doesn't sound logical since they don't allow you to see how your campaign is progressing in real-time. They send me a fake report then I tried to call George but unsuccessfully I couldn't get in touch with him, he was hiding behind Tim who was the one talking to me instead of George. 
The next day I had to give them another name and call from another phone line to get in touch with George, the trick succeeded. I could say he was very surprised when he realized it was me. He promised to rerun the campaign again but at the end of the day he didn't keep his words. What they do when you purchased a consumer list that they will supposedly blast for you is that they use an e-mail spider tool in order to collect thousands of e-mail addresses in just a few minutes based on a keyword query.  These emails are nothing less than Business e-mails that they extract from the web; this program can literally scan almost any URL on the web. For sure you won't get consumers emails from them. 20 days ago, I bought a list of 1000 emails from another company and I got way more visits than the supposedly 2 millions emails that Tim said blasted, in fact I got in total 229 clicks on my website from just the 1000 emails campaign that I ran myself. Don't even think to purchase or do any kind of business with http://americaint.com/ otherwise it's like throwing your money in the trash; period. In fact most of these companies are located in Florida. By definition Florida is a hot bed for scammers especially this kind of business Email list companies.

										This company is profiteering from the slow real estate market by targeting real estate agents with big promises for referral clients and lead generation in exchange for a $3500-$3950 entry/set up fee for a service that is worthless. 
Here's the scam: The agent gets a phone call asking if they will accept a referral client, which any agent will certainly accept. They are instructed to call a number later that day for a conference call about the ""client."" No such client exists; the conference call is a sales pitch for becoming part of their network. Jeff Guthrie, ostensibly the owner, conducts the conference call and makes sure to drop the name of established companies like housevalues and zillow in the pitch. The angle is that the agent was handpicked to be part of the network and that they are getting in on the ground floor of something big, which will refer them tons of real estate clients from their powerful internet presence. 
According to his website, ""The Real Estate Advocate was founded by Jeff & Patsy Guthrie in response to a negative experience they had when buying a home...Jeff and Patsy knew that if they were going to find their dream home - at the best price and best terms  then they needed to be represented by a top-notch Real Estate Professional the REexpert... After going to many, many real estate referral web sites, the Guthrie's realized that the real estate agents that these sites recommended were NOT great agents (they were sub-par or average at best). After doing some research, the Guthrie's learned that virtually all of these real estate referral organizations would take ANY agent who signed up for their program - and who agreed to pay them for their referral services. ""
Ironically, The Real Estate Advocate won't accept any agent unless they pay for entry as well- $3500 or two installments of $1950. A survey of those in the program in our metropolitan area shows their experience level to vary from newly licensed to experienced, making Guthrie's program utterly no different from those he decries on his website. 
After the conference call, various pressure tactics are employed by the follow up staff on agents who are intrigued by the pitch. The fee buys exclusivity for certain zip codes, pays for the supposed elaborate setup of the internet sites (which are actually quite sparse, simple templates a 10th grader with a basic HTML skill could create for 20 bucks), and of course, the promise of more business than the agent can handle in spite of the tough housing market. 
Thereafter, agents get a ""newsletter"" email encouraging them to spend even more money to accelerate their results with pay per click services. 
5 months after being contacted by Mr. Guthrie's staff (no one has been able to reach Guthrie himself), none of the agents in our market area have gotten so much as one lead or referral from this expensive program, and none of the websites they paid dearly for are anywhere near the top of the google search. 
The area agents therefore call shenanigans on Jeff Guthrie, The Real Estate Advocate, and RE Experts for this deceptive subterfuge.

										This company may as well be run by Bernie Madoff.  They are crooks.  They give you a list filled with ""info@_____.com"" or ""admin@_____.com"".  You are essentially paying for a list that isn't even creatively disguised as a scam.  
I will break down the numbers for those of you considering using them.  Over 70% of the emails  bounced back and didn't even exist and then of the remaining 30%, half of those went to the above generic email addresses and the others were on an internationally banned list.  How are these guys not universally accepted as criminals?  Some of the most unscrupulous collection of individuals known to business (although calling this a business is a stretch).  Tim, one of the support staff, probably can't even support his own body weight.  Lazy, rude, and unaccomodating.  Their retention rate must be less than 5%, and if they claim otherwise it is probably as ""real"" a number as the fictitious documents they call a ""list.""  I repeat, SCAM and STAY AWAY from using them.

										This company misrepresents their clients and their works.  A number of clients listed on the site are not clients of Speed2Market, and never have been.
This makes analysis of the business's abilities and previous works unachievable, therefore wasting the time of potential clients, and gaining for themselves a level of exposure and professionalism which they obviously do not have, otherwise they would not need to represent client works as their own, when they are not!
If I was any of these businesses I would be asking questions why this person/organisation can use their names and gain kudos which they are not entitled to.
These people are helpful, but will not answer questions put to them regarding the clients listed on their site.  The adversion to answer deems there is a problem internally... They either know or dont know which clients they have or have not done work for.
This is a dubious marketing practive, and I would advise potential consumers to verify with a potential service provider their client base, and the works they have done for them.  I certainly will not be investing my dollars here as I do not think that an association with a business which represents themselves in such a way is a clever or intelligent decision to be making.
NB: Didier has ripped countless people out of their financial investments with companies such as WILD TIGERS and ZEBRA Interactive... I see he is getting on with another venture these days, and best of luck to the authorities catching up with him.  Thought that I would mention this since finding out who the director is.  Still I will not be discussing my needs with this organisation.

They fraudulently made claims as to the desirability of their email operations and sales of phone cards and other products, downloaded phone ring tones, games and the like.
They also made false claims regarding the closeness of the company to their loyal route operators. They also made false claims and misleading statements as to the real overhead and start-up costs of ther victims.
This fraud is National in scope and I have been in contact with dozens of other victims who have been fleeced in exactly the same way.  I want to see a class action suit develop out of these complaints and I want to recover all or part of my wifes' retirement funds.  This ripoff has put us close to bankruptcy.
National advertising was in place in Orlando and we would net $2000 per month.  Insurance covering theft and vandalism would be covered by the location owener.  An extended warranty was available for $250 per year per machine
NCS did not want it's route operators to sell advertising
as they would not be entitled to it's 20% share.  This was a turnkey operation and no selling was involved.

										This company says they will put you on the internet and your name will come up first in Atlanta Ga Homes search. They are totally deceptive and do not make it clear how hard it is , if not impossible
to find your name on the internet. They make it sound like anyone looking will find your name first and
that this is an ""exclusive listing opportunity"" for you only. ""No one else will have this exclusive spot"".I had second thoughts right after I said I would do it and check them out on several sites. Scam, Scam,scam!!!!!!!! They also go under various versions of the Linktech name( also negative reviews). Then I tried to find my name  which they said would show up immediately.  I looked for two days and never could find it!However, right after I had second thoughts, I called my credit card company to report it as misleading 
and false advertising. They said they would block the company and reverse the initial $14.95 charge Later on my phone, I got an alert that there was a ""charge coming through with out the card present"" for Linktech ( their alias name which is how it got through). Later it appeared as Premier Global for $79.00
on my statement.WHen I called them all of a sudden my name appeared on the internet and even then it was very hard to find. What they don't tell you also is the your name rotates down the page  and then to who knows where periodically.Also they have no connection to Google  and as they represent. The biggest misrepresentation is they promise you first page, top of the page position which is totally bogus. If you do happen to find your name, which is next to impossible, it is gone in an instant and you are not  in number 1 position.IN SHORT, they do not produce the what the represent on the phone.DO not do business with this company ever!! Hang up before they slick talk you into their product and save your self the money, headache and disappointment. Remember they are very smooth talking, convincing and know all the buttons to push.

										This company sold us an email List with 60% failure return. When we asked to clean the list for us or give us a refund, send us proof of testing, with statistics, they stopped answering.
Their first answer to our request was very unprofessional. It really felt like a teenager was behind his computer.
Stay away from this scam company.
Sending emails cost a lot of money and any professional company will clean your list with their program if you have a problem. It doesn't cost anything and the consumer leaves happy.
This company doesn't even have the tools apparently to show a simple proof of their testing. I will denounce them to The Federal Bureau of Investigation for Internet Fraud.

										This company suckers you in with false claims and testimonies giving honest business oriented people false hopes. They are very high pressure and very demanding but give you no help.
I already had an internet business that I just wanted help marketing. We thought we had found the answer with Stores on Line.
But after paying over $3,000.00 which $900.00 of was for takeing credit cards on line, I got ZILCH. Their CD didn't work for building a website, so I went in through their site. They have the most unfriendly user software program for building a web site, I have ever encountered. I already had a web site better than theirs and couldn't find anyway to marry them or to make theirs look better. I could not use the $900.00 credit card acceptance program because they had never had anyone with a large ticket item before. They wanted me to put up another $3,000.00 to take credit cards. HOOEY!
I was contacted 2 - 3 months after joining by one of their so-called experts who wanted another $3,000 - $5,000 to hold our hand and build our company up, so they could use us as one of their ""monkies for show and tell"".
When he realized I had learned more than he knew about web sites and marketing my product, he promptly left me alone.
We were new to Internet selling when I signed on with them and had great hopes of them helping us grow our business, especially paying that kind of money. Thankfully we have been truly blessed and successful growing our own Internet business without them. But I do believe we should all band together and start a Class Action suit against them to regain our hard earned money that they schemed us out of. We shouldn't sit by and allow them to rip off other poor people with big dreams! I am willing if you are. Thanks for allowing me my time on the ""soap box"".

NO NO NO it is not people be aware!!! They immediately charged me $1.95 for processing the free trial set up. What! and then a day later authorized their monthly fee for $39.95 ( not 14 days) 
I immediatey decided not to go through after seeing that all there products ( including there ""special deals"" were 30-50% higher priced then the purchase price on selling sites. ) There is no way anyone would be able to make a go of it. They only stay in business since they steal peoples money! 
I called them to cancel the day that I saw there was a charge for $39.95. They said there would be no problem and I would get refunded for that. 
A month later I have called them 5 times for a fax to delete the hold, and I still have not got anything taken care of. I have talked to 3 supervisors still nothing. 
My card said that the authorization will be dropped on April 9th. ( 6 weeks later) I will keep you posted.

I have requested multiple times that I want this so called sitemap that does nothing removed from my website and they wont even tell me where it is buried at. I have since found out that I can add my own site maps for free...
There are hundreds of site map generators available for free on the website but I cannot even add a new html site map of my own until I can get rid of the cancer they put on my site. I sure wish I had some help with this one. These people are a very bad apple.

										This fake marketing group selected me to be a ""secret shopper"".  The letter I received in the mail came with a $1,375.00 check, the check looked  so real.  In the letter I was informed to contact A-Z Marketing Group to speak to a Research Marketing Associate who would then guide me through my assignment.  The letter also had an evaluation form enclosed, this form was to be used after my check cleard and I started my assignment.
When I called the phone number, a gentleman with an accent (Nigerian or African) informed me his name was Tony.  He told me to put my check in the ATM deposit drop (since it was after hours), he said my check should clear in about 2 (two) days and  I will be able to begin my assignment.  Out of the $1375.00, I was to keep $200.00 for myself.  The rest of the money was for my secret shopping, $50.00 to Wal-Mart, $50.00 to J. C. Penny  and $ 995.00 was to be sent back to them via Money Gram.  Tony also informed me I would be able to keep the items I bought from both stores, so I planned on doing some shopping for my two children.
Nontheless, I am here now with an account from my financial institution that was closed due to this so called marketing company and the fradulent check they sent me.    I have contacted my local law enforcement a policeman took my report then told me I would need a detective.  I Spoke to a detective on that Friday, he never called me back, but did promise me he would help me as much as he could (yeah right).  Next I contacted the FBI who sent me to the Secrect Service who was just about as interested in this case as I am in baseball (which is not at all) now I need your help.  Please!!!

You will have to eventually change your bank accounts and climb a wall of toll free numbers to get the matter fixed.

										This is a copy of the letter I send to Leasecomm Corporation.
To whom it may concern: 
In regard to the bill you keep sending me, you are the one that owe me a refund of $500.00 and more, your advertisement was fault. You said that a person can make money, while they sleep,well what about if they work, which both was wrong. Your company have taken my money, on fault pretends.I don't owe you money, you owe me, you have your product, because, I send it back, if you don't believe me, you can set up for me to take a lie detect test.
I have talk to 2 to 3 people on the phone, about this matter, close to 5 years ago,and had to go throught so much red tape, and you still charging me for something I don't have, and for something that was fault. The item that was ship was return back  to  the same address, because after I found out right  away that your advertisement was fault, and I didn't suppose to do the work myself, I return your product. Your program was totally wrong for me, and your peoples was well known. I even let your people know, that I had no computer at that time. I was told that that was all right, the company tades care of the business for me, while I sleep, you set it up and run it for me, all I hade to do was to watch my mail box, and if I wanted to see my website I had to go to the library, they said.
I repeat, the product was send back to you, no more than 2 or 3 weeks after, I received it, back to the same  address. The letter goes on, but I have not received any answer, only bill's  saying I owe them. And I never gotten my refund. Its been over 5 years and I am still waiting for them to correct this mistake.
I have inform them that I know nothing about computer, or even know how to operate one.

										This is a follow-up on the ripoff report I submitted on 3/15/2007:
In good faith, I prepaid Web Marketing Source $4000+ for promised web marketing services in early Feb 2007.  In speaking with one of the managers from Web Marketing Source's apparent parent company, Captures, on March 22nd - he said they had already done a tremendous amount of work on my site, and therefore, could not refund my money.  He said the 6 weeks problem had only been an email communications problem, as they had the wrong email address for me  but they had been doing a tremendous amount of work on my site all the while they could not contact me via email nor logon on my site (since they didn't have my password).  I said I had called two different contacts from Web Marketing Source many times, leaving many voice mails, sometimes speaking with one of them  and, that I had emailed my correct email address and password for my site in early Feb - the same day I repaid them $4000+.  I then asked for documentation and evidence of this work.  He said he would get it to me, and that the receptionist, would also send me the normal welcoming email you get when you initially sign up with them (which I never got, even to this day).  
Well, it has been over a week, and the manager still hasn't sent me the documentation or produced the evidence of all this work, supposedly done in Feb and prior to my complaint with BBB and RipOffReport.com.  However, I have evidence to the contrary, as I have traffic monitoring software on my site that records stats on every visitor that comes to my site, including their domain name and IP address. The earliest evidence of Web Marketing Source visiting my site was late March, 5 days after my formal complaint with BBB.  This proves Web Marketing Source (or Captures) did not even visit my site until after my formal complaint with the BBB mid March.  So, how can they say they've done all this custom work for my site, before my complaint with BBB and my phone conversation with their manager in late March?  This proves that Web Marketing Source is dishonest and only started doing any real work on my site recently, such as their tech recently providing meta tags for my site.  Even this meta tag work, done so recently and late - is minimal, as it is only for 6 pages on my website, when I have 100 non-product pages and close to 3000 product pages.  And this is supposed to be proof of over $4000 worth of work?! 
This company has a lot of other complaints against it from small business owners such as myself for non-work and refusal to refund.  They are a disservice to the industry and should be stopped or disciplined for ripping people off.  
In summary, all I am presently asking for is my initial investment.    I am not yet also asking for additional damages.  I prepaid them in full, and in good faith $4000+ in early Feb 2007.  They have not produced evidence of working on my site before I made the complaint.  I have evidence they did not.  And the work they have recently done, is far too little and way too late.  This problem was not just a breakdown in email communications.  It was a breakdown in them honoring their agreement with me.  How can they expect me to continue a business relationship with them when their honesty and competence has been so low?  How can I have an ongoing relationship with them when I have not been given any concrete evidence to trust them?
The manager offered to give me a few months off the monthly fee of $159.99 for this so-called email communications problem.  I don't want that offer, as I don't trust them, and that would be throwing good money after bad.  $4000+ is all I am presently I asking for.  I think that is more than fair.

										This is a Telemarketing company that advertised on Craigslist for a ""Business Development"" person. Their contract allows them to basically re write the hours you worked or not pay you at all.  Which is what they did to me.  Their technology that they used for the telemarketing calls was terrible quality.  I can't believe that big brands in Canada give their sensitive data to such an outfit.  Given what they do to the workers, I can imagine they have no respect for sensitive company data from these big brands.This place is to be avoided at all costs.  They lie and they cheat..it is that simple.  Because you are an independent worker..you are stuck as there is no support out there..like better business etc.  I have to believe and hope that their bad karma will come back to them someday.

										This is the second time I got charged by these ripoff artists. First time was when I oreded some flowers for my wife online on Mother's day. They charged me $12 and I immediatly contacted them and told them to refund me my money. They said I was registered with them when I ordered the flowers online. I immediatly had my membership canceled.
The second time was March 19,2005. My wife ordered something online through Chadwicks. Apparently they charged us $9 on the credit card when she clicked on an ad to save $10 off her next purchase. WooHoo!!! She will get to save $10 off her next purchase, but first we will charge you $9 a month for these services. What a freakin RipOff. It's sad how these people can actually take your credit card number without your knowledge.
By the way, that is the last time my wife is ever ordering through Chadwicks. And I quit ordering her roses through that flower company also. When companies link up with fake ones like Reservation Rewards, they will lose all of their business. Good bye Chadwicks!!!

										This message is for everyone who is interested in working for Power Sales Team as a sales representative, or Power Info Tech as a web designer. 
The person who runs this business (Mr. Williams [954-678-8461]) lacks the proper credentials required to ensure a successful operation. He lacks professional organization and exaggerates the profits or successes of his business ventures and websites. 
Mr. Williams manipulates his employees until their use has run its course. He promises his workers a specific wage schedule and then fails to live up to it when the time comes. Should you decide to quit, he will not deliver your payments post-employment. Instead, he will deceive you by saying that you are unworthy of your salary. If that method fails, he will give you a check that is worthless due to his lack of funds. Since his personal and professional accounts are consistently overdrawn, the check will bounce, causing you to suffer for his flaws. 
As of this writing, Mr. Williams still owes two former employees their salaries for six weeks of work; thus far, he has refused to pay either one of them.

Paid what I thought was $5 for the month, and then got a reply that if the person I want to contact ever joins reunion.com then my email will be sent.   They charged me $59 for a full year and then another $1 for THEIR DONATION to the Red Cross.  When I called she offered me a $24 refund and cut my subscription time down to 3 months. Then I told her NO, if the monthly charges are $5 then why would she not charge me $15 for 3 months and refund me the other $45?  Then she got back to me and said OK, $24 for 30 days!!!  When I told her NO, $5 for 30 days is what I thought I was paying AND getting in touch with someone I had been wanting to reconnect with.  Then she put me on hold and never picked back up again.

										This sounded so real to me, and started off looking easy (and honest) but after they got my money, the panic began. It's not data entry at all!! What it is was so confusing that I really couldn't tell you exactly WHAT it was! 
All I know is that suddenly I was to  learn all these steps to follow in order to make money. I had to join into this and that which required MORE money--When I saw that, I immediately wrote to them trying to back out of it 'to no avail.'
I see now that they deducted the $25 from my checking account. I have called the number on the statement numerous times and there is only a recording saying to leave a message, which I did-- insisting they return my call and credit my account.  Yeah, right.
These people are the rip-off artists all the way!! 
I'm nervous about them having my credit card number, which I NEVER give out.  ""Just this once"" I told myself.  After all, they mentioned how wonderful their reputation was.  I was desperate and hopeful like so many others.
It saddens me and infuriates me too, that there are people who take such advantage of others.  I pray that they can be stopped!

The day they recieved them they claim they had a database failure for a few days. When it came back on, they showed one of my offers as not clicked on yet. I went back and forth with them numerous times and had to file with the BBB in which they are members. Mine was not the first filed. They got that straightened out. Then they say wait 6-8 weeks for delivery of gift from the date they recieved the certificates. After 8 weeks, I e-mailed many times. They finally told me they could send a check. I asked how much and when, and now they say according to their terms they will make every reasonable effort to deliver the gift in  a reasonable time. Which means they will send it, if and when they want! They now ignore every e-mail I send them. A little honesty would go a long way. I do not like to hurt any company, but I HATE dishonesty!

										To all of my fellow grieving investors, move over for one more.  I am a God fearing, red blooded American who believes in capitalism.  But, I was totally taken for $20,980 and yes I fell for the LAX scam here in SoCal.  Mr. Jeff Kuba??? and Pablo Rodriguez??? ""promised"" a lot and clearly delivered ""goose egg"".  Fortunately, (Thank God) I will be able to recover from this experience, but what stings the most is that I fell for this scam and was willing to fight for this company.  
What a moron I was, I was possessed by greed.  Yes, I must come to the realization that the Goodman gang was able to tap into my individual ""need for greed"" and I wished for the best and got the worst.  That being said, there are legitimate investments out there and not all are greedy. But, I had a small part to play in this dance with wolves.  
Adding insult to injury, this Consumer Information Services (CIS) and Mr. Joe Kenyen (real name??) indicates he can retrieve money from Pantheon for investors.  I asked Mr. Kenyen for satisfied Pantheon investors and references and his answer was ""we can not reveal personal information"".  He further indicated he was able to get 4 out of 16 investor all their money back and charges a fee of $1,195.00 (3-year commitment).  I also asked how did you receive my name and number.  He said someone a Pantheon provided the names.  Does this make since?  If the names are personal and confidential, how would he receive my name and number.  Watch out for this guy.  He lives in Arizona, in a private residence.  
Lastly, just a word of caution regarding another investment call QuickScan (legitimate???) received my name again from another Pantheon list of investors which seem to get passed around like best seller ""suckers"" list.  It appears that if anyone is connected to Pantheon or this investors list should beware and take great caution.  If you play with dirt, you will get dirty.

										To Whom It May Concern:
I would like to join the hundreds, if not the thousands of people, who have or should have already filed and posted formal complaints  against SMA.COMM on their  Bad Business marketing site. I had personally  dealt with  Ruth Rubin,   Steve Alembik ,  Anthony Pascale. My personal experience with SMA.COMM shows that they just keep and send inaccurate marketing lists. 
A ll of the lists sent were already inactive and false SMA.Comm reports are  false, inaccurate, and misleading!
I have personally experienced the lack of commitment on updating their fictitious email and postal marketing lists. Recently, I filed a complaint with SMA.COMM against their NCOA'ds  and nothing, ! My complaint was listed as resolved after sending me other inaccurate, fictitious Marketing lists .
This is very typical and I have experienced this several times already with SMA.COMM Marketing lists.
Why do I bother to file a complaint? Habit, formality, it is what you are suppose too do. With computers, it really is a big deal to let others beware. 
That was my horrendous experience with the  SMA.Comm marketing company So please  beware!

										To Whom It May Concern:
My name is Donna, and I worked at the Cape Girardeau, MO establishment from 7/30/07 to 8/21/07, when I was terminated without cause.  My weekly assessments by my superviser, Bryan Parker, were all fantastic reviews, therefore leaving me to feel very confident with my job, and my job security.
Of course this letter is about me, but it also does involve people in the classroom taking their training also.  For the very few out of over 22 people who really, truly wanted to learn to become a CSR, it was extremely difficult in doing so.  I took this matter to Mr. Parker many times, and it helped out to a very small degree.  People were constantly coming in late, thus disrupting class, but was there anything said to these people?  I can answer that...NO!  
Upon my termination today(8/21/07), I was given no reason at all.  I offered to take drug testing, show them how VERY WELL I do handle a computer, but H/R said no way.  Yesterday I came in at 8:00am as usual, told Bryan about my 12 yr. old daughter being very sick and I needed to go and sign some papers so that the doctor could treat her for a dehydration problem, thus leaving me to look a bit rough.  
But you don't judge people by how bad they indeed look, you are supposed to be asking them if there is anything that they could help you with.  Also, just yesterday, I was told by Bryan Parker that I would not lose my job due to having to go to sign papers on my baby girl.  I do NOT EVER, EVER come into that classroom disorientated, unless something bad involves my children. 
And even then? I gave NARS everything I had inside me to give.  Not bragging, but I guarantee you that I'd make it on that floor with flying colors.
One more thing, Bryan Parker needs to understand a few things also, and that is, that we as a whole in that class room do NOT care if he is gay or not, but somehow or another, it's brought up quite a bit.  Now, I ask you, what the heck does that have to do with NARS?  
Nothing at all, I can tell you that much.  Also, all those people who've missed full days during our training, well, guess what?  They are still working, even though after just 3 times you get written up for it.  I never even received a verbal about a chance of my getting fired.  
I am going to PUSH this case, and I am going to push it hard, too.  If Mr. Parker wants to teach a course in SEX ED and HOMOSEXUALITY, then perhaps he should be fired too.  
Thank you,
I will wait for a return answer on whether or not you can help me or not.

(The contracted order was to include ltv's no ""higher"" than 90%)
After much work and per our conversation enclosed is a break down on the list I purchased from Mike Wohl, invoice date 8/15/08.  The ltv's listed are lower than that caluculated based on the listed loan amount 
versus the listed sales price. When calculations were completed it was found that:342=35% of 988 records had ltv's between 93-103%, all have the same sales and mortgage date.  The order was for estimated ltv's from 0-90%.  Please keep in mind this has nothing to do with appreciation but rather the listed loan amount versus the listed sales price.  
During the first mortgage date of 10/14/2003-10/14/23006
100% loans were prevalent with subprime lenders surprisingly there are 356=36% of  988 records with ltvs of 80%.
It is believe if courts house records were verified there would be an outstanding 20%loan for the same date as that listed for the first mortgage on this list.
There are168=17% of 988 records with ltv's listed that are clearly wrong and different from that calculated based on listed sales price versus the loan amount listed. Examples of some leads:
#36   ltv listed 69% actual 80%
#194  ltv listed 57% actual 71%
#263  ltv listed 88% actual 103%
#337  ltv listed  66% actual 80%
#372  ltv listed 51%  actual 67%
#491  ltv listed 52%  actual 79%
It goes on and on.
Lastly, ther are 512 records that were not received.  I must have taken for granted all the of records were there when I downloaded the list. I tried going back to the link but the log in an password was not recognized so I could not download it again and will need a new log in and password to do so. I imagine that list would be modeled after the list that was received.
Please let me know how this situation will be rectified.
Offer from Mark Mcquinn, 
As I sign of good faith, I am willing to replace 100 records at no charge even though we do not credit on LTV as it is an estimated attribute.  
Thanks.

										Traffic Designs made me believe that I could get started in this business with $377 to begin.  I was made to believe that for $5 worth of advertising, which I would pay them, I could get started contacting customers to bring them in to specific websites like E-bay and Amazon.  
Then, when I called back to get started with my coach, I was told that to bring in the customers, I would have to invest $2,500 to access 100 servers that would automatically bring in customers.  I fell for this.  But I did not turn in my acceptance form because something didn't seem right. I called in January 2006 to cancel, but the alternate coach, because my ""coach Frank"" was not available.  He coaxed me into buying $150 worth of postcard ads, which I trusted might work.
Immediately, I got on the internet and found public responses to Traffic Designs saying what crooks they were and how people were unsuccessfully trying to get their money back. I called to cancel, and they said it was too late.  I never got the card in the mail.  BofA is trying now to get my money back.

										Unfortunately I fall for it and give them my credit card number. But I had 14 days to cancel it from the 14th to the 28th of January 2008. So I call back few days after saying, how do peoples see us or come to exactly our site, we have a affiliate number wich was 24578 for me? So Nick ext.222 answer me: ""Well first he said you have to advertise every where you can"" as I did. I call back another day to say:""I don't think it will worked"". He answer me: ""Stay with us and you will have the proof of what you will be doing monetary speaking in a short while"". Of course it is not a ""get rich overnight"", but you will be paid good money and in US money also.
He call me the 28th to say: ""well did you make some money yet? "" Of course I said no. He said:""are you sure?"" of course I am sir. I don't understand it, because you should.
But my answer is: ""They take money from people, so they make money on our back."" We don't and will never do. They are providing a web site and that's all, we have to advertise and see if we sell any satellite dish, or us alarm, or network dish and we are affiliate with Amazon.

										Unfortunately, I have come to find the inordinate amount of complaints filed against this company for the same type of allegations - unauthorized credit card/debit charges for detox products. They are hiding behind the guise of their ""Terms and Conditions"" (posted at www.probioticcleanse.com), which did not appear on the AcaiBerry Detox pop-up that I used to place a ""risk-free trial order"" for $3.95 in shipping charges. My latest credit card statement reflects three separate charges of $79.62 each that are 15 days apart. I was able to contact the company after much research. They have changed their Website several times. The working number is 800-238-9688. The 866-949-0138 number appears to be disconnected. The representative gave me a Return Authorization no. for one of the three unused bottles of product and confirmed that I would receive a refund in the amount of $79.62 within 5-7 business days of the return. In the interim, I have filed an online complaint with the Florida Attorney General. The Better Business Bureau gave this company an ""F"" rating due in excess of 1,500 complaints filed by consumers. The Attorney General's office did launch an investigation against this company on March 2009. I feel foolish for having fallen victim to this type of scam, especially being in the legal field.

										Upon contact with Go Telemarketing they told us that we could pay by cashier check only and would accepts a credit card.  This should have been our first warning sign. 
They said that all leads would result in a face to face appointment.  We had to go out their personally and not to call first.  If we call first then that would consider a valid lead.
The first appointment I received.  I drove about 50 miles (gas @ 3.80/gal)  I was told by the client the she did not request a appointment and told the telemarketer this.  Two other had not recieved any calls from telemarketer and had no idea why I was there.
I complainted to Go Telemarketing.  I told them that I was going to call the client and confirm the appointment.  I was told that by calling first that would be consider an appointment even if the client didn""t request an appointment.   This should been another warning sign.
I sented in reports about this problem and was told that that there was nothing that they would do and they would not refund and monies.
They did sent me a recording proving that the client had been called.  remember these are senior citizens at least 62+.  The telemarker spoke fast, ask only questions that could be answer with a yes or no answer.  Did not ask whether the client understood the the material or having any interest in a reverse mortgage.  the client was told that some material would be delivery tomorrow at a set time.
Go Telemarketing would then sent me a lead sheet.  When I got to the client house.  They question why I was there.  They remember someone calling, did not understand anything about the call and did not consent to the appointment.
Another guarantee was that the value of the home would at least $150,000.  One of my appointment was a $50,000 home.  They refuse to replace that lead.
Upon requesting a refund I was told and I quote ""Go Telemarketing will stop sending appointment when your current schedule has ended.  We do not offer a refund on purchased leads whether the leads was valid or not.									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										Warning: Traffic Geyser is a scam. I got little, if any, value from my 30-day trial membership that is supposed to help people market on the Internet with videos. 
I canceled my membership 3 days early, then emailed them again the next day asking them to confirm my cancellation. I double-checked their terms to be sure I had followed their cancellation procedure exactly.
I did not hear back from Traffic Geyser until receiving a notice that they had charged my bank account for the full monthly fee of $97. I had given them a card number for an account with only a few dollars in it in case something like this happened, and the charge caused an overdraft on my account. This works well if you don't completely trust a ""trial offer"" because you can always transfer money to cover it if you decide to subscribe.
After calling Traffic Geyser (I did not have a phone number for them until they sent my 'receipt,') and leaving a voicemail, I immediately called my bank, and they were able to remove the charge, but I had to cancel my card. They will send me an unauthorized charge complaint to complete, which must be returned within a specified time to keep the charge from hitting my account again. 
The reason my bank could stop payment was that I called within a few hours of the charge posting, and did not have enough money to cover the charge.
Traffic Geyser has still not returned my call or responded to my emails or complaint in any way. If they were legit and not a scam, they would have immediately replied to correct the situation like any legit business would. Beware of the Traffic Geyser membership ripoff!

										We are a small family run English company and we first contacted Internet Advancement in September 2003 in response to some emails regarding being listed on their shopping malls, which later became discussions on Search Engine Optimization.
Everything seemed fine and we signed up to a ""special promotional package"" - $490 fee, then $39.95 per month. Certain guarantees were given about search engine rankings.
They promptly changed all the keywords to words which were just not right at all and despite us telling them so, they said those words would work, and to leave them as they advised.
Of course, they didn't work - and the whole website nose-dived almost instantly, and it still has not recovered, some 16 months on.
After many months - and many many complaints to them - without avail - despite them saying they would fix everything - and the total nosedive in sales, and of course hits, on our website - I am still trying to get a refund from them. I have a fully documented history of dealings with them - when you can get them to respond, that is - and it shows all the lies and fraud they are involved in.
During this time my husband passed away and Internet Advancememt said they would do some extra things to help make up for things - this was never done .
We are fully entitled to a refund, but when it is mentioned there is always an excuse as to why we don't qualify - our source codes were changed - which is a load of rubbish - or we left it too long to complain and we are now outside of the period in which we could have complained etc etc.
What is so evil about this company is that they not only completely ruin what you did have working, even it wasn't terribly successful - with the result that we have had almost no sales on our site since they fiddled with it - but we have the privilege of paying them to ruin our rankings.
They promise a rankings report every 60 days - you never get one.
I have now been waiting since 31 Dec for another reply from ""Jason"" but nothing has come yet - I see he has sent wonderful replies to other people as well, from the listings here! I am not now surprised to read on this site that many other people have suffered exactly the same as we have, and been given exactly the same ""excuses"".

										We purchased two EZ-link units for $25,480 from these crooks in Florida in July 2004.  Salesman, Clark Sampson sold the first one. Then we received another call from Jeff Cooper, Assistant to the president shortly after, making the same claims, plus the lies he told us were in short, some of the worst one could claim. They both claimed they would pay for themselves in a years time.  They said, ""any time you have any problem, we will solve it for you.""  What a farce!  They promised units would be delivered and installed in 45 days. What a lie that was!  We had nothing installed.  Promises were made, they broked so many times one can't count.
We had DSL and phone lines installed in one location for five months, where the lines went nowhere, with us paying not only the installation fees, but the monthly bills.  We had all the licenes, permits and all legal requirement in the locations we had acquired. Pantheon would not return phone calls most of the time.  We sent a letter to the president, Alan Glaubman, asking why all the delays, registered, and signed, returned by mail.  We received no response!  We then sent a letter of demand for our money back.  We gave him ten days.  Naturally there was no response.  
We have contacted the Missouri Attorney General, Jay Nixon, who is currently investigating this company.  He hates scammers. He is like a bulldog.  We have also contacted the Missouri Secretary of State, and they are investigating.  We have also contacted the Florida Attorney General, now also investigating.  We were just notified Feb. 18, 2005, the Special Agent In-Charge Amos Rojas Jr. of the Miami Regional Operation Center of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement has had the report, and currently is investigating.  U. S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has been notified of this scam company.  We are using every tool to get these crooks.
We would recommend the ""Rip-Off Report Do It Yourself Guide to be followed by all the hundreds of peoples who have been taken as we have.  Bring justice to Jeff Cooper. Bring justice to Clark Sampson.  We all need our money back.  Contact the Assessors office of Dade County.  See were these crooks live, what property they have, their phone numbers at home: do all the digging you can. Starting faxing and calling them.  Tell them we all know about them.  See what business are around their so called company address.  Fax the Rip-off reports to their business next door. Get your Revenge.  
We are coming after you Jeff, and you too Clark.  But especially you Alan. If we don't get our money back, we have some nasty law coming on your head!  Make it hard or make it easy!

										We signed a contract with salesforce.com on 03/27/08 which was a 3 month contract for $1,125.00. We did not want automatic renewal, so the salesman put billing frequency as annualy on our contract.
On 11/26/08 our contract was void. on 11/28/08 our account was fraudelently charged by salesforce.com for $3,375.00. We had NO contract stating that they had authorization to do this.
We called on 11/28/08 when we saw this charge hit our account. We left two messages with the billing department and one for the salesman. Our salesman reconfirmed that this was not agreed upon and that salesforce.com was at fault. Salesforce.com kept putting us off and saying that ""the money will be in your account tomorrow"". This was the same excuse we heard day after day.
After one month, the billing department finally called us back. Finally we made an arrangement with the salesman to give us another 3 month contract for 1 user for 12/23/08 through 03/22/09, and then we would recieve a $3,000.00 refund. We received a refund of $2,675.00.
After battling with them we recieved $375 less than we had agreed upon. Their exuse was that we had lapsed time without paying them. First of all, they automatically charged our account 2 days after the contract went void without authorization. I guess 2 days of lapsed time equals $375.00 !?!?
I strongly suggest not to do any business with salesforce.com. Their Tech support is TERRIBLE!! and I have not once been able to reach their Billing Department during business hours. After 20 minutes of waiting on hold, it transfers you to voicemail. I have not had one good experience with salesforce.com - their program isn't any good anyway! Look at how many bad reviews they have! Don't sign a contract, they won't honor it anyway!

										We thought we were getting on the road to financial recovery,after an accident wiped me out, when my wife and I answered an adverisement on the USA cable network. And in the process get a new computer to replace our gerbil fed dinosaur.
My wife answered all the financial questions. I spoke to the sales representative briefly to give her some system requirements. This was in November of 2006. I know my wife asked how long the process would take and was delighted to hear we would have a new computer in Febuary,2007.Well, we gave them our financial information and began our payments.
In the early part January of 2007, my wife contacted  the company to check the status of our orderand was told everything all was inorder. To her shock,when she tried to call them infirst week of Fbuary, the phone at the company was disconnected, and the new number they gave in that stupid foward message; no one answered. She tried sending an e-mail; no reply. Still they kept taking money. We recieved our statement for January with a customer service number and and e-mail address.She tried both...to no avail.
Finally in mid-Febuary, in our statement, we got a ""congatulations"" with our statement...saying we had reached a"" fullfilment phase"".This was something that WAS NOT explained to us.Now our computer would be ordered in March. Mind you, we could not get a return call or e-mail from this company for atleast 3 to 4 weeks. 
So,on or about the tenth of March,  when we recieved paperwork for our computer to be ""shipped"" or something we also were informed we qualified for upgrades to our computer and a ""revolving credit account"".On March 13, my wife got an e-mail reiterating the fact that the paperwork was needed to complete the order and had not been recieved yet although we sent it out around the 10th or 11th of March. Of course  we couldn't get any one to call us at our convience or answer a dam phone for that matter.
On march 27th  we recieved a phone call at 7:30 p.m. It was Tanya from Financing Alternatives. I was in the room while my wife struggeled to get some answers from Tanya, but she became condescending and offensive only referring to a contract she said was incomplete.(A note here: If our contract was not complete the I beleive it is a void contract and not enforcable.)I took the phone from my wife and got the same treatment from Tanya...I angrily asked to speak to a supervisor.....she said no!!!..at which point I demanded to speak to one. 
I was put on hold for about 5 to 10 minuites..then told that a supervisor was not available and that one would call me in ""24 to 48 hours"". On Wedsenday and Thursday, I waited for a phone call that never  came. 
So Thursday night I called them and left a message on there voicemail.stating that since they couldn't bother to call me back that I  was giving them until the monday to contact me to resolve this or I would cancel there payments. They didn't call so I followed thru.
Since then no-one has even made an attemp to contact us to re-solve the problem, which is what we wanted in the first place. Yesterday,May 2, we recieved an e-mail from Tanya. It confirmed some of our info but from there point of view. This was a reply from an e-amil we sent  A MONTH AGO!!!! I also sent a hand written letter to the ""ceo"" of this company, George Christian, who apparently taugh his employees the fine art of not answering, because I haven't heard from him either.
It's a hell of a thing to start a company based on treating people poorly,and ripping them off because they had some hard times. After 20 years of customer service besde employment, all some had to do was talk to us and return (in a decent time frame) a phone call.
We are not done because of this we are filing this report and folowing up with our police department, the Virginia BBB  and Consumer Protection Division. If I have to go there to Virginia I will get my money back.

										We worked with 2 separate analysts over the course of a year.  After our initial ""kickoff"" meeting, which lasted roughly 1 hour, we barely heard from them again.  All of our goals were ignored by the team as they seemingly tried to automate our account and not apply any ""real"" work.
Once a month we received meaningless reports, which ironically highlighted the fact that they were missing all of their goals.  After multiple attempts to work with them and expressing our frustration the CEO, James Amato, contacts us to offer us a free month.  He assured he had a new person for our account and that things would improve.  He made this offer during our busy season so we said ""thanks"" and accepted the free month.
James promised he'd call on January 10 at 10am to try to save the account.  Believe it or not, he didn't call at all.  After I contacted him in the afternoon he said ""a meeting ran over"".  I wasn't buying it, but set up a meeting with him the following day.  To my surprise, he didn't call us then either!  
I finally got in touch with him the next day and asked for a refund.  He said we'd get one on the following Monday, but missed that date too.  Upon following up with him he said he ""decided against it"".  
My advice for anyone considering this company for work, save your money.  We've never felt so insignificant by any vendor we've worked with.  They routinely miss appointments, show up 15 minutes late, make promises and change their minds.  Very frustrating lack of professionalism here.  Buyer beware.

After not getting results from their ""Enhanced listing"" at $49.99/month for about 9 months, we cancelled the account. Some time later, we noticed they're still billing us. We canceled again - they claimed they had no record of the cancellation.
After a while, we noticed that they're billing us again. We complained and cancelled again. Again, they claimed there was no record of cancellation. We also talked to our credit card company and tried to ensure they will not be able to bill us again. 
Fast forward a year. They're billing us, this time for no services rendered at all. It's like playing a ""Whack-a-mole"". A conference call with our credit card company and a Local.com representative resulted in Local.com guy claiming again that they don't have a record of cancellation, and then, when confronted with a fact that they don't have a paid ad online for us either, he immediately hung up on us. We'll see if the chargebacks will get them to finally stop.
(I know we were stupid not to simply cancel the card they keep billing, but we do run a busy company, and pay a lot of other people monthly... this would create a major accounting hassle. We still might have to do so - and I'm considering going to a small claims court too.)									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

										Welcome to the worlds most lucrative online harmacy software system.  So goes the welcoming letter included with our software package. Yes, it is lucrative for the company, not the many people who have bought into this big RIP OFF Scheme. It was claimed you could make a lot of money from the orders of drugs at lower prices from your personalized web site.
Sometime in Feburary of last year (2005) I responded to some internet advertising for My home pharmacy and was later contacted by phone and after some discussion finally decided to go ahead with the business on the 6th of March charging the fee to my Amex card.  
The company I signed up with is Pharmaceutical Wealth Network Inc. of 3851 E. Thunderbird Rd. Phoenix, Arizona with the parent company being located at P.O. box 1210 Pahrump, NV 89041 and a toll free # 1-866-562-4021 or 1-866-999-7674
I talked to two or three persons but wrote down only the name of Jason Smith who was working there at the time, seemed like a nice guy but he suckered me into this thing so he bears responsibility also.
There was also an advertising agency associated with but seperate from Pharmacuetical wealth network (so they claim) whom I paid advertising fees to (PREMIER MARKETING GROUP) I believe they were in Scottsdale, I would like my money back from them also as I got no results from their so called advertising. They promised no guarantees though.
I have seen abolutely not one response to my website in spite of thousands of hits over 11 months so there is no truth at all to ther claims. 
I was told something about a money back guarantee which I am ready to claim but don't know how as I can no longer contact them. Perhaps they disolved the ""LUCRATIVE"" business and all went to Hawaii!! and I with a bunch of other people funded it.
Any help recovering my money spent will be appreciated!!!

										Well here I am having hoped to avoid doing this in a public forum. Since I cannot get anyone at EMS to call me back, I must take advantage of all avenues open to me. 
After having bought ""The Silent Money Machine"", I received a call from the folks at EMS telling me that they were offering a select few the chance to work one on one with the pros in order to make them a great success suitable for marketing their products. After some lengthy questions about my ability to commit my time and finances, the caller decided I was an extraordinary client and would try and put me thru to the owner immediately. Behold I was ""in luck""! The owner was immediately available! He smoothly convinced me that their fine team of graphic artists and web site builders could help me greatly. He sent me to some websites online as examples. Everything sounded GREAT!
I was sent a contract to sign and information on where to wire transfer my $4000. I am not generally an idiot, but Jason (the alleged owner) was so good at his pitch I was genuinly excited. The contract went into great detail about the ""custom designed package of trade secret products and/or services....includes EMS's online website creation, ecommerce, marketing and business developement software"". 
During this time I had a rather sudden illness in the family, requiring me to travel. I kept in contact with Jason as he was rather sure to call me every day or two to ask when I could wire the funds. He told me on multiple occaisions that my ""website was nearly finished"" and they had been ""working hard"" on it since he could tell I was serious. After finnaly sending the funds I never heard from him again. Calls now go unreturned.
The contract contains language that is very tricky, in that it attempts to protect EMS from having to refund any money after the first three days, since the party signing will receive ""trade secrets"" that cannot be recovered. I HAVE RECEIVED NO TRADE SECRETS. The ""customed designed products"" have nothing ""custom"" about them.
There was no website and no one was working hard, or otherwise, to do anything at all. (Except maybe to ensure I would send in the cash.)
Here's what you get:The ""Business Guide Solutions Kit"" is a run of the mill deal to help you incorporate...get it at any office max. The ""Dream Builder"" kit is a pitch for a financial planner. The big ""Internet Web Store"" that they had been working hard on is an online software application which you are to use to build your own site. It is repleat with buttons that do not do what they are supposed too, often taking you to a screen that tells you that feature is under developement. My ""coach"" for the only session I took was a nice enough guy, but admitted he knew next to nothing about the program as it was ""new""!
After this first session, which was back in February, I had emailed him with a number of questions and also called him on the phone. You CAN call with questions as much as you like... they only problem is finding someone who knows the answer. He told me he would email the questions to the right people by our next training session. When it came time for that, one week later,  he still had no answers and agreed we could not proceed further until he had them. This went on for two more weeks.
Finally I got an email with answers! 
HURRAY!.... Wait.. the answers are ""That button doesn't work"", ""that doesn't work, we are working to fix it"" etc. The online web builder program is a joke as far as I am concerned and I taught MYSELF more about it that the coach knew .. all in one week!
I have cancelled further training sessions and am patiently waiting a reply from EMS or Perforum (the coaching company). After seeing the responses posted here from EMS and the threatening language used, I am even more DISGUSTED. 
WARNING TO EMS: I will NOT be intimidated by threats of lawsuits for defamation. LIBEL, specifically, constitutes a FALSE statement made in writing and published to one other than the defendant. Furthermore, mere opinions are not defamatory unless it implies an assertation of an underlying false fact.
No statement or fact presented here is false and I stand by them all.

										Well, by the time I read this report, FAI got me for about $1000. I figured I need to cancel their transactions directly from my bank, before they get the full $1800. They told me after 3 mos. of payments you get your computer, well, I ordered in Nov, 06, it is now Aug, 07, 9 mos. so far.  they sent me the shipping paperwork, and guess what? it wasn't all there, so I had to wait another mo.  
I've called them soooooooo many times, I went over on sprint mins. like it was nothing!!  They NEVER answer. as soon as 930am comes, the machine immediately says ""all representatives are currently assisting other customers, please email at .."" so, that's a serious runaround, I might have broke the contract by preventing further payments, but the violated the contract first by lying about even getting a computer.  
I emailed them ""tanya"" and told her everything, Not to respond to my email cause I'm done with them. and I'm sure they're hitting that delete button instead of the ""open"" button.  I Hope they enjoy that $1000, cause my 16 mo. old son sure would have! 
So, now after waiting for 9 mos. for a mythical computer,I have come to the conclusion of buying directly from best buy or circuit city, cause I'll NEVER purchase onling again.

										Well, I should've checked the Rip Off Report before I wasted my time to go interview at this location.  I showed up and while the building was nice, the office was a dump.  This should've been my first clue.  There was a line of people interviewing for one position that the guy said he had to fill immediately.  The interview was quick and the guy was fast talking, slick, and had everything right to say.  Still, I had my doubts.  Something inside told me that this wasn't as promised. I saw one of the candidates outside who interviewed and they also got the 2nd interview tomorrow, which was to be shadowing one of their ""top"" marketing professionals all day.  After checking the internet, my suspicions were confirmed. Rip off report, you saved me from making a big mistake and I'm grateful. 
In my own personal experience, this firm did not live up to what the guy said it was all about. He dropped many names, some of whom I knew to be using other marketing firms for their communications or relying solely upon their in house staff.  I just can't believe that this dumpy little office could be handling multimillion dollar accounts and doing marketing communications.  No wonder their website (still under construction after a year) has very little information. In looking at the Rip Off Report, it looks to be a scam, so I cancelled my 2nd interview happily.  I will gladly save myself the time and trouble.

										What a scam! 
I was approached by this company (CityGrid Media formerly known as Citysearch ) and offered to sign up with them so they can launch an advertizing campaign on line for my business. They claim to help you advertise your business, by asking you to pay to list your company on their directory. They also claim that they will drive traffic from all the search engines to your business, make your business grow.
They charge $19.95 per month for this service and they want you to allocate a minimum $400.00 budget per month, also. It is a pay-per-click service! 
So as a small business owner, you are looking for some credibility and want to help your business grow, you have a quality product or service, so you want your phones to ring or the emails to start coming in. So you put aside some funds towards things like this that would help your business grow. You pay to get your company listed, little do you know-- you are about to get sucked into a
nightmare that could cost your business everything. 
After 2 days I check the statistics regarding the number of clicks on my account and I was about to pass out. A ridiculous amount of clicks and absolutely no results: no phone calls, no e-mails, no contact! I figured that the way things are looking, I was using my whole budget for that month with no results. I called them right away and asked them to stop everything and cancel the account. I told them that I have a suspicion I am a victim of a scam. 
Upon calling I was told that I cant cancel until the end of my next billing period. I said this was ridiculous and that they should cancel the account immediately! It did not make sense to me to spend all that money for no results! They said that I may be in too many categories and we should reduce them. And I have to wait until the next billing period before I can cancel. I asked them politely to please cancel my account now and cut my loses here. I was willing to pay the $19.95 plus
whatever amount for the clicks for the two days. They repeat the same thing over and over... they cant cancel my account until the end of the 30 days (billing cycle). I was tired of fighting so I surrendered. I went ahead and I reduced the number of categories my business was listed for. I knew at this point that they would make sure that at the end of the month they take all my money! I put stop-payment on the transaction with my bank. 
Needless to say that I did not see any results from so called advertizing campaign that they ran for me!
Two months later they started harassing me for payment. At one point they called me to cut a deal with me: everything will go away if I pay have of it. I accepted just because I wanted this to be over with. With one condition: pay half then and half in two weeks. I was very specific when I asked their rep to call me the second time when they want to charge my card for the second payment! I even told them that I will not use the same credit card for the second payment so do not save it on file! 
To my great surprise, when I receive the credit card statement, I find the second charge. No calls, e-mails about their intention of charging my card again! 
In the mean time, I was contacted by an agency that handles a Class Action Suit against CityGrid
Media, LLC (more information at http://www.MenagerieSettlement.com).
After the two payments I am still receiving collection letters from CityGrid Media.
When you start a business you need as much help as you can get, you need people on your side who can support you and help you grow. I now have debt collectors contacting me and telling me that I owe money and ruining my credit score, all because I signed up for a shitty service that did nothing for me and because they refused to cancel my account for such a poor performing service.
Do not use the services of this company, you will be sorry.
If youve done business with this company, please check out http://www.MenagerieSettlement.com and join the law suit. 
Its ridiculous how they got away for so long with this scam!									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

After researching on the internet, there was complaint after complaint on ILD telecommunications.  Looking further, I found this occured while submitting to an online survey with the internetsurveygroup.com.  I am very leary of websites offering free laptops, money, and gift cards.  
There are a few survey groups that I do participate with, and have not had any problems so far.  I know now not to submit to any ""survey group"" anymore.

										When I signed up for this ""excellent opportunity"" the end of December 2005, paying $4000, I was told I'd make thousands of dollars by doing nothing.  
What I was paying for was for the company to send out ads in my name.  When people purchased from my ads--from eBay, Casino or Amazon--I would get paid. 
Over the months I contacted several people at Assurance Plus, no easy feat, to find that Joe Hickey (original salesperson) does not work there anymore.  I was told by the customer service department to be patient and to keep checking my advertising campaign pages.  Still, no sales were reported.  
It took alot of tenacity on my part to make many more phone calls and finally get through to the general manager, Dave Hershman.  He told me to be patient and that if for some unforseen reason I hadn't earned any money by the end of 2006 (original contract was for a year), he would extend my contract for another year for FREE.  He would also increase the number of targeted visitors over my 3 websites.  I thought this sounded reasonable! 
Anyway, by June of 2007 I still hadn't earned anything.  I started the phone calling odyssey again to attempt to get through to someone in charge.  I was told that Dave Hershman did not work there anymore.  I finally spoke with James Healky, new general manager--again, no easy feat getting through.  He told me not to worry, if I didn't earn anything by the end of 2007 he would contact the CFO to see if I could get a refund.  He also said this would be an unprecedented move as people ALWAYS make money!  
During all this time there were computer glitches so that it was not always easy to check on my advertising.  The end of 2007 came and--big surprise--I never earned a dime from this company.  
I called the BBB in Arizona and they told me I had to file a claim with the Colorado Attorney General's office first.  They also told me they had several complaints against this company.  I don't have the astuteness to file the claim with the attorney general's office or the money, so here I sit, out of $4,000 feeling like a fool.  I'm so glad I stumbled upon your website!  Hopefully, someone will file a class action suit and I can get some of my money back!

										Where do I begin telling about this company?  It has been one long nightmare from day one.  They charged me the day I signed up with my hoping for more business.  They did nothing for three weeks but still had my $299 at that point. I was told everything would be up and running by 2 weeks.Theystate that they said 4 weeks. After 7 weeks I gave up on them ever getting my project righly finished.  Now I am in at $398(charged me another$99 monthly charge which I agreed to but not with no performance on their part) and still my Smart Marketing Package Agreement with Customer Touch is still not finished and it is 7 weeks into it after signing up with them.  They talk a very persuasive talk but have no organizational ability of doing what they promise. (Incompetent)  The way they work is if you want something done you have to create a service ticket.  I have left several service tickets, they take days to do even the simplest tasks and the ones that are to much for this sorry company (which I could do easily if they gave me access to the software but they will not do that) but this is their business, so what is their problem. They are dysfunctional and none of their departments mesh with each other and then I get the email that states ""Ticket Resolved"", no it isnt, nothing was done at all concerning what was in that ticket.  I have a professional website that is far superior professionally looking comparing to their lower grade generic website and when I signed up they told me they could use the website that I currently have but have not done a darn thing connecting my site up with the Facebook Business Page nor have they even done a darn thing finishing up the simplest of things to get it up and running. THIS COMPANY IS THE MOST INCOMPETENT COMPANY I HAVE DEALT WITH IN A LONG TIME-DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS COMPANY BECAUSE YOU WILL BE FRUSTRATED, ANGRY AND RIPPED OFF! After I signed up I saw in the contract that it is for a one year agreement with the dates of payment uncertain in the contract and they charged me  $299 for the first 4 months then $99 month there after but doing nothing for the money I was paying them. I lost my business charge card and that was a blessing because I had to get another card which thankfully they  now do not have the new card on file so I can stop payment if they do not perform, which I have seen more than enough to know they are not capable of any meeting of the minds with me.  But I am out $398 so far because of their TERRIBLE SERVICE! They have an outstanding looking website but the child like website they tried to stick me with which was just a template cookie cutter looking generic website was a joke not nearly as good as the one I currently have.  I knew that i should not have gone with this company.  They use high pressure tactics to get you to sign , try to make you sign for a one year contract and they are VERY SELF SERVING.  THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT THEMSELVES, that is it.  Watch Out I WARN YOU ABOUT SYNERGY DIRECT SOLUTION.

										While looking at my bank statement today, I noticed an unusual $14.95 charge.  The description said ""Easy Saver.""  I had no idea what this was so I called the phone number listed.  They answered the phone ""Membership Services.""  I asked her what the name of her company was and she replied again, ""Membership Services.""  I finally got her to say ""Encore Marketing International.""  I asked her what the charge was for and she said that I must have clicked ""accept"" on a pop-up banner after I ordered flowers back in May.  I knew that was not true because I never accept offers like that (it was for $10 off my next order and I knew I would not be ordering again).  She removed the pending $14.95 charge, but said I needed to speak with a supervisor about removing the other 5 months worth of charges.  There is also a charge for $1.95 that I did not authorize.  I am currently waiting on the supervisor to call me back.  
After searching Encore Marketing International online, I have found that there are numerous complaints against them for the same thing.  This was an unauthorized charge.  I did not accept anything, nor did I agree to or sign up for ANY type of service.  So far, I have been billed over $90.  I will update my report with the outcome of my calls and complaints.

They stated that while I was ordering a restaurant certificate from Restaurant.com, I was asked if I wanted to sign up for their service free for 30 days. (It sounded like the default was YES and you had to specifically UN-CHECK if you were not interested. 
I was supposed to have received a package from the company  which would have allowed me to cancel prior to my 30 days. I have NO recollection of this. I cancelled my membership over the phone, but I am still out $14.95. I have received an e-mail confirming my cancellation. 
I will be keeping a close watch on my acct. for any more activity from this company. I have to say that I am even more disappointed in Restaurant.com for aligning themselves with such a company and allowing their customers to get sucked into this.

										Whole sale prices?  MY foot!!!! I paid 200.00 for a membership fee to get in to this thinking i was going to get wholesale prices on the goods i would sell. 
1) you cant see what the Wholesale prices are until you have access to the site which you can only get after you pay your fee. 
2)  The stuff for the most part  the produsts are outdated, refurbished, and worst of all, ( The prices they gave me that they call wolesale average 20% higher than the products ever retailed for brand new). Now i did do some research. 
Most of these products on the market now which are the newest and latest up to date products are retailing for still far less than what you pay for their outdated products No, i didnt ask for a refund. 
Figured i am just out of the money. If you comunicate with this company, see if they will give you full access to their products to review priceing. Doubt that will happen. all i can say is, ""Folks, dont go there!!!!""  I bit and got bit.  
You know, it seems like there would be some kind of fair trade and commerce laws on the books preventing this kind of thing. And its happening all around us. What does the FBI and other investigative services do with their time? 
Or, have these kind of scams become federally legal? Have they found loopholes in the system? Or, is it just a scenario where when a class action suit finally makes its way in, they can buy their way out for a few million, profit 10 or 20 million, and the ripped-off consumer gets pennies on the dollar and still loses his butt even if he was just a consumer level party to the suit? 
  HA, Ha,. Ya. Bet you have all seen or experienced that scenario before. Bad thing is, I am smart enough to have come up with these kind of scams myself as simple as they are but not smart enough to keep from climing in and getting bit thinking there just might be a legit opertunity to make a residual income however large or small. 
Sound like you? Yep. What is the consumer protection agency doing about this stuff? (Fair comerce act.) Is their such a law?  No? Used to be? Lets revise the old one or get a new one on the books. Look forward to everyones input on this and i give all my respect and best reguards to the good folks who created and maintain this site.

										Why I didn't look here BEFORE I allowed National Sales Group (NSG) to bill $89.95 to my credit card is beyond me.The come on was for only $29.95 to gain access to all kinds of great job opportunities not available to the general public. I was told I would receive a password immediately for access to my personal web page and to go there and do all of the tasks, the Job Target Profile, Resume Builder, Online Interview, Sales Course & Personality Profile as soon as possible so that potential employers could access all of my information as soon as I returned the signed documents they would be sending out within the next seven business days. I sat down immediately and filled out EVERYTHING, including the online test. 
Although I did hear them say they were mailing me a $50 ""Mastering the Art of the Sale"" which was part of the original $89.95, they did not let me know that this online Sales Course was one in the same. This Online Course also did  not mention anywhere that it was the same one that I'd be receiving in the mail. So, I had already blown any opportunity of even hoping for a $50 refund even if I did try to return it. 
The book, ""Mastering the Art of the Sale"" offers nothing but basic 101 sales information and has a lot of typing/editing mistakes in it. Certainly anyone looking for a pharmaceutical, medical or technical sales rep position would be able to write a manual that helped people a lot more that this poor excuse of a book. 
So, it was three weeks before I ""qualified"" to get anything supposedly posted so that potential employers could see my resume and I was quit tickled when on the twenty seventh day I received three notices that three different companies were interested in me and I was to follow a link from these notices and apply. The first one was for a position posted on every job search web site I had looked at and I had already applied for and the other two just simply did not exist. I called NSG and told them these jobs were not offered by these companies and I was told to keep checking, because sometimes NSG gets the listings prior to them actually being posted on the employing company's web site. Everyday I have checked these two companies and neither has any such postings. 
Of course by now my original $29.95 for the first month had ran out so they billed me for another $13.50. I'm a s l o w  l e a r n e r.
You also have to call in every few days to supposedly get them to ""send out your resume"", it's not automatic. I never received another inquiry.
Be aware that there is ANOTHER (possibly the same but don't know) company out there also offering pharmaceutical rep job wanting the same $29.95 to help you find a job. This one is American Sales Group (sound familiar ???)
I will never sign up for another online opportunity without first checking this site and running a Google search about the company and people I am looking to do business with.

We called and Called to find out where it was, same thing promised the computer would ship in 5 payment and the 99.00 down. This is crazy. We did get the computer,but the things we were offered to have on the computer are not on it. It is not a dell it is a Hewlett Packard, that is not what it was suppose to be. 
I tried to get some software for it and I was told that the product key and serial number do not match and are not valid. What the hell is this thing stolen? I want to take action also. We have now paid over 1200.00 for this thing and still have another 1000.00 to pay. Something needs to be done with this company, and I want to know if my computer is ligit.

										Yes Local did advertising for me for about 3 months and i got some varying results with the last month being the best the 1st month was very bad they charged me $750.00 and the clicks I got averaged out to be around $12.00 per click.I changed companies after the 3rd month i just didn't feel I was getting my money's worth.The company I went with after that was worse so I came back to Yes Local.   They took out $750.00 my ads appeared for about 3 days then they were gone. I called and spoke with John he said they were having technical difficulties and the ads would re-appear soon and I would not be billed until i had my full months ads. The ads did re-appear for 1 or 2 days and then they were gone again. I called back and spoke with John he said, that they would be back up soon and would i be interested in joining service pro? he explained, that they were changing the business from advertising to service pro a company that as he explained will do the advertising for me and I would not have to spend any money that when i ran a service call repairing appliances they would get 30% of the call that I would call them when the job was complete and the customer would pay them and they would then send me my cut. I signed up for this to see how it would work I was told that i would still get my months advertising for what I already paid for.well my ads showed up maybe 2 more days and then were gone for good. I called john back and told him I was canceling my account with them I did not want anything they had to offer with yes local or service pro. about 2 to 3 weeks went by with no more ad's then I noticed a $750.00 charge to my checking account from yes local which caused my account to be negative I had around $200.00 is NSF fees I called john and he said they would send me a check by Friday and i should receive it the next week by this time I Did not trust them so I went to my bank and they recovered my money it took several days to get it back now 2 weeks later Telecheck called me and told me they have put a hold on my checking account that i would not be able to write a check or use my check card I  explained to them that I was a victim of fraud and explained to them what happened she told me they would contact yes local and get back to me.They called me back a couple hours later and said they could not reach them that 1 # was disconnected and no one answered the other so I gave them the #'s that i had.This was on good friday. She called me back a couple hours later and said she spoke with john and he said to call back Monday and gave her another # to the accounting department she explained to him that I could not use my checking account until this was settled and he said to call back Monday.The lady with telecheck told me that she would take the hold off until this was settled but she did not It is Easter weekend and I cannot pay my bills i can't even get gas for my vehicles.

										Yes, I guess I got sucked in, too. The fast talking Victor Tran promised that I would be able to see an income before the first payment was due. Well, only if you have something to auction on e-bay! Which I don't. 
The laptop which he assured me would have Vista, Quickbooks and Office 2007 on it doesn't have any of those. It is an Acer that was virtually obsolete even before it was sent. But what it does have however, that I really didn't expect, is a  TROJAN PROGRAM in it that runs in the background that will steal all of your logins and personal information! It is supposed to be upgradeable to Vista, but the upgrade period had expired before I even had the conversation! 
The gal who called to confirm that I had received the laptop and (also fast-talking) make sure that I knew what I got, would not accept the fact that I had not even looked at the laptop yet and would need to talk with her at another time. She strong armed me into accepting it and confirming that it was OK. Now that I have had a chance to check it out - it is NOT OK!!  
Everything that is included in the ""package"" is available in the internet for a fraction of the cost or free. I'd love to just get out of it and cut my losses after only the first payment. PLEASE somebody tell me how I can cancel this ""non-cancellable"" lease!!!!!!

										Yes, Our small business got duped by this company too. Grabbed 285.00 back in October, my boss asked me to call them today and tell them how unhappy we were with their services, and low and behold the phones are disconnected and website is GONE with the wind. I am going to seek other ways to hopefully get our money back. It's a shame people are so greedy, instead of just helping each other out!

										Z57 is a TOTAL RipOff!!!
I had been a loyal customer for many years... the last 2 years (2011~2012) were nightmares for me.  They are not competent to resolve IDX issues (which is the Heart of a real estate website) for 18 months!!! Each time you email, online chat, or call, they always come back with reasons to further delay to correct.  While I had more then given patience and extended time hoping they would correct the issue, I was debited $109 each single month (from credit card) for an website without the ""Heart""!!!  My countless calls, online chats, emails (I kept good threads) didn't help!!!  WORST part is I spoke to and emailed to cancel my account on 6/28/12 (cannot tolerate any more), I was still charged each month to date!!!  I kept receiving Outstanding Balance notice from Z57.  My phone call and email to Derek Farrar at Z57 explained everything and included complete email records on 11/21/12 to confirm once again with Derek that he'd make sure my account is canceled.  On 11/26/12, I received email from Nathan Corliss of Z57 confirming my account being canceled, but still keep receiving bills from Z57!!!  The UGLY part is they keep billing and accessing my credit card even after I reported unauthorized debit to my credit card company!  They are so sneaky and debited my older credit card in their records!  I had reported the incident of the unauthorized charges to my credit card company and had to close my credit card accounts to prevent Z57 from keep doing this!  Z57 is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!!  I just received a letter from Z57 today that they are sending my account to collection if I do not settle with them for the $109 balance immediately.  WTF!!!  I am reporting this to Dept. of Consumer Affairs!  DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH Z57!!!",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

St. George, Utah

										If you talk to a person on the phone after paying for a small program that costs under $100, and they tell you you need to come up with $200 to start their full marketing approach, then if you qualify they will have you talk to a more important person, who is the real salesman. That person will tell you they will take most of the burden of starting you out, but honestly, they will ruin your credit for THOUSANDS of dollars. 
They will tell you they will work with you if you can't make payments out of your new profits while you are in the program, but they will put on your credit that you owe thousands. They will call you any time when you are about to give them moneyeven on Saturdays, and then will say they are always available, but once they have your money, good luck reaching them about filling in the blanks for anything you didn't get as promised. It is hard to tell where they are based or really located, because I kept getting calls from different numbers, and when I called back the numbers that called me, then some of those appeared to be not taking calls- very suspicious. Some in Califormia, some calls from UTAH.
While I had questions that I needed to ask the person who would be providing the 'consulting/mentoring' I was told I could not talk to that person until 5 days after I committed some money to them through a credit card. However, I was told if I wanted a refund, it needed to be made within 3 days of the credit card payment, so I had no real opportunity to get my questions answered about the exact experience or financial results of the person who was giving me advice that I have already received in a 99 cent ebook! I ended up getting advice from a person who bought things at garage sales and hoped to sell them on ebay.
They also implied that their experienced experts know how to make money on things that sell on a regular basis on ebay, but when asking them, they were just guessing different things and they would pay fees when things don't sell and you can lose money if you order things for people and people want refunds as you may not be able to return some items.
So, I downloaded their software, and in the process, my computer had java script boxes appear with wanring messages, and they became more and more frequent as they slowed down my computer more and more, until 4weeks later, I needed to replace my hard drive and I lost hundreds of files and my some of my wedding pictures from last year. (My fault too for not backing all of those up.)
I can now see why they didn't want to tell me their company name until I was ready to give them my credit card information, they probably didn't want me to be able to do research online to check about other peoples experiences with them.
Avoid Impact KI     /     Impact Knowledge Institute /      Duvera Financial
and any other company that tries to get you to commit to a program that will cost more than the up front amount without providing you the company name, and the real track record of the financial results experienced by the person who is giving you the 'coaching.'
It is probably best not to let a company view all of your activity on your computer when you don't know exactly what they are doing with it.

People like David Randall Phillips of Island Media/Dolphin Bay Advertising should be in banned from doing any sort of business. There is no place for con artists like them in society. This company David Randall Phillips owns is hilarious. Trying to ban Spanish speaking people & the ability to speak Spanish and do business in the US? You gotta read this shit from his site http://acassia.org: ACASSIA is a non-profit organization that feels English is the primary language of the USA. We do not like having other languages thrust upon us in our home country. We are uniting together to make a change. We are teaming up to boycott any business in the US that allows their workers to speak any language other than English when we are in their business to spend our US dollars.

Then he’s a pirate on a radio station with bottles of booze in the pictures and seen grabbing at two women. What a fukn loser!

Baltimore, Maryland U.S.A. ",, 800-778-4018,Blue Hippo LLC Blue Hippo is a joke of a company Baltimore Maryland,"       I answered an email regarding earning money via internet.  I was telephoned by a Josh Jones and he told me about an ""exciting"" company where Pinnacle365 would set you up some Web Stores.  They had me go to my computer and see some of the options.  There were 3 options.  As I recall, if you paid $299.00 you could get X number of stores.  For $399.00 you could get more stores.  If you paid $499.00 you could get 65 stores.  They made it sound so good, and I thought it would help my income, since I take care of my elderly mother and I don't work.  Before I signed the contract, they said I could get my money refunded within 30 days.  They said I could make up to $2,000/mo or more with these store.  I foolishly signed a contract on Aug. 1, 2000.      On August 13, 2013, a man named Stan Davis called me and told me about their company and how people make money. He told me he could set me up with the website and a blog site and 2,000 contact names.  He then told me I would be set up with a website and a blog site and I would be listed on first pages of Google for my products.  I asked ""So if you set me up now, I can start making money today, He said yes.    He also told me that I would be contacted and I would have a person who would be my tutor and help me along with the computer, since I am over 60 and do not know a lot about computors.I asked about getting my money back within 30 days.  He said yes.  I was so excited and about finding a company that I could earn money with online.  The cost to me would be $2,000.  I again foolishly signed a esign contract.      I called their number 1-888-434-8490 several times and spoke with Jason Butler.  Whe Jason did not answer the phone, there was an answering machine.  No phone calls on the answering machine were not returned.  When I did talk to Jason, he said he would set up an appointment for tutoring next week.  That was his standard answer.      I started getting a really bad feeling about this so I decided to contact Pinnacle for a refund.  I did not find a physical address on either contract to send a letter to.  On the 1st contract with Josh Jones it said that a refund would be made if I contacted them in writing.  I called Jason Butler and he said he did not have an address for the Phoenix office, but I could send a letter to their office in Sseattle, WA.  I sent a certified letter to both Josh Jones and Stan Davis to 1425 Broadway, Suite 20, Seatlle, Washington 98122 on Aug. 26, 2013.  The Certified Letter to Josh Jones was signed as recieved on August 28, 2013.  The Certified Letter to Stan Davis was rejected.  I recieved that letter back.  I called their office daily for 2 weeks and then at least 4-5 times during Sept, Oct.  No one called me back.      I had paid the first contract with my debit card so I expected a refund to that debit card.  There has been no money returned on that debit card.  I called the phone number on my bank statement that we given for me to call regarding that charge and no one called me back.  I did the same with the Discover card that I paid the $2,000. with.      This company is bad news!  They need to be stopped.  They pray on the elderly and the hopeless and the unemployed who are looking for help for their income.      I hope you can help.  ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

The first time I called I was not able to activate my credi t card so I told him I would have to call back. The next day I called back to give him my debit card and was told they would not charge the 40.00 just needed to make sure card was valid. Then Joe stated hugesnet would not allow it unless I purchased the equipment. I told him I had already gone through this before and there was no problem, it was just supposed to be a 40.00 hold, he sttd they also had Exede which was far faster and all arouhd better than Hugesnet but it had a set up fee of 49.99. I told him okay and was happy to get the faster of the two. He asked for my debit number and I gave it to him, then I asked when I would have to pay again. He tried not to answer but that made me feel uncomfortable. I continued to push it until he stated it would be about 3 days after installation and it would be 60.00.  I told him I would not get paid again by then and he offered to delay installation, I told him I was working online and needed it. He stated nothing he could do.  I asked him not to charge my card and cancel the order. I asked him if they would charge it, he stated ""I don't think so, but if they do they will refund it in 7 to 14 days."" I told him I did not want to wait 14 days. I hung up with him and called my debit card, it had already been charged while we were speaking.  I called the number back and asked for a supervisor, the man stated his name was Ernie and he was the Supervisor.  I asked abut Joe and he said he worked in a different Office which I thought was strange because I had already spoken to him there twice. The call was sent to Exede and the person I spoke to was in billing, she was very good at escalated calls and calmed me down, I told her a customer has a right to recind an order and not be charged, if that is the way it is set up they by law have to let the consumer know. She said she would escalate call to her supervisor, while waiting te fcall was disconnected. Icalled back and talked to another young lady who just continued to tell me the money would be returned in 7 to 14 days, I asked her why I had to wait and she said because it takes that long. I finally requested to speak to her supervisor who would not even come t the phone. I refused to discuss it with her anymore and told her  had the right to speak to someone who migh t be able to handle i t.   she finally got a Supervisor and he was very rude, I told him as a consumer I had the right to resolve this he stated it would be 1 to 2 weeks for refund, I old him a chargeback cou7ld be done in ten minutes, he stated they did not do charge backs, they refund back on the card wi thin 7 to 10 days.   Ever heard of a chargeback???? It means you put the money back on the card, the ony reson it would take that long is if they plan to fight it, they better not I did not recieve any services and I was straight out lied to about everything from the beginning. There was no problem wi th Hugesnet Joe just got more money for signing exede customers.   I am very angry at the rude and nonchalant way I was treated and they are trying to break into the business? Not like that. If I was starting a new Company, I would want a marketing Company that was up front withs my consumers, no tone that is going to misrepresent to get people to sign up. Exede didn't seem to have a problem with this so what would they be like if I had kept them as a provider? There was no customer Service to it, I was treated like a sucker and while I had been blaming the Marketing Company I wonder if Exededid not know what was going on all along. For a new up and coming provider this will not  help you grow. I have been in Customer Service and related fields for 25 years and I have never seen a new Company come out of the door by being rude specially when their reputatoin is involved.   ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

No dice.  I then questioned Exact Data's rate of $100 append fee per 1000 records to the competitors average fee of $12 to $20 append fee per 1000 records.  2nd red flag.         He pretty much said it that's the way it is, take it or leave.  Limited skillset, lack of professionalism and poor attitude puts not just the rep but the reps company in a less than desirable light.  And to be specifically told to go to the competitor, I told him I would take his advice.  3rd red flag. So to all those inquiring about using this company, take rep/mgr Ryan Kluck’s advice and go to the competitor.  I'm pretty sure you'll be better off.     ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report ..

Ottawa, Ontario Canada ",, 613-271-8184,"Ridgegold Marketing Inc., Ridgegold Marketing Inc.-  Matt Lapierre-Executive Director RIPPED OFF-LIES, LIES, LIES,Ottawa Ontario","  In Sep. of 2009 i entered into a contract with incfortune.com I did'nt receive anything from them untill Oct of 2009 and that was a charge on my credit card of 5,ooo.oo at witch time I contacted my credit card and disputed the charges.   I then started calling Incfortune every day when someone answered I would start explaining my situation and the next thing I know my call was disconected.  I have talked with one technical support guy whom promised to give his boss the inf. that I had told him. He stated that my name is in the comp. but there was'nt a web site set up for me. I then called back the next day in wich I spoke to a gentalman that told me he was going to go over my contract and because of the website not being set up he would have to do some further investigating and would call me back. I received a letter from my Credit Card comp. in wich there was a copy of my contract and a letter from their lawyer. I called the number on the letter from their lawyer and the number is the one to Incfortune.  Even after receiving the letter I still to this day call but Still noone answere's or if they do when they are told about the circomestances I am hung up on.           This to me is by no mean's a way to run a business Im at my wit's end and would like to get my money back thank You ..    EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.

The first business ""You Get Paid Fast"", took only $28 payable by Certified Checks and Personal Money orders, so then came the ""International"" business model called ""My New Internet Business"" which was $100. Money for advertising is taken from you and then when you get leads into your new ""The Marketing Platform"", you never actually get paid. Why? Because the platform keeps expanding, morphing, and changing so that you must join ""UNDER HIM"" in the next best program such as ILN, MOBE or DPS in order to gain access into the membership area and supposedly receive commissions from the MAIN Entry Portal Business called ""The Marketing Platform"" or TMP. The problem is that you can never return back to see your stats, see who is in your downlines or check on your pay because it is all bogus. I had eight sign ups after joining the first two platforms and then spending a couple of hundred dollars to advertise in one of his Co Op's. I went through support to ask where my commissions were and they said after three inquires that they handed it over to Paul. I got NO REPLY from him. I then took matters into my own hands and emailed the sign ups I was supposed to have on my team to again get no reply from any of them. I was just about to join the DPS system which is a high ticket business through HIS TMP for $840 (which would qualify me as a Gold level member). I didn't like the method of payment and so I contacted Paul about it who of course would be more than happy to accomodate me by adding a special ""PaymentButton"" on the order page just for me so he could get paid. Then he went ahead and marked me as being paid and I was given full access to the DPS. However I never went through, I backed out, didn't join and didn't pay, yet Paul conviently added me on the Blog to share with everyone as yet another Gold member joining the DPS! If you check on the blog at ILN or softrwareresellers.internetlifestylenetwork.com/  or  facebook.com/groups/PaulDarbyTeamILN/  you will notice that every entry on FB will only show new members being added and welcomed aboard, BUT NONE OF WHICH SHARE ANY REGULAR COMMISSIONS OR EARNINGS! Is this just a  coincidence that there are these missing details? I think not. My advice: Have nothing to do with this guy or his marketing platforms. The other programs he is promoting are all great and very legitimate and profitable, but when you go in through Pauyl Darby's TMP, he will skim off your money, take your sign ups and keep you joining new programs that HE overrides all your efforts from of course. Can I prove this? No. I cannot prove it because HE controls all who enter, and what you are allowed to post. Just try to get money or talk to your sign ups in your down linre or even look at them and you may find out the hard way like I did, that this my be more difficult than you were expecting. The training he offers is old, outdated and the videos show how he doesn't want to fix the junk he puts out there. The man was a bit quirky to me at first and I was slightly amused and entertained, but I am not laughing anymore since being scammed out of all my time and money. I suppose what hurts me the most is that I trusted this man and believed he was honest and caring. Don't let this facade fool you as it has the other 80,000 on his marketing list!

You can call and leave messages or e-mail and no one will get back to me. I had several service issues where the system stopped working and I would call and leave a message about the problem and no one gets back to me. I did get ahold one time of Cary Gottlieb and he told me they would have it working the next morning. Well it was not working the next morning so I could not get any calls. Today my system is frozen and I called several times about the issue and the message was no one was available leave a call back number which I did and on one called me. What I did was call back and hit the sales option line and guess what Tim picked up the phone and I told him my system was not working and he told me he have it up in 2 hours. So if you want to get thru try the sales line that's seems to work if you have to speak to someone. Cause they are looking for your credit card Also I like to mention when the system works I get a lot of transfers where they want to be on the DNC list.

This is exactly what happened to me, don't fall for it yourself!! I was contacted by ""Steve"" from North Point Web Mall who gave me a very convincing pitch regarding an online business that was basically set up completely for me. He told me that he would do all the work, North Point Web Mall was a reputable company that has been in business for over 10 years and has very happy customers making lots of money with no time or effort involved. In order to set up this business I was told I needed to make a one time ""Setup fee"" of $99.00 and I did not need to do anything else. I would receive a refund after 30 days if I wasn't happy with the program. Also, after the first $2500.00 that I made I would get my ""Setup fee"" back. I agreed to do this and was then transferred to Patricia. She then gave me a confirmation number and verified that I would receive an email to confirm. She also gave me a toll free customer service number that I could call ""anytime to ask questions"" which of course is never answered! She set up an appointment for me to speak with a mentor and told me that I would be speaking with Gregory Samuels who would answer all my questions and explain how the whole thing worked.  On the day of my appointment, I spent about 45 minutes on the phone answering HIS questions, mostly about my economic situation...personal details about how much I have in investments (I mostly lied because I was starting to get suspicious) whether I own my home, how much I have in credit card debt and availability etc. He then told me that he had an offer to make that would create a website, start a marketing campaign which would run from 4/25/13 to 4/27/14 and would guarantee 30 thousand targeted visitors to my web site and I would get 30% commission from these sales. I was told I would make $1397.00 per month, and up to $16,765.00 per year. I was then given a lesson in wise business investing that was a waste of time. Of course the only way I could have all this set up and earning while I did nothing was to send North Point Web Mall an additional $4750.00 which I told him I did not have. He told me that I should pull this from my IRA since I have substantial investments there and the stock exchange would not get me anywhere near the return on my investment that his company could generate. He assured me ""It's your money you can do whatever you want with it, you can write off the amount at the end of the year as a business expense."" There were other promises too which put me at ease that I was making the right choice. Since I have not been happy with my IRA I decided to do this, so I got wire instructions to send them the money including the routing number for North Lake Consulting LLC. I was to wire this amount to them through a Wells Fargo bank account (funny how that bank seems to come up a lot with these scams.....?) I spoke with Amy the next day to let her know I had started the process and would be sending a Wire Transfer of the funds the next day. I insisted that she send me an email stating exactly what I would be paying for which, amazingly, she did. This step convinced me that I had something legitamate. A few days later I got my check from my IRA and attempted to wire the funds to them. My credit union contacted me to say that the routing number was not correct. I called North Point Web Mall, after several attempts, I finally reached the infamous Amy in customer service. I told her that the routing number was incorrect, she made a couple snide comments to me ""When I spoke to you before I told you the routing number had changed, don't you remember that?"" of course I believe she had her clients confused because that conversation never occurred. I got the correct number and sent the funds believing that it was just a bad day for her.  On May 6th I recieved 3 checks totalling $524.99 and thought I was really onto something here. Of course 2 days later I got the infamous call from Gregory Samuels asking for the remaining $7500.00 which would then put me in the ""Elite Category"" and result in an opportunity to make far more money than my other campaign. When I told him I wanted to think on it a day he agreed to call me back the next day, we set up an appointment time, which he missed. I started the process again but then I thought about how much I would be losing if I didn't make more than the original 3 checks and I stopped buying into it.  When I have attempted to contact this company they NEVER return phone calls or emails. That to me is a HUGE red flag. I have been waiting for a response to some simple questions for over a week now and that got me interested in investigating further. Now I see these people are doing this to a lot of other people, perhaps its time we fight back huh? I will be pursuing this to the best of my abilities, I don't have 4K to lose and I doubt anyone else does either.  NORTH POINT WEB MALL IS A HUGE FRAUD, DON'T BELIEVE THE PROMISES, THEY LIE!!!!   ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0
 Purity Products ,"  Purity Products  200 Terminal Drive 
Plainview, New York U.S.A. ",, 888-769-7873,Purity Products  behaves like a Charlatan Plainview New York," About 10 years ago I ordered a program from Anthony Morrison about making money on-line. I don't remember the name of the specific program, but when I bought it I was offered unlimited consultation by his company for a monthly fee. I turned the consultation offer down. 
I decided the program was not for me,  and never thought about it again until 7 months later when I found a charge on my bank statement from his company. Going through my past statements I found that I had been charged $29.00 a month for consultation services since I bought the program.  I called and was able to talk to someone, who in effect told me ""Too bad-you must have signed up for the program, or we wouldn't be charging you.""  I did not get any money back or any satisfaction. 
Then a year ago, my husband, not remembering the name Anthony Morrison, ordered his program""Advertising Profits From Home"", along with the unlimited consultation service.  He (my husband) was then hurt in an accident and unable to use the program, so called and cancelled the consultation portion of the program.  Now he finds that he has been charged each month the same $29.00 fee for the program he cancelled.
It is obviously careless of both of us not to keep up with our bank statements, and we have both learned our lesson.  I have no idea if Mr Morrison's programs work or not, but I do know that he makes a practice of deducting money from your bank account without authorization once he gets the information he needs to do so. My husband also has not been able to get any money back.
EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E. According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: “we could not do anything for you” or “you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days”. If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent! DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get. And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state. Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here. Remember… Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck… Let us know how you do!

I have paid ABT Media and Marketing over $8500.00 in the last year for services that were not fulfilled. I had them build a website which STILL ranks as one of the lowest rankings in the industry in Florida! I also had them optimize my other website at $800 per month, which was poorly administered. They even forgot several services including a social media optimizing! I had to call them 3 months after to ask them about it, and they stated that they forgot to include that, however, they DID NOT forget to charge me for it! Their reporting is on an email format similar to this: photo booth ....8 down -2 photo booth rentals....13 up +1.... EVERY month I had to call and remind them to send me a report! They forget to send them! REALLY?!!!! The company I am with now sends me bi-monthly reports and they are an 11 page attachment with graphs, stats, rankings..... I'm a little concerned for Chris, the owner, because she forgets a lot! My mother had alzheimer's and I can sense a little of that. When I switched to ABT from another SEO company that optimizes Websites, my site was ranking number 3 for the key words, ""photo booth rental(s)"" when I left ABT last month, my company is not even showing up on the 4th page for ""photo booth rentals"" and I have fallen to number 9 for ""photo booth rental."" I really think Chris ""forgot"" to optimize my website every day. Now she is claiming that I owe her for a month of service (8-1 to 9-1) when my month has ALWAYS started on the 17th. I have records to show this. She ""forgot"" again and said that my month started on the 1st and therefore owe a month of service that was never provided! I have also caught her in another lie from an email I retrieved from my cousin who also uses her services (not for much longer though). In it she states on Aug. 10th ""FOR THE RECORD, we did not do ANY website work for him."" But now she wants payment for ""services"" from 8-1-8-3!  Please do not ever use this comapny for SEO services. You will not get the results you are looking for! They always come up with an excuse as to why your site is low in rankings! It would be similar to staying with a personal trainer for years while only getting fatter!

Wouldn't return calls left me hanging out to dry Las Vegas Nevada"," After being a customer over with this Company for over 2 years, we decided to try their ""New enhanced service"" to hopefully find out what we were missing (consumer/ business email contact lists). Please keep in mind that my staff had received calls to upgrade for the past year and finally I agreed to see what we were missing! I decided Rather than upgrade our classic (""UNLIMITED"" business account, that we would simply try the risk free option of starting another account (perfectly legit and approved by Infofree) through me personally and through my personal credit card. I signed up and ??? There was absolutely NO DIFFERECE in the sampling of 20 total leads!! The only difference was that with the new service we would only get 200 per month from our $50 a month fee! So i called to cancel and I spoke to the lady who's voice is on the prompt, she was very nice and explained to me that she could turn us off but we should try the unlimited background checks? I agreed and after the month decided to canel and stay with the 1 classic account. THAT IS WHEN THIS COMPANY SHOWED THEIR TRUE COLORS. First- When trying to cancel over the phone it goes to a voicemail. SECOND- They will not call you back. THIRD- They immediatelly went to the terms of service.  Here's my problem! 1) There is absolutely - NO Difference in the leads that I recieved from my classic plan versus the new plan and that is my beef with this company! They seemed to be more interested in being right about us Downloading the  leads to compare than their employees misrepresentation of what we were told we would recieve!  2)They Advertise a 30 day Money back Guarantee with No Indicator that there are Terms That apply or need to be referenced! In addition they have positioned the main page to not show the Terms unless you scroll down the page.  3)They have known of this manipulative marketing tactic since 2012 and have done nothing to resolve the problem for the consumer and I have also addressed the US Attorney Generals office to look into how many other customers have had this same issue. 4) Either way, I purchased the service in good faith and by being bamboozeled by their staff that their new leads were different then their old classic plan and that is not the truth! After all this we went into our Classic plan and they disconnected us even though we had seperate everything and never had a problem with this account nor service!! We have yet to recieve a refund for them turning off our old account prior to our month being up??

I said I cannot afford that and he suggested I put it on my credit card like most people do.

Here is yet another album they are ripping me off for.  only one of hundreds.  CD Baby is a TOTAL rip off scam company  HERE IS THE PROOF.  at what point is it no-longer considered a glitch, how many albums? how much money? before you say ok this os NOT an accident this is obviously some foul play going on here.  by my calculations, 80% of all payments or more, get glitched out of my account.  when i proved it once, they just told me; to bad.  then they changed the web site so it could no longer be proved by taking a screen shot of your accounting, now the accounting is totally locked out.  THIS ALBUM IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE FORE SALE AS DIGITAL DOWNLOADS, YET HERE IT IS COMPLETE WITH A CDBABY STAMP AS THE SOURCE.  and they never paid me a penny, its been like that for at least 7 years. ( with hundreds of albums)  cd baby has kept me a a virtual salve making music for them in hopes of earning more while they shave my payments off the top.  once a guy told me if you want to get paid more then make more music, and every time i do they just rip me off for it.

The next day, I called back and wanted out.  I had second thoughts but Bill Isska (Developing Manager of E M Business Connections) talked me out of cancelling the deal. He assured me that they were a legimate business. This then lead to an additional $20,000 for business leads from a bank to get my business started. A week later, Dave Marsh called me with news that my $20,000 had been reduced to $10,500 because the bank had negotiated a lower price with someone else and would extend that price with me.  I was thrilled that my debt is now reduced by $9,500. I was told to call Dave Marsh every two weeks for a status update every Wednesday begiinning of May 29th, 2013.  I never was able to contact Dave Marsh because the phone number that I called (866-964-5694) always said he was available at the time and to try again later.  I been trying for 3 months and get the same message.   While this was going on I was contacted by Scott Parker (646-350-0820 for the Business Development Center) who talked about building corporate credit.  Then a Jarrett (800-715-1772) a Credit Specialist called from Business Solutions Online Inc. talking about developing my business online website.  I brieifly worked with a Lauren from Customer Service from Business Solutions Online Inc. for my capture page on my website.  I paid another $10,000 to develop a website, banner ads, facebook, and twitter account for my business.  During this time, I am still thinking that this is all legimate because of all the calls I received by none from Bill Isska or Dave Marsh. The calls keep coming.  I am now to take a online course on Corporate Credit for a business that really doesn't exist except in name only.  E M Business Connections has lead down a path a financial ruin with no real means of making any money.  I have a federal EIN number as a Merchant Agent but no contacts, no equipment to sale, etc.  I would like to sue E M Business  Connections but have no way contacting them.

Unfortunately we did not know this before we hired them and only learnt the hard way that they can best be described as a bunch of fumbling amateurs when it comes to SEO and a complete liability when it comes to PR. The Enroute Communications scam is based on the fact that they advertise services that they cannot fulfil and end up doing more harm than good. Enroute Communications posted a rebuttal against a group who have been seriously damaging our brand image. Except they made critical errors with the first paragraph and were completely shot down within hours, which led to Enroute Communications panicing and withdrawing the rebuttal, which only damaged our credability further as they were representing us.

I used to be employed of this company. I want to apologies to any of the customers I have signed up, thinking I was going to help them to have better internet presence for their business. When I first started there. Ryan was the owner & Krista Koka was his accountant& King Wells was the CFO. They helped Ryan out in the back office. Within a week or two. Krista & King Started taking Ryan to Hooter's (this is next door to Click Media at the time). To get him Drunk. Krista & King would tell all the employee's that Ryan was spending all the money from the new accounts & that they had no money to pay the employee's. Krista & King would make them self’s appearing as the hero's at the time. Once Krista & King, where able to steal the company away from Ryan & buy all the accounts that Click Media had. Krista was now the new owner & changed the name to Grand Placements Services G{P}A. She then had me go into the back office to try to get Click Media account to sign a new agreement for Grand Placements. That way when their billing would be due they would have to pay Grand Placements any money that would be due. If the customer would not sign, than they would not do any business for them. They would say they could not help them since she was not a part of Click Media. All though the only change that was made was Ryan leaving and the change of the name. ending my time their everything stayed the same instead of Ryan spending the money we watched Krista and king shop, purchase a new car, move into a new house and yet on pay day they never had pay roll for their employees claiming Ryan was hacking the accounts and calling all of our customers and getting them to cancel. Needless to say I and 3 other employees with family couldn’t continue to work without pay had to resign. When we had returned for our last paycheck they did they not pay any of us, and now claim that they are suing each and every one of us for our old accounts who have cancelled. The reason for this message… I don’t want to see them steal anymore money from both hard working business owners and employees trying to make a living to support themselves and their families. If you are looking to do business with grand placements services or be employed by them take a few minutes and do a little Research on them to make a sound decision, hopefully I have helped you………….   ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

Cape Coral Or New York?? Florida or New York"," Here is the truth about ZipNadaZilch  AKA ZNZ.  No punches held.ZNZ is a company in the Houston TX area which offers individuals the chance to share in what's called affiliate marketing commissions.  One way online businesses make money is to pay commissions out to people or companies that drive new customers to their website and perform some type of interested customer action.
An interested customer action can be anything from registering with the website to beginning a trial with a product or service to a paid membership.  The commissions paid out by these online businesses, range from $5 to $50.ZNZ shares this commission with you when you help them get a referral.  If you refer someone to their website and that person signs-up with the referral code you gave them and finishes enough offers to satisfy ZNZ, you get paid.
An offer is one business which your referral agrees to try.  Most of your referrals will have to complete  4 to 6 offers on the average to satisfy ZNZ.  The $60 site requires 6 to 10 offers.
How do you get people to use your referral code, thereby getting you paid.  Well, it is mostly accomplished through freebie websites like ""Anything4Free"" which happens to be the biggest and best-est freebie forum.
It is called freebie trading.  Traders will pay to have newbies use their referral codes.  The traders will share a part of their payment from ZNZ to the newbie.  Some pay low and some pay almost all of the payment because they are entered into contests which pay decent money.
Another way is to post one's referral link all over the internet.
And yet another method is to sign-up with the Internet Money Machine which is approved my ZNZ though ZNZ doesn't have any association with IMM or support it internally.Now for the bad......  
75% of the companies listed on ZNZ's website, do business in an unethical manner and are set-up to profit from human error.  These are all the late night infomercial companies hawking weight loss and beauty products.   
Or credit monitoring companies offering free trials, hoping you forget to cancel so they can bill you.  There are some good ones like Netflix, Gamefly and some of the book clubs but overall the products and services are way overpriced junk. 
These companies have done the numbers and know that a certain amount of people will forget to cancel, therefore allowing them to charge those outrageous fees.  
For example, if someone forgets to cancel their Hydroxatone order, they will be billed over $150 for 2, 2 oz's or two tiny little jars of face cream.  And the orders will keep coming until the poor soul cancels.Further problems......
Due to some people taking advantage of the system, ZNZ has had to clamp down on certain things.  They are really on a no gift or prepaid card campaign. 
 See, ZNZ knows that people have gotten around the system with prepaid and gift cards.  People basically would order a trial. get paid and say ""screw you"" to the trials.  They were fine with this until they started losing to many commissions.
So if ZNZ thinks someone is using a prep-paid card they will ban them.  The companies are adjusting their payment software to bounce out payments from these type of cards as well.  I'm not so sure this is legal though.  Companies are not supposed to deny product or service based on payment method.
The other concern is what ZNZ does with commissions from banned people.  If they keep those commissions, isn't that just as bad as the person who got them under false pretense or broken rules?  It may be criminal if ZNZ is targeting certain people for the purpose of keeping monies.
To recoup losses ZNZ has greatly increased their identity checks and enforcement of rules.  They have also had to lower their offer percentages.  What used to pay 35% is now paying 25% and they cost more.Are the offers free......
Not anymore folks.  Well there are still a couple but for the most part, each offer costs from $3 to $10.  It will cost about $20 to $30 for each referral link now compared to Free to $7 last year.  Final Thoughts.........
ZNZ has fallen from grace in the past year or two.  Not all their fault as they deal in a poorly premised business theory.  Pay someone to try your product.  If I pay you $10 to try my service for free for a month, how many people will be drawn to you for the service or for the money?

Ottawa, Ontario Canada ",, 613-2718184,Ridgegold Marketing Inc - Matt Lapierre - Executive Director !!!WARNING POSSIBLE SCAM!!! - STAY WELL CLEAR OF THIS COMPANY - Ottawa Ontario Canada," Here is the truth about ZipNadaZilch  AKA ZNZ.  No punches held.ZNZ is a company in the Houston TX area which offers individuals the chance to share in what's called affiliate marketing commissions.  One way online businesses make money is to pay commissions out to people or companies that drive new customers to their website and perform some type of interested customer action.
An interested customer action can be anything from registering with the website to beginning a trial with a product or service to a paid membership.  The commissions paid out by these online businesses, range from $5 to $50.ZNZ shares this commission with you when you help them get a referral.  If you refer someone to their website and that person signs-up with the referral code you gave them and finishes enough offers to satisfy ZNZ, you get paid.
An offer is one business which your referral agrees to try.  Most of your referrals will have to complete  4 to 6 offers on the average to satisfy ZNZ.  The $60 site requires 6 to 10 offers.
How do you get people to use your referral code, thereby getting you paid.  Well, it is mostly accomplished through freebie websites like ""Anything4Free"" which happens to be the biggest and best-est freebie forum.
It is called freebie trading.  Traders will pay to have newbies use their referral codes.  The traders will share a part of their payment from ZNZ to the newbie.  Some pay low and some pay almost all of the payment because they are entered into contests which pay decent money.
Another way is to post one's referral link all over the internet.
And yet another method is to sign-up with the Internet Money Machine which is approved my ZNZ though ZNZ doesn't have any association with IMM or support it internally.Now for the bad......  
75% of the companies listed on ZNZ's website, do business in an unethical manner and are set-up to profit from human error.  These are all the late night infomercial companies hawking weight loss and beauty products.   
Or credit monitoring companies offering free trials, hoping you forget to cancel so they can bill you.  There are some good ones like Netflix, Gamefly and some of the book clubs but overall the products and services are way overpriced junk. 
These companies have done the numbers and know that a certain amount of people will forget to cancel, therefore allowing them to charge those outrageous fees.  
For example, if someone forgets to cancel their Hydroxatone order, they will be billed over $150 for 2, 2 oz's or two tiny little jars of face cream.  And the orders will keep coming until the poor soul cancels.Further problems......
Due to some people taking advantage of the system, ZNZ has had to clamp down on certain things.  They are really on a no gift or prepaid card campaign. 
 See, ZNZ knows that people have gotten around the system with prepaid and gift cards.  People basically would order a trial. get paid and say ""screw you"" to the trials.  They were fine with this until they started losing to many commissions.
So if ZNZ thinks someone is using a prep-paid card they will ban them.  The companies are adjusting their payment software to bounce out payments from these type of cards as well.  I'm not so sure this is legal though.  Companies are not supposed to deny product or service based on payment method.
The other concern is what ZNZ does with commissions from banned people.  If they keep those commissions, isn't that just as bad as the person who got them under false pretense or broken rules?  It may be criminal if ZNZ is targeting certain people for the purpose of keeping monies.
To recoup losses ZNZ has greatly increased their identity checks and enforcement of rules.  They have also had to lower their offer percentages.  What used to pay 35% is now paying 25% and they cost more.Are the offers free......
Not anymore folks.  Well there are still a couple but for the most part, each offer costs from $3 to $10.  It will cost about $20 to $30 for each referral link now compared to Free to $7 last year.  Final Thoughts.........
ZNZ has fallen from grace in the past year or two.  Not all their fault as they deal in a poorly premised business theory.  Pay someone to try your product.  If I pay you $10 to try my service for free for a month, how many people will be drawn to you for the service or for the money?
There are other companies out there which one should research and I highly advise until the heat comes of ZNZ.									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

Colorado Springs, Colorado U.S.A. ",, 719-444-1153,Dex ONline Media Renewing Contract after being told on phone not to Colorado Springs Colorado," Here's what TIO and WWM did to me.First, I purchased a personal website from a company called Triple Income Opportunity, www.tripleio.com , also known as National Opportunities, for $99.99 from Connie Ligas with a promise to make good money on commission. This was purchased on a different credit card, and is also in dispute. This purchase came with an unconditional 30 day money back guarantee and a company called World Wide Marketing was recommended to me as a marketing company. I was also promised that I would not be charged further. Literally overnight, a website called www.7008.tripleio.com became available to me. This site is identical to www.tripleio.com, and I believed this to be a holding place while my personal site was being constructed. A few days later John Collins of World Wide Marketing contacted me and convinced me to purchase marketing from their company since they knew the business so well, and another marketing company must be approved by Triple Income Opportunity if I chose another firm. This also came with a money back guarantee. All communication up to this point has been verbal. A few days later, Jack McKenzie of World Wide marketing contacted me about a website name. I chose www.riversidesuperstore.com as a name. The next day, I input my website name into a browser. Immediately, the name was redirected to www.7008.tripleio.com . This site is identical to www.tripleio.com. There is no mention of riversidesuperstore.com, not even in the address field. So, in essence www.riversidesuperstore.com = www.7008.triplio.com = www.triplio.com If I type www.riversidesuperstore.com into a browser address field, a redirect occurs, and www.7008.tripleio.com shows in the address field. Again, the content of all 3 addresses is identical. I called and requested a refund, as had been verbally promised, and termination of my membership from National Opportunities. They indicated that since I had purchased marketing from World Wide Marketing, I had to first get a refund from World Wide Marketing. I called World Wide Marketing and requested a refund from marketing. They stated that I was ineligible for a refund since my marketing was already in place. I asked for details and was told that my site had been included in www.msn.com , www.facebook.com and various other sources. The support representative quickly became belligerent, verbally abusive and hostile. I also spoke with John Collins who was also abusive and hostile, and resorted to name calling and belittling language. He offered no techniques to verify that marketing was in place Finally, I searched facebook and msn specifically for my domain name, and no results for the www.riversidesuperstore.com were found. Searches for some of the products offered (AT&T, Apple Computers, etc) also did not produce results. Google and Yahoo also did not produce results. World Wide Marketing has also failed to deliver a television commercial on DVD. Finally, I am trying to locate an independent 3rd party to offer an opinion. I believe, however, that National Opportunities and World Wide Marketing are possibly the same company. The phone number for National Opportunities is 888-278-0065. John Collinss voicemail directs calls to 888-278-0065 for customer support. I dont know if what they are doing is legal, but they are certainly operating a very elaborate scam. At any rate, both companies have violated a money back guarantee, however, I realize that this specific complaint is with World Wide Marketing. My total loss so far is $6100.00.

They offered me a competitive salary, and I was beyond qualified for the position. As they trained me, I learned many “dirty little secrets” about the company. Fity Social Media is as fraudulent as they come, in order to inflate social media subscribers (facbook likes, twitter followers, etc.), they use some kid off of hackforums. While their advertising suggests these are 100% organic, what I saw first hand is the opposite. The team purchases 95-99% of these from automated “bots”, for cheap cheap prices I might add, many being for a “vouch” on the community they purchase from. While their entire business is fraudulent, they are also just plain grotesque people. Grant Cooper took me out for a drink shortly after I was hired. I drank on his dime, while he pushed me to drink more and more. Eventually, I'd gotten so intoxicated, I could barely walk straight. Grant was also heavily intoxicated. He forced me into his car, and drove while heavily intoxicated, stating “it's no biggie, I do this all the time!”. Grant took me to a motel and took me into it, the place was roach infested, and smelled of lost dreams and sex trafficking. He caressed me and kissed my neck, before forcing me to take my pants off. He felated me, and bent me over to sodomize me. I was too drunk to protest, as I lay there lifeless, being violated by this sick s.o.b. Grant proceeded to beat me, the next day I came to the office and was told I'd been terminated. I took to exposing grant, but he showed up at my home with a hand gun, and threatened to kill my family if I spoke. I am too afraid to go to the authorities, and have moved to another state, and am currently attending therapy to get over him violating me. Do not work with them. ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E. According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent! DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get. And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state. Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here. Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report ..

I did these sites around 5 years ago and had no issues. However I decided to complete the yourfreexbxoone.com site and it had been nothing but a nightmare. I completed an offer and got 12 other referrals to do so as well no problem. Of course this went smoothly, the part that benefits their company. After that it all went downhill. I placed my order Dec 19th 2013 and waited and waited... no shipment. After waiting around until Jan 5th 2014 I sent a support ticket to see what was causing the delay. Seven days later I received a response *note their site says 2-3 days for a response* saying they were out of stock over the holidays and have since gotten the item back in stock and would ship soon. After waiting another 12 days and no shipment I sent a support ticket on Jan 17th asking when it would be shipped. That support ticket never got a response, but they finally marked it as shipped Jan 31st 19 days later and with no tracking number.  They claim orders should arrive within 10 business days of being marked as shipped. HA! So I wait and come Feb 11th I send them yet another support ticket to try and get a tracking number or update on the order. I waited for 20 days to get a response this time (remember they say 2-3 days for responses).  All their reply said was quote, ""I apologize for the delay in your order being fulfilled. Please allow me to check into your order further and we will contact you via this ticket with additional information."" Never heard back from them…  One more week goes by and finally March 10th they change the status to shipping soon and then marked as shipped March 11th. Awesome, so they figured out what was wrong and reshipped it. NOPE. Again it has now been 17 days since marked as shipped the second time and still nothing. I’ve had support tickets and the last I’ve heard from their end March 3rd with the above quote. ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

I contacted the company and they advised I had to return the product for a refund. I mailed both of the new products back to them and waited for my refund. When I contacted them because they had not refunded my $175.34. They informed me that I could only recieve a refund for one of the products because I was past the point of returning one of the products for a credit, even though they came in the same envelope. I asked that they send me my refund of the one product! That was back in April. It is now September. I have had to call repeatedly. They are now informing me that there is a problem with their system and they will refund me my money whenever they get it fixed!

McDONOUGH Georgia," I have been a dedicated, loyal hard worker of this company for many years. I worked for them many years and never once had any complaints. Several months ago I got an email stating in order to stay with them I must earn over $1,000 per month. So, I focused on making them as much money as possible. Working day and night to make sure I was making over the $1,000 mark and neglecting other honest networks I am with just so I could make Adknowledge the money they needed. I started making around $2K - $5K per month for them. Still no complaints. I never got any bad emails or notices or anything. Of course, any time I had a question or problem I wouldn't get a response either. Well, out of the blue yesterday I get an email that I was being terminated and that I wasn't going to get paid what I earned. I had earned $2,888 for this month so far and my goal was to make at least $4,500 or more. They gave me no reason as to why I was being terminated. I emailed them, I send info to other members of their team, filled out contact forms etc and nothing. They wouldn't even say why. Under their own rules you have to get a few warnings or more to get terminated. So basically what they did was lured me in by promising to keep me employed as long as I made over $1,000 per month then when I started making $4,000 - 5K per month they terminate me and keep the money. I read all their rules and their own rules even say you have to have a few warnings just to be put on temporary leave. I have never got a warning, a complaint, a bad word anything. I followed all rules and guidelines and stayed with them because I was basically guaranteed a spot as long as I made them enough money. They owe me $2,888 for what I earned. I actually should get more because of the stress and hardship it has caused me. I am a single Mom and that was my full time job. Companies like this do not belong on the internet. They have lousy communication. Their operation does not run smoothly like other networks. If you need any kind of help you are on your own. Thank God there are honest companies I can fall back on that do communicate and don't lie to you or take your money. I just hope they get shut down before they do this to other innocent hard working affiliates. I informed them after they did this to me and refuses to answer that I would report them. I just want the $2,888 that I earned then want nothing to do with them. There has to be someone who can investiage them. I have done internet marketing for 10 years and have never been treated like this. I have seen scam companies like this come and go.   ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

My emails are ignored Cleveland Stockton-on-Tees United Kingdom," I purchased exclusive life leads from iLeads via Erik Tyndall. It took two calls for Erik to set up my account. I set my range from ages 40-60 in two counties in Illinois. The first lead I received was outside of my age range. A week later I received a lead that met my criteria. After contacting my account executive with concerns that the leads were not coming quickly enough he gave me options to expand my territory. I did not agree but several days later I received 2 leads that were outside the selected counties; in defiance of my express wishes he expanded my lead area. I spent more time on the phone and drafting emails than contacting my prospect. I asked for a refund of my remaining leads as I lost trust and faith that I would be delivered what I paid for. I was informed by VP of Sales Robert Gregory that I would not receive a refund, that my options were to expand my territory, expand my age range or get semi-exclusive leads. He also stated that when buying exclusive life leads many of iLeads clients have a territory of an entire state, which I certainly was not told adn would have have altered my approach. He regretted that I was not told. This experience does not reflect the quality of the leads, as a veteran life lead purchaser I know it can be difficult to get quality leads, rather this serves as an educational tool for others to make informed decisions. In an environment where one has dozens of lead options, customer service really sets a company apart and I believe the difficulty I've had with iLeads needs to be shared.   ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

Simi Valley, California U.S.A. ",, 805-578-5500,Smc what they can get away with Simi Valley California," I purchased two separate computers from Dell about six months apart. Both purchases qualified for a financing program which advertised 0% interest for 12 months. I received a regular monthly statement from Dell Financial Services (DFS). In that statement I was billed for the second purchase which I would not receive until the subsequent billing period. If this limited experience is any indication, Dell prematurely recognizes sales and is overstating income. If this is a widespread policy, Dells quarterly filings to regulators and shareholders are inaccurate. I am certain that Dells accounting and audit departments are familiar with GAAP revenue recognition principles (SFAC 5, Recognition and measurement of in Financial Statements of Business Enterprises) and a disregard for such basic rules is alarming. In my particular case the effect was to overstate my balance, overstate my payment due and, as I have an automatic payment in place which did not take into account the premature charge, an underpayment penalty assessed to my account. Since the penalty is based on a policy that violates GAAP rules, the assessment and booking of penalties additionally overstates income and receivables. This prompted me to look closer at my subsequent statements. I next noted that even though I paid more than my minimum balance (calculating the amount to payoff in 12 months), the excess over the minimum was not applied to the earliest purchase, or FIFO, as set forth under IRC Sec. 453 regulating Installment Sales. Each statement reads payments are applied first to minimum required payments with excess to credit plans in order of promotion expiration date. I called DFS and was assured that FIFO was applied but I made the calculations and in fact I could see this representation was inaccurate. The same statement also reads To avoid deferred finance charges, pay the new plan balance by the promotion expiration date. The promotion date may differ from your payment due date. I received my earliest purchase in the billing cycle ended 05/13/08 and a first payment is due on or around 06/13/08. Since Dell did not apply FIFO to my two balances as requested, and did not provide an accurate statement which showed the correct remaining balances, a balance of approximately $75.19 remained on my earliest account as of 05/13/09. Since this was deemed not paid within the 12 month interest free period the entire deferred interest charge was applied. I immediately paid the entire balance of $1,211.39, less $90.83 of deferred interest, and closed my account. I spoke with a Dell Financial Services representative who explained that interest free for 12 months means that if the balance is not paid off within 12 months the entire deferred interest is charged. I assured Dell that this was not my understanding of the term, and while I am certain that Dell can direct my attention to the fine print, the plan was represented as interest free for 12 months and every monthly statement still labels the purchase plan as NO INT 12MOS. Dell continues to send letters and phone my home attempting to collect the deferred interest plus additional late penalties. I always identify myself by name and ask the representative if they have read any of my earlier correspondence. The Dell representative is always stuck, because before they can speak, the Dell representative wants me it identify myself through additional personal information. I repsond back that it is Dell calling me and I should be the one to ask for proper identification. To date there is the original $90.83 of deferred interest and $105.00 of late assessments on my account and Dell is threatening to put my account in default and notify the credit reporting services. Fortunately, I am completely debt free, employed and a homeowner, so Dell\'s threats have little impact, but I notified my employer\'s Employee Purchase Program and requested that Dell be removed as a preferred provider.All of the above occurred before I went online and made a search for other ""complaints"". I was shocked to learn the extent of Dell's abusive practices, the number of lawsuits, and the numerous settlements in favor of the consumer most recently by the Attorney General's of NY in September 2009 and 34 state's Attorney General's in January 2009.It appears at every level Dell, Inc. is engaged in questionable accounting practices; improper revenue recognition, assessment and billing of fees not supported by the underlying transactions, improper allocation of excess payments in contradiction to the plain language on the billing notice, and finally, deceptive names used to describe finance programs. If in the public market Dell, Inc. seeks me as either a customer or as investor I expect transparent accounting and fair business practices.  ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

Loveland Colorodo," I received a phone call from this company with an offer of a 30-day free trial for providing a zip code based, rotation of my company listing (website?) thru top positions on several search engines. The woman told me that she was calling from a suburb geographically adjacent to my hometown, but didnt know where my hometown was or how to spell it, so was obviously lying. She promised to send me paperwork confirming our agreement, which I never received. If she told me when the trial would start, I did not write it down, thinking that it would be on the paperwork. While she told me that I would be charged $49.95 per month after the trial period, I did not think that it would start automatically after the trial period, because I never gave her a credit card number. She did not tell me that I would be billed through my telephone bill. IF she told me that I needed to cancel (I dont remember), I thought that it would all be included in the paperwork that she would be sending and that I would be able to review it.A man from the company called to confirm some days later. I told him that I had not received any paperwork, and he said that he would have it sent. I also told him that I wanted to include additional zip codes, and he said that he would have a sales rep call me that afternoon. He did give me the customer service number--the first time I was given some way to contact them. When I received no call from a sales rep, I called customer service. The woman who answered also said that she would send paperwork. Still no call or paperwork arrived. I assumed that the trial period would not start until they could provide the zip codes that I wanted.Probably 3 weeks or more later, I got a sales promo piece in the mail. Although personalized as if done in a mail merge, it had no details of our agreement: no website of mine to be listed, no zip codes where the service was to appear, no dates of trial period, etc. I have no way to confirm whether this service was ever provided. I always ask my prospective clients how they heard about me, and no one ever mentioned seeing me on an internet search. (And yes, I realize that there are no guarantees of clients.)When I called my local phone company about the billing (since the name on the bill was not ZipWeb, but ZlocalHost) and was patched thru to ZipWeb, Christine supposedly cancelled my ongoing subscription. When I asked about being credited for the first month, she told me that my local phone company had already credited my bill for $49.95. This was another lie, because they cannot credit my bill for a third-party billing. The phone company rep confirmed that after Christine hung up. When I called ZipWeb directly, I got Christine again. She put another drone on the phone who was supposedly a supervisor. He was very rude and said that he would not respond to my idle threats to report them for their shady practices. He said that the service was provided and that I was informed of their cancellation policy, so they would not be applying a credit. He ignored my declaration that no paperwork had been received after 3 different people made promises to send it.At best, ZipWeb is guilty of misleading clients, lying, and other unethical practices. And at worst, this is a total scam with no service provided. I will also be following up with my phone company as to how a 3rd party could bill me without any confirmation from me.Barbara Arvada, ColoradoU.S.A. ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

The credit card rep. explained that I would have to take it up with Visa, which I did immeadiatly I got off the phone. I contacted Visa several times over the past two weeks and have been on hold with them at this point for over an hour so far. I put my phone on hands free & started checking easykits on the web. I found this web site so decided to add my complaint whill I waited for Visa. Back to the story, I called the number supplied by Visa for easykits and spoke to an operater. I was told that I had just 3 days after joining their membership before I was charged their monthly rate of $86.00US. I was told that this was clearly marked on the membership application. I am a careful consumer and read not only what is written but what might be implied and that statement was not on the form. After a spirited conversation I was told that I would be able to get a partial refund which I immeadiatly agreed to. A refund of of less than half the ""unauthorixed""fee charged has now been applied to my account. Again I followed up with Visa to try and get Visa to credit me the rest of the charge. Visa said (again) that I would have to get the refund from SMARTWEBCONTENT and suggested that she set up a 3 way phone conversation with the company, which she did. The person on the company phone told me that by accepting the partial refund makes it impossible for me to get a full refund. She said I would have been told that by their rep. at that time. This was anothe false statement & when I told the rep that she said she would escalate my complaint to the next level and I should receive an email (to my email address that they previously told me was invalid) within 24hrs. The Visa agent was still on the line and I commented ""lets see if that happens"". That was 5 days ago and the reason I am now on hold to Visa again.

Please be careful do not give these people any information! EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.

I received my CD via First Class Mail on 9-14-09.  I was charged  $69.97 on 9-15-09!  I had no free trial to speak of.  I received the outer envelope, the CD in a plain envelope, a Welcome card, and a Notice that if any charges are disputed with my bank against this account, that I will be blacklisted on the BadCustomer.com website. That was it.  No mention of any $69.97 fee.  I called 1-877-361-8622.  The girl that I was talking to was very difficult to understand.  They are obviously brainwashed into talking consumers into keeping their ""package"".   I must have repeated that I wanted a refund and the confirmation number for that refund at least 6 times. I was told that it would take 3-5 days to receive that refund.   I find it amazing that they can charge the unsuspecting consumer so quickly, I had the CD one day.  Even if I wanted to use it, I am so sickened about their deceptive practices, that I cancelled right away.

I signed up with them in February, 2009. At the time Rob knew I was very sick. I was paralyzed. Rob talked to me at length about this, even telling me that his brother was a paraplegic. At the time I signed up, Rob knew I had contracted a terrible infection in my back (MRSA). He knew I was going into the hospital for a very long time, six months as it turned out. Since then I have spent a total of 13 of the last 18 months in various hospitals.He stated that he had a new program that he could only offer to one person that year. I expressed at great length my financial situation, especially the need for new medical equipment and the fact that I could no longer work. I also told him that I had talked with other ""coahes"" at Push Traffic and did not feel comfortable with them. Finally, I told him that I did not think I could do very much if any of the work required to make the program work.After all of that, Rob assured me that he would do the work for me as a personal favor. He said that we had built a bond (remember we talked several times) especiallyin view of his brother's paralysis. He assurred me that he would build the site and market it and I could phase in as my health allowed. Rob promissed me that if I did not begin to make money in three to four weeks, he would refund all of my money.The fee was to be $20,000. This was all the savings I had left. I told him I could give him $15,000 now and the rest when a loan from my brother came. He agreed. I asked and he put all of our agreement in writing. I gave him my credit card.That night, I suffered a heart attack and was rushed to the hospital. My wife wrote to him in the intensive care room and Rob made the same promises to her. I got home from the hospital two weeks later. I saw my credit card bill and saw that Rob had charged it the whole $20,000. I called American Express and tried to stop the charge. They said i was too late. I called Push Traffic and was told that Rob was unavailable. After 15 more (documented) calls I found a secretary who told me, on condition that I not reveal her name, that Rob had been fired.I was finally able to talk to a man who said he was the manager. He said that he would be my coach. I explained to him that I did not want a coach and that I was too weak to do any work. A few days late i was rushed to the hospital as the MRSA had now entered my spinal cord. I spent four straight months in a sanitary room, no computer or cell phone. While there, my brother tried to contact Mr. Raygoza or anyone at Push. Finally, the ""manager offered to refund $3,000. He refused, kind of wish I had that now. As of today, I am now healthy enough to write this formal complaint. Push Traffic has never done one single thing for me. They have not established a domain, built a website, nothing. I talked with a woman who wrote her story here and she recieved some sor of settlement, although it had to remain confidential. I have tried, with my brother, to call Raygoza and others at Push Traffic, including Ted Molina.I have not even recieved the courtesy of a return call.Push traffic is a complete fraud. John Paul Raygoza has in effect and in my opinion stolen $20,000 from my family. Do I feel foolish. You bet!!! butI did nothing more than trust a man who said he shared a life changing illness with me. I have no idea where rob Martino is and they will not say.I am and will always be very sick. I need the mony very badly and they know it. It is almost like they are laughing at me. This has added greatly to the strain on my marriage. It is like they are laughing at me.Now I am in desperate need of a new chair and a lift to assist getting me into and out of be. the cost---$25,000.I understand that Mr. Raygoza ia highly regarded in the internet business, often referred to as a ""guru"". I have another name, but will share it for the oppurtunity to tell him personally. I also understand that he owns a successful web business called ""15 Rounds"" or something similar, which blogs about the boxing industry. I say we  all start to fight back on both the Push Traffic and 15 Rounds businesses and anywhere else we can. Please share your thoughts. Thank you.   ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

NEVER FALL FOR THIS SCAM. Malvern Pennsylvania", I was contacttd on 05/08/14 on the phone by a representative of this company. He told me that he would give me an ad that appears at the top of my mobile phone with a click to call anytime someone searches for my category on their mobile phone. He said that it was not a pay per click program that they charge a flat fee for their program.  I asked him if it was Display advertising or if it used Google Adwords. He said that it wasn't a pay per click kind of campaign. He guaranteed that I would be at the top of the google searches. I asked if his company was a Google SMB Premier Partner and there were only 19 of them in the US. He said that they were partnered with Google and they must be. After hanging up with the representative I called back in to talk with someone. This time an inbound call I spoke with someone and that I was concerned as they were not a Google Premier SMB partner. He stated that they were not and that they were a Google Partner.  I asked him about the campaign if it was PPC as they state on their website. He said that it is but there will not go over the amount that someone pays them. He said that when someone is interested the outbound callers collect their information and his level of representative then call the customers. I explained to him that they should better train their outbound callers to provide the right information. He said that I was costing him money and he hung up. Be truthful on the phone. All PPC Ad campaigns can be Budget Based. If someone is giving you $300 per month to run their program you would never go over the $300 or you would lose money. The customer's ad will stop getting displayed if the budget isn't correct. Maybe only Google Premier SMB Partners are familiar with this?  Beware of who you have run your Adwords program and do some research on the impact of Quality Score on your Cost per click and how it affects your placement in the Google Ranking.     ,  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

Research on the IP Hits on our sites as well as each person's post is going to put into a package & sent to several law enforcement agencies. I have been told by one Federal investigator that in order for us to get any attention is to have a large number of people who were scammed out of a cumulative large sum of money. It is particularly important if people were senior citizens, disabled or unemployed at the time of the scam. I ask people who have been scammed by World Wide Marketing, etc, to make reports to the following consumer complaint sites:   ripoffreport.com, (((Redacted)))  Law Enforcement Agencies to report your story: Federal Trade Commission                 www.ftc.gov  Internet Crime Complaint Center  (FBI)        www.ic3.gov      This site is a partnership between the FBI, National White Collar Crime Center & Bureau of Justice.  National Consumers League Fraud Center    (((Redacted)))   This website claims that it  will automatically forward  your complaint to local, state & Federal law enforcement agencies. You might try entering your story here first & see if you get an acknowledgement from any of the law enforcement agencies.

Then they preyed on me like a vulture devouring their dinner. All the time I was giving them my credit card info, I knew that I was being scammed, but I couldn't bring myself to stop it. If you want my full story, go to(((Redacted)))and search for World Wide Marketing. That site works differently than ripoffreport. There aren't any report numbers.  Scam reports are recorded there in Threads. Search for National Opportunities. There are two threads for this name. Look at the one starting with a post by Magboiler. My userid on(((Redacted))). I have several posts asking people who we call spies (You know the ones that claim that they have made money.) for proof that World Wide Marketing is a legitimate business.  There are several other posts by myself & others about how to get these guys. I would love for you all to join us. You will also find many other reports of people who have been scammed like me & you.

Tinton Falls, New Jersey U.S.A. ",, 732-741.7779,Global Resources LTD Cant say if there a scam However no people skills what so ever Tinton Falls New Jersey," In April of this year I selected one of Charter Communications Bundles composed of Digital TV, Telephone and Cable.  I had TV and Cable at the time and was signing up to add the phone to their bundle.  When signing up I was quoted one price ($29.99 per month) for the phone portion of the Bundle and was told there would be no installation charge ($30.00). My first bill the phone was $34.99 plus a proration of a partial month of $15.15. This was a double charge for a full month plus a partial month of $20.15.  The $30.00 installation charge I was told wouldn't apply was on the first bill as well bringing the total overcharge to $50.15.Charter outsources the selling of their services to independent third parties.  By law third party sellers are required to disclose their representation of the firm whose products or services they are offering.  I was told nothing.  I don't know the exact number of these third parties but conservatively I would estimate 30 such entities.  Charter exerts little if any control of these firms who are compensated based on the amount of business generated. Competition among these sellers is intense opening the door for misrepresentation and false inducements to get your business. It allows a buyer to go down the list of of phone numbers and get quotes until you find one you like.  In fact, the first seller I called was to willing to discount prices on everything I was looking for. Figuring that would cause billing problems and seeing myself say to Charter but that's what they said it would cost, I declined. The second seller I contacted quoted prices more in line with I thought they might be.  The long and the short of it was that despite my caution the prices I was quoted didn't enter charter's billing system in the same amount. 5 months I've been stonewalled trying to get Charter to honor the prices the people they pay to generate business told me they would be.  It has occurred to me that perhaps these third party sellers were less than forthright, with Charter completely oblivious to the possibility of fraudulent low price quotes. Not.Quoting from Wikipedia ""Charter has been criticized for poor customer support and frequent billing consistency issues, causing the Better Business Bureau to post a warning to consumers about the company:  ""The Better Business Bureau has received numerous complaints regarding this cable, digital TV and high speed internet access provider.  Complaints primarily allege that the firm had IMPROPER BILLING PRACTICES, referred customer bills to collection agencies in error, provided poor customer service, USED MISLEADING ADVERTISING, provided defective internet or cable performance, USED IMPROPER SALES TACTICS or ***MISREPRESENTED THE ACTUAL COSTS OF INSTALLATION AND SERVICE***, Failed to properly install or maintain service, damaged customers' property and failed to honor service appointments.""  Other than that it's a great little company.Wikipedia goes on stating ""PCW also ranked Charters cable service as worst among 14 major internet service providers, is the second-worst-rated cable ISP on dslreports.com, Consumer Reports indicated in their February 2008 issue that Charter's television/internet/telephone bundle collectively is the worst of all major national carriers"".  Their are other hick-ups such as ""accidentally deleted the email accounts of approximately 14,000 customers with the data irretrievable.""  There are other miscues to peruse in this article if so desired.On the Better Business Bureau site is a list of ""Customer Complaint History"" for Charter.  The highpoints - over a three year period Charter had ""6,871"" complaints, about 6.3 per day. In a major category were ""2,891 regarding Billing or Collection Issues"". Among this group near and dear to my heart or what I experienced were ""1,145 - FAILURE TO CORRECT BILLING ERRORS 107 - FAILURE TO SUBSTANTIATE CHARGES.""  Other complaints in this category were 1,337 - None of the Above - None of the above but related to Credit, Billing, or Collection Complaint Issues.  I'm not sure what that means but probably reflects the customers inability to articulate in an understandable manner what the actual problem was (it's hard to understand what people are saying when their screaming).  A few more smaller number of complaints 22 - Failure to provide itemized billing as requested, 163 - Improper collection practices, 66 - Unauthorized bank debits and 20 - Unauthorized credit card charges.Another major category had 900 regarding Customer Service Issues. 453 - Failure to provide promised customer support. 80 - Failure to return phone calls requesting assistance. 79 - Inappropriate behavior of customer service personnel. 378 -None of the above but related to customer service issues.I grouped together 6 categories for 1,103 complaints. Of those 252 regarding SALES PRACTICE ISSUES; 422 regarding Refund or Exchange Issues; 291 regarding Repair Issues; and 138 regarding Delivery, Warranty and Product Issues.The next to the last major category plus one category with a single issue was 1,554 complaints regarding Service Issues. The single issue category 199 regarding ADVERTISING ISSUES; 560 - Improper or inferior service; another 622 of - None of the above - but related Service Complaint Issues and a combined 132 - Delayed Completion of Service and Failure to honor agreement. The last category had 166 complaints regarding Issue Not Defined. This group was likely comatose and unable to speak due to the trauma of really bad service.The real barometer of Charter's dismal service, aside from fee misrepresentations (accompanied by remuneration for the sellers service) by third parties to lure business in the door, were the number of unresolved complaints. Out of 6,871 complaints there were 4,078 where ""The consumer failed to acknowledge acceptance"", of Charters resolution to the complaint, to the ""BBB"".  Fully 60% (actually 59.40%) of complaints were never resolved.  Not to many companies could have 59.40% of unresolved customer complaints and stay in business; but, the fat lady has yet to sing.To be fair Charter resolved 1,623 complaint issues where consumers ""acknowledged acceptance to BBB"" and ""1,154"" were given a pass as ""Administratively Closed as the BBB"" in 1,024 of these complaints ""determined the company made a reasonable offer to resolve the issues but the consumer did not accept the offer."" I wonder what the definition of a reasonable offer is.  Probably is somewhat akin to what the meaning of is, is.On a brighter note the BBB found that in fully 2 of the complaints ""the company provided proper verification that indicated there was no obligation to resolve the issues"" even though ""the consumer did not accept the offer"" (Wonder why the word reasonable was left out?).  Let's see, Charter got it right 2 out of 6,871 complaints. That's 0.000291 and quite an accomplishment.Even though Charter's miss-billings don't amount to much money, their arrogance and denial of what I was told the charges to be by an interested (as opposed to a disinterested) third party who was compensated by Charter to book the business, their abuses provide an incentive to address and bring scrutiny to bear on their unethical business practices.  If I get my money back that will be a plus.Brought in to right this listing ship in August 2005 is CEO Neil Smit, a former Navy Seal who ostensibly attained the rank of Lt. Commander in his 5 years of military duty. I don't think he's noticed the angle of the ship has slipped a couple of degrees more. Neither has Paul G. Allen, the owner of this nifty little company. Since he apparently doesn't realize he's not dealing from a position of strength, it might behoove him to take a reality check and descend from the tower and respond to complaints instead of aloofly and arrogantly turning away. Most Disgustedly, ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

Seven months later we have not recieved one phone call, or one email from either site.  Keep in mind after seven months and several requests the contact function on the sight never worked.  Donovan Media AKA The Web Leader was paid in full for both sites as soon as they where completed in August.  Then the monthly fees started, several months we were billed improperly and one month we where charged $5,000.00 on our credit card.  If i did not dispute it and say something, I would have been over billed.  Their response was that it was the secretary's error. They also, without written consent, started billing my other company's credit card due to a issue with the first card.  Every few weeks, I would call the office to see why there was no response to the sites.  Noone in the company was familiar with our sites and in seven months they went through three SEO techs that I know of.  Seven months later and loosing a lot of money, I requested that my site info go to another provider.  Their response was ""NO, I cannot have the passwords and info to take my sites"", that I paid in full for.  I also had my two sites evaluated by a third party that had no benefit in providing me with this information.  Their conclusion - that over the past seven months they have done no SEO work on the sites, so i have been paying alot of money for nothing.  I tried approaching them a civilized manner regarding a  solution to this matter.  Tom's response to me was that they can't figure out how Googles new coding works and that the results I wanted, I needed to pay him $2000.00 a month to get. That was not what our contract stated. I am fully aware that SEO takes 2-3 months to start working, but seven months later with no calls and no emails -  something is wrong.  This company was recommended to me by someone. I should have never given them my business.  It took the owner seven months to call me and the only reason was because I disputed his fees on my credit card.  Now, with thousands of dollars lost, he took my two sites down off the web without my permission and he refuses to give me the passwords. Again I paid in full for both sites, so why wont he give me the Info. He had links off of our site of all of his clients. Some of those clients were are competitors and one was an adult novelty store. This is not the way I wish to present myself to my clients. In addition, he took the websites down and put up a message to call Donovan media due to billing issues. So now, this is what is displayed if anyone should view the websites.

The story starts with Great Leads LLC, a company that Jeff Randol owned in 2010. Great Leads LLC went under and left behind sizable debt including unpaid payroll. Several employees lodged complaints against Jeff on Rip-off Report, many of them even pursued legal action against Jeff.

Whether they do their calling in house, or farm it out, the leads are absolutely worthless.  Specifically, of the 25 leads I purchased for almost $1,000.00, none of the people I spoke with were receptive. This is before I even had a chance to tell them why I was calling. There were major errors on people's names, the qualification parameters I entered for each lead weren't even close.

When I went in to interview the police we there and I turned around and left I wanted no part of that. After some digging I found out that Consumer Education Outreach owned by Jeff Randol is a front for scams he perpetrates. Jeff Randol has been operating as an independent business owner since 2001. He has run through a string of illegal and bankrupt businesses such as Great Leads and Consumer Education Outreach. His main focus is low-grade outbound call campaigns targeting senior citizens, the elderly and at-risk adults, even tens of thousands of consumers on the National Do Not Call registry. His business is a front for his illegal TCPA Robo-calling campaigns, which use pre-recorded voice messages for consumer theft. Currently, he is being funded by ePath Media a company owned by Bill Baskin & Jeremy Buttke based in California to run press 5 business to consumer automated call campaigns for Reverse Mortgage and Solar. Some of the unregistered business names Jeff Randol uses as fronts include Green Energy Association and American Mortgage Quotes. Sometimes he has his call center staff claim to be from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or from an energy company like Pacific Gas and electric to steal people’s information.  He even fakes the caller-id’s to trick the unsuspecting consumers into believing the calls they are receiving are from the government or a public utility. Jeff Randol’s personal life is just as screwed and corrupt as his business; he is under investigation for fraud and violations of the TCPA laws, a sexual harassment suit, and several wrongful termination lawsuits. He has been convicted of providing alcohol to minors and using false identity credentials (Colorado Case, Weld County, 2000M913), Felony Theft of $15,000 (Colorado Case, Boulder County, 2004CR3709), he even filed for personal bankruptcy in August of 2013 (US Bankruptcy Court case 1317811ABC). Theres talk online and on Facebook that he has been physically abusing his beautiful wife Debi and then told her to claim she fell off a horse. While he's having an affair with one of his employees. That is why the police were at his call center to investigate the allegations of fraud and domestic violence. Jeff Randol continues to operate his boiler room business in Windsor Colorado. Jeff Randol has no business phone lines for a reason, so that no one can call his fake business. You have to reach only him on his cell phone at 970.518.7228.

During this phone call Mr. Schelor offered me the opportunity to purchase an Affiliate Starter Kit for $100.00 and $19.95 to host a website, this was alleged business opportunity involving the sale of CC Machines to other businesses. On 3/11/10 I received an additional phone call from David Olson on behalf of Marketing Plans and offered me an opportunity to purchase ""LEADS"" from Core Payment Solutions, additional computer training, and additional training equipment. The additional leads were sold in a package of ""8000"" leads for $9999.99. Mr. Olson explained to me that I would begin to recoup my money in 90-120 days and I would make approximately $9600.00 a month. I gave Mr. Olson my CC information for payment. After thinking the purchase over the weekend, I decided that I did not want to be involved and wanted to cancel my purchase, on Monday March 15, 2010 I contacted Armondo A. and advised him that I wanted to cancel my purchase which he responded, that there were no refunds or cancellations. After telling him that I did not want to be involved in this program, he then faxed paperwork to me, confromation of my CC's being charged, at that time, he then requested my SS#, my signature, all my banking information, which as I said I was unwilling to do, as I did not want to participate in this program, and that Iwanted my money refunded. Upon not getting any response back from him per my request, I sought answers threw my lawyer. Which I gave her all my information, she then wrote a letter to the PA & AZ Attorney General Office, and to this day this is still unresolved and I am seeking your help in this matter, to help me in getting my money back. As this was a scam and I do not have a Home based business. If need be, I do have ALL of paperwork sent to me by the various companies involved, and would be more than happy to make copies and send them to you for your review. Thank you.

As an OPT student struggling to grasp a jump start with my career, I fell in the dead end at this surge of stench. First let me warn you that Systems Logic is really know as iVision Solutions, Inc. The same company that is posted online with an establishment of a staffing agency to promote placments with high end clients/vendors. The issue stands as such, there altered format of resume enhancement after ""Training"" is forged and falsely promoted experience that is dishonest and untrue. I was marketed after arriving in 16 weeks. The training was for a period supposbility 8 Weeks. The catch in this is that there recruiter lures you to their office after finding your profile online or at their weak job boothes at local or state regitheystered job fairs at colleges preferrbly targeting the Chinese community beause of their OPT status. I am a victim of this. I came to their offices and found that the offices suggested on the website were going to be upheld as professional enviroment, not some vacant run down office. I walked in and none of the lights in the hallway were on or even working. I noticed sleep employees or students or someone the first day I came taling about how tired they were of the internet never working. Right then and there I should of walked off, but I had no choice at this point, I already bought my flight ticket and spent the remaining amount of money I had on taxi because they were too cheap to pick me up. Once I arrived, I was greated by the office mananger Bilal Shabbir, he listed all the rules and etc and told me once I signed the ""Agreement"" I would be binded by their contractual rules. I only sought this far because of H1B sponosorship promised from their or my recruiter, who by the way lied to me about being in the united states, he was in India!!! I waited for like 6 hours in the office until finally Bilal came back to take me to ""Guest House"" which was not in the apartments like I was told I would stay, but at a townhouse. When I walked in it was like a punch to my face. Dirty, smelled like trash, no A/C, trash everywhere. I was like am I really staying in this dump?! Eventually after weeks of complaining, they sent someone to come fix the issues, but wow. We had to be clearly begging becaues just after a week there, I had bites all over my body. I went to a local doctor and had to pay out of pocket to be notified that I had been bitten by Bed Bugs!!!! I went to the training for the period mentioned, the traininer was never there or always calling off, his name is Ravi. We would be told to be there at 9 am by the staff and traininer and noone would show up or we would get notified by the office manager that he would be running late. By then our training went from 6-8 weeks to 12-14 weeks. Once we were started to be prepted for marketing, I noticed that they had their India office assinged to marketing people. Who I could barely understand. What makes this even worst is that they lied about my resume and promoted me to interviews with falses experiences and I felt so ashamed by then. Fianlly after months of being at this dump, I got a job. The funny thing is that once I arrived at the clients location, I decided to just quit. I took the offer from the client. I never got paid unitl like 4 weeks being at the job site. I never got my promised incentives or part of my deal or offer. I honestly only had one good experience when I was there, but it seems that person is not even working there anymore. If you get approached either online or by phone by these scam professionals, hang up, ignore!!! I was told I would be sued or sent to collections. I was threatned like a million times since I've left, but it felt good to leave. There never get a penny out of me. ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

They rent the URL to you (yes, you pay for it, but they own it) so all the advertising money you spend to promote the URL is lost when you leave them. (Unless you know this and insist they use a URL that you buy and refuse to transfer to them). When you leave them, they rent ""your"" URL to your competitor. Now your competitor begins immediately receiving the trailing benefit of all your advertising spent with Yodle. Yodle looks good to new client, because they are re-routing all residual leads that come in after you stop paying them to their new client. They take over your Google Places page. If you let them ""manage"" your Google places page they will remove your ID and password and take full control. You are cut out of access to Google places. When you leave they threaten to close your Google Places page. If you let them setup your Google Places page, they claim they will close it down. If you let them ""Manage"" your existing Google Places page, you will have to fight and argue to get them to give you back the ID and password access you once had. They will sell you a website, then re-sell it to everyone around you. In my case, same colors, same people photos, etc... This makes you look like a cookie cutter commodity. The phone number they promote is not your phone number. Again, like the URL, they can and will re-direct the phone calls to your competitor when you leave. When I worked with them they were not able to produce enough leads to cover the cost of their service plus the direct costs to service the client. When we asked to cancel service they refused. Then after the contract was over, our position in Google for our favorite three key words (we were ranking #1 on two of them and varied between #1,#2, and #3rd position on the third one) was severely damaged. We stayed on first page for one keyword, however, much lower, and for the other two key words we stopped appearing on the first page all together. Our Google Reviews disappeared and we can’t seem to get them back. Over a year later, we still have not fully recovered our Google Places position. We have had to hire someone to get this fixed.

So regardless of the fact that we have been continuing to have problems with the system Lime Cellular is not prepared to refund or support us for future problems. The problem is the problems never stopped. Other issues was, trying to learn their system was impossible as they do not offer enough supportive information.

We're committed to bringing the advantages of a big city ad agency to the small town business website.""

Our customers are the face of our business and their satisfaction is of the utmost importance. We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually improving so that their experiences with Captain Marketing remain strong, consistent and positive 
Their target market is to work with small to medium size US based businesses. They typically sign up businesses through a series of efforts with telemarketing, organic search engine optimization (SEO), paper click, client referral, email marketing, and miscellaneous of all other traditional methods. 
The sales process is one in which the first stage involves needs and goals assessments for each client. Captain Marketing does an extensive analysis for each client to better understand their particular issues and needs. They have discussions with perspective clients to understand what their business goals are. All this data is prepared and analyzed and presented to perspective clients. The second stage is making educated recommendations based on the clients budget and providing the details as to time line, methodology, products involved to reach the clients goal. The third stage is to ask the client for a commitment to begin any normal work that the client would like Captain Marketing to perform in their behalf. They feel the vast majority of their clients are happy and state they have over 1,200 clients. Clients are able to cancel services at any time with a thirty day written notice. 
In regards to complaints the company receives, they try to set their clients expectations from the beginning by letting them know things will not happen overnight and that it takes four to six months to see results.  They feel there are no major common complaints, since each client has individual needs and circumstances... Captain Marketing is a company dedicated to setting realistic goals to provide the services necessary to benefit our clients.""   .. Bruce Gordon 
If there is an issue that comes up, Captain Marketing states that they will give free SEO time, free back links for a month; they offer copyright content or design changes to the website. They provide free hosting and offer social media to clients. Their goal is to keep clients for as long as possible and to make the client see the value of Captain Marketings services.

Captain Marketing views their relationship with clients as a partnership and they are working together to reach the clients goals. Bruce stated many clients view Captain Marketing as their marketing arm.
Internally, the company stated they have changed their credit card processing services to correct credit card errors and are hiring more people to grow with the company. They are also bringing in more Project Managers to handle the new accounts to improve their current processes. 
Since the company has been a part of Ripoff Report, they have made changes internally. There was a billing error that they stated was corrected with a new credit card processing service that began in November 2011 and since then there have been no billing errors. They stated that they have processed nearly 20,000 transactions without error. They have also increased their accounting staff. The company had a disgruntled employee and feel they have resolved this by now having an open door policy for employees to express their complaints and concerns. The company had issues where client did not like back links. In response, the company created different types of links so that clients who prefer other types of links would now have greater ability to satisfy them in that area. Furthermore, they had complaints of substandard service. They feel the complaint was satisfied by a phone call and explanation from the company.

This means that clients can expect that the company will work towards finding a mutually satisfactory resolution to any complaints or concerns.  Madwire Media listens carefully to client concerns and sees them as an opportunity to become more efficient as a company in the services offered and the support for those services. Demo Reel of our latest work: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJLficuooZY&feature=share&list=PLA1C68D551421ED4FRipoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business.. The information provided in this report is based on comments made by Joe Kellogg, JB Kellogg, and Jerry Kelly during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward the Madwire Media..  Madwire Media’s vision is to be a company that has unbelievable technology and unbeatable customer service by helping companies grow through Marketing and Design. The company’s target market is small to midsize businesses with annual revenue ranging from $25,000 to $1,000,000. They have a global clientele with majority of their clients outside of the state of Colorado. Madwire never buys leads or cold calls because all of their leads are strictly inbound. Additionally, the company states that they operate with the same marketing strategy they offer their clients with the goal of having an inbound lead generation. Furthermore, the company states they have dedicated marketing consultants whose responsibility is to consult the potential customer about their business, create a marketing plan to help their business be successful and reach a package that fits their needs. Madwire Media feels they are set apart from other companies in their industry because they have a proprietary product that they build. The company creates a dynamic solution with MAD-360, which is their core product offering. Everything the company does is analytic driven which they feel is unique to their company. The marketing they provide comes with analytics which further helps to separate them from their competitors. The sales process with Madwire Media starts when the lead comes in and the company reaches out to the potential customer. The company goes through a process of asking the potential customer questions to figure out their needs and how Madwire can consult them in their business. This process helps the company to identify a road map to success. With each new lead, the company always has a consultant mindset, not about the company selling something. During this process, the company’s main objective is to find out if Madwire’s solutions are going to work for the potential client, how they can help, and if they are a good fit to work together. Next, the Madwire works with the prospective client to discover their budget and put them on a plan within that budget. Madwire does extensive research and competitor analysis which includes what their client’s competitors are currently spending. The company explains discovered information in correlation with their needs and goals. Finally, Madwire Media puts together a plan for growth opportunity for the prospective client. Their ultimate goal for every client is to build a solid brand and make them the “go to guy” for their local business. Furthermore, Madwire looks to build a long term, profitable business for their clients. Through the customizable solutions created by Madwire prospective company’s results vary for their services. Joe Kellogg, CEO of Madwire states, “Ultimately, the client drives the business and they need to follow through on the action plan to have optimal success. Each client has a dedicated marketing executive and they each have a whole team working behind them. Essentially, each client has their own marketing team helping their business. This means low overhead for the client because hiring an on-site marketing team would be more costly. A huge benefit for our customer is that they receive daily marketing communication from their team.” The company is striving to improve internal processes in initial website launches for their clients. This is a service they provide to every client and it is a full investment on their side because the client does not pay for it. Typical websites take 10 weeks to launch but Madwire can launch a website in 10 days while keeping the same quality and work flow. When looking at improvements in internal processes, JB Kellogg, COO stated, “We see all feedback as a positive thing. We are constantly analyzing and measuring data to streamline processes. If an issue arises, we are able to correct it immediately.” Additionally, the company has made several structural changes by providing the client a dedicated reprehensive for their account resulting in better service. JB Kellogg further stated, “With ‘Execution Excellence’ being our motto, we strive to uphold standards with every client complaint. All complaints are viewed as opportunities.” A common complaint the company has received in the past relates to client’s expectations. Madwire explained, “Many times a client is a brand new business, new to the internet or just doesn’t know what it will take for them to be successful. They may have unrealistic expectations and when those are not met right away, it causes the client to become unsatisfied.” The company stated that they always resolve the complaint. They want and even encourage clients who have unmet expectations to reach out to them before writing a review to allow them the opportunity to do whatever it takes to turn them into a satisfied client. One way to resolve a complaint is to keep them as a client and bend over backwards to ensure the client is satisfied. If the issue is because of an expectation, a dedicated marketing executive will do more consultation. The marketing consultants are the first people to talk to clients. Their job is to tell the client what their competitor is spending while setting proper expectations for their success. JB Kellogg explained, “Madwire Media wants our clients to understand that the process takes time and work. It takes time to constantly analyze, measure, and adjust over the course of 4-6 months. As long as the client understands that and are committed to the program, we will do everything to help them be successful.” They mentioned their first commitment to their clients is a specially designed website at no charge to them. Madwire’s success is built on long term customers. Therefore, they make it a priority to resolve complaints effectively. The company had a situation a few months ago where a client was unsatisfied with their marketing plan. The client said the particular program he was on did not make sense and Madwire agreed with him. Madwire Media informed him that he should be on a higher platform based on his location and what his competitors were doing. Ultimately, he was not getting what he wanted, but didn't want to spend the additional dollars to get what he needed. They took the time to listen to what he wanted and advised him on the type of people that are searching for him, which happened to be coupon and sales driven consumers. After the conversation, the unsatisfied client saw the value in what Madwire Media provided, but decided he was not prepared to put more into the process. The main issue in this scenario was communication and expectation. The company feels there is not one resolution to answer problems; not one person is going to have the same complaint.Since complaints on Ripoff Report, Madwire Media stated they have not changed their process just because they have had some bad reviews. They constantly strive to improve processes regardless of complaints. They said that creative agencies sometimes have a tough time satisfying how something looks compared to how it is going to drive traffic to their website. Unfortunately, they can't please everyone. They strive to make the best decisions based on what is going to best drive traffic to a client's website, which is oftentimes not what the customer thinks is going to look the best.The company’s motto that they communicate and hold employees accountable to is ""Execution Excellence,"" which is doing whatever needs to be done to take care of the client. No one in the company has voicemail because they want their clients to have things done timely, if not immediately. The internet is instant and they want their response to be as well.  Some changes they have made as a result of complaints received is that they are more engaged with Ripoff Report and value it as a way to discuss and resolve issues for unhappy clients. If a customer has a problem, they want it fixed. They ask themselves what the company can do to fix the issue. They look at Ripoff Report as an opportunity to reach out to the client to correct the problem.  Madwire Media wants to tell the truth about their company and the thousands of companies they help. Jerry Kelly stated, “Ripoff Report is the mechanism to identify people that have a problem and how we can solve it. This gives them an opportunity to work with unsatisfied clients that they would not have normally been able to reach out to because they did not contact our firm directly.” Madwire Media™ / Execution Excellence™ is our standard.  ”Jerry Kelly, the Chief Marketing Officer of Madwire Media™, stated “We consider all customer complaints as constructive criticism and use them as tools to improve our processes. Our customers are our family and are the life blood of our business and their satisfaction is of the utmost importance. We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually providing a high level of service so that their experiences with Madwire Media™ remain strong, consistent and positive”.Another top executive of the company told us that their policy is to always proactively engage our customers to gather valuable feedback so that we can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible.

									Mad Wire Media Mad360 Ponzi scheme Loveland, Colorado

										This is one of the worst scams I have ever had. They use the good guy bad guy technique. The sales person will sell you the big dream of how they will build you a website in 3 weeks and then she will make you believe she is on your side. Then they do the pass the buck scam.  
They will pass you to so many people you do not know who is who. They will call and tell you next week we will work on your website for 6 months and then after they took no less than 8k they plopped down some horrible looking graphics and website and never finished it.
They keep you in the loop because they have you by the reins, you have paid them so much money you cannot switch to someone else. Then they continue to take your money and charge your card even when you have asked them to stop, they just keep on charging your card. In my case 1300 a month. 
You need to make sure you do not let them host or keep your website files on their server. If you ever become unhappy with them they will try and shut your web site down. Even if you are with Big Commerce and you change your password, make sure you also change your pin and all 3 places that you can log in.
Once they see you have had enough abuse they will try and downgrade you to $45 a month to maintain your site. They never ever completed either of 3 websites they did for me. They just kept charging and kept saying next week.
I have 98 different emails from 9 different people. They pass your account around from person to person to keep you confused.
They charged me 300 a month for a blog that consisted of one or two lines of blog. I also asked them for 3 months to finish the last part and they never did while still charging me. The new company I hired finished it
in literally 5 minutes while on the phone with me.
One website I paid Mad wire media Web design thousands in advance to do a custom template and they put me off for 6 months and then finally started to work on the site and then said they had to have more money
after they launched it and it was live and the shopping cart was not working.
The big commerce sites they never finished and they threatened to take them down if I canceled my accounts, but they never finished them and I had paid them close to 6,000 and 3 weeks turned into 7 months. Moving all of my files and changing all my passwords and pins stopped this nightmare.
From beginning to end it has been well over a year (16 or 17 months) and they never completed one single website and took nearly a total of $10,000.00 In other words I got 2 half ass templates for this amount! I did all of the work, they supplied one template.
Ironically when we called Big Commerce to complain, the rep said they had at least 4-5 complaints against Mad Wire Media design that day! I wish I would have also read Rip off reports prior to hiring them because they have several other complaints on rip off reports as well.",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

East Hartford, Connecticut U.S.A. ",, 860-565-7620,P&W Surplus Store Operated By Keylynk Technologies NEVER BUY A PC from P&W Surplus Store East Hartford Connecticut," Saw ad in local paper for Radialabs product and low cost, $3.95, to try a sample. Went online and thought I read website thoroughly and ordered a sample of product and was charged the acknowledged $3.95 in January, 2010. Looked at bank account on Feb 4 and saw a deduction by Radialabs for $74.95.  Called them and was advised that website advised there would be a contractual agreement if I did not respond within 14 days of receiving the sample product. There's one born everysecond and I feel too stupid to live. I did recieve an email after the phone call indicating that my account had been cancelled. This is so smooth it's scary!! EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder

 Matt Bacak scam, false advertsing, no support, lies, cheat Suwanee Georgia A very dear friend of mine who lives here in Texas, attended one of Matt Bacak's Millionaire Internet Intensive Workshops in Atlanta. I'll never forget how excited she was to go and learn Internet marketing. She says that she doesn't remember exactly the amount she paid to go but it was either $3,000 or $4,000.She said the she loved the seminar and that in fact, Bacak even gave all the attendees a basic laptop computer.She said that Bacak was a very nice and normal guy. She also said that it was refreshing that he even acknowledged a bit of a learning disability.She met several other attendees and looked forward to making a connection with each of them in order to keep her learning of Internet marketing on-going.She had received a small inheritance and decided to take six months off and build her Internet business. She had just over $50,000 to invest in her new business.Bacak's theory is to build a huge email list. offering free information in what ever area of expertise that you possess. In the seminar, he goes through the various means of building your business through 'list building'.She loved the excitement (which turned out to be more hype than anything) of the seminar and was very excited to put it all into practice.She did and even ended up attending an up sell event that cost her around $10,000. This was a week long event that Bacak and his employees spent more time with a half dozen others who had likewise spent this amount.I never saw anyone work so hard as she did in trying to put into practice the theory and techniques that Bacak taught her.The reason for this report is that the methods that Bacak taught her didn't work for her (and I later found out, several others). She attempted contacting his office numerous times and could never get a 'live person' to talk to. She kept calling for a matter of weeks and still no response. Her natural thought was that Bacak had gone out of business.She contacted several others that attended both events with Bacak and who likewise spent a lot of money. To her surprise, NONE of the people attending the event had gone on to building an Internet business except one.This guy seemed to be really on top of all that Bacak was teaching and was far ahead of the curve in building his business. In fact, most of what Bacak taught, this guy already knew and had already started putting it into practice.She thought that of all the attendees that this guy would be making a killing with the additional knowledge that he gained from Bacak. He seemed to know almost already have known all that Bacak taught. However, as he told me, it was a huge confidence builder and confirmation that he was on the right track.He doesn't live too far from me, so I called him and asked him to lunch one day. He was very generous in offering his time with me. We spent two and half hours together.I learned that his experience with Bacak had pretty much been what my friend's experience had been. He had built a huge list and was offering books and motivational products to his list. Though he was very reluctant to call Bacak an out and out fraud, he did say that he had spent nearly $50,000 in addition to the $10,000+ that he had given to Bacak. He couldn't get responses from Bacak and couldn't even get anyone to answer the phone at Bacak's office. He shared with me that several other attendees apparently saw him as one who would surely be highly successful with Bacak's training. He said, ""I was in hopes of proving Matt Bacak right in saying that you CAN make a fortune with his methods.""He said that when the others also couldn't get Bacak or anyone else at Bacak's office, to answer the phone, they started calling him. He said that he has stayed in touch with a large number of attendees.In fact, my last contact with him a few weeks back, he said that he was now bankrupt. His last contact with Bacak resulted in Bacak blaming him for not being successful.From what I've learned, Bacak also offers to help some promote their products to his own subscribers of his opt-in list. He doesn't do that (at least he didn't in the case of these two as well as all the others I contacted). His methods that he taught were not as nearly as effective as he indicated in his seminar.I took my friend's business card stack of those who she exchanged business cards with at Bacak's event (about 26 in all) and NONE of them were marketing on the Internet or even making a supplemental income with it. The one exception was the guy I had lunch with. He said that he made a few thousand dollars a month but no enough to care for his family.After talking to all the people that I did, most of them said that Matt Bacak was a nice guy on a personal basis. In fact, the guy I had lunch with said that it took him a long time to realize that apparently the money to be made from 'list building' was made in teaching others what you know about it and Internet marketing.Bacak boasts of making millions in what he does. He has several offices in the Atlanta area and has his own airplane. Apparently, he is the only one doing this. My friend asked me not to file this report. As with most people who have been scammed like this, she is embarrassed. The guy I had lunch with said that he believed that Bacak had great intentions and was very sincere. In fact, after putting everything he had into building an online business and losing it all, he still says that Bacak is a nice guy. He said that Bacak was a 'Christian' and attended a large Atlanta church.I'm surprised at my findings. Had it only been my friend, I could give Bacak the benefit of the doubt. However, seeing others who have put their hopes, futures and lives into the hands of guy like this, a purported 'expert', I couldn't remain silent.Buyer beware of Matt Bacak, 'the powerful promoter'.Llicash Richardson, TexasU.S.A.

Only then do we publish our findings.Rip-off Report cannot ever guarantee any product or service, but we can only report what we find, in order to help you get a better understanding of the company or individual we are investigating.

After a recent mailing to everyone who filed a Rip-off Report, it became apparent that Achieve Technologies is sincere in their commitment to remedy any and all customer concerns. Company executives stated to Rip-off Report that Achieve Technologies has now dedicated a portion of their customer service team to work exclusively on making improvements in the customer service arena. These changes were implemented as a direct result of feedback they received from Rip-off Report.As a sign of their commitment, Achieve Technologies and their sister companies recently had every employee go through a new customer satisfaction training program. This training will ensure that all customer concerns and questions are answered in a timely fashion and all clients issues are addressed, this new training program was designed to reiterate the fact that customer service is their primary concern.ACHIEVE TECHNOLOGIES CONTINUES TO CLARIFY WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY CAN DO FOR CLIENTSAchieve Technologies understands the saying, you can be judged by the company that you keep "" so Achieve Technologies is working with their affiliate companies to make sure they are held to the same high standard. In fact, Rip-off Report learned from a company executive that they have ended relationships with companies that were not willing to make changes. In todays business world how often do you find a company willing to walk away from profits in the name of ethics? Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning has and says they will again, if necessary.  Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning carefully screens the companies that refer them business in an effort to help the clients that are working towards a successful business. Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning  also endorses companies that they refer clients to, but maintains that those services are 100 % optional and will welcome feedback on these companies for further evaluation at assistance@achievetechnologies.netANY BUSINESS THAT CAN ADMIT THEY MADE MISTAKES AND CORRECTS THOSE MISTAKES IS A BUSINESS YOU CAN TRUST AND WORTH DOING BUSINESS WITH New company executives also stated that over that last few months they have streamlined their directory assistance branch of the customer service and live chat departments in an effort to eliminate dropped calls or unusually long hold times. In addition, Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning has added new processes that allow them to better serve clients from all across country.Because of our investigation and the sincere efforts put forth by Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning, Rip-off Report is proud to give Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning a positive rating. All in all, the company implemented strategic changes to its Customer Service Department and reached its goal of achieving total customer satisfaction through excellent service. This was made possible by a totally honest approach to corporate introspection.Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning CEO stated "" We understand that the only way to grow as a company is by first recognizing our weaknesses and then committing the resources necessary to fix the problems those weaknesses have created "" . He then added, We know that we have made mistakes, all businesses do, but I can assure you that we are 100% committed to resolving those issues and creating an excellent experience for our clients .ACHIEVE TECHNOLOGIES CONTINUES TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND BY IMPLEMENTING QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM. Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning has also improved its services by offering live webinars, live chat and a special team of  personnel dedicated to offering technical support through email or phone support in between a clients appointments with their coach.  After each appointment with a client, emails are sent with clear instructions of assignments and a reiteration of what was covered during their appointment with their coach.  This provides a multitude of options for a client to gain assistance during our program and provide us with necessary feedback from the client if they have any concerns or require assistance.  Thanks to this feedback from clients, Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning has made changes and to the information presented and continues to strive for excellence in order to be more effective.ACHIEVE TECHNOLOGIES GIVING THEIR CUSTOMERS THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT... Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning understands that clients come to us with a dream to run a successful and profitable Internet Business, our program is designed to teach how you can own and run that Internet  business.  We often refer to the well known quote Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.  Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime this is a fundamental belief of our coaching program and we provide you with the tools and the knowledge, but sometimes its still not enough "" Rip-off Report regrets that we need to say this, but there is still some form of effort and work required on the part of each client.  In the business that Achieve Technologies is in they understand the confusion and dedication required  with beginning a new business and they have built a program to assist in reducing that confusion and to keep its clients on track and motivated to their best ability, but ultimately the client has to be dedicated and complete all assignments and complete the work in order to be successful.They also know that the best laid plans are guaranteed to fail if you do not use them.  Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning cannot be held responsible for a clients failure to use their advice. That is no fault of the company.  For example, When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don't blame the lettuce?Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning realizes that there can occasionally be a breakdown in communication between the client and the coach, for any number of reasons.  Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning is managing issues when they arise and proactively looking for ways to decrease possible misunderstandings in the future through added employee incentives, instituting high standards for sales executives, adding extensive quality assurance measures, implementing workforce management and increasing training.Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning has found that the main reason they lose clients is because of the failure of the clients business to produce profits.  Once the client sees their business venture as a failure their first impulse is to cut their relationship with Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning, instead of giving us the opportunity to honor our commitment to them to provide them with continued support and access to training materials for as long as they wish to use it.In spite of all these situations, which show that bad service is not always a fault of Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning,  I believe you have a company that is ready to serve those who need more assistance and is willing to make things right if they seem to have fallen apart.Rip-off Report knows, there is no company or individual that is perfect  Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning knows this also and demonstrates their need for continuing improvement - that is why Rip-off Report feels you can be completely confident, safe and secure when doing business with them as a member of ..Rip-off Reports Corporate Advocacy, Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program. ...A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business.RESULTS OF MAILING TO ALL THOSE WHO FILED A RIP-OFF REPORTAs a part of the Corporate Advocacy Program - Rip-off Report sent an email to every client who filed a Report on Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning and I would now like to share the results with you.As usual, the majority of clients stated that they appreciated our efforts and related how they had already been taken care of in a satisfactory manner.  It never fails, most customers asked if they could remove the Report they filed and we explained that unfortunately, it was not possible. It is Rip-off Report's philosophy that it is much more beneficial for the consumer to see how a company like Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning takes care of their mistakes. No company is without its share of problems, however, there are many companies who continually sweep those problems under the rug and never achieve the growth that other companies such as Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning enjoys.Rip-off Report feels Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning has learned from all those who have complained... and they even seemed to be thankful for those who have brought problems to their attention. One executive stated, ""We can only improve our business based on feedback from our clients, sometimes that feedback may be hard to hear but it is the only way we can become better.""Achieve Technologies shows leadership by joining the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program.Keep in mind, Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning has worked with over half a million clients and with only 20 Rip-off Reports to show for it.  What really is amazing that despite Rip-off report appearing at the top of most search engines about Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning, ..if there was a real problem with this company, there would be a lot more complaints about Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning.  Plus, their complaint ratio is less than one half of one percent.  Rip-off report feels that this is significantly way below the industry standard for the clientele that they work with. From our perspective, it is quite unusual for a company who has had so few complaints request on their own to be a part of the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program.  Achieve Technologies/Vision is showing leadership for other companies to follow that care about their clients.ABOUT THE CORPORATE ADVOCACY PROGRAMWhile Rip- off Report does not endorse any company, including Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning, overall, our research demonstrated to us that Achieve Technologies is a solid, reliable company that stands behind its service.Many companies that contact Rip-off Report make claims that the Reports about them are false, were filed by the same person or even a competitor.

We often refer to the well known quote Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.  Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime this is a fundamental belief of our coaching program and we provide you with the tools and the knowledge, but sometimes its still not enough "" Rip-off Report regrets that we need to say this, but there is still some form of effort and work required on the part of each client.  In the business that Achieve Technologies is in they understand the confusion and dedication required  with beginning a new business and they have built a program to assist in reducing that confusion and to keep its clients on track and motivated to their best ability, but ultimately the client has to be dedicated and complete all assignments and complete the work in order to be successful.They also know that the best laid plans are guaranteed to fail if you do not use them.  Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning cannot be held responsible for a clients failure to use their advice. That is no fault of the company.  For example, When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don't blame the lettuce?Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning realizes that there can occasionally be a breakdown in communication between the client and the coach, for any number of reasons.  Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning is managing issues when they arise and proactively looking for ways to decrease possible misunderstandings in the future through added employee incentives, instituting high standards for sales executives, adding extensive quality assurance measures, implementing workforce management and increasing training.Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning has found that the main reason they lose clients is because of the failure of the clients business to produce profits.  Once the client sees their business venture as a failure their first impulse is to cut their relationship with Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning, instead of giving us the opportunity to honor our commitment to them to provide them with continued support and access to training materials for as long as they wish to use it.In spite of all these situations, which show that bad service is not always a fault of Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning,  I believe you have a company that is ready to serve those who need more assistance and is willing to make things right if they seem to have fallen apart.Rip-off Report knows, there is no company or individual that is perfect  Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning knows this also and demonstrates their need for continuing improvement - that is why Rip-off Report feels you can be completely confident, safe and secure when doing business with them as a member of ..Rip-off Reports Corporate Advocacy, Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program. ...A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business.RESULTS OF MAILING TO ALL THOSE WHO FILED A RIP-OFF REPORTAs a part of the Corporate Advocacy Program - Rip-off Report sent an email to every client who filed a Report on Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning and I would now like to share the results with you.As usual, the majority of clients stated that they appreciated our efforts and related how they had already been taken care of in a satisfactory manner.  It never fails, most customers asked if they could remove the Report they filed and we explained that unfortunately, it was not possible. It is Rip-off Report's philosophy that it is much more beneficial for the consumer to see how a company like Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning takes care of their mistakes. No company is without its share of problems, however, there are many companies who continually sweep those problems under the rug and never achieve the growth that other companies such as Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning enjoys.Rip-off Report feels Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning has learned from all those who have complained... and they even seemed to be thankful for those who have brought problems to their attention. One executive stated, ""We can only improve our business based on feedback from our clients, sometimes that feedback may be hard to hear but it is the only way we can become better.""Achieve Technologies shows leadership by joining the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program.Keep in mind, Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning has worked with over half a million clients and with only 20 Rip-off Reports to show for it.  What really is amazing that despite Rip-off report appearing at the top of most search engines about Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning, ..if there was a real problem with this company, there would be a lot more complaints about Achieve Technologies/Vision Learning.  Plus, their complaint ratio is less than one half of one percent.  Rip-off report feels that this is significantly way below the industry standard for the clientele that they work with. From our perspective, it is quite unusual for a company who has had so few complaints request on their own to be a part of the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program.

StoresOnline ripoff fraud Orem UTAfter attending an all day workshop with Stores Online, Inc. 7/12/2005 in Monterey, CA, I spoke with SOL representative, Andria Finau,  and asked if I could have more than 3 days to cancel if I so desired.  Three times I asked her this question, and three times she assured me that she had the ability and authority to extend the Notice of Cancellation.  My friend was with me and witnessed the entire conversation.I emailed and called SOL on the 6th day to cancel and reported to the Cust. Serv. Supervisor, Lupina, what Andria had told me.  Lupina stated ""she didn't say that,"" ""she can't say that.""I disputed the charge with my credit card company and in Oct. I was notified by Citicards, that SOL would not honor our request for credit.I subsequently sent a certified letter to both SOL and their representative, Andria Finau, requesting a full refund from the company, as I would rather settle directly with them than pursuing court action.I am awaiting a reply.Sue

Russ Burnett Jr. set up a new company listed as Online Images LLC. I can only imagine why this guy isn't in jail yet. After the Origin 3 mess Russ went to work for a company called Global Response Technologies. He worked there for about a year before leaving and now that company is under investigation by the Federal Authorities. Then he founded this new entity Online Images LLC. When Origin 3 failed a lot of us went after this guy to get our money back, only to have him declare bankruptcy and leave us all high and dry. Looking at the listing of judgements on him something stands out. Many of the judgements it turns out are against to the wrong guy. It turns out his father has the same name as he does minus the Jr at the end. What he is doing is using his fathers Social Security number and claiming it as his own. Running up his scams and then walking away scott free when it all falls down and having his father declare bankruptcy again to get rid of the mess. this is Social Security FRAUD! You cannot use someone elses social security number and pass it off as your own, ESPECIALLY to evade paying debts. It's a federal Law. The only thing I cannot understand is why his father would go along with this scam multiple times.

They offer an incredible free web application for online marketing. I used it fine for about a month. Then as my company email marketing list grew I naturally had no issue paying for their premium service that supports larger email lists.  As of the day I paid them - not a single email campaign has gone out - mind you, it was the same exact campaign I had used under the free account. This is the genius part, they bait you with the free service then switch it up when you pay them.    I received a vague email stating some nonsense about an ""omnivore"" program that was verifying my email addresses. I had 2500 emails on my list, 2000 of those emails had gone out when I used the free account, and then only after paying their ""verification software"" flagged those same emails as requiring additional verification. Does that in any way make sense?  So I emailed asking what happens next, what exactly they were talking about, and got no response whatsoever.  By the time the second day came around I was infuriated, as my business is bleeding from lack of marketing materials going out.  They are a good free service for small novelty products, if you have a real business that needs to operate smoothly then they definitely are not the company to use.  They have no working phone numbers, I left countless mesages on their voicemail system, no calls back. I tracked down their parent company - Rocket Science Group and the same thing, they are off the grid with no working numbers and ofcourse they ignore your emails.    This is a incubated, start up type firm, their business model is to build their customer list so they can flip it around and sell the company, investors buy when subsciptions are high. So they are not concerned with customer relations or operational legitimacy. Just some techy types that execute an idea then leave you high and dry when you need actual results. Also, their analystics for open rates, etc. are horrible.    Then, I sent an email letting them know that I would be charging the fees I paid back through my bank, FYI - a chargeback is bad for the other end, the company that originally received the funds (meaning Mailchimp) not for the person who the funds originated from. So I reminded them that a chargeback would be bad for their accounting purporses and they would have to pay bank fees and it wouldn't faze me in the least bit.    Lo & behold - within hours I received the first and only repsonse from them - I would be refunded.    LMAO, these people are jokers. Big disconnect between executing a company and actually operating a company. MAILCHIMP IS A ONLY WORTH THE FREE SERVICE THEY PROVIDE!!!   I went with constant contact, which is anywhere from $5-$15 more, but it is worth double - seriously, Constant Contact has phone support, I spoke with them 30 mins the day I signed up, they got started on verifying my email list right away, they asked me my schedule for getting the campaign out and they had everything up and running for me right on time. I can't praise them enough, they truly understand what they do and their work ethic speaks for itself.    CONSTANT CONTACT fan!!!!!   ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder RipoffReport.com Author of www.ripoffrevenge.comRip-off Report PO Box 310, Tempe, Arizona 85280 									",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

Lanham Maryland," This company promises postive Yelp reviews for a fee.  While this isn't a very ethical route to go, if you have a bad yelp review from years ago bringing your score down, it can seem like a good idea.  Well its not, its a terrible idea... especially with this company.  They'll take your money but thats about it.   I ordered 5 yelp reviews to be posted 3 days apart.  After about two weeks of no contact or postings, I inquired and just didn't receive a response. About a week later I called and left a voicemail saying if I didn't hear anything I was going to file a chargeback with my bank.  That got an email response saying I shouldn't because they can't guarantee reviews once I do that.  Regetting getting involved with them, I went to the website to see what my options were and it says full refund within 30 days for any reason.  I was within the 30 days so I sent multiple refund requests by email before receiving a response saying that it wasn't possible. [continued below]....
									
										.....  No explanation or anything, just that it wasn't possible.  I wrote back asking that the refund policy on their site was a lie then and got the same ""refund isn't possible"" response.  They ended up posting some poorly written reviews to my yelp that were all filtered out immediately.  Along with those being filtered my previous good reviews from real customers were too.  On their site it says any filtered reviews will be replaced at no additonal cost.  I've emailed three times over the course of a month asking about this and I haven't received a response.   Basically this company will take your money, not do anything it promises unless you repeatedly call and email them.  Then they will do a lazy job and not honor promises made on their site.  You can still visit their site and read their refund policy at the bottom of the main page and the filtered review question in the FAQ.  They simple either ignore your request or say its not possible.   ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

Internet"," This company was reported fraud, tricky and stoler credit card charges during trial period from numerious people, no media or BBB taking any action on them, they are still in business freely without any hesitation or court claim, because they charge $2.97 and $139.95 to $149.95 to people's credit cad during trial period and people do not deal with them legally due to small amount, also time and cost to recover this fund is lot higher than $149. Same fraud happened with us on April 9,2010, ICM should send us program information kit via mail(which we never received)and confirmation e-mail of sign up(we received on monday) when people sign up online at the cost of $2.97 and then they should provide coaching free for three day as they promised, coaching they have is very tricky and time consuming so you can miss your trial period of three day to cancel this service so they can charge you additional $149.95 or 139.95 even if you do not want to continue business. So I was wake up on monday and verified my cancellation deadline with thei staff, which is they confirmed and told me April 9, wednesday.(Also told me that we need to go through coaching program so do not worry about cancellation until you know the program)  I have trouble to cancel in weekends because they are closed to provide coaching.info of the program, while they started coaching they gave us next day time for interview and after interview they gave us next day executive interview telling that everyone does not qualify as our business partner but I was luky to get in this business and I will get three business days to cancel services if I don't like the program !  when they mentioned $12,000 cost of coaching I have tried to cancel this service but they can not cancel becuse they are not part of ICM and I have to call different number !, I called to cancel at the given phone number they said I am late to cancel and the people Who gave me three business day to cancel they are of part of ICM team. ICM counts weekend days even if they are closed for weekends. How they can count week end if they are not available to provide program information on weekends? I have canceled on third business day and they stated that they can not cancel or refund. I came to know about coaching staff is not part of the program when I signed then why they did not clarify in the beginning and gave me three days trial ? It was all tricky business to make 139.95 even if I never received any KITs of program informationas they promised. Numerious people had filed compaint about this company because they were cheated by all false promises of three days trial conflict. they claimed third party coaching is not part of their company then why they have released my information to them to provide me coaching and false promise of three business days trial period. I did cancel services on 3rd day and I should get refund. they know that I will not spend attorney fee to get my money back so they can keep my money, where is BBB and fair market consumer act ?

Oklahoma City Oklahoma"," usdirectory.com is nothing more than a forceful scam.  I was first contacted by www.usdirectory.com12/09/2010 and I first told them no on that date. www.usdirectory.com started with a sales pitch of only $5.00 US dollars a month to advertise my company and get me on the first page of Google. I stopped them right there and said, if it was only $5 to get on the first page of google by keyword and not just by my company name, then Google stock would not be in the $400 a share range and after being in business for over ten years myself, I understand that the right advertising works and for every good advertising agency there are 5 bad. It's so sad really.. So, I looked into this a little more and had to see what the catch was. After only a few minutes of research, I found the dirt - 0.25 cents for a reference? ""What the heck is that?"", I asked the sales rep (that calls me hourly like clockwork). He/She said "" 0.25 is the only price you will pay per reference."" Which is almost the same as a paid impression for legitimate companies that don't need to change wordage The other difference is that your name may come up as much as 400 times in a day.  How?  The companies scam is pretty simple and if you pay attention to the wordage it's easy to catch.  First,your given the option to choose up to 6 categories or keywords. Most companies will choose the hottest keywords thinking they are getting a deal! Wrong!  You are basically giving them your savings at this point. Because by choosing these keywords or phrases, your both agreeing that they need to get you the most impressions possible at 0.25 cents a piece. They will get it shown to anyone possible on thier site, even if it's someone like me who they suggest should check out the site themselves. I'ts not only a genuine impression with keywords it just cost one of their advertisers 0.25 cents or so because I wanted to see what the sales rep was talking about. It's very simple and clever. Let me back up a second here and give some simple advice when dealing with these types of companies.  Immediataley ask for their number and extension and say, I will call you right back on this number. This will usually send them into a stutter.  Most of the time these types of companies will only be outbound and the so called sales rep will not only be using a fake name, but the number they are calling from is bad or dead. This means you can't call back.  Of course they offer a customer service number, but again. Get the number and call it. Act as if your a customer and call with a general problem. Chances are if the comapny is bad- your customer service call will be taken by another person with a fake name. Like that credit card commercial when you call up and it's some guy outside the country who says "" Hi this is Laura or something "" it's almost comical. Other ideas range from asking about the weather or who the Mayor or Govenor is. Chances are if they say they are in Florida and you see it's rainy online and they say it's sunny. You should hang up the phone.  Never give out your credit or debit card information over the phone and especially your bank information to any company you feel un-easy with. Our suggestion is to use a pre-paid credit card. Companies can not charge you hidden fees, because there is no pre-paid credit card comapny out there that will cover these types of charges. If there is only $5 in a pre-paid account, then only $5 is available. Get it? Contracts? If the company says there is no contract, then there is no contract and since there is no contract allowing them to take funds or sue you for fraudulent charges. It also means that your chances of getting any money back that may have been taken from you are not good at all.  Stay alert! and know that if you are reading this, a good scam artist has read it too and is already thinking of a way around this advice.  There are many ways to advertise your business online, with or without a website. Since the online boom and fading of local newspapers, most local newspaper companies have turned to online advertising and they are usually local and affordable. Another source is the phone book, these companies often have online advertising and the sales repsare more than willing to give a name, phone number and address or meet in person.  Advertising is expensive, but it can be managed and you must stay involved. Don't ever think that you can just give anyone money and your company will be number one. It just does not work like that. Take a little time to educate yourself or waste your time making money and giving it away and as far as www.usdirectory.com goes. I chose not to advertise with this company at this time and I would not recommend them to anyone. I found most of my information by typing in these key words - usdirectory scams and I had more than enough to reference my concerns. ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

Los Angeles California"," We were contacted by Millenium Marketing Systems in June 2010, by phone to set up a home based business in which we were to purchase a website for a one time fee of $529.81 and told that it would make money.approximately 2 weeks later we were contacted by Brian Davis with MMS who began to tell us we needed to purchase advertising in order for the website to make money, we were told we would make $4000 to $5000 a month if we purchased tv infomercials and radio advertisement. He proceeded to tell us that we would make money through debt consolidation, debt settlement, credit restoration and merchant accounts. The cost for this was $25000.00, plus we would have to get a business LLC name, open a checking account in that business name, this is where we would receive payment. We were to carry this on our personal credit for about 30-45 days and only pay 1 minimum payment, then they were to open a line of credit in business name where the balance could be tranfered over. They were to handle everything. We were told by Brian that he would be our consultant through the whole process and help to grow our business one on one. The more money we made the more he made.   Once they received the money, Brian would not return any calls and we found out that the invoices had email blasts and guaranteed targeted visitors what ever that is on them, this is not what was sold to us over phone. We contacted them finally after several days,and Brian said that mistakes were made and the invoices were wrong, he only worked with tv and radio advertising customers, he told us he would take care of this and that new invoices would be sent out. This is the last time we heard from him. Then we began to talk with Allen Hughes, after investigating he also said the wrong paper work was signed and he would send out new invoices, which we never received, from this point on we were left in the dark, trying to figure out how business was to operate and funtion. As time progressed we called daily seeming to never get answers. After 30-45 days we began to ask for reports for business activity. We called for weeks trying to get reports only to get same stall tactics.  Finally received one Aug 24, the report contained email blasts and on line advertisement and we kept telling them we thought this issue was resolved, this was not what we purchased they said they were still resolving the matter and it would be corrected. During this whole process we have had no consultant,and have made no money. We kept asking when it would start making money, each time they would extend the time out from 30 to 60 days and then 60-90 days and then 90-120 days. We see that 3 purchases were made on Oct 13 and 1 on Oct 22, in which we were to receive a check for on Nov. 1, which we have never received. Now all representatives that we were in contact with are no longer there, and now no one is calling. I believe thisto bethe same company as milleium marketing concepts , core payment solutions ,millenuim marketing solution just under new name some one has to do some thing to stop these people. This is a criminal enterprise.I have sworn affadvits from former employees of this company stating so.Owners name Real Fontaine, Jason Wooldrige,Terra Couthrie. I have all these calls recorded also.

Aurora Illinois", We were guaranteed a 25000.00 loan by this company. They told us to send 3 payments up front as a security deposit which was 915.00. Then a week later no one would talk to us and we still hadnt gotten the money. Finally Chris talked to us and told us the reason we hadnt recieve the loan because my credit score had dropped and they wanted us to get insurance on the loan so we sent them another 500.00 dollars and after Chris confirmed they recieved the money wr were blocked from calling them. It had been almost 2weeks since we sent the 500.00 and still no money and no one will talk ro us. ,  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

Aurora Illinois"," Well, it's been a month since I ordered the SEO services from Clear Media Concepts in Seattle with offices in Portland as well. The Sales Director Austin Bucy had a slick pitch and told me I would get 4-12 leads a day and it would result in at least 4-6 sales each month. Apparently he has no idea how I close! If they could deliver 4-12 leads a day I would probably get closer to 15-20 sales a month! The problem...Clear Media Concepts DID NOT deliver! They happily took my $400, made me sign a digital contract so I could NOT get my money back, and started my campaign 21 days after the money transfer.Immediately when the campaign started Austin alerted me that Google would not accept ANY of my Lead Capture Pages because they record IP Stamps. So, we shifted gears and sent the dismal traffic to my Home/Sales page which ANY marketer knows that it is impossible to follow up without capturing their information and consequently became the kiss of death for my SEO campaign!Today I went to the Credit Union and forced a charge back on Clear Media Concepts because they will NOT give me a refund. My card has been cancelled (hassle) and now I am in limbo waiting for the outcome. The Owner of Clear Media Concepts Brandy Engel has been corresponding with me and also notified me that they will assess a $50 charge back fee if they win. I guess that would be called ""financial gloating"".Another funny twist of events. When I originally called to ask for a refund I dialed two separate 800 numbers. One went to a hotel and the other was disconnected. That speaks volumes for Clear Media Concepts. In summation. It looks like I might lose the charge back because I signed a contract based on Austin Bucy's fabrications of leads and sales. Personally, I would NEVER recommend Clear Media Concepts unless of course you want to throw money away! ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0

It made me feel very uncomfortable, but I really needed the job so I tried to ignore it. After a while, Jeff started trying to make me sleep with him at a local hotel to get paid. He told me I wouldn’t get paid unless I met him at the hotel to “pickup my check.” I repeatedly asked him to stop and told him I would never sleep with a married man, let alone my boss. He presented himself as a Christian man and I told him if he kept it up I would tell his wife Debi. It was very humiliating. If you are a girl, don’t get involved working for Jeff Randol. He seems like a nice guy at first, but when you are alone with him, he says and does unthinkable things.  To make matters worse, most of the paychecks he wrote to me bounced, and after some research, I found other people who experienced the same problem in their business dealings with Jeff. Search Jeff Randol on this site and you will see a long history of complaints. He knew I was a single mother with financial struggles and he preyed on me. I have all the Facebook messages he sent me to prove that he tried to take advantage of me. I’m still waiting to get paid by Jeff Randol for the long hours I worked for him! Do not trust Jeff Randol - I wasn’t even able to cash checks that were legit from my new employer at a certain check cashing franchise due to him bouncing so many payroll checks there! Totally embarrassing. When I searched Google in an attempt to collect the monies he still owed me - I saw he had setup yet another business even though he still hasn’t paid many of his past employees. The thought of him preying on other vulnerable single mothers at Consumer Education Outreach makes me sick. Consumer Education Outreach employees beware - he is party in a number of lawsuits and he engages in illegal and unethical dialing practices. I will update this posting once Jeff has paid me the monies owed. This posting is as a warning to all women ",  Computer Marketing Companies ,0
