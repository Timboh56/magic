As a matter of fact, I was instructed to just send them in by Clarence. So the week of August 4th, I sent in my gift cards for my order. The order was suppose to arrive one week later.   On August 12, 2014, I sent in an additional packet of McDonalds Gift Cards to Gift Card Rescue. They were supposed to receive the McDonalds gift cards on Friday August 15, which they did. I have a copy of the receipt from the post office.   I spoke with Gift Card Rescue more than once and they told me they did not get the cards. I even chatted with them and then got an email stating they never got the cards.   On August 21, 2014, at 1:10pm I was informed that Giftcardrescue has not received my gift cards for order J4QC.    “This is a friendly reminder from GiftCardRescue.com that as of 2014-08-19, we have not yet received your gift card for order (J4QC).”     Since I was informed my gift cards were not received I had to open a case with the Post Office. I got a call back from the Post Office Branch Manager and I was informed that the cards were sent. Giftcardrescue continued to insist they never received the gift cards. I was also mailed a mail recovery from by the post office to trace the gift cards.   Later in the day on August 21, 2014 Gift Card Rescue informed me that they received the cards.     The other issue I have is that they were going to buy my cards and then backed out. I was informed yes we want to buy your cards. Then I was informed to sign paperwork to complete the sale.  I did this and sent my drivers license I feel like I they did a bait and switch on me.     It is worth mentioning this company is not an accredited business and has a 0.8 rating on resellerratings.com   I was hoping to workout these problems with this company, but have not been able to.  I have paid more than $5 to ship my items. Now they want me to pay the bill to return the cards with a self-addressed envelope   This is not simple because I have to calculate how much the gift cards weight and buy the postage to ship back, which is a complete nightmare. I have sold similar McDonalds gift cards with giftcards.com and they accepted my gift cards without any issues. They also verified the balance and everything was fine.     In the end, several issues could have been avoided. If they did not want to buy my gift cards they should have processed the first order in a timelier manner to avoid me sending in the additional cards. I should have been informed right before sending my cards I would have to pay for return shipping. I have sent in receipts with proof of purchase for the McDonalds cards. There was no suspicious activity or fraud involved. I was also willing to send the credit card statement in which I bought the cards with. I was even informed not to send in my credit card statement with the proof of purchase.   When this type of issues arrives companies make an effort to resolve the problem with the customer.  Gift Card Rescue has not given me any compensation or replacement for all of my inconveniences. Instead Giftcardrescue has ripped me off and made me feel like crap.   ",Internet

" eBay Scammer Sara Bowler, Sara Bee, Hsandra63 ","  eBay Scammer Sara Bowler, Sara Bee, Hsandra63   
Internet USA ",eBay,6185145020,," eBay User hsandra63 (aka sara bee, aka sara bowler) was the high bidder on an auction for my Louis Vuitton bag, auction id 281393512530 which ended on 7/29/14 for the price of $1246.70 with shipping.  At the time she only had a feedback score of 7, and one was a negative feedback for sending someone an empty box. After not hearing from the buyer despite her bidding less than an hour before the auction’s end, she paid the following day but PayPal held the payment as pending and informed me not to ship until they cleared it, to which I complied. It was after this payment cleared and I pulled up her shipping info that I noticed that the negative feedback had vanished and her feedback percentage had bumped up from a 75 percent to 100 percent Being a bit concerned about the transaction I made sure to have the bag professionally packed and shipped with serial number notated both by photo and receipt from the UPS store. [continued below]....
									
										..... Several day later the bag was signed for by someone with the name of Williams and later that day I received an eBay message stating that there was “damage in shipping” and the LV box was crushed and there were marks on the bag that she was “very upset by” and wanted to know “what we could do” which to me seemed suspect as they did not look like photos of damage that could occur in shipping I made her aware that the item was insured and she thanked me and said she would let me know how that went. I then heard back that she would prefer that I handled it, which normally I would agree to but seeing as how I was certain that the damage was fake and most likely either another item which had heavy wear or some type of substance that she applied I looked into it. It was at this time that I checked the status myself through UPS and saw that when UPS attempted to inspect the bag she refused. When I asked about this, she stated that she must have been out. UPS confirmed that this was not the case but she had indeed refused, not once, but twice and then canceled the claim. She later backtracked and said her boyfriend had answered and didn’t know about the claim. Becoming increasingly irritated, I decided to enter her PayPal email on google, and the first result was Bad Buyer Report. In this report, her name was listed as Bowler. Also, her area code was from Illinois, not Indiana, so I did a little bit of research. Apparently she has a history of different types of scams dating back to (at least) 2009, where I saw a post about her scamming hundreds of people on eBay. This was when she was still living in Dorsey, IL, fresh out of Edwardsville high school. By the way, good job making the honor roll every semester, jackass. Guess they didn’t teach you how to look yourself up on the internet before making eBay accounts. After corresponding with her and getting nowhere and catching her in lie after lie, I contacted eBay and UPS to let them know what was going on. I then decided to check her feedback again and noticed that she left someone a negative feedback, I messaged her and found out that she cancelled Sara’s payment because she did a google search and found out she has scammed people before and would rather have the negative feedback then to lose out on $2000+ and the item. I kick myself in the butt for not being smarter! While messaging each other back and forth, she mentioned that she had threw out the original packaging and was no longer able to get the bag inspected for insurance purposes and wanted to return the handbag back to me. I was already upset by her constant lies and excuse that I wanted more photos of the damage before I decided on what to do and I had to call eBay and ask them what was the next step I needed to take to protect myself, as I never have dealt with anything like this before. Upon further inspection, the second set of photos she sent to me (8/8/14), I noticed the damage somehow got BIGGER than the first set three days earlier. I then printed out the pictures she sent me, and started comparing the damage and to my surprise (or not!) it didn’t match. She must have put some black vinyl substance on it, which was easy to wipe off and had taken it off after sending me the first set of photos thinking I wouldn’t have requested for more. Was it possible that the bag had some sort of flesh eating canvas disease and that was why the black substance kept getting bigger and bigger? Should I be worried and tell her that bag needed to be quarantined for the safety of other high end bags? I will probably never know what she put on this bag. I’ve been calling eBay and UPS every day and updating them on anything new and sending them any information that is required for my case. I even spent the $7.00 to have CarolDiva authenticate the bag, just because she might pull the “it’s not authentic” card on me, even though I purchased this handbag at Louis Vuitton in Saks at Walt Whitman mall around August of last year. Now eBay told me that the only way she will have a slight chance at anything is to submit the bag to UPS with the ORIGINAL PACKAGING and have them inspect the damage but how would that be possible if she toss out the box because she was not “aware” that she needed to keep it.  Will the box magically appear when she snaps her fingers? eBay called me to inform me that they had to refund her the money because she provided the tracking number. The sad part is that it sounded like they almost KNEW that she was scamming me but since there was nothing solid to confirm it, just tons of things to indicate that it was probably the case, they couldn’t do much to help. All he could do was say that they had to close the case due to eBay’s policy but that he wanted me to follow up with him once the item arrives. I guess she does have magical powers and was able to make the box reappear! If you see a Sara Bee, Sara Bowler, Sara Loraine Bowler from Dorsey, IL, Edwardsville, IL, Muncie, IN, DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM HER OR LET HER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM YOU. My next step is to file an IC3 report and to call the local police department in Muncie, IN and make a report. I have attached my conversations with her through eBay, and the tracking information and the “damaged” bag. If you compare the timestamp from our messages to the UPS timestamp, you will notice that she lies and constantly tries to backtrack. ",Internet

I have an audio recording (available upon request) from when comcast sales representative John originally took the sales call.  In it, the following false statements were made by John (Last names available upon request). 1) It was stated that I could cancel at any time for 70% of the remaining contract costs.  The actual contract states this number is 75% indicating that I was not told the truth. 2) It was stated that my contract duration was 12 months.  He again stated later in the phone call that if I were to cancel on day 31 that I would have to pay for the remaining 11 months, further alluding to the fact that he made these statements regarding the contract duration.  The would place the contract end date at 10/29/14.  The actual contract states the contract end date is 10/24/15, indicating that I was not told the truth. 3) It was also stated that I would have 99.9% uptime.  I have been without internet for almost a month. 4) It was stated that a move transfer would be set up for me if I chose to move.  No mention was made of a move installation fee or of the need for a new time-bound contract to be drawn up in order for me to complete my move.  A free installation, however, was mentioned.  Comcast now states It will cost me additional money if I want to move and in order to do so I must sign a new contract. Based on these false statements which improperly informed me of the specifics of the contract which I was about to sign, I am asking for what was promised by the representative.  Since there are three months remaining on my contract according to John's statements... at $49.95/month, the total cancellation fee is as follows: $149.85 (.7) = $104.90.  This is in response to the Comcast claim that my early termination fee is over $1000. Technically speaking, however, Comcast should honor the fact that the sales representative misrepresented the information contained within the original contract and therefore treat the written contract as void.  This means I really shouldn't even be paying my proposed revised early termination fee as the contract is was rendered void by the false statements made by John the sales representative.

I now, thoroughly regret every interaction I ever had with them. The accusation levelled against me (as shown in the link) was that my IP address was used to access a victim’s account. I promptly explained to them that a shared IP address was not sufficient evidence to warrant a permanent ban without appeal and requested to be able to contact someone with the authority to help. Every single time, my request was ignored and I was told to make a new account. To put this into a real life context, it is your bank seizing your assets (because I don't get back what I invested into the game), locking your account and THEN telling you, that if you want to challenge it, you must open a new bank account with them. Throughout this procedure, they have been abysmal both as a company and as customer support. The most serious matter you can encounter (withdrawal of service) is unresolvable by customer support, and any attempt to challenge that fact is met with top-down fascism of ""We can do whatever we want. We don’t need evidence. We own everything you paid for.” That, justly sums up what you can expect from Kill3rCombo. Never admitting fault, never listening to reason, never making ANY effort to accommodate you. I wish this was all that could be said, simply at the sheer absence of customer support, I should have known better. However, I pursued this issue through the forums as well. As linked below. enforums.elswordonline.com/showthread.php?155337-Account-Banned-for-quot-Involvement-in-a-hacking-case-quot This thread became one of the most viewed on the entire website, with almost 100 people replying to it, 90% of them supporting me and wishing they could help. Still, the company made no effort to contact me or resolve the matter. I sent the thread to the Game Masters, the people who are supposed to be able to help with account bans, just to constantly be told that their inboxes were over capacity and that my message was rejected. Finally, I made my last effort. I can honestly hold my hands up and say, I went above and beyond anything that can be expected of a consumer when I attempted to bring the matter to the attention of the Operations Manager of the company, telling him I did not want to have to write reviews that would harm the company because of their appalling support and procedures (see link below). I offered them free consultancy as a former forensic I.T. systems assistant, to improve their investigation procedures, and to review the amount of evidence required to completely ban account. I received no reply. imgur.com/a/XfeG1 Please, avoid this company at all costs. Your account and efforts are not secure. You are at a constant threat of their flawed investigation methods. Playing without breaking the rules for 233 hours, I can attest that you can lose everything at their whim. You cannot discuss it, you cannot fight it, and you cannot do anything. Simply because, they do not want you to. They will completely ignore and disregard you as if you were the ugliest part of their operation, just because you have standards of what you expect.

I called Earthlink to advise them this but they did not believe me. I offered to give them the contact number for the technician but they transferred me to tech support. They insisted internet was available and put in the service request again. I was again called by another local technician who told me that internet was not available where I live.

Today I received a bill from Earthlink for $110. I called them and they would not talk to me for several minutes because the person kept asking me for my email password which I had no clue what he was talking about. He finally told me that there was an early termination fee and he said something about the bill being due to me disputing the charges with my credit card company.

In the end, this is the most expensive ""service"" available. We found another provider, and we called to cancel HughesNet. It was a fight just to get the contract canceled. When we explained that it seemed unjust to have to pay $144 to cancel a service we never truly received, the best they could offer was to reduce the fee to $72 (and, because they charge a month in advance, they are still keeping our $79 fee that was just paid with only 4 days into that month's service).     ",Internet

Below is an excerpt of one of his emails: Darling, yesterday was the day we had everything rounded up. The memorandum was given to the directors from Vanguard stating how the fund disbursement should be done through the Vanguard Magellan share purchase arrangement in the name of the partners. [continued below]....
									
										..... As you know, your name represents me in the partnership so one of our director's was wise or should I say stupid enough to ask the question about the only female partner not being present. The answer came from my client, the investor. He told them that you can see that she is based in the States as her address shows. He also told them that she left back to the States and requested that she can be well represented by her fund manager Mr.Mario Valentino as she was already an investor with Vanguard international.> > The total transaction was worth 2, 000,000 (Two Million) Barrel of raw crude at the sum of $73 Dollars Per Barrel. That makes the total transaction sum to be $146,000,000 (One Hundred and forty Six million) Dollars. After the total deductions of transaction subsidy, investors deposit commitment, government settlement and other miscellaneous expense which was negotiated and drafted by me as part of the reason why I was invited in the team, the total offshore fund remittance by the buyer to the Vanguard account rounded up to the sum of $81,000,000.00 (Eighty One million ) Dollars. From this total transaction sum, I am only entitled to 10% of the money as the financial broker and estimate consultant and fund receiving partnership body (which in this case Vanguard international)> > Let me cut the long story short as it may take me more 50 pages to explain all this. The summary of the transaction is that when the company receive this money, they will make purchase of Magellan shares on ground for trade on our behalf on the percentage stipulated in the memorandum. What this means is that the company will be purchasing the value of $8,100,000 (Eight Million and One hundred Thousand) Dollars worth of Vanguard Magellan capital shares in your name as the transaction deed stipulated. This amount will acquire the total of 128,571 Vanguard Magellan capital shares in your name. Being a direct share buy, the company will contact you to provide them information required for the issuance of the investors’ certificate. All you will need to do is to reconfirm for them the information they already have in the memorandum. I know this may be sounding a bit complex but I want you to know that I am still around to handle this and that there is> nothing illegal in this transaction. This transaction is still 100% legitimate so do not let the complex nature of my explanation confuse you.> > Honey, I will need to stay here till early next week when the whole fund must have been confirmed by my office in the Vanguard offshore account. When the share purchase is completed, we will apply for the resell of the shares from the company which I know most of my partners will be willing to buy at once. Once we sell of the Vanguard shares and all the other shares I will be raking up about $11,000,000.00(eleven million dollars) Once the shares are sold, the fund will be released in your name since the share was on your name. The moment you have confirmed the money, I will then fly down to States for a new life with you.

Comcast also has a rotten practice of billing in advance (you pay for services you haven't yet received). Worst of all, it took me MONTHS to get them to disconnect TV service I never wanted.  After I returned the equipment and told them NO MORE TV, they started with harassing phonecalls to try to get me to sign up for the services that I had just told them to discontinue. Thoroughly disgusted.  I have a bad feeling that Verizon won't be any better - I hope I'm wrong about that. ",Internet

Centurylink,"  Centurylink   
Nationwide USA ",www.centurylink.com,201-737-3789,," I contacted Centurylink through an internet ad I saw online.  I explained in very clear details what my needs were;  I explained I had just signed up for Suddenlink three weeks prior and was promised 50 mbps for an additional fee.  Not once could I reach 50mbps and this was even after four different technicians came to my home. Suddenlink finally admitted they could not guarantee me 50mbps even though I was paying for it.  I made it very clear to both companies I needed a minimum of 50 mbps because I run 42 websites and trade the markets from home as well as sell trading software and provided demos for prospective customers.  The young lady representing Centurylink proceeded to tell me Centurylink offered fiber optics in my area at 10mpbs but since it was fiber optics vs cable the speed of 10 mbps for fiber optics was the equivalent of 100 mbps.  I repeatedly explained I needed a minimum of 50mbps.  She assured me I could get 50mbps plus phone service for $59 per month.  I agreed to sign up for the service and she transferred me to Jose employee ID# 9832398.  Jose again reiterated I would be getting the equivalent of 50 mbps with their service using fiber optics.  I signed up for service.  After three phone calls and two different techs came out the line was active.  Yet no internet service.  I called the technical support line and after 1 hour I was told there was something not connected on their end.  He had to put in a ticket to get it fixed and called me back 30 minutes later. Finally the internet is working but the maximum speed is 10 mbps.  I’ve been out of the market for a few days and now I hit the ground running with trades as the market is moving fast.  I submit first 10 trades, missed the trade due to slow internet speed, loss $3200.  I submit several trades the next day as the market is up over 100 points again slow speeds missed the trades and hit with a $2700 loss.  I reset modem and tried selling a few positions, left $5400 on the table due to slow internet speed.  By this time I’m furious.  I call Centurylink and explained I’m supposed to be getting a minimum of 50 mbps.  I’m told that’s impossible because they don’t offer 50mbps.  I asked to speak to Jose, “sorry we don’t transfer calls”.  I asked where he’s located “sorry we don’t have that information”.  I asked for a supervisor and was told by the supervisor, I was miss informed as fiber optics is not offered in my area or even in the state.   By now the end of week 1 of Centurylink I’m out of $20,000 in losses due to poor internet services.  Okay so I try the phone service I signed up for; the static and clunky service is so bad my broker can’t hear me. I called him on Skype and because the internet service is so slow Skype does not work either. I’m now using my cell phone to make trades which has its problems. I’m behind on updating my websites because using FTP the internet connection should be instantaneous and it cuts off. I’m having to update website manually through the hosting company, this takes forever. I just moved to Texas from New York.  In NYC I had 100mbps for $79 and Centurylink wanted to charge me $79 just to get 25 mbps after I complained.  I was told Texas is a backward state.  I was fairly warned of this and it’s been a nightmare.  I can’t believe a simple commodity like internet speed is so difficult.  Losing money in the market is a given, but losing money because of negligence by Centurylink makes me furious.     When employees of a company cannot reveal their last name to customers and hide behind ID numbers, that’s a red flag there’s something wrong.  I was lied to and deceived into signing up for their service. How does an individual sleep at night when they spend their working hours deceiving consumers and the company allows and encourage such deception.  No amount of money is worth compromising your integrity for a pay check.   I could file a law suit against Centurylink but I did not get him on tape.  I will however call them again and act as a new customer and explain again what I need.  If the person I get tells me again I can get fiber optics, I will have them on tape and with this I will have the basis for the lawsuit for deceptive practice and negligence.

Tracy Bernardo,"  Tracy Bernardo  915 L Street, Suite C-325 
Sacramento, California USA ",www.sacramentowebdesigngroup.com,9165728084,," Sociopaths have no heart, no conscience and no remorse. They will lie, cheat and steal from you, and then tell everyone that it is all your fault. Why is it so critical for you to know about sociopaths? Because millions of sociopaths, also called psychopaths, are living among us. Yes, many of them are criminals, locked up in jail. But far more are on the street, hurting people without breaking laws, operating in the gray areas between legal and illegal, or simply eluding the authorities. They can appear to be normal, but they pose a tremendous threat to us all.  Sounds exactly like Tracy Bernardo. He has lied, cheat and stole from his clients then when they spoke out about him, he called them liars, he called them his competitors, he's called them irresponsible customers, he's called them thieves and child molesters. He was basically operating in the illegal areas because bait and switching is illegal. [continued below]....
									
										..... Many customers have said he appeared to be normal until they handed over the money, that’s when he stops picking up phones and responding to emails. Be careful anyone who might run into Tracy Bernardo. I believe sociopaths needs to be exposed especially the ones that are online doing business to warn others. He is filled with nothing but lies, he has told one of his clients that she wasn't a client and had never purchase anything from him, then on the same page he changes his story and said shes the most irresponsible pig owner to have purchase from him. When he rages he does not stop to think and rationalize things out, he just wants to dish out the most hateful attacks he can on the person to make them look bad with lies. Tracy Bernardo is a pathological liar, he lies so much it's baffling, he does not have an inch of integrity in his body. He knows this as well but is afraid to look in the mirror, he has a lot of dirt on his hands which is why he goes from one company to the next and after all those years of doing business you can't find one person to back up his business ethics. Tracy Bernardo is a shady businessman, he does not invest into his business long-term, he wants his money quick and fast which leads him into unethical business practices. Just look at his new company www.sacramentowebdesigngroup.com he popped up with after his pig scam, he tried to reinvent himself even going far as writing fake articles that boasted him as ""The best web consultant in Sacramento"". He's not fooling anyone, with his track record of lies and deceit its about time he gets exposed. He makes his money by being dishonest and its obvious. Fake articles, fake revenue claims, fake persona, fake stories...ect The fact that he lies in a snap of a finger makes him dangerous to do business with, if he doesn't get his way with you be prepared to have your business slandered by him with lies, if he knows where you work he'll pry into your personal life to blackmail and slander you. It has happened to many victims and will happen to you as well. This man is sick!       ",Internet

I immediately send the watch back, untouched, unused, in the original package. Before I did so, I took pictures of front and back of the watch for evidence. I did not hear anything for weeks, so I send an email again (to Amazon) and asked where the refund was? I got a email from Jomashop saying they had not received it yet... eventhough my tracking said that it was delivered. They the said it would take some time to process. After I did not hear from them for another week I wrote them again. This time they said they had received it , but it was worn and had scratches.

Sadly, this isn't a reality on the popular social media website Facebook. Currently, they permit users to stalk and harass innocent victims through their site with libelous pages. When a victim reports the violation to Facebook, they simply look in the other direction and allow the abuse to continue. Case in point, my stalker named Dennis who is currently using Facebook to further damage my reputation. He's the individual I filed a previous report about. Facebook has a responsibility to protect their users who report abuse but instead, they do nothing but take sides with the perpetrators. So, this of course means that a predator can do whatever he/she wants because Facebook will just let it go on regardless of how the victims feel. It states in their ""Community Standards"" that harassment is supposedly not allowed but yet when someone files a legitimate complaint against someone committing the act, Facebook sends back a generic response claiming that the abuse doesn't violate their ""Community Standards"" which naturally leaves the victim out in the cold. In addition, Facebook allows pages depicting horrible abuse against animals but takes the time to remove pages that speak out against this sort of thing. They ignore legitimate complaints of this nature too. This is totally unacceptable and I refuse to stand for it any longer! Facebook needs to change their policies or at least follow their own rules so that nobody will have to worry about being abused on their website any longer! Furthermore, they need to stop favoring selected individuals and do the right thing for once! Obviously, unless it's happening to THEM, it doesn't matter if someone else is getting abused.

The virgin mobile representatives seem clueless to helping me as a Faithful paying customer and their lack of information for policy change is very unprofessional.

Why can't I have the $35 unlimited plan if they still offered it, it just doesn't make any sense. And why don't the representatives have any knowledge about the practices of version mobile policy changes. As a good paying customer this is totally unfair practice. ",Internet

I waited and did not get the watch before the 27th. So I did not want the watch anylonger. It was quiet hard to try to get a RMA (return number) luckely I had bought this watch through Amazon.com. I wrote them and complained that I had difficulties getting the return number from Jomashop. After I did this, I finally got the return number. I immediately send the watch back, untouched, unused, in the original package. Before I did so, I took pictures of front and back of the watch for evidence. I did not hear anything for weeks, so I send an email again (to Amazon) and asked where the refund was? I got a email from Jomashop saying they had not received it yet... eventhough my tracking said that it was delivered. They the said it would take some time to process. After I did not hear from them for another week I wrote them again. This time they said they had received it , but it was worn and had scratches. I told them that I had taken pictures before I send the watch and send it to them as evidence. And ask to show me those scratches. After some time they send me the pictures... and they did not show scratches. It went back and forth with no result. Now I have put a claim in with Amazon .com and hopefully they will refund me through their A to Z Insurance.  Jomashop has the worst customer service and they are a bunch of crooks.

That's right - if they owe you money and it's a small amount, they don't deem it worth their while to refund what they owe you and ""write it off."" I have called for 5 1/2 months and they told me this policy and when I asked to speak to a supervisor was told that she or he would override this policy and they were sending a check out for the sum of my balance. They have lied to me repeatedly! I have not received a check. Each time I get the same story. That's stealing! If I owed them money, they would most certainly demand it, even if it is a small amount. This is plain and simple, stealing. It is unethical and poor business practice. Whoever heard of a company that if you owe them money, you need to pay, but if they owe you money, they don't? And then, if stealing wasn't bad enough, they have lied repeatedly! I guess they figure that after a certain amount of time, I will just give up and stop calling. One customer service rep even told me the supervisor wasn't available but he or she would call me the next day - never happened. Who ever heard of not giving someone back the balance on their account, or even the change due with a purchase? Scoundrels! And it's not like their service is that good - in fact, it's pretty darn bad sometimes. Several times during the years I had them as my ISP I was without email service for weeks at a time before I could get anyone who spoke decent English and knew what they were doing to help me!

He is working in the Philippines. He was working on an engineering project. He was all for long flattering emails.  Sometimes if something to good to be true, I need to check, deeper. I did not get to the point where he asked for money. I have reported it to the Attorney General’s Office, sent a email to ‘Our Time’ and Match.com.  But I wish there was something that could be done about cons like this.  He has 2 phone numbers that I know of: 515-259-0911 and 806-318-6064.  There were 7 other complaints in 2013 on the 806 phone number, and he got money from some, he just changed numbers.   ",Internet
WWW.JUSTCLOUD.COM,"  WWW.JUSTCLOUD.COM  PO BOX 639 
 KIRKLAND, Washington USA ",WWW.JUSTCLOUD.COM,4252740657,," I researched companies online looking for the best cloud storage service out there.  I chose JustCloud.com because they offered ""unlimited storage"".  I signed up and paif their annual fee, then I downloaded the software and straight away it detected my Raid external harddrive, which had approx 2TB used and 2TB free space, I was told that I needed to pay extra to back that drive up, I paid another fee and it started uploading.  After one month of constant uploading, 24 / 7 they had only backed up 1/3 of the 2TB that I needed to back up, naturally I was disgusted by this, I contacted the customer support at Justcloud and they just kept responding with a semi automated reply, a reply that was standard, pre written.  After getting very irrate with them someone replied and stated that I should pay an additional fee for a service that they call ""super charged"", which I did, but within a few days I realised that the only thing that was being supercharged was my credit card. I complained again and they tried to tell me that it must be my upload speed, because they had super fast speeds on their end.  I told them that my upload speed was 8MBS, I tested it, but their service was only able to upload at approx 1MBS, even after the ""turbo charged"" add on. After approximatley 3 months (yes three months) the 2TB raid hard drive was 95% backed up and justcloud sent me an email stating that I needed to upgrade to ""business service"" which had a monthly fee.  Naturally by this time I realise that I had been totally jipped. I sent them an appeasing email stating that I was OK with the service and that I had and that I did not wish to upgrade, I also asked them to specifically tell me exactly where and how I had exceeded the services covered under the plan that I was currently on, they did not reply, I sent another email asking again, why I needed to upgrade, no reply. The next trick up their sleeve was to block me from any further uploads, the software started up every morning and I could see it reading my new files on the raid drive, it looked as though it was working normally, but then when I tried to send a link to someone so that they could view some photos via Justcloud, I realised that my new files had not been backed up.  I contacted customer support and let them know about this error.  They responded and told me that my account had been suspended from uploading and that I needed to upgrade if I wished to continue using their service.  I do not know how long ago they blocked me from uploading, but I did not receive any notification from Justcloud stating that I had been blocked. Since this time I have researched the company and it appears that they are doing this to many people, my case is not unique.  Justcloud has added some verbiage to their website about their ""personal use, Unlimited package"" haveing some restrictions about bandwidth usage and space limits, however at the time I signed up and paid, their was no specifications about limited space usage.  Just clouds software picked up my Raid harddrive and clearly stated that they could ""Back it up"", the software read the 2TB that has been used and offered to back it up for a fee, they didn't say, we will back up 1.7TB then ask you for more money. I believe the practises of Justcloud are a fine example of False advertising and I am sure that a good Class action lawsuit attorney could find a slew of other violations in their business practises.  I only hope that someone starts a class action lawsuit against this copany.   ",Internet

CJ nicely explained what happened and I asked Tracey for my money back. Not only did he not provide me with a pig but he embezzled 3 years worth of savings from me. I have a lawyer trying to get my money back. Tracey has thrown a huge wrench in my finances and has been an incessant headache.  If you ever come across this man I have one word of advice for you, run. He is a nasty old man who is money driven and will step over his own mother to make a buck. He is soulless, he will resort to anything to get his way. Once you send this man your money, it's gone forever.

My id identity was stolen because Adobe was sloppy in the way they DID NOT protect our personal info.  The letter from Adobe said, ""customer names, payment card expriation dates,... payment card nubers, and other info... third party used our systems to decrypt card numbers.""  My next complaint is that Adobe failed to mention to me in the letter and elsewhere that 3 or more million users' private personal sensitive financial credit card info was also stolen. How could such an important detail be left out? How could Adobe be so GROSSLY NEGLIGENT in protecting our personal data? The next complaint I have is that ADOBE DOES NOT ANSWER THEIR PHONES. Why do I need to wait on hold or talk to people that don't speak English? Why am I being transferred to foreign countries?  The letter says Adobe ""DEEPLY REGRETS"" this hacking incident. Really? If you regret it so much that you were so sloppy to let my address, phone number, and other personal info out to hacker thieves - then why isn't someone picking up the phone right away? I'm an American. I'm an English speaker - as you know because the letter is in English. Then give me a phone number where I can talk to someone that won't put me on hold - that doesn't have a complicated number / dial system to call into.  Chief Security Officer Brad Arkin signs the letter - the same one saying they ""deeply regret"" losing our id. If so, then where is HIS phone number? Why can't I call him to address the problems this has caused? Another complaint I have is the passive and lazy nature of the letter. Really? You just gave away 3 million users' private id info and all you offer is credit monitoring that I have to sign up for by Feb? And then what? Will you start charging my credit card after I forget in one year to cancel the monitoring?  There should - I strongly advise - a class action lawsuit over this matter. A year of credit monitoring simply does not amount to any fraction of the problems you have caused 3 million + customers.  And what happens next year? What if the hacker thieves abuse my credit 2 or 5 years from now?  Or 10 years from now? SHAME ON YOU ADOBE! I WANT A NUMBER I CAN CALL YOU DIRECT AT! NOT ANY RECORDINGS.

Wikipedia,"  Wikipedia  149 New Montgomery Street Third Floor 
San Francisco, California USA ",www.wikipedia.com,1-415-839-6885,," Most people by now realize just what sort of place ""Wikipedia"" is on the web but there are deeper issues left unexplored. What many might not know is how ""Wikipedia"" selectively censors contributors to their website with the help of free speech violators. These violators will censor or speedily delete your articles simply because they don't agree with the content and if you dare to protest, they threaten to ban you from contributing in the future. In addition, they will censor out any valid edits you make to other articles on their website if they don't agree with your statements. They make false claims that you are in violation of their so-called ""rules"" and when you speak out in protest, more threats from them follow. The top offenders of these acts go by the user names: C.Fred, Largo Plazo, and 220 of Borg. A friend of mine for example attempted to write an article about me at my request and the ""Wikipedia"" gestapo were right there to interfere with it. He protested against their unjust actions and they deleted the article quick as a flash. Then, they made false claims that there wasn't enough ""reliable sources"" to corroborate certain statements within the original article when in fact there WAS sufficient sources noted by the author. The reason I wanted a ""Wikipedia"" page of my own is because I felt it was necessary to put something out there which would be in contrast to libelous statements a stalker has made against me. I wrote my first report here about this stalker who's name is Dennis. Unfortunately, the ""Wikipedia"" gestapo decided to support and protect my stalker rather than permit my friend to submit something that would shed a positive light on me. It has become abundantly clear they would rather support a criminal instead of allowing an article submission that would essentially help to repair an innocent victim's reputation. It is also apparent they care nothing for the decent contributions of others outside their little circle and only THEIR words are good enough for publication on the website. Regardless of how many valid points you make or concrete facts you have, the ""Wikipedia"" censors will prohibit an opposing point of view whenever they feel like it simply because they assume they can. To make matters worse, they will bend the rules for certain people they favor while others whom are unfavored are forced to toe the line. For example, they have a policy against people writing articles about themselves because it supposedly is a ""conflict of interest"" but someone like my stalker who HAS created an article about himself is exempt from this rule.

I also purchased the Video relay system along with the alarm it must have internet to be operational it keep going offline it was offline for over 2 weeks during that time I was still charged, I contacted customer service they told me the equipment was fine that I was the problem and did not know how to use the equipment ""its been in my office a year"" WARNING if you have an issue with any part of your service with Alarm Force they will not take any responsibility for the equipment only blame the consumer. I asked several times to be let out of my contract due to faulty equipment and numerous service intteruptions.  I could go on I am only WARNING any consumer that is thinking of using Alarm Force to think twice there service is not good there customer service is extremly RUDE just read some of these complaints don't take my word for it and you will be stuck paying a company for 3 years even when your service is down it will take 2 weeks to get a technician out to fix the problem and even then they will always say there system is operating fine even when they know its not. Please also know they monitor everything in Canda and the response time from the time your alarm goes off and the first intial comminication is over 1 minute and the police have still not been called at this point your home will be cleaned out before authorites even arrive believe me.  PLEASE DON""T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID there are allot better and more reputable american companies don't use this poor Canadian company you will be sorry.  ",Internet
Earthlink,"  Earthlink   
Internet USA ",earthlink.net,888-EARTHLINK,," In July 2013, I called to cancel my internet service and they offered one month free; when the free month was up I could call and re-start service at a lower cost.  I did not call. I noticed in September that I had a charge for monthly service from Earthlink on my bank statement.  I called in October and asked for a refund of the charges and they said that I had not cancelled because I accepted one free month.  Even though they have a no refund policy, after an hour and talking to three different people, I convinced them to give me a refund but they would only do it for one month.  As I called on the day that the October charge was pending, they could not refund that charge.  I called my bank and cancelled my bank card so that the charge would be denied.  The next day, Earthlink called and left a message that the charge had been denied and so the refund was going toward the October bill. Therefore, there would be no refund to my account.  A week later I was billed for service from October 23 - November 22, 2013 for service that I had now cancelled twice.  I called to discuss the matter during the customer service hours listed on the bill but after many mechanical questions, I reached a line that told me that the service center was closed.  I will have to wait until next week to battle the company again to get the charge removed.  Based on other complaints on this and other sites, I look forward to a long and protracted fight.  I would discourage anyone from using Earthlink's service.   ",Internet

Exact Data,"  Exact Data   328 S. Jefferson Street, Suite 550 
Chicago, Illinois USA ",http://www.consumerbase.com/index.html,312-229-5492,," I agreed to purchase 6,558 position/role- specific emails from Exact Data.  After spending numerous hours evaluating the quality of the list we purchased from Exact Data and trying to improve it, we concluded that the email addresses were no where near as accurate as we had been led to believe they would be.  Manual checks quickly confirmed that the ""100% deliverable guarantee""  that had been implied would certainly not hold if we were use the email addresses.  We have purchased several similar data files in the past and the information provided by Exact Data has been the worst to date.   The major problems we have encountered regarding the list:   
1. Very low ratio of email addresses that can be validated by manual look-up. Spent hours to verify the randomly selected records from the list and found very few that are current and available on district web sites.
2. Multiple records for the same job title. Example: there are 39 records with ""Human Resources"" in the title and 35 are HR director or HR manager within a single school district   3. District name was not accompanied by state and city as we were told it would be.     Bottom line is the data we were promised does not stack up with the data we actually received.  We certainly do not feel that we got what we paid for.     In retrospect, I now realize that most of the ""promises"" were delivered solely via phone.  Exact Data did not address specific questions we sent by email.  They chose to respond to certain issues via phone and phone alone, thereby making it much more difficult to prove the deceitful manuevers that they engaged in.     We contacted Exact Data several times to express our concerns.  We wanted to send the data back and receive a refund.  At this point, we emcountered an extremely dismissive and unhelpful ""Client Support Coordinator"" who proceed to argue with our experience of the transaction/exchange to date and repeatedly cite the purchase order we signed as if this vague document justified the shoddy data we had receievd and the shady business practices we had been subjected to.  They did provide us additional email contacts but they failed to appreoctae that we were not simply looking for a gross number of email addresses. As we had made clear during the intitial stages of communication, we were looking to purchase accurate contact information for a strategically selected audience.     Preliminary conversations led us to believe that we could expect accurate email and mailing addresses for the contacts.  As stated in one of the email exchanges Exact Data claimed ""we guarantee 100% delivery. I would like to stress the 100% delivery. You are getting what you pay for. All of our email contacts are white listed through our servers, double opt-in, CAN-SPAM compliant and ECOA verified every 30 days ensuring validity.""  Later it was made clearer that this guarantee only held when Exact Data ""delivers email campaigns from our servers, we can guarantee delivery rate because if we see that any of the contacts are not good upon deployment, we keep deploying until 100% of the contacts in which you purchased are reached. So, if 50 emails hard bounced back, we’ll deploy 50 more. If 25 of those bounce back, we’ll deploy 25 more.""  Adding new emails to replace those that bounced would obviously not constitute 100% delivery of the contacts initially presented. This definition of ""100% delivery""is misleading and, again, contrary to our objectives as discussed with Exact Data prior to purchasing the flawed data set.  This ongoing deployment of addiitonal email addresses is far from 100% delivery.  It is more akin to ""shooting in the dark"" until a soemthing has been delivered to anyone a set numebr of times.  We are not interested in simply delivering emails to random individuals.  We are attempting to strategically connect with individuals of a particular type.  Hence, we are not interested in deploying additional emails to simply reach a meaningless quota.  For several reasons, we cannot afford to transmit large number of bounces; nor squander resources on communicating with large numbers of individuals who do not fit with our target audience.   We were repeatedly and rudely referred back to the purchase order as if this limited document provided aequate rationale for everything that had occurred.  The purchase order states ""nationwide"" and ""client deploy multi-use.""  Given what we had discussed on the phone regarding mailing address information, I presumed that ""multiple use"" referred to mailing address in addtion to email address. Later, I was told that ""multi-use indicates that you are able to use the e –mail list multiple times.""  Obvioulsy, one may use an email address more than once.  Why would ""Email-Client Deploy Multi-Use"" mean that were permitted to use the email multiple times as opposed to providing multiple means of client deployment including email and snail mail.  The purchas eorder also states ""Nationwide.""   How would we know that the contacts were nationwide unless we had a physical address to confirm as much?  More importantly, why would the purchase order trump conversations that we had previously had?  The purchase order clearly does not indicate that we would not be getting the mailing addresses as we had beenn told we would.    Finally, I offered to validate the contact information through a third party at our expense and deploy the emails ourselves and pay Exact Data for the emails that were actually delivered to people in positions that we were actually interested in connecting with.  Exact Data proceeded to provide us a small subset of mailing addresses to accompany thier significantly flawed and over-priced data set and indicated that this was their ""final resolution.""                    ",Internet

Fort Sill, Oklahoma USA ",www.suddenlink.com,58059100402489954,," I recently moved from Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA to Fort Sill, OK.  When I arrived I started shopping around for internet.  The only company I could find on Fort Sill was Suddenlink.  They advertised 10 Mbps speeds which were slow to what I am used to but better than nothing. I scheduled hook up and they came and set me up.  They charged me for the first month's bill at the installation.  They also installed a wireless router/modem combo.  This caused all sorts of problems.  When I hooked up wirelessly the speed was 1Mbps or less.  When I connected direcly to the modem speeds were up around 7Mbps, but still below advertised. I had them replace the modem with a standard cable modem and I hooked it up to a wireless router of my own.  Speeds were decent for a few weeks.  Now I find it rare to reach speeds above 3 Mbps. The house I live in is brand new, as in I am the first person to live in it, in a brand new neighborhood on post. [continued below]....
									
										.....  All of the lines are new even.  I understand that multiple users can clog cable internet, but if the absolute max is 10Mbps and you put 200 people on it in a small area, you have to account for that when you advertise speeds. I have someone coming out for service on tuesday to see if they can fix it but I have little hope.  If they can't fix it I will be reporting them to Fort Sill so we can hopefully get a good internet provider on post instead of suddenlink.

Cox Communications,"  Cox Communications   
El Cajon, California USA ",http://ww2.cox.com/,619-262-1122,," Hello All,   For weeks now my household has been having problems with the internet disconnecting, and taking hours to reset, even after unplugging the router, modem, and connecting the internet from modem straight to computer (very important to remember).  Finally I called Cox to file a complaint, not only that I expect to be prorated for all of the outages I was experiencing, but also for them to fix the damn thing.  There's nothing worse than having choosing to stay at work to take an online university test online so it doesn't drop in the middle of it (therefore ruining a grade and GPA), but also because a member of my household works from home in the evenings and weekend too.  What is worth pointing out, is that the Cox service would drop almost like clockwork at the same time every other day, then take 1-2 hours to come back online again.  Okay, so on with the complaint.  The first time, the representative told me that I need to buy a new router, I didn't.  I went to the movies, came home, and it was working perfectly fine.  The second time I called, I was told the same, so I took the router to a friends place to test, and it worked perfectly fine yet again, then when I returned home, it again worked.  Thrid time, I was told again to finally replace the router, and as the internet had been out for 4+ hours, I decided to drive to Bestbuy and buy a new one.  When I got home, everything worked fine.  Fast forward 3 weeks, the same EXACT issues began again, modem resets, and ther ""online"" light keeps flashing.  I let it go a couple of times as it lasted only an hour, but then it started taking hours for the modem to come on.  I called about 4 times, and was told each time that as my modem is out of warrenty, I need to buy a new one, even though after those 4 times it worked in two to five hours later (always around the same time the internet cut off when Cox blamed the modem).  Then comes the fifth time I contacted Cox technicians about the issue (a few days ago).  The lady rudely cut me off everytime I told her to stop blaming it on the modem and get someone out to fix it, she hung up on me.  So what did I do, I jumped in the car, and went and bought a brand new modem, the same as I had before.  While at Bestbuy, the gentleman told me that Cox had teamed up with Mottorola for a better modem to get the most of the internet I was paying for, hmm I thought!  This was starting to sound like a ploy to force customers to purchase newer modems, i.e. more revenue.  When I returned home and carefully took the new modem out of the box (I planned on proving a point) so I can return it, it worked for five minutes, then what do you know, same problems again, tha tlasted a few more hours. Oh, and the Cox technician stopped by today, went into the apartment complex cable/internet area and what were his words...  ""it seems that there are lose cables in here.""  He didn't even come into my apartment, while yesterday Cox had the audacity to say ""we'll waiver the tech. fee"", you're damn right, it's your equipment, not mine, especially after you mae me pay for items I never did need!       ",Internet
Hughes Net,"  Hughes Net   
Internet, Select State/Province USA ",www.hughesnet.com,1-866-347-3292,," First of all, I could (already have basically with all the notes I've taken) write a book about this horrible experience.  I signed up for Hughes Net in the summer of 2012. It was very slow and wouldn't hardly work. My mother in law bought us Netflix and Roku as a gift. We used it for one day and then it wouldn't work anymore. It was too slow. I had had to call the company numerous times because our Internet just wouldn't work. After 6 months of calling very often a representative suggested I upgrade. After he explained the service would be exactly like what we had but more of it and faster, for the exact same cost each month and free equipment. Then he slipped in at the end that I would have a 24 mo contract. I wasn't happy but he guaranteed me that we would never run out of Internet or go over usage again and we could stream netflix all the time with this new upgrade, so I agreed. Well, the first bill was almost $200 (compared to our normal $50/mo)! I was told that was set up fees, etc. I paid it. We were able to use Netflix for 2 days and after that it showed we had reached our allowed usage. So I waited a couple of days, b/c our old plan renewed Internet service every night at midnight. It never would renew so I called and they told me that we had to wait an entire month to get our Internet usage restarted! I was so mad that they didn't explain that to me, but dealt with that. After a month, when I paid my bill and they renewed our service it wouldn't come back on! That was probably in March of 2013. I have been paying for Internet every single month and not had service (it is now October! and it is automatically withdrawn from my checking acct each month). I was told if I stopped payment I would be charged the early cancelation fee, so I've kept giving them chance after chance to fix it. They determined our modem was ""leaking"" Internet...??? and sent a new modem. We hooked it up and sent the old one back and still not working. I have called at least weekly since March (would call more often if I had time and if my heart/blood pressure could handle that!) and every time they tell me (as if I don't know b/c of my status meter) that we have gone over our monthly allowed usage. I tell them every time I have not gone over b/c I haven't even had any Internet so I couldn't possibly have gone over. Their customer service is horrible. I hate the automated system that can't understand anything I say and won't let me choose to talk to a rep directly. It takes at least 10-20 mins to speak to someone. When I do get to talk to someone they don't speak English well and are hard to hear, much less understand. Then they are rude to me as if they can't understand ME!  I finally called day before yesterday to request to cancel our service and not have to pay the cancellation fee since it is their fault I am canceling. The rep told me they would NEVER do that for any reason and kept trying to ""troubleshoot"" my problem. I kept telling him they obviously couldn't fix it and I am sick to death of spending hours on the phone unplugging and replugging that modem in. It's obviously not going to work! I eventually got to speak to a manager and was told the exact same thing. I told him that was very bad business. Why is it okay for them not to hold up their end of the contract (NO service) but not okay for me to cancel? He offered (finally after 45 mins) to send someone to my house to work on it. I relunctantly agreed, for my main goal was to cancel my service so I could move on to another company.  I cannot handle this anymore, it seriously is causing me so much anger and stress I am just sick. It is so unfair and I have played nice and never once not paid my bill. I have spent hundreds of dollars on service I have not been able to use in almost a year! I contacted a lawyer and have an appt this next week with him. He told me to bring my copy of my contract and my bills, however, I never got a contract and since it is automatically deducted from my checking acct I don't even receive bills! I don't know how this will work out, but I hope and pray I get out of that contract and I would not be completely happy until I got reimbursed for all these months of no service, however, I am not expecting that!

The sales process begins with calling the business owners and describing the benefits of working with Local Lighthouse, explaining how their program works, discussing price points, and educating them on online marketing services. Once those details are discussed and the business owner expresses interest, they are then transferred to customer service to confirm their business information and campaign details. Local Lighthouse Customer Support & Complaint Resolution

At times, a client may not be satisfied with the product or service they received. Mr. Paik explains that sometimes this can happen when the client does not like the look of their website. However, he states that this is not a common complaint for Local Lighthouse. To resolve the issue, Mr. Paik explains, “The customer service team will discuss with the client the part of the website that they were unhappy with, [and then] they will create a support ticket for the web design department. Then the designers will complete the necessary changes for the client. Customer service will be notified the changes have been made, and then the client will be contacted that their website has been updated.” After this process, Mr. Paik explains that generally the client is happy and satisfied with the re-design. However, if they are still unhappy, the team at Local Lighthouse will do another revision until the customer is satisfied. Local Lighthouse is also willing to negotiate a refund, possibly up to 100%, if the client is completely unsatisfied with the final product and no longer wishes to work with the company. Once a complaint is resolved, Local Lighthouse representatives follow up with the client to make sure they feel the issue has been resolved and are now satisfied with the end result.

Since receiving a complaint through Ripoff Report, the team at Local Lighthouse has increased customer service staff to respond to clients faster. “We have the PARC program, which was finished, for the clients to access their information about their campaign and website. PARC is a report card on online marketing to benefit the client,” explains Mr. Paik.

Mr. Paik and his team recognize the value of working with Ripoff Report and the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program. “This program helps us know what clients are experiencing, also a great way to voice an opinion. This program helps us improve our own product for the future to know what the customers are feeling,” states Mr. Paik.

									Local Lighthouse Corp Local Lighthouse Completely misleading, deliberately dishonest Internet The company called and introduced themselves as ""google"".  They explained how they would enhance our website and make it come up in searches.  Nothing was ever said about making a new website.   Once they were handed over to the person that was only supposed to be giving them the payment information, they started the entire pitch again.  the problem with that is, that person did not know what was told to the first person.  So everything was changed without us knowing it was different. They created a new website for us that was nothing really useful to any customers that we would have looking at it.  The name they gave it was nothing that our customers would use to find something in our line of business.  The website also did not show up on Google at all.  They had it coming up on Yahoo and Bing.  I do not ever use either of those search sites.  I do not know of many people that do. When we comtacted them about not being satisfied they gave us a huge run around.  We contacted our credit card company to stop the charges and contest the others.  Local Lighthouse would only resend the terms that we supposedly agreed to.  But that takes us back to them changing the stuff once the other person here got on the phone.   Finally, they sent us an email saying that they would charge back all funds to our card and cancel our account completely.  We were pleased that they finally did that.   Now, not even 2 months later they have tried to chrage our card again for all of the fees.   Do Not do business with this company.  They are completely dishonest!  They completely misrepresent themselves.  It is a complete rip off!!!!!   ",Internet

I have always had a paid membership, until their software deducted 150 points from my score.    I contacted them many times but hey refused to investigate my complaint. For the past couple of years I have used their free membership because they would not look into the malfunction of their software.   Since 2006 I have never broken any of their policies. I simply play chess and chat with the friends I've made online, while playing. A week ago a player, username Randy and I were playing chess. He obviously had 2 accounts on his computer.   That isn't allowed. I found out because he substituted my username for his 2nd account username - randy2.  I informed of this. He scoffed. I resigned the game. He challenged me to another and I placed him in the ""Ignore"" category so he would not bother me again. I was not going to break any policy. Now that they have flagged my account, I'm starting to think they used Randy to set me up, knowingly playing chess with someone who has 2 accounts.   I cut & pasted all correspondence between Randy and my self, and will submit it right below. Thru the years I've been informed of others who were tossed out for frivolous reasons, so I saved this correspondence right below, to protect myself against gameknot and any of their future accusations against me. I guess I was correct in doing this, since now they have flagged my acct and are forcing me to pay for a membership if I want to continue playing on their site.   18-Aug-13, 11:32To: randy2 To randy2 Hello, randy2, Randy, who is busterjazzman? instead of my username on the board, this strange username has taken my place for this game?!

Siteground Affiliate Program,"  Siteground Affiliate Program  P.O. Box 48010  
Washington , Dist of Columbia USA ",www.siteground.com,1.866.605.2484,," SiteGround is a hosting company with an Affiliate Program. An Affiliate Program is a Program that pays you to refer customers. A website hosting company is a company where you can post your website to the internet. Siteground provided me with a special affiliate link. This link, when the client clicks on it and hen goes and makes their purchase, is supposed to provide a commission. Siteground's affiliate program clearly states that they will pay you the Wednesday following 30-40 days. This gives the company ample time to determine that the new client is real,no fraud is involved and he client has actually posted a website, and will be a good customer. The problem with Siteground, is that their pending period has come and gone, and they still have not paid me. They currently owe me in excess of $400.00. My main concern, in addition to not getting the money that I have earned, is that they don't give any explanation as to why there is a delay, or if there is something I can do to remedy the situation After all if there was a problem with one of my accounts (which I doubt), wouldn't it make sence for them to let me know so I could fix it? After several emails back and forth with Sitegrounds Affiliate manager, and inquiring as to why I was not paid, I was told that siteground no longer wanted my business? I was shocked. So they arbitrarily decided to cut me off, not pay me 400.00 worth of commission (all my customers are still valid today) AND ask me not to submit any more business??!! Wow, so if you inquire about your accounts with site ground you will not get paid AND you'll be asked to leave after you have given them some good customers. My Conclusion The Siteground Affiliate Program is a complete and total RIPOFF ",Internet
Spark Whitening,"  Spark Whitening  7565 Commercial Way, Unit E  
Henderson, Nevada USA ",www.sparkwhitening.com,866-711-2831,," After reading previous reports from other consumers, I see this ""company"" is still taking advantage of people and stealing from consumer's bank accounts! Through an incentive web site I decided to sign up for the ostensibly ""free"" sample of Spark Whitening tooth whitener.  Supposedly only $1.03 (which I thought was for postage), I was charged an additional $3.87...a charge that seemed mysterious to me because the postage on the package was only $2.55. These charges occurred 5 days after I placed the order.  On August 3, an additional charge of $94.31 was charged to my account...an amount  that most definitely DID NOT authorize.  When I saw the charge in my account on August 5 I immediately called this ""company"" and demanded a refund.  I was told that if I returned the ""complete kit"" I would receive a portion of the amount because I ""cancelled the account after the allotted time"".  Strangely enough, I read all the small print before I requested the sample.  NO WHERE did it state I would be charged this ridiculous amount of $94.31, NOR did it state anything about cancelling the account within ANY allotted time.  Today, August 22, I checked the tracking and found out that the package I returned on August 9 was received by them on August 12 (the rude female ""supervisor"" said the package was received on August 13. I asked her when my account would be credited, and she said within 24 hours.  I got the distinct impression that had I not called to ask, no money would be forthcoming. It was at that point she said I'd receive $70, the partial amount of the original charge.  When I told her I was told the entire amount would be returned if I returned the complete kit by August 24, she indicated that her ""notes"" did not indicate that and that I was only getting the $70.  She practically called me a liar, and when I asked to speak to a supervisor she said ""I am the supervisor"".  She very rudely tried to end the conversation, but before she could hang up on me I said ""Well, I'm calling my lawyer next"" and I disconnected. It's bad enough my account was charged an amount I never authorized; but it triggered NSFD charges as well. I complained to my bank, and they gave me a provisional credit for the amount.  When I hung up with the ""company"" I sent an email to my bank requesting an official investigation.  I don't know if they will be able to collect from this company, but I'm not willing to let this end here.  I will contact my lawyer.  I used my debit card as a ""credit"" card, but I don't know if the Fair Credit Billing Act covers that. I am furious that these people get away with what they pull!!  There has to be some way to hold them responsible, or at the very least force them out of business (until they come up with another fraudulent product). Word to the wise...never sign up for a free sample.  It isn't worth the trouble, and you can't trust these offers. ",Internet

About two wks. ago the product failed to operate. I tried making a tel. call with my cell phone and no one answered on the other end. I then many wrote e-mails asking for support and all I received voice mails that were not audible. I do beleive these voice mails were from an outsorcing company in the far east, making me think that NetTalk has closed up their operation due to massive problems.   Presently I have no operating telephone system in my home for use in business or normal communication.   I am very frustrated with this ordeal.

It was an in-house tool at first and was officially launched  to developers in December of 2007. Shortly after launch they experienced  explosive growth and quickly became the largest CPA network on Facebook, Myspace  and beyond.""   You may use them with many of your online gaming sites.  My problem began back in 2012 when I contracted a virus so bad it crashed my whole hard drive causing me to lose very pricesles information, photos, videos, etc.  I also noticed that the offers were not paying as stated on the site.  So I contacted them more then once about the situation and at one point threatned to sue them if they did fix there issues.  Instead of working with me to resolve the issue they suspended my account.  I asked them one several occassions to reinstate me but without any response from there company.  Accord to the site I use often, SuperRewards has claimed that they suspended my account because I failed to comply with there offers which is untrue and I saved ALL my confirmations to prove my case.   The major problem with SuperRewards is when you submit a ticket about an offer you get two to three automated responses, very rarely do you get a real response.  In order for you to get a person to auctally read your compaint is to submit an email to the corporate office.  This can cause issues like mine and cause a suspension due to complaining.   Today I sent emails to ALL the email addresses I could find and asked again for a reinstatement.  We will see, this is just a warning about there company and how they handle complaints.     ",Internet

IMVU,"  IMVU  100 W. Evelyn Ave. #110 
Mountain View, California USA ",www.imvu.com,650-321-8334,," I signed up for IMVU back in February 2009. It sounded interesting after reading about it on a gaming review website. I made an avatar named TemplarDuLane. I made some really good friends on IMVU but as time went on,I started seeing an increase in drama among people I associated with on there and I just didn't want to deal with it,so I started going on less and less. In the last eight months,I would say I have only logged in two or three times,each time for periods between five and ten minutes. Yesterday I received a notice from IMVU that my account had been permanently banned. They said it was for repeated violations of their terms of service. I read and re-read the TOS and I could not find anything that related to my situation or might have gotten me banned. I was immediately suspicious because,as I said,I don't login to IMVU much anymore. Another thing I have a problem with,if I was supposedly violating their terms of service,why did they not say anything before now? I received no warnings or notices of any kind. Yesterday was the first and only communication they had with me on the subject. IMVU has a real money economy and from time to time I would purchase credits to buy my avatar different outfits,rooms,etc. Besides the four years I lost and the time and energy I spent decorating my avatar and my rooms,I also have now lost touch with all my friends on the site,not that anyone at IMVU headquarters cares. If I had to guess,I would say I lost over 500 items that were in my inventory (many of which were paid for with my own money),my avatar,and many friendships all because IMVU wants to start playing God all of a sudden,their word is law and frickin' canon,they can do no wrong. The worst part of this is my account is banned permanently,which under IMVU guidelines means it can not be recovered under any circumstances. I've heard stories from other people about how IMVU has done the same to them,banning them for no reason or absurd reasons. If there is ever a lawsuit filed against them for this,damn skippy I'm gonna be one of the first to join it. ",Internet

Comcast,"  Comcast  4920 Centennial Blvd 
Colorado Springs, Colorado USA ",www.comcast.com,(877) 550-6106,," Just moved to Colorado Springs less than a month ago.  We set up internet and cable through Comcast on a 30 day trial. It didn't take 30 days to discover that the internet was very slow and the TV packages left much to be desired.  We tried upgrading the internet and it was still just as slow.  Our monthly rate should have been $70 and we were told that there would be no charge for install. 3 weeks into the trial we went online and our bill was over $200! When asking them why it was because there was a $40 install fee and a $7 monthly rental of the modem which we were not told about. It would have been more if we were not using our own router.   Knowing that if we didn't cancel within 30 days I started looking into other options...otherwise we would be locked into a 2 year contract which will increase even more after the first year.  Called Direct TV and their customer service was phenomenal. They explained all of the charges in great detail and were very helpful and best of all honest.  We were able to get 225 channels for $45 per month.  The most shocking thing to me was that Direct TV was unable to provide internet in our location. Ive called 4 other companies and no one else is able to provide internet! Only Comcast.  Ive never experienced such a monopoly for a commodity in this day an age that is a necessity.  The whole point of having free enterprise offering products and services is to ensure fair pricing, better customer service and to allow consumers to cast their ""vote"" by awarding their business.  I am surprised that the competition laws allow for this and question why one company has a complete choke hold on the market leaving consumers restricted and forced to go with them.  I will also note that the people I spoke with at Direct TV were not outsourced- I was happy to see that they are employing Americans.  Given the market domination and wealth Comcast has taken - I say taken because it appears there is no other choice-  why would they outsource their call center overseas and not give something back to the people by at least employing Americans?  While we could have saved money by staying with Comcast $80 per month for both we have chosen to pay more out of principal.   Just for internet with Comcast we will be paying $50 a month and Direct TV television we will be paying another $50.  We will give Comcast the business that we are forced to and not a penny more.  Hopefully my post will inspire others to push for change as this type of control a business has is not good for the economy nor is it good for the people.

After waitinrg almost 5 days, I had inquired why the order was taking so long. I wake up and found this person refunded my money. He claimed he was too busy (over 60 orders a day as he states) to do the order and that it was ""clearly stated"" on the website that custom orders take 72 hours to produce. What was not stated is number one 72 business hours or every day hours and number 2 the order wasn't ""custom"" as he stated, but part of what he calls ""radio packs"" where 10 or 20 similiar voice drops were similiar in style and put together as a package. This needless to say infuriated me, especially since I have been so cordial and professional up until this point with him, not to mention I have order many many drops in the past with him totally upwards of $400, so I am not some street traffic, who goes by once and disappears, but a regular customer.

What he apparently does is what you may call fill in the blanks, filling in the blanks to the templates to make it appear to be giving the illusion they are professionally done from scratch. Then he had the nerve to accuse ME of being a theif when I complained to my credit card company about his antics. I was even so gracious as to try and make peace with him, sent him the money again when he told me he ""just made up my voice drops this morning"" and you know what this knucklehead did?

Nationwide Recovery Systems, a collections agency, called and said we now owed $539.46.  He was trying to ""help us"" so that the case wouldn't be taken to court.  I told him he needed to produce proof of a contract.  He said there was a verbal contract, and played a recording supposedly made in December 2012.  It was a recording of one of our staff members interacting with an automated voice.  However, the recording was made a year earlier when the staff member was speaking not with a automated voice but with a real person.  There was also a gross error in the verbal contract which clearly indicated it was faked. I told the collection agency that for us to pay this amount is ludicrous, that the recording was faked, and read off the list of complaints filed against A2Z.  I warned him that if Nationwide Recovery Systems was indeed a legitimate collection agency then they probably didn't want have anything to do with A2Z Offsite.  The man on the phone said he would report it to his superiors. On May 6 I made a few phone calls warning all local churches here in Boston about the scam (A2Z tends to target churches). The next day, May 7, I received a letter from Nationwide Recovery Systems (the collection agency) indicating that they are ""no longer doing any collections work for A2Z Offsite or for any of its affiliates.""  They also apologized for any inconvenience the letters may have caused.  The letter was signed by Dennis Dlabaj, the Vice President of the collection agency.

mesa, Arizona USA ",mycricket.com,(602) 458-4460,," I purchased a $100 Cricket modem on 3/30/13 to help me through a tough period. Spent $177 or so on it, including a month's worth of Internet service, which was 65 MB or gigs. Forget which. Anyway, brought the modem back on 4/30/13 after finding the service sluggish. The folks there were friendly, but refused to give me a refund because they told me March has 31 days, and by returning it on 4/30, I exceeded their 30-day policy.  The manager came out to tell me that they go by days and not by month. The clerk proceeded to tell me how to save more money on Cricket services by signing up for low-income programs and to allow direct pay through my checking account. I could not believe that this group was so quick to deny my refund, but so happy to tell me how I could save by having Cricket dig their pocket deeper into my life and privacy. It was pretty uncomfortable because they pushed and pushed me to keep my Internet service with them, saying that a technician could speed the service up if I would just request customer service. Ya, right.  IMHO, this company is just all about taking money from consumers. I nowhere near reached my limit on the Internet service bandwidth, but they sure were quick to deny my refund. If they were so interested in helping me financially, they would have  given me the refund instead of being so condescening about qualifying for subsidized programs and hyping how great their customer service is. They're just interested in raking in the dough and don't care about their customers.  I remember when a month was a month, regardless of the calendar. Oops! forgot computers don't. And what happens when house payments or apartment rental payments are due? Is it by month or by 30 days? Think it's by month. Also, I have a Cricket phone and the billing period goes by date, not by days. Anyway, I'm over it, but don't have anything good to say about my Cricket experience there.  ",Internet

I purchased giftcards from them that got lost in the mail (I assume they did at least since they never arrived). I contacted their customer service promptly about it. I then requested they send me the giftcard numbers since I could transfer the balances to my existing account with the company from them. They did so and surprise...nearly half the balances were gone. 3 cards were purchased, 1 was $0, 1 was half used up, and 1 was as advertised. I transferred the remaining balances and took a screenshot showing them the balances that I transferred and requested a refund according to their refund process.
Guess what, they denied a refund! Can you believe it? I couldn't. Stealing from customers...well, I would say avoid avoid avoid if you don't want to throw away your money in Montana. It isn't worth 5% if they're going to take half of the remainder.

Madire Media REVIEW: Comitment to Madwire’s executive team and employees are committed to customer satisfaction.  Madwire’s approach to business is focused on providing the highest customer satisfaction and a 360 degree marketing program. *UPDATE: Madwire Media pledges their commitment to always improving their operations by joining Ripoff Report’s Corporate Advocacy, Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program. A program that benefits the consumer by increasing their confidence when doing business with a member business.  Madwire Media is recognized by Ripoff Report Verified™ as a safe business service. "," Ripoff Report Verified™ REVIEW:

EDitor’s UPDATE: Positive rating and recognition has been given to  Madwire Media for its commitment to excellence in customer service.

Ripoff Report’s discussions with Madwire have uncovered an ongoing commitment by the company to total client satisfaction. This means that clients can expect that the company will work towards finding a mutually satisfactory resolution to any complaints or concerns.  Madwire Media listens carefully to client concerns and sees them as an opportunity to become more efficient as a company in the services offered and the support for those services. Demo Reel of our latest work: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJLficuooZY&feature=share&list=PLA1C68D551421ED4FRipoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business.. The information provided in this report is based on comments made by Joe Kellogg, JB Kellogg, and Jerry Kelly during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward the Madwire Media..  

Madwire Media’s vision is to be a company that has unbelievable technology and unbeatable customer service by helping companies grow through Marketing and Design. The company’s target market is small to midsize businesses with annual revenue ranging from $25,000 to $1,000,000. They have a global clientele with majority of their clients outside of the state of Colorado. Madwire never buys leads or cold calls because all of their leads are strictly inbound. Additionally, the company states that they operate with the same marketing strategy they offer their clients with the goal of having an inbound lead generation. Furthermore, the company states they have dedicated marketing consultants whose responsibility is to consult the potential customer about their business, create a marketing plan to help their business be successful and reach a package that fits their needs. 

Madwire Media feels they are set apart from other companies in their industry because they have a proprietary product that they build. The company creates a dynamic solution with MAD-360, which is their core product offering. Everything the company does is analytic driven which they feel is unique to their company. The marketing they provide comes with analytics which further helps to separate them from their competitors. 

The sales process with Madwire Media starts when the lead comes in and the company reaches out to the potential customer. The company goes through a process of asking the potential customer questions to figure out their needs and how Madwire can consult them in their business. This process helps the company to identify a road map to success. With each new lead, the company always has a consultant mindset, not about the company selling something. During this process, the company’s main objective is to find out if Madwire’s solutions are going to work for the potential client, how they can help, and if they are a good fit to work together. Next, the Madwire works with the prospective client to discover their budget and put them on a plan within that budget. Madwire does extensive research and competitor analysis which includes what their client’s competitors are currently spending. The company explains discovered information in correlation with their needs and goals. Finally, Madwire Media puts together a plan for growth opportunity for the prospective client. Their ultimate goal for every client is to build a solid brand and make them the “go to guy” for their local business. Furthermore, Madwire looks to build a long term, profitable business for their clients. 

Through the customizable solutions created by Madwire prospective company’s results vary for their services. Joe Kellogg, CEO of Madwire states, “Ultimately, the client drives the business and they need to follow through on the action plan to have optimal success. Each client has a dedicated marketing executive and they each have a whole team working behind them. Essentially, each client has their own marketing team helping their business. This means low overhead for the client because hiring an on-site marketing team would be more costly. A huge benefit for our customer is that they receive daily marketing communication from their team.” 

The company is striving to improve internal processes in initial website launches for their clients. This is a service they provide to every client and it is a full investment on their side because the client does not pay for it. Typical websites take 10 weeks to launch but Madwire can launch a website in 10 days while keeping the same quality and work flow. When looking at improvements in internal processes, JB Kellogg, COO stated, “We see all feedback as a positive thing. We are constantly analyzing and measuring data to streamline processes. If an issue arises, we are able to correct it immediately.” Additionally, the company has made several structural changes by providing the client a dedicated reprehensive for their account resulting in better service. 

JB Kellogg further stated, “With ‘Execution Excellence’ being our motto, we strive to uphold standards with every client complaint. All complaints are viewed as opportunities.” A common complaint the company has received in the past relates to client’s expectations. Madwire explained, “Many times a client is a brand new business, new to the internet or just doesn’t know what it will take for them to be successful. They may have unrealistic expectations and when those are not met right away, it causes the client to become unsatisfied.” The company stated that they always resolve the complaint. They want and even encourage clients who have unmet expectations to reach out to them before writing a review to allow them the opportunity to do whatever it takes to turn them into a satisfied client. One way to resolve a complaint is to keep them as a client and bend over backwards to ensure the client is satisfied. If the issue is because of an expectation, a dedicated marketing executive will do more consultation. The marketing consultants are the first people to talk to clients. Their job is to tell the client what their competitor is spending while setting proper expectations for their success. JB Kellogg explained, “Madwire Media wants our clients to understand that the process takes time and work. It takes time to constantly analyze, measure, and adjust over the course of 4-6 months. As long as the client understands that and are committed to the program, we will do everything to help them be successful.” They mentioned their first commitment to their clients is a specially designed website at no charge to them. Madwire’s success is built on long term customers. Therefore, they make it a priority to resolve complaints effectively. 

The company had a situation a few months ago where a client was unsatisfied with their marketing plan. The client said the particular program he was on did not make sense and Madwire agreed with him. Madwire Media informed him that he should be on a higher platform based on his location and what his competitors were doing. Ultimately, he was not getting what he wanted, but didn't want to spend the additional dollars to get what he needed. They took the time to listen to what he wanted and advised him on the type of people that are searching for him, which happened to be coupon and sales driven consumers. After the conversation, the unsatisfied client saw the value in what Madwire Media provided, but decided he was not prepared to put more into the process. The main issue in this scenario was communication and expectation. The company feels there is not one resolution to answer problems; not one person is going to have the same complaint.

Since complaints on Ripoff Report, Madwire Media stated they have not changed their process just because they have had some bad reviews. They constantly strive to improve processes regardless of complaints. They said that creative agencies sometimes have a tough time satisfying how something looks compared to how it is going to drive traffic to their website. Unfortunately, they can't please everyone. They strive to make the best decisions based on what is going to best drive traffic to a client's website, which is oftentimes not what the customer thinks is going to look the best.

The company’s motto that they communicate and hold employees accountable to is ""Execution Excellence,"" which is doing whatever needs to be done to take care of the client. No one in the company has voicemail because they want their clients to have things done timely, if not immediately. The internet is instant and they want their response to be as well.  Some changes they have made as a result of complaints received is that they are more engaged with Ripoff Report and value it as a way to discuss and resolve issues for unhappy clients. If a customer has a problem, they want it fixed. They ask themselves what the company can do to fix the issue. They look at Ripoff Report as an opportunity to reach out to the client to correct the problem.  

Madwire Media wants to tell the truth about their company and the thousands of companies they help. Jerry Kelly stated, “Ripoff Report is the mechanism to identify people that have a problem and how we can solve it. This gives them an opportunity to work with unsatisfied clients that they would not have normally been able to reach out to because they did not contact our firm directly.” Madwire Media™ / Execution Excellence™ is our standard.  ”Jerry Kelly, the Chief Marketing Officer of Madwire Media™, stated “We consider all customer complaints as constructive criticism and use them as tools to improve our processes. Our customers are our family and are the life blood of our business and their satisfaction is of the utmost importance. We value our customers above all else, and look forward to continually providing a high level of service so that their experiences with Madwire Media™ remain strong, consistent and positive”.

Another top executive of the company told us that their policy is to always proactively engage our customers to gather valuable feedback so that we can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. Madwire Media™ is  willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to provide great service with past, current, and future customers. Madwire Media™ 100% customer satisfaction guarantee lets customers feel safe confident and secure that we will be relentless in our approach to service, design, and marketing your business. ” Our Customers are our family. 

Madwire™ posts unbelievable growth in Colorado as the fastest growing company in Colorado with growth over 798% and qualified to be in the INC 500 as one of the fastest in the country. Our growth comes from 3 key components “Our People, Our Product, and Our Process”. At our facility we provide a great environment to be successful, from built in locker rooms, a fitness center, a game room with foosball and pinball, and a roof top deck overlooking lake Loveland.

Opportunities for suggestions and improvements are encouraged.  All employees go through extensive training to ensure they are well prepared to handle clients businesses and ensure their success. We continue to close the loop improving processes for our Marketing Executives. We have a standard that everyone at the company holds true.

Ripoff Report was pleased to learn that Madwire’s™ past and current approach to business is focused on its pledge to total commitment towards client and employee satisfaction.” Company Video: http://vimeo.com/44244614STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM Madwire Media™.

									Madwire Media Mad 360 BUYER BEWARE!! Loveland, Colorado

										BUYER BEWARE!!  This company sold me a website that I didn't need.  I was only interested in their SEO & google adwords packaged.  They up sold me into a $1260 program that included, a ""canned"" website"",  20 blogs per month, $800 worth of Google Adwords & retargeting package.  They indicated that I would get $800 worth of Google adwords campaign, but they did only did $600 worth per month.  Their SEO Blogs were a joke.   They indicated that their expertise would drive business to me, and that they are the BEST in the industry.  What a joke!  
After about 4 to 6 weeks I submitted a cancellation email, when  I realized the shoddy work they did, and that their program was NOT WORKING!   Their Google Adwords campaign & SEO was a joke.   
 They ignored the email that I sent them notifying them of the cancellation & charged my credit card  for 2 more months.  They are denying that they received the cancellation notice, even though I not only emailed them, but also faxed a CANCELLATION LETTER!! Buyer BEWARE!   Although they say they guarantee their work, this is FALSE!!  They DO NOT GUARANTEE THEIR WORK.  All you will get is LIP SERVICE!  When you realize their program doesn't work, you will be out thousands of dollars and a lot of headaches.  They are only after your money.  They will SAY & DO WHATEVER it takes to get your money, & leave you ""in the dirt""!  They are smooth talkers, & persistent in up selling you their ""shoddy"" work.   But, you will be SCAMMED!  Look Elsewhere!
For Google Adwords, if you are a LOCAL company, you are much better off doing Google Adwords Express.  For SEO, I would find a ""REPUTABLE"" company that understands your market to do the SEO.  Madwire Media AKA Mad360 are SCAM ARTISTS & Do SHODDY work.  I wish I had seen these ""rip-off"" reports from consumers before I went with them.  I see that they have ""manufactured"" good reviews on a different website.  If you google:  Madwire Media Reviews, you'll see a bunch of positive reviews all 5 STARS.  They appear to be ""manufactured"".

										Think your backed up files are safe and  sound? Think again.  Back up your precious files with Frontier Backup & Sharing and kiss your files good bye.
 It says on the Frontier Secure homepage (http://ww2.frontierhelp.com/) , ""Never lose a precious photo or critical document.""  They go on to say on their website,  ""Don't hold up your life worrying about protecting your music, your photos or files.  Keep memories safe.  The times of your life should last a lifetime.""  Well our photos and files didn't last a lifetime.  In fact, Frontier has told us that all of our files are gone.  How could files just disappear we wondered?  
My name is Dana and I work for David B., an  architect and artist in Milan, New York. David is also the owner of 20+ rental properties that I manage.  As I am sure you can imagine, we have tens of thousands of photos, leases, CAD files of home designs, etc.  So backup of our documents is something that we take pretty seriously.   To that end, David purchased the Backup & Sharing program from Frontier Communications several years ago prior to my coming on board.  Frontier said they can't officially tell us when since they do not have that information in the system any longer.  Let me explain how this whole horrible mess happened.
 
On February 4th of this year, I was unable to access  Frontier Backup & Sharing.  https://frontier.ob.f-secure.com/.  The message I got was that it didn't recognize my email address.  I wasn't able to log in using any of the  three office email addresses.  I checked my email and saw that there was a back up report from Frontier dated  1/26/13.  It stated that 33,485 files had  been backed up from David's computer and 22,261 from  mine.  I figured there must be some glitch that was making it unable for me to  log in.  
I made two phone calls to Frontier that first day.  Spending an average of 31 minutes on the phone. I learned that we did not have back up service since a CSR by the name of ---need to get name from bill---- removed it from our plan.  Now why on earth would he do that?  He said that David told him to.  That is absurd.  David did speak to this individual about lowering our bill and in order to get the lower rate, the CSR explained that he had to remove all the features of our plan and then reload them.  For some reason, the Backup & Sharing Plan was not reloaded. I can assure you and everyone else that I speak to that David would NEVER say he did not need the online backup.  In October, 2012 we lost our external hard drive backup, the Seagate Black Armor NAS 110.  We took that to the GEEK Squad but they couldn't retrieve any of the documents off the drive.  We didn't panic as we knew that all our files were being safely stored through the Frontier Secure Backup & Sharing Program. So we thought.
On February 4th, I expected a return call from Chris, employee # 06221 at the Internet Help Desk after he spoke with his supervisor, Mike. I never heard back.  On February 5th, I called again. In fact, I made three phone calls to Frontier that day.  The most promising was my call with Jennifer, employee #407609 or JRF 412 as she is known in the note system. Jennifer seemed very willing to help and made two different calls to try and figure out how this could have happened and if we could in fact get our files back.  In a recorded phone conversation with me, Jennifer was not only apologetic but appalled by the fact that the CSR absolved himself of any responsibility in not reloading the backup plan.  Instead, he blamed the customer.  Jennifer spoke to Michael Rand, a supervisor involved in the security department.  She delivered the bad news that they didn't think they would retriever our files.  This didn't make sense to us.  David said, ""If we were terrorists, they would have our files in a heartbeat.""  Jokes helped because otherwise we would be in tears.  At that time, the magnitude of our loss hadn't quite sunk in.  Sometimes you don't know what is missing until you actually need it. Jennifer said she would get back to me as she tried to resolve the problem. 
 On February 8th, without a word from Jennifer, I called Frontier again looking for answers.  I got Roger in the Ft. Wayne, Indiana call center.  We spoke for 46 minutes.  Basically, it was me telling my tale for the umpteenth time.  Roger said he would talk to his supervisor, Cynthia Alexander.   
On February 11th, without a call from Cynthia Alexander, I phoned Frontier again.  This time I spoke with Evan Dingman, employee # 06453.  Evan was the one who delivered the fateful blow that the files were in fact lost. Incomprehensible.  ""Never lose a precious photo or critical document.""  Was this just false advertising? 
The next day I called Cynthia Alexander or she called me.  Despite copious log taking, I don't recall who initiated the contact.  I have to say through it all I have remained calm. I have tried to be somewhat Zen about the whole situation despite ridiculous amounts of time trying to resolve this and spending hours retyping and recreating documents and spreadsheets that had been lost. While, frustrating and time consuming for me, it has hurt David far more.  On the most basic level, he is paying me to reinvent the wheel.  But he has lost far more.  He can't replace all the photos that he has taken over the years, all the memories that have been lost.  This of course is priceless.  Not only are we talking about his personal life but his professional life.  As an architect, he has spent countless hours producing architectural documents for all the homes he has constructed over the years.  He has been a licensed architect since the early 90's and had a lot of his early drawings put on CAD files.  As an artists, professional photos of his work are gone.
How do you assign a monetary value to all this? Frontier seems to think that our lost is worth $143.76.  Cynthia Alexander advised that Frontier was willing to give us two years of Backup and Sharing Service. One year to credit our service and one year of service going forward.  At $5.99 a month , this comes to $143.76 over the two years.  SHOCKING!!!! I wondered if she was joking.  At this point, I asked David to step in.  David spoke to Cynthia and Markee Brown, the call center manager, who after consulting with some senior level staff advised that they will only give us two years credit.  David told Cynthia that he was not pleased with their offer and that they would hear from his legal counsel.
While we are considering taking legal action, we thought it important to get the word out that backing up your files may not be secure at all. Especially if that company happens to be Frontier Back Up and Sharing.  While this has been, and continues to be an unpleasant situation for us, we hope that you find some interest in it, and in the interest so many people with so many things to save may find in our story.

I am a young single mother living on a budget. In this day in time having internet is a must so I came across Freedom Pop and thought that they might be an affordable alternative to getting internet in my home. I order the Casual 2GB package @ $17.00 a month. Upon arrival I was very excited to use my device, hooked it up, watched a movie the device worked perfect then went to bed. The next day I went onto the website to see how much data I had used and to my surprise I had used the entire data plan! I thought that was a little strange but I went ahead and upgraded to biggest plan they offer 10GB. The next time the device was used my nephew came over and played his playstation online. The next day I started getting email after email ""Freedom Pop has added $10 to your account"" over and over again. I thought that was strange since I had already upgraded to the biggest package. When I looked at my bank statement Freedom Pop had charged me $131.59 in overage fee's over a 6 day period, $70 in one day! And continued charging my account until I had insufficient funds. So let me reiterate people... I paid $100 for the actual device, $60 for the biggest plan, and now on top of that $130... FOR USING THE DEVICE 2 TIMES! I called the company and asked what the reasoning was for all these charges. They said that much data had been used because I ""had a good connection"". The best they could do was refund me $40. Needless to say I will never recommend this product to anyone. You've been warned!									",Internet

There are many casting submission options for actors and this one is the most expensive with the worse customer service.  Their costs are ridiculous. 
The other thing I don't like is that they won't let you put your entertainment website on anything because they want you to have to spend a fortune adding your pictures and demo reels to their site if you want casting directors to see that.  
Plus if you need help, you sit on hold for a very long time.  You'd think with as much money as they charge they'd be able to hire enough staff to take care of their customers. 
I'm not only an actor but I also own a production company and I cast many actors.  I won't use them anymore for anything and I hope other casting directors stop using them as well so that actors stop using them and start using the other options out there that are much more affordable.  I really can't stand this company; they need to be put out of business.

After sending my two elementary school children to school while the State Police were here I worked with my Insurance Company to file the necessary papers. I then realized the thief was driving my car listening to my XM radio! I called the support line (which I have had a bad experience with in the past) I have had my XM account since 2005 and a few years ago I even added on theinternet/iphone service.  I always pay the year in advance to receive the discount.  I asked if they could just suspend or put my account on hold for 2 weeks until I found out the outcome of mysituation (recover my car or I get another one) but I would be happy to continue listening to my phone XM.  I was told that was NOT possible and if I only wanted the internet I could be credited less the amount of only an internet contract.  I asked if this would be the $3.50 I pay for adding it on to my package and was told no because I would have to shut down my car service, it would be $14.49/mo; I then took the time to explain my personal situation to the representive to no avail. She told me the only thing that could be done would be to transfer my account to another vehicle then transfer it back or leave the service on.  I thanked her for nothing and said I guess Iwould have to let the thief drive my car & listen to my XM?!Call #22/25/2013 After aprox. 1 hour on the phone; I got another NEW account, for some odd reason any time there is a change or mess up with my account, they give me a new one?? Then whenever I call they say, oh, I see several accounts under that number?! WTH?   The nice guy in listener care (Hemet) was verypolite and said the 3 months I received with the purchase of my new Chevrolet could be added to my existing service and after I was transferred to billing they would have to credit my account for my existing service from the stolen vehicle, then they would transfer me back to listener care to turn it back on.Well Ms. Bianca was having no part of any compromises, she said I could pay for an 18.00/mo package after the free 3 months and they could credit me my service?! But it wasnt going to be possible to keep the use of my internet service until the trial ran out in May?  I asked can I put the trial on my husbandsnew Chevy-NOPE!

Internet United States of America ",www.windstream.com,800-347-1991,Windstream Communications  Very Poor Service provided and missleading advertisment Internet,"
										I am a Windstream customer and have internet service with them. The cost of this service is about $60.00 a month . I was a customer before they became Windstream and had no issuse with the service that was provided. However that all changed about 6-8 months ago. During the morning and early afternoon hours my internete works great. However every evening about 7 EST my service slows down to a crawl. I called them for months about this issue being told it was an outage in my area. I was told we will send a service man out sometimes that happened most times not. I was told everything under the sun to basically get me to go away. I got so frustrated that i canceled my service but found no other high speed providers in my area. I had to go back well nothing has changed . However one thing that has changed is I have finally found out whats causing the problem. After repeated calls i finally spoke to someone with Windstream who explain the problem . Windstream has  taken on more customers than their equipment can provide service for. Their Lans are over utilized. Its fine early in the day when traffic on those Lans is low. However in the evening when people get home from work and start watching videos or downloading things or stream TV Latency rises.  My latency goes from about 50 early in the day to sometimes well over 5000 in the evening. Well due to my constant calling Windstream has given me credits to my bill for the last 3 months . The problem as i see it is they are continuing to add more customers and ripping off those that dont complain. I last spoke to someone from Windstream last night and was told nothing is in the works to fix the problems. I would encourage people to call and call and call. Also ask the about the over utilization of their lans . They will tell you nothing until you become to big of pain . Then they will credit you to shut you up. Well im looking for high speed internet not credits.									",Internet

Internet United States of America ",www.ebay.com,402-952-8336,"Ebay/PayPal  EBAY LIES AND PAYPAL SWEARS TO IT! VICE VERSA, Internet","
										To whom It May concern:
Please find a copy of 2 (two) Complaints EBay Inc. and PayPal Inc. I have spent 7 weeks and approximately 70 hours trying to resolve the issues with both companies (owned together) this is a monopoly if I have ever seen one.  
1)     If youre selling on eBay you can only do it through PayPal, no money orders, no checks, no bank checks, and no wire
transfers. EBay can randomly take money out of your PayPal account without notice and if you dont have enough in your PayPal account PayPal will take it from your personal checking account and forward the money to eBay. This is my case.
2)     For no reason in November EBay put a hold on my PayPal funds for 30-40 days (money paid to me for item I sold on EBay)
3)     In December I had a $455 I had no notice that the over $1200 in my PayPal account had a hold on it. (keeping in mind this is good money from eBay customers that paid with their own PayPal money)
4)     January 14th I get a commendation letter from EBays 
5)     Please see bank statement ($455) was taken out of my personal checking account by PayPal to pay eBay causing check to bounce in my account. I contacted EBay they told me it was PayPal and I had a hold on my $1200+- balance in my PayPal acct.  They could not tell me why, I told them that EBay/PayPal owes me 3 times the amount that I owe them. I told to to stop the transaction they refused (still having $1200) in my eBay/PayPal account. I got a supervisor on the phone at PayPal and he
told me to go to my bank and put a stop on the transaction and pay when incremental funds become available and as long as its paid by the 15th of the following month I would have no problem. That what I did.  All went well until I made a $75 payment to eBay and notice that the $75 that was available came out of my account. They also helped themselves to $719 at the exact same time and date. (by the way these fund were on hold and not to be used) My balance after the $75.00 payment
was $97. Please see all the backup documentation. EBay agreed they made a mistake and would put the $719 back into my account. (Please see letter from the EBay agent Maggie sent to me on Jan 23rd 2013. The next day instead of putting the money back in they took it out again (leaving me with a negative balance of over <$650.00>) .  
6)     I had a $97 balance with eBay (see statements) On Jan 12th 2013 eBay withdrew $719 from my eBay account. 
7)     I was getting no place fast, I wrote to the BBB after a canned response (see response) eBay the closed my account. I have to lay off the help that I have because of eBay/PayPals arrogant monopoly. This is illegal, Theft, Fraud, extortion, price fixing, Monopoly, and an abuse to customers beyond (seller) belief.
8)        I was speaking with an associate (supervisor) that made it clear We dont care about seller, as  long as we have buyers someone will always be in line to sell to them Please take the time to examine the documents,
especially PayPals statement that I will bet the best accounting firm in the country could not make sense of it.",Internet

So I called my credit card company and disputed the double billing.  They gave me a temporary credit but recharged back to the card at the end of January 2012.  
Earthlink terminated my service without prior notification this morrning at 5:20 am and sent me two emails at that time that I had requested closing the account (not true).  So they terminate the service without any explanation or advanced notice!  My brother lives with me and is disabled has a pacemake/defibulator implant that is monitored by Medtronics and his Cardiologist 24/7 that is no longer possible since they terminated the service.  They forced me to make a payment of the disputed amount and then told me that it would be up to 48 hours before I would have phone service again.

As I was told, this offer was not contingent on being locked into a contract and there were no installation fees.  In fact I was told that my services with frontier were month-to-month. We decided to set up telephone and Internet with frontier to save more money with dish.Our installation was delayed by a couple of days, so I couldn't be present while the technician hooked up our services outside. After the installation, I received our first bill and was upset by what I read. I was charged for over $120 in fees for installation, etc. How ridiculous! I called frontier and was told that our services were contracted for two years and that if I cancelled I would have to pay a fee of more than $200. Wow, this is a far cry from a no hassle trial of the product.We have had frontier set for over a month and a half and have yet to have it work properly. The Internet would not connect with my wireless printer and also would not allow any computer or iPad to stay connected to the Internet for more than ten minutes at a time.I called frontier again to try and resolve my issue. I was placed on hold for thirty minutes and then never picked back up. I eventually gave up. The next day i talked to a customer service rep, amy. She seemed to be able to fix everything for me. When I hung up with her, I was so relieved.When I called them back to cancel after troubleshooting the issues and jumping through hoops, another customer service rep told me that they could not help me as Amy promised and that I would have to pay a cancellation fee.

										Don't make the same mistake I did buying from FlashRouters.com. Obviously this is some kid in New Jersey selling routers out of his mom's house @ 14 Dorothy Ave in NJ. I've been going back and forth with Joseph for the past month trying to get my money back!!! To some people, $150 isn't a lot of money but to me IT IS... Why is FlashRouters a scam? Here is my personal experience and review:
I bought the ASUS RT N-16 and spent about $150 with shipping charges. It arrived a few days later as promised, however the router looked like it was a dog's chew toy for the majority of it's life. Literally, scratches and what appear to be bite marks of sorts on the top casing. I spent well over retail cost on amazon to get this thing pre setup with my vpn provider EXPECTING to get a NEW router - Not an old, re-manufactured unit. Immediately I emailed Joseph at FlashRouters and after days of waiting received a reply that he, ""could send me a replacement but unfortunately could not refund because the router is fully operational. [continued below]....
									
										....."" 
Thankfully, a swift paypal dispute DID get my money back, and now the flashrouter serves as MY DOG's CHEW TOY. This whole process took so long to resolve, in the meantime I ordered a brand new n-16 from amazon for the same price, received it NEXT DAY, and it turns out the new firmware already works with my vpn provider. It took all of 15 minutes to setup compared to dealing with scammer joseph taking two weeks of my life that I'll never get back. I win!									",Internet

HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN

ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder

										These guys are total scammers. They pretend to be a big company by the image they portray. I was a little sceptical when i showed up for my first meeting with them. They work out of a 10x10 room at a virtual office complex (fairly inexpensive way to look professional on a tight budget). I decided to go against my gut feeling of running out the door the first 10 seconds upon arrival. After talking with them for a few minutes, it was evident that these guys were ""wingin it"" or should i say ""fake it until they make it"". The price package for the basic seo was fairly reasonable, so i decided to take a leap of faith. BIG MISTAKE!!!!! After 2 months, absolutly NOTHING was done, nothing. Everytime i called the secretary, she would use the same excuse of ""They are working on your site and we should get you a report soon"". Ive used seo companies before, and i can tell you that i had the initial evalution report within 1 week (with the other company). I emailed her over and over and over again asking for some type of proof that work was being done.They never showed me 1 ounce of proof that work had actually been started, after 2 months. I guess when they are charging by the month it makes sense to work in slow motion to keep the monthly fees coming in. These guys are very unprofessional, incompetant, bloodsuckers from what i see. I finally had enough of getting the run around for 2 months, that i called it quits. Word of mouth is a powerful way to blackball a bad company. Believe me!

http://www.gambleroncall.com
I never heard of the website or the company before.  I looked all over the internet and couldnt find any reviews of people who have actually signed up with them or that had been successful.  Their website was very appealing giving testimonials of people who had used their ""system"" turning $100 investment into $7000 monthly income just gambling.  They claim that they have compiled a group of over 15,000 people who are gambling nationwide and all the players are successful gamblers.  The name of the guy running the website is Michael Burke.  He claims they have been testing, monitoring, and profiting using his system since 1997.  The product that is sold on the website is an e-book called ""The Master Guide Program""Everything on the website seemed positive and there seemed to be a real potential to make money since so many other people had been successful.  So I decided to give it a try, although a part of me was still skeptical, as I have been ripped off before.    The ad on craigslist said the cost was $199, but they had a discounted price of $159.20 on their website.  As soon as I made the purchase, they sent me an email with access to the ""The Master Guide Program"" e-book.  I took the next few days to study the material.  Michael Burke talks about how he lost and won a lot of money at the casinos.  One day he meet a homeless guy on a bus stop bench who starts telling him the secrets of gambling in Vegas, next thing you know he creates a gambling club who he claims has been successful since 1997. In the book, he also describes profiling blackjack dealers looking for ones that look ""nervous"" or looking for craps tables that have ""a lot of energy"" as if crowded tables or nervous dealers somehow make you more money at the casinos.  Then it goes into basic strategy and a couple betting progression techniques just like so many betting systems that are out there.  Even after reading the e-book over and over a few times I decided to keep an open mind and at least try out the techniques. 
So, I memorized the methods that were provided in the e- book and went to Vegas for the weekend to try them out.  I started with a $1000 and by the time the weekend was over I lost virtually my entire bankroll using ""The Master Guide Program"" e-book I purchased.  I never deviated from the method of play that was described in the book, but I still lost all my money.   I come back to town on Monday and describe my experience to Michael Burke in an email.  He responds to me 2 days later and said he was sorry for my loss and was wondering what casino games I played and how much money I was betting.  I responded, letting him know the games I played and the money I bet.  Michael responded saying ""Its gambling!  Sometimes you lose in the short run, but all our members win consistently!""   I couldnt believe my ears, so I asked for a refund and he responded saying ""As far as refunds, we've never offered refunds. You can't read the book,run to a casino one time and say it doesn't work."" Then I started thinking.  Michael Burke has been able to recruit over 15,000 members to be part of this gambling club.  He typically charges $200 for his ""Master Gambling E-Book"".  If you do the math, he has made over $3,000,000 selling his ""Master Guide Program"" e-book.  So, the question that comes to mind is, is this guy really making money gambling or is he just making money from people buying this ""Master Gambling E-Book"".  Even he is making money gambling, where did his bankroll come from?  Oh thats right, from sales on his e-book.  Bottom line is this.  This website is selling an e-book that describes a ""system"" that doesnt work.  Its just like any other gambling system that is out there on the internet that eventually fails.  If the owner of the website is making so much money through gambling, why does he charge for his e-book, why not make it free if he really wants to help people?  Oh thats right, because maybe most of the money that he actually makes is coming from his e-book sales, not gambling.Michael Burke is a total scammer, looking to take peoples hard earned money and doesnt care whether or not you lose money using his gambling techniques.Below I have the email exchange between Michael Burke and Myself
Hello Michael,I took my time studying the material that you sent in your e-book. I wanted to make sure that I knew the material very well before I started using my money in a live casino. I used your ""system of play"" to the T following your progression rules and rules for the table games that you outlined. I just came back from Las Vegas on a weekend trip. I left with a bankroll of $1,000 and I came back with virtually nothing left losing my entire bankroll. I followed your system word for word and made sure I never deviated from it, but I still managed to lose everything.  I dont know what to do...Do you have any suggestions? I am very discouraged at this point. Thank You
(Response from Michael Burke after 2 days)
Hey Charlie, sorry for the bad experience!A few quick questions...You lost $1,000, what size bank were you playing out of? What size bets were you playing? What games did you play? Where did you play? How many sessions did you play?You said it was a week-end trip, how much total time was spent actually gambling?Michael Burke

(My response)Hello Michael,I started with a Bank Roll of $1000. Based on master guide you provided, the only comparable was $750 bank roll with $150 buy in and $5 unit bets. So I used $5 bets. I played at the Hooters Casino and I only played craps and blackjack. I played 6 sessions before I lost virtually my entire bankroll. Each session took hours as I would go down and then up in my buy in but eventually lost it all. I played basic strategy with blackjack like you recommended in your book and played craps with your recommendations as well. I looked for nervous dealers at the blackjack table, and craps table where the action was happening. I played the progression just as you outlined in your book, every time I lost a progression I would start over just as you stated. Anytime I lost my buy in I would leave the table as suggested. I didnt let my emotions get involved and I stuck to your rules to the T
(Didnt get a response 3 days later, so I asked for a refund and wrote this) Hello Michael, I would like to request a full refund for the money I paid for your e-book. The ""system of play"" you described didnt work for me and I only lost money when I actually used your techniques at a live casino. If I do not receive a refund within the next 24-72 hours I will have to assume that you have no intention of giving me a refund. I will therefore request a chargeback from my credit card company, as well as post negative reviews on every possible blog I can find on the internet about your company and it practices. If I get a refund, I will do no such thing. I only think it is common courtesy since I lost $1000 using your techniques at a live casino and didnt profit from your ""system of play"" then I am entitled to a refund since your product didnt live up to what you promised, which is being profitable. Thank You (Finally got a response after 5 days of hearing nothing) Hey Charlie, I just was forwarded your email. I'm down in San Diego with a group at Pechanga Casino..be back in Vegas tonight, I'll take a look at everything and get back to you tomorrow! Thanks(Here is the email he sent next day)Here's the way your play should have broken down. If you start with a $750 bank, use $150 buy-ins with $5 bets. Each play day, you would only play 5 tables and your maximum loss for the day would be $105. As you play each table, you need to follow the win/loss worksheet on page 50. If you follow this, your worse day of play would be a 70% loss of your $150 buy-in. You also need to also take a look at Page 33 and your safety factors. Once we add the 'members only' page to our site, you'll be able to get one on one advise from members that have been playing and winning. As far as refunds, we've never offered refunds. You can't read the book, run to a casino one time and say it doesn't work...it's gambling! Our members win consistently, but in a short run, they can also loss and that is what you did. You'll receive your user ID and password shortly to access the 'members only' page. 
(I never responded to this last email he sent and decided to post my experience with Michael Burke and his website www.gamblersoncall.com everywhere I could on the internet)Please dont waste your hard earned money on this guyssystem!  You will regret it!  I am only taking the time to do this so you dont lose a bunch of money like I did.So is this a winning system? In my experience no.  In most peoples experiences? Probably not.  Yes, I did lose over $1000, but at least now I can provide you who are reading this, an unbiased, objective experience and you can now make an educated decision on whether or not buying Michael Burkes e-book or other products is something you should do. Good Luck									",Internet

										My 1st complaint is when I was talked in dropping AT&T and combining my phone service with TWC, i was only given the ""good news""..all the extras I would be getting for only a couple dollars more a month. She NEVER said anything about a service charge and a home phone activation fee!  The second complaint is totally unsatisfactory services! I have had nothing but trouble with my phone connections and internet connection! I have had several techs here to ""fix"" the problems but never have had done correctly! Now they're suppose to be sending a specialist on Wednesday Jan 9th 2013. 
Back to the trouble, I have had to disconnect my modem and router & reboot my PC 5-6 times a day in order to get connection! My phone service takes 30 -40 mins to connect to make a phone call! I have been experiencing these problems since I connected my phone services to TWC. When I got my bill i received $25.00 in extra charges. I call and told them I wasn't told of any ""charges"" for adding my phone! After several connections to different departments, they agreed to creit me $9.95 but they ""couldn't"" credit the $14.95 Home Activation fee...just not possible! They say at the begingiing of each phone call ""you may be recorded for quality services"", so why don't they go back and listen to see the rep did not mention any of these charges?? Also, as many times I've had to call, was disscontected, hung up on, re-routed, waited for a rep and all the trouble I had with the service I would like a credit! All they wanted to give me was a $20.00 off the whole bill! counting the $9.95! If someone reads to chats i have had, the recordings of my many phone calls, and disconnections of reps, they would see why I am so upset! I have NO problem, not paying them at all!

I discovered TWC has a very sneaky billing practice - the give you movie channel access for a year - but don't notifiy you when that year is up, nor do they keep ANY record of your prior chats - so if you don't you are on the hook.  I had put a reminder on my calendar to cancel the service in 2014, but they tell me they have no record of my call in 2012.
I was charged $288 for channels I NEVER had access to.  Because I couldn't prove it - I didn't save the chat from last April - I am stuck with the bill.  Those of you who may ask - why didn't you check your bill? - I went paperless.  Once I tried to log on to review the bill - TWC had changed the platform and I couldn't log on.  
Lesson learned - DO NOT GO PAPERLESS.  Open every bill - TRUST NO, ONE ESPECIALLY TWC. ACCEPT NO FREE OFFERS.

Wildwood, New Jersey United States of America ",www.comcast.net,1-800-COMCAST,"Comcast of Wildwood, NJ  Lies, Deception, Extortion and Fraud Wildwood, New Jersey","
										  What is a consistent Comcast bill? Who knows?  My monthly bill for telephone, internet and cable TV fluctuates from $150 - $195 without any extra services, movies, etc being purchased.  Comcast has not been able to explain why the bill is never consistent.  
  There have been two times where I have paid my bill on time and even in advance only to have Comcast suspend my services for ""non-payment"".  I have had to drive to their office with my receipts (missing work and losing pay) to prove my account was in good standing and to hear employees apologize for company mistakes.  
  My latest experience with Comcast takes the cake and is the mother of deception, fraud and extortion.  I paid my bill on time, $171.38.  The bill was due on December 14th and I paid it on December 9th.  On December 17th, I came home from work to find my television, internet and telephone disconnected.  My cell phone network was having trouble so this warranted a 15 mile drive to the nearest public pay phone from which I called Comcast.  I gave them the reference number from the paid bill and again they admitted my services were suspended by mistake.  I was told the services would be instantly restored.  I drove home, waited an hour and half and still no services.  I drove back to the public phone and called them again.  This time they told me the ""tech department"" was closed and my services couldn't be restored until the following day.  However, they told me that if I was willing to pay $170.30, a month IN ADVANCE, they could restore my services instantly.  This is where I got confused. The tech department was closed and couldn't restore my services until the following day, but if I paid an additional $170.30 for services I haven't even yet received, my phone, television and internet could be ""magically"" restored.  I said I'd wait for the following day as I'm not in the habit of paying bills for services I haven't yet received.
   So the following day comes and my services aren't restored as promised.  I drive back to the public phone and place another call to Comcast.  This time they tell me that since I didn't resolve the issue by midnight of the previous day, I now owe the $170.30 for a month in advance, plus a $100 deposit and a $5 restoration fee for each of my services.  Without this additional $285.30 being paid, I will have no services.  
  This borders on extortion, not to mention a series of lies and deception from Comcast employees.  Changing the name of the company to Xfinity was a maneuver to cover up shoddy service and complaints.  It's still the same olf company fleecing its customers with lies.  Not to mention there are very few employees who speak and understand English, making communication with them next to impossible.  Avoid these scam artists at all costs.

										After reading a report written last month on this terrible internet service, I felt i had to chime in as well.
RuralWest is one of the 2 known internet providers on Vandenberg AFB.  The other being Verizon High Speed Internet.  I had originally chosen RuralWest (6.0+ Mbps) because they offered faster speeds compared to Verizons (3Mbps) download speeds.  With the number of Computers, Laptops, and Tablets floating around my house I needed the download/upload speeds to support them.
Like a growing number of Americans, I have dropped cable TV services in opt for Internet based entertainment (Netflix, Hulu, & Amazon Prime).   My household has been internet dependent for 3 years now with no issues, until moving to this base.  I currently pay $57.75 for what they call ""PREMIUM INTERNET"", and I get speeds comparable to dial-up or slightly better.  Evenings (4pm-12am) are the worst times to browse or watch anything online.  We continually have to wait for video to buffer on Netflix and even YouTube.   Mornings (3am-10am) seem to be the best times to get things done.  Anytime after that seems to be spotty at best.  The slow speeds (30KBps) I get in the evenings is about what i used to get when I was deployed.  Those of us who know how crappy the internet is down range, knows that it should be much better at home.
Since I've started subscribing early this year (2012), internet speed and reliability has slowly but surely degraded.  I was on the brink of canceling my service before I received an email from the President, talking about an upgrade.
""DEAR SUBSCRIBER:
 
I would like to personally apologize to all those subscribers who 
experienced the five day outage on our Interent.  We had what I would 
call the triple play of events in respect to that outage.  First is 
Murphy's Law - If something is going to happen it will always happen at 
an unopportune time - we had our outage on Friday afternoon on a three 
day weekend.  Secondly, our outage was caused by the loss of a power 
supply to a fiber node.  The replacement part happened to experience 
what is termed infant mortality - which means if an electronic component 
is going to fail - it will fail instantly or within a very short time. 
 Our third item was the simple fact that our supplier is located in 
Florida and they had gone home for the weekend.  We did try to fly a 
unit in from Colorado, but as it turned out it was non compatible with 
the fiber node in place.  Long story short - we do apologize and we have 
set some plans into place to assure we have a back up for the back up!
.
 
In regards to the upgrade of our network.  Our plan is to upgrade our 
speeds on the base significantly.  Our suppliers have estimated that we 
should have service in the mid October time period.  The gating factor 
being a connectivity issue between our headend and the telephone central 
office.  Fortunately, the distance between our two entities is measured
in feet not miles.  Once we establish the new broadband pipe - we will 
be changing our current offering to better accommodate users.  The most 
significant change will be less contention for bandwidth and higher 
throughput.  We will also be establishing some usage gates, however, 
they will probably not impact 90% of our customers.
 
The usage gates will be matched to the tiers of our service 
offerings.  In the next several weeks we will send you another general 
information email with our plans.
 
Thanking you all for being so understanding
 
James R Hirschy
President -Rurlwest Corporation.""
Now I understand that their estimated time for completing the upgrade may be off a bit, but its now a few days before December with no change in their terrible Internet service.  I have tried to reach out to them by email asking them to give me a call in hopes to find out where they are at with the upgrade and to find out any kind of info that would help enlighten me on why internet service has been degrading over the past 6 months, but I have yet to hear from them.  Their internet service is truly horrid and I encourage others to file a similar complaint and to spread the word on their internet service.  If any customer knows of a better internet service that is available to the base, please spread the word.  The previous report I read mentioned Verizon Fios, but everywhere I look online for alternate services have come up with ""not available in your area"".  If you know how to get it, advertise it.  File a complaint, and submit a report to the Commanders Action Line.  If we all do a little, we will do a lot.

										Essentially, Fueled.com exploits its workers and clients. Upon entering an agreement with the company, I read an advertisement which indicated, ""Upon completion of your internship, there is a HIGH probability of you being hired."" Approximately two months into the training, I was then told, ""about 10% of interns are hired."" I am blowing this whistle on this highly misleading information, a direct contradiction willingly known about my the company. They use such enticing grounds as full-time employment to maintain a steady stream of UNPAID interns, who work tirelessly, undoubtedly unaware of the ""10%"" chance of them being hired. With no chance of a full time position,  a significantly smaller portion would willingly choose to work day in and day out for no money!
Additionally, I was told my work was ""not billable"" aka not worth money. Meanwhile, I was assigned a public relations client who was billed $125 dollars an hour for my work. Another contradiction.

In early November, I call. They say they w ill get back to me with how they are going to proceed. I get an email the remaining day saying they will give me $25 saveology credit (I paid over $65 for all of it). I email back saying this is unacceptable. No response.

										After months of torture, we sent the following letter to Cbeyond but never got any response. I was given a call by a law firm who is suing CBEYOND. I lost their number. Can anyone post their number again?  In case I need it.
 Since we became a customer of  Cbeyond we have experienced nothing but very poor customer service and a dysfunctional organization. Two weeks ago I received a call from an out of state attorney who said they are starting a class action law suit against Cbeyond.  Honestly, it did not surprise me at all. I am not sure how Cbeyond is still in business competing with extream customer 
service oriented companies. I guess customers like me who writes check for 
Cbeyond employees have no place in your business strategy.
Does your upper management know that their sales reps use illegal tactics to sign up customers? For instance, we were promised (verbal) a guaranteed $200 per month bill and $1,000 sign up bonus. [continued below]....
									
										..... We never received $1,000 bonus and our phone bill is over $400 a month (we used to pay only $250 to Comcast for higher quality service).  
If you come to my business you will see a huge mess of phone and electric cables that was left hanging on the wall by the tech that Cbeyond sent to our business when they installed the service. Those cables are huge safety risk for our property and employees. We called and complained 
but we were told by your customer service people that it was not their mess. We 
had several other issues with your service and every time we tried to get help from Cbeyond they just ignored us or asked to call some third party tech. 
I can cite at least dozen experiences where Cbeyond lost an opportunity to create a lifelong customer. In September we lost phone service for 5 days (we are a Pizza delivery service who depends on phone service).
Cbeyond did not help us at all. We lost over $7,000 in sales and wages. We were offered pitty $63 as compensation. When our insurance company called Cbeyond they did not get any information and were brushed off. I will invite your president Jim Geiger to call COMCAST to understand what really a customer services is. They will take care of him like a family member.  
Honestly, I hope Cbeyond closed their business so their reps do not mislead  the helpless consumers.  I think we tried to put up with Cbeyond for such a long time that pain has become 
cancer. We need to fight the pain now with any help we can receive. Just check 
out the internet and you will know why people are extremely unhappy with Cbeyond.

										Yesterday, I rented Dark Shadows through the Vudu app on my X Box. Except for the first time I streamed a movie through Vudu, I have had almost no problems or very few problems. The first time I had a technical issue; there was some type of an audio delay that was very distracting.  Vudu acknowledged the issue and immediately resolved my concern by offering me a service credit. After that, I watched about a half dozen more movies on Vudu with no problems until last night. I rented Dark Shadows with my husband and the movie buffered well over a dozen times. It was so bad that it would buffer for 30 seconds or longer and then it would show the film for a 2-3 seconds, and then it would start buffering again for another 30 seconds. It completely
ruined the experience of watching the film and I was disappointed. I called Vudu today at 5:30 p.m. and spoke to a customer service representative. I explained my technical issue and the representative was completely off the mark from the beginning. It was like he was not even listening to what I said. He ignored the fact that my husband did some troubleshooting by resetting the modem and the representative recommended that
I play the movie again and reset the modem. I told him I didnt want to watch the movie again and that I already tried resetting the modem and that it did not help. When I realized that I could not get through to the representative, I asked to speak to a supervisor. The representative said that there were no supervisors available because it was almost closing time. When I pointed out that it was only 5:30 p.m. and that they closed at 8 p.m., he said yeah, its almost closing time, there is no one here but representatives. He said that the only person that was available was a team lead. I asked to speak to the team lead. The representative questioned me on the subject that I wanted to discuss with the team lead. I said unsatisfactory customer service. After a very long hold, I was transferred to another gentleman. He introduced himself as a supervisor. I said, the representative just told me that there are no supervisors available because it was almost closing time despite it only being 5:30 p.m. He apologized and said he would talk to the representative about it. I thought that he would resolve my issues and just issue me a credit for the disappointing viewing experience. Instead, he was rude, talked over me, interrupted me, and was disrespectful. He, like the previous representative, wanted me to do some troubleshooting that the other representative already mentioned. I explained that we already did that troubleshooting and that it was an issue with Vudus server. We have the highest internet speed that Cox Cable offers and was able to watch Netflix and Hulu with no problems before and after the movie on Vudu
so we knew it was not our connection that was the issue. Despite explaining this, the supervisor insisted that we troubleshoot with technical support. I told him again repeatedly that it was not our connection that was the cause of the rebuffering and that we received multiple error messages saying that Vudu could not play our movie when the rebuffering got really bad. He refused to listen to me, cut me off, and talked over me. I was shocked at how disrespectful he was to me. Vudus representative and supervisor were completely uncareful, were not thoughtful to my concerns, were inconsiderate,
lacked thoroughness, and treated me like a greedy customer that wanted some freebie for complaining without a valid complaint. I felt marginalized and accused of being a liar when I had terrible issues with their service. They do
not own up to their poor customer service, their lack of quality, and the issues with their server. I will never rent movies through Vudu. I understand that technical issues can occur once in a while but the customer service was
reprehensible. Id rather drive to the last Blockbuster in a 20 mile radius and rent a DVD than buy another movie rental from Vudu.									",Internet

										AT&T's throttling of unlimited internet customers is outrageous and I cannot understand why the PUCs and class action lawyers have not gone after them.  You sign up for unlimited internet, you pay the money monthly, then they cut you off full speed when you exceed some varying limited data amount in a month. Really I did not care till my son experienced it tonight.
I have 4 AT&T lines with unlimited data. My wife and I use virtually nothing, and the kids use quite a bit. But typically 2Gbs a month. Today my son got a nastygram text saying that he was using a lot this month and would be throttled at 5Gb. At this point he has used 3.5Gb. I did not listen to him properly and called AT&T to complain. The guy said that they now cut at 3Gb. So I expressed my extreme displeasure. After the call my son pointed out that the text said 5Gb not 3Gb. 
So I called back and got some girl who told me that AT&T's computers were down for the next 2 - 4 hours (what, they don't keep their customer support computers up at 6pm? Maybe not when they get complaining customers on the line)... Anyway, she said that for LTE customers (like my son's phone) the limit before throttling is 5Gb and not 3Gb but she could not look into it because... yes the computers were down. So I told her I was fed up with this and that I had signed up for unlimited data on 4 lines, now they were cutting one of them off at 3Gb but it was meant to be 5Gb and should of course be infinite. 
Anyway, this is a scandal and a total ripoff and no one amongst the 300 million people in America seems to care or be able to do anything about it. Where can one find some legislator who is not getting reelection money from AT&T, or PUC member who is not being entertained in Vegas by AT&T, or a lawyer who is presumably not getting free ATT&T phone service to go after this pseudo monopoly?

										My ordealstarted the first week of July. I was moving into a new apartment and exploring my options for internet service. I have been an AT&T cell phone user for almost 10 years, so I decided I would give them a call to inquire about high-speed internet service.Initially, AT&T's offer seemed to be a decent deal, so I told the sales agent that I was interested. She went over some of the terms with me, then collected some information (Address, SS#, Etc.), and asked about a start date.So, I gave her the date that would best suit my schedule. However, after we established this, she disclosed some, ""additional"" terms. One of which, was the fact that I would owe a relatively substantial amount if I decided to cancel the service within 2 years. Upon hearing this, I informed the sales representative that I was no longer interested in the service. She
accepted this, and told me that the sale had been canceled. About 2 weeks later, I receive a phone call from a, ""technician"" stating that he is here to set up my new internet service. I informed him that this must be some sort of mistake, and after hearing that, he agreed, and I thought that all was well. The very next day, I receive an internet modem, along with set-up instructions. This, of course, was very disconcerting. I
called AT&T immediately, and the representative said that they saw that my service had been canceled and informed me that the only action that I needed to take, was to return the modem. So, my wife took the modem to UPS (No packing
label was enclosed) and returned it to the address listed on the package.Much to my dismay, the following month, I received a bill from AT&T for $100.20. Charges were for internet service, installation, and equipment. I immediately called AT&T, and the ""customer service"" representative that I spoke with seemed confused at the fact that I never wanted the service. I informed her that I initially told the sales rep that I did not want the service at the end of my inquiry and that this bill is some sort of mistake. She basically proceeded to tell me that there was nothing that she could do, and I had to pay the bill. I immediately requested a supervisor, and her response was, ""My supervisor is busy, they will have to call you later."" Attempting to keep my cool, I said, ""Okay that will be fine."" Then after asking for her name and contact information, I was magically disconnected. I called back, and was connected to a different rep. I told him the situation, he told me to ignore the bill, and that I would have a statement crediting me for the full amount the next month. Again, I said that I would still like to speak with a manager, and he gave me the, ""Okay, they will call you in 2-3 business days speech."" Then I asked for his name and contact information, he gave me his first name, and told me that there is no way to contact specific reps. I never received a phone call from a supervisor, and if I did, I did not answer the phone due to not recognizing the incoming phone number. No message, or contact information was provided.The next month... I received the same bill, this time saying that the amount was now over due. Once again, I contacted customer service. This time, I was directed to billing. The AT&T rep there told me that I had not returned the modem. In response to this, I gave them the UPS tracking number that I received upon returning the modem. After that, I was put on hold for 3-5 minutes, and the rep came back on and informed me that I would be credited for the modem, but not the connection fees and the service. I asked, ""Why not?"" and she responded by saying that because, I gave the sales rep my ss#, I legally consented to the transaction. Also, if I wanted to cancel service with no charge, I had to do it within 3 business days, otherwise, I would receive a bill, like I had. I responded by telling the rep that, even if I had given my ss#, that it wasn't a consent to service, and even if it was, at the end of the initial sales call, I had told the sales rep that I no longer wanted the
service, thus, negating any sort of consent. I also informed the rep, that even if giving my SS# was indeed consent to service, by saying that I no longer wanted the service at the end of the call, I would be well within the ""3-Day"" limit for service cancellation. I then asked if the sales calls were recorded, and she informed me that they were not, however,
supervisors listen to the calls, and they had not ""heard"" me say that I did not want the service (This, of course, is an impossibility, since I did tell the sales rep that I was no longer interested in the service). Then, the tech rep, with whom I was speaking, told me that she agreed with my interpretation of ""what constitutes a transaction."" She informed me that she was just a tech rep, and that she could not help me further, but should contact customer service, and they could potentially help my cause.Since I had basically been called a liar by whatever manager supposedly, ""listened"" to the initial sales call, I again, asked to be called by a supervisor. She said okay (Supervisor never called... again) then transferred me to a billing rep, who supposedly could help me. This rep said that, after my credit for the modem, she would credit the rest of the account. I thanked the agent and asked, ""So now this account is clear, I now owe NO money.""She responded, ""Yes Sir, please wait 1 billing cycle to receive the credit.""The next month, I received the same bill... with no credit. Weary of what the rep had told me about the credit taking up to 2 billing cycles, I ignored the bill. The following month, I received ANOTHER bill, no credit applied. I called, and again, spoke with AT&T customer service. This representative informed me that the credits were in the system, and that I had to wait for the next bill to see them. Again, I asked if these credits absolved me of having to pay any money. He said ""yes sir."" I was thinking that this had been solved, until today. I received yet ANOTHER bill. This time, for $25.20. I had only been given a credit for $19.95 worth of internet service, and $55.05 for what I am assuming, is the remaining balance
of the modem, which was $75. Since the initial bill was for $100.20, I was NOT credited the remaining balance as stated by BOTH customer service reps that i had spoken with. I will be contacting AT&T again tomorrow... and more than
likely, will be met with more lies, and indifference. After this, my wife and I will never use any service provided by AT&T again The practices used by their sales staff and sales managers is clearly unethical, and the company appears to have no desire to rectify this issue. I only hope that other people do not fall victim to this atrocious abomination of a company.									",Internet

										I've had the worst experience with Nextiva's online fax service. I signed up for a free trial. Upon signing up, I did NOT receive a confirmation email with my temporary password. I had to click on the ""forgot my password"" link in the login section of the Nextiva website in order to have their system send the password to my email address. 
Second, I decided to use MetroFax instead of Nextiva due to their ease of use and ability to send 79 page faxes (I had also signed up for a free trial for MetroFax at the same time that I signed up for the free trial with Nextiva). I attempted to send a cancellation email to Nextiva, and the email was returned to me as having ""failed to send"". I called their customer support to try to cancel the account via phone, and the representative (Jerome) stated the account could only be cancelled via email. I asked him if he could remain on the phone with me while I attempted to resend the email via a different email service provider, and he rudely scolded me, ""I CAN'T WAIT ON THE PHONE FOR 24-48 HOURS WHILE THE CANCELLATION IS PROCESSED."" All I asked was for him to remain on the phone while I resend the email from another email provider to determine if the ""failure to send"" issue was on my side or their side. 
In the end, I was eventually able to send the email. 
Based on my experience with Jerome from Nextiva's customer service department, I would never sign up with any service provided by Nextiva. They have an incompetent, untrained staff. Nextiva's policy states in writing that the customer can either call or write an email to their customer support. Yet, when I called, I was told that the only option available was cancellation via email. I do not like this lack of understanding of policy amongst their customer service representatives.

										I moved to a location that did not have internet service, and since the satellite dish was on my roof, I called Hughesnet...BIG MISTAKE!! To begin with, I was quoted $52.99 per month.  I am being charged $68 (incl taxes). 
I called customer service and was told that I was being charged for a ""repair discount"" of $6.95 per month.  When I asked to have it removed, the lady told me that she had to ask if she could because she didn't know who authorized it.  I didn't authorize it, so remove it. Finally, it was taken care of.  That was phone call #1.
I tried to get online to check my account, and because no one at HughesNet did not follow thru and give me paperwork for my account,  I did not have my account #. Hence, phone call #2.  This time I reached someone named Ann.  Ann doesn't like to be nice. She told me that I was using over 250mb of downloading everyday...No I'm not.  HughesNet is so slow that the 5 adults who live in my house don't like using the computer. She says I can get tokens to give me more mb's.  Really?!  Don't I pay for that service? I didn't sign up for tokens!  Needless to say, we didn't get anywhere at all.  I hung up because HughesNet is only one-sided.  Customer care my ass!
Ok, so now I have my account #, it doesn't work online.  Phone call #3. This time I spoke to Karen. I hung up on this one!  I told her my account # didn't work, she gave it to me again.  This one is on ANN!  I even repeated my account # to her, twice, and she said it was good.  She failed to give me one more #. Thank you, Ann.   I asked Karen if she could cancel my AUTOPAY and give me a paper statement, so I can have better control over this account.  HughesNet charges $5 for that!  
What makes this worse, 3 of our cellphones depend on the internet to work for phone service, and now I am back to using a house phone.  Thanks HughesNet...you suck!!

It started out with me filling out their ""quote"" form online in which they give you an ""initial"" price they are willing to offer for your device. I accepted and they mailed out the shipping materials. I received the materials and sent my devices in USPS. That was the beginning. I kept the tracking info since theirs does not work on the site except to track the box they send. After tracking it I noticed it sat in the Sparks, NV hub for 3 days before another delivery service picked it up. Why not just use USPS all the way? What are they hiding? 
I emailed and received a quick response stating it was still in transit. I live in BHC, AZ and I am only 2 days USPS or UPS away, however it took nearly a week for it to hit their so called warehouse. After they inspect your phone for another 2 days their buyer Brian calls you to give you a bogus line and an offer that is 1/10th of the original ""quote"". He stated since a newer phone came out it dramatically dropped the offer of my phone and he would offer me $10 right now for my brand new phone. I declined his offer and told him to ship my devices back to in which he stated he would get in touch with his warehouse to forward the information. 
I went on their website to see if his quote was still standing for that phone. Low and behold it shows $145 for my phone that he states was worth only $10 because of the release of other new phones. 
 This is a bait and switch company! Do not use them for anything you need to send in, even if you are desperate. There are plenty of other websites out that will be willing to buy your devices and our probably more honest then this company is.

										I'm not exactly sure what this company does, since all of their stuff is in Romanian, but to me it looks like an Internet Cafe.  Twice now, this company has purchased large packages from my website Viewet for Facebook Fans.  The first time it was 8,000 the second time it was 7,000.  The first one was purchased on the 23rd of March and was disrputed on the 27th of March, after we had delivered all 8,000 Fans to their page and the second one was purchased on the 27th and was disputed today, the 3rd of April.  Each time, they file a Unauthorized Claim which they somehow win because online Serivices are not covered for seller protection.  They wait until they get what they purchased, then I get the claim.  I don't know if it's their accounts that they are doing it with, or if they seriously hacked someone, but the claims seem to come only after the service was delivered, so I'm guessing it's their accounts and their is no address on either of the accounts. 
The two different emails they purchased from were: angiejmayes@hotmail.co.uk and kevine014@aol.com

Internet United States of America ",www.ecoeconow.org,619 622-1804,Domonic Mongello EcoEcoNow Domonic Mongello Made Promises and charged thousands of dollars and never delivered anything with his ecoeconow scam that has been in launch phase for several years. Internet,"
										Domonic Mongello charged  me thousands and thousands of dollars and made a mountain of promises with his ecoeconow scam business and delivered on none. Once paid he became the most arrogant, narcissistic, social path I have ever seen in my life. It is then he begins to treat people like garbage and everything becomes his way or the highway. Like all narcissus, Domonic is a complete control freak and IF there was a ecoeconow for those who didn't get in line with the way he thinks ""THEIR"" Business should run, he would just cut them off the system until they do fall in line. A con man of a person who claims to be a good Buddhist (yea right) when he doesn't get his way you will not see a good
Buddhist but someone in a bad moodhist. 
Narcissus like Mongello are bullies and like to use verbal intimidation and threats on their victims to get their way. And if that doesn't work, he uses pity stories in a attempt to control and manipulate your emotions such as weather problems destroying his home, internet problems due to flooding, the death of his mother(didn't attend her funeral) sickness and being in the hospital and any other pity party item he can use to buy time, stall progress and manipulate a situation for his own purpose. And finally if he has to become a Monk a buddhist or mother Teresa to sell himself off as a great guy to manipulate you consider it done. And if you asked for a refund, in his arrogant mind he believes just talking with his highness on a telephone justifies his fees like he is some Anthony Robbins guru. What can be done about Domonic Mongello?
The problem is he lives in Thailand and is heavily guarded within it's corrupt system! This gives him the comfort of not worrying about accountability for his fraudulent actions. There is a large number of individuals that's been a victim of this scam artist and my hope is if we can save you the reader of this report from losing your money to a wolf, that's one less person that will need to write their story of being ripped off by this moodhist con man on this forum.",Internet

										Kocasinan Kayseri. Promised low prices for poultry products. I travelled from my country to see for myself. When I visited them everything looked so real. The offices, the furniture, the staff, the equipments, the machinery and the workers all dressed in nice and clean uniforms. The owner Ms. Ela and her husband Serkan promised that after I pay them they will load and ship my goods within the next day. I had no doubts in my mind, so paid them all the cash I had brought with me. The next day they started giving me excuses for not being able to load and ship. One day they delayed because of label printing problem. Another day the truck broke down coming from Iraq. The next day they said another of their truck was coming from Iran and the driver was tired so he is resting. The next day they said because of the wether conditions they are not able provide the goods. By then I realized there was something not right with these people. So I decided to ask for my money back because I couldn't stay and bear the expenses of car rental, hotel and food. But they refused to return the cash. When I insisted they called the police and kicked me out of the factory. Soon I found out that iwasnt the only victim. I met more people who were also ripped off and had no hope and didn't know what to do. I and some of the victims decided to fight for our rights by legal means.

If you look at the BBB page about K2 Networks they have had multiple complaints over the past while and yet still maintain an A+ rating.
http://www.la.bbb.org/business-reviews/Online-Gaming-Websites/K2-Network-in-Irvine-CA-100018034
That is because the Better Business Buearu takes money for better ratings and has obviously been paid off and the A+ rating that you are seeing here is a bought rating so don't believe the rating that you see on the BBB website about these guys.
The Better Business Bureau ratings are misleading at best and misrepresent the true rating of a company. If you file a complaint with them they will close off the complaint and do nothing to help you and if you question them about the rating they will just give you a bunch of garbage about how the rating system is a complex system.

So you are probably asking why I am telling you to avoid the online game Fallen Earth. Basically the game is laggy as hell most of the time it is quite unplayable. Also a thing occurs that is called ""rubber banding"" here you will walk forward 2 steps and then get pulled back to your orginal position again due to all the lag. There are frequent outages and server crashes and log in issues with not being able to log in. 
The servers have been like this for months now and nothing is getting better recently they introduced this on the steam network and ever since then it has gotten 10 times worse. 
If you complain about the problem to the staff nothing gets done about the problem. The Game Masters (GMs) in the game are rude and ignorant towards the players and their customer service in game or if you open up a ticket is horrible. 
Basically in game every time you log into the game if you are a free member a large logo comes up telling you subscribe to the game. Which I did because I got sick of seeing this come up every time and opening up a web browser window every time trying to get you to subcribe then when you do subscribe to the game you can't even play the game because of all the technical problems with their server and software.  
Over all the game is extremely buggy even in game as well with lots of glitches and problems. The server I am playing on is NOT a test server this is the full production server and there are this many problems. 
There are frequent disconnects and the server is extremely laggy! 
Now I have asked to be compensated for all of the outages and lag and extremely horribly play and nothing has been done up to this day to compensate me since I am a paying customer and have a commander's level subscription which costs an outragous $29.00 a month. You can go play a lot of other MMOs for a heck of a lot cheaper then that.  Over all this is just yet another rip off. 
This is nothing more than a money grab they want you to subscribe and pester you till you do. And once you get in game if you have to reset your AP you have to buy that from the cash shop with real money. 
This is nothing more than a money grab by this company and they are doing a horrible job at running the game and expect people to pay for this crap! Even once you are a subscriber you get very little and still have to pay for reset injectors (reset your AP) if you screw up and put the points into the wrong location. THis should be 100% free if you are a subscriber.

When I reached almost $1,000 in revenue, I received a message that my account had been flagged for a warning because of a violation of the Terms of Service on Fiverr. I sent a request to the online system to ask why. They told me that a certain line in the item was a violation of the TOS and needed to be removed. I responded that it was no problem to remove it, with my apologies, since it was a line used be another seller who had almost 2,000 transactions completed on the site. Two hours later, I received three e-mailed, each timestamped within the same minute, informing me that I had been demoted to having no level on Fiverr. I contacted the customer support department,  to see why, but they cancelled my support request. I placed other, new support requests, but they cancelled those as well. Finally, I logged in to my Fiverr account and found that they had not given me full credit for orders that had cleared and were to be paid that had Gig ""Extras"" attached to them. I attempted to contact Fiverr about this as well, but they cancelled those requests also. Paypal is the payment method Fiverr uses and they refused to help or file a dispute about this company's wrong doings in this instance. DomainsByProxy/Godaddy is the cloaking service used by Fiverr to hide their contact information from any public WhoIs source.

They only offer online support and complaints can only be filed via e-mail. When I asked more detailed questions, the chat representative stopped responding.

										Last year in September 2011 I was recommended by AT&T sales person to switch from DSL to U-verse internet, with $5.00 more I was going to get 12 times better speed in my internet , total payment would be $24.95, which normally is $40.00 but this is promotion for one year. I asked the sales person how about after one year do I have to pay $40.00 ? she said no you can call and ask for the same rate. I gave my permission to switch, by the way they charge $100.00 on modem that they said I will get back with $100.00 rebate which I received the rebate 3 weeks ago.  The internet problem started from day one. Every time I call AT&T U-verse center I have to be on the phone for at least one hour to one hour forty five minutes, after 10 days of the service I was told that you can't get the speed that we offered so they lowered the speed to 6. After they lowered it, it started giving me more problems, constantly dropping the connection, very slow speed from 0.68 to max 4.80. I have never ever seen my speed going up to 5 or 6. the last tech person came to see what he can do after 2 hours of working on my internet before he left he saw that my internet dropped to 0.68, he said I can't do anything from this point on I will contact the center tomorrow they will send other tech person to work from outside to bring you speed upper 5. He left and the next day we had phone call he identified himself as AT&T U-verse tech and that he is going to be working on my internet and an hour later he called and said he is done. While he was on the phone I tested and still got the same old speed that fluctuated from 2 to 4. I told him at that moment and he said he can't help me that I have to contact the customer service. So I contacted customer service again, and they couldn't help me after another an hour to and hour forty-five minutes. Now, I started getting higher bills to pay for tech-support and other services that they didn't complete to change the internet speed. Every time I call they put me on hold then after waiting for half hour or so I get disconnected, now I don't know whom or where to call so they can solve this issue, is there anyway you can bring AT&T to listen their customers complain?

										My wife signed us up for clear internet service about 6-9months ago and in the initial 2weeks the service seemed to work without any hiccups until about the third week. Like most consumers, we didnt pay too much attention to it because we both were barely home and quite frankly we dont use the internet that much once we get back from work. The low speed and often no service from clear became more of an issue as our internet needs grew due to my business integrating the ipad into everything we do to service clients. So I called Clear to let them know that the 3mbps they promised wasn't actually what I have been getting once i tested the connectivity/ download speed. It was during this conversation that the truth was revealed, as the customer service rep i was speaking to asked me if i was a consistent user of the service and that if I wasn't  that could explain why my service speed may have been downgraded. He went on to tell me that the service might not work properly indoors as well. I found is statement appalling considering the fact that I had no desire to set my modem up on the exterior of my house at an attempt to enjoy consistent internet speed. Prior to this, i had spent a few hours here and there trying to troubleshoot the problem, to no avail. Sometimes it works for a few hours and then it will go slower or no service within the same day. So finally 2 weeks ago I decided it was time to stop this waste of money and cancel the service and request for a refund for the last few months. I was promised a call back from management and offered a lower bill to temporarily appease me. Once again I was shocked because based on the offer it seemd as though they knew their service wasn't worth the amount they charged and if you didnt complain then they kept taking your money. I accepted the offer but my issue still wasn't reolved, so i called again a few days later and i was informed of a $40 fee per modem to cancel. This means they intend to charge me a $80 cancellation fee for both modems i have. For a service that is subpar to say the least I dont think its fair and I am willing to fight them as far as I can.

There is literally a group of people who follow me everywhere and say all manner of lies about me.

If you do a search for your name before signup, they will ""entice you"" by implying that you have a criminal record (even though you have none). Once you sign up to see, it shows no records (of course).
Then as far as their ""service"" - they show only very few records, that are very incomplete and out of date - in fact, many are completely inaccurate. The service is utterly worthless. This is one of the most bogus garbage scams I have ever seen.									",Internet

										This company was found on the internet by my 12year old son who wanted to purchase a tablet with the money he had saved up from chores and Christmas gift cards. I had read the reviews and not knowing that these reviews are not written by the company consumers but the company themselves went and purchased the tablet for my son. We waited for the tablet to be shipped but, it was not sent to us for a few days after ordering it. I then received a phone call from Tony who said he worked for E Global Wireless and wanted to know if we wanted to upgrade this product.
Tony explained he would upgrade the battery and memory, plus throw in a rapid charger and car adapter normally costing $88.00 for just $43.00. After listening to his offer I accepted this offer. After he charged me he made a mistake he said and charged me $42.00. Finally after a couple of days we received this product in the mail. The first thing I realised it read made in Shenzhen, China and I work for an airline and realise many things comeing for this part of the world is either poorly made with cheap labor or counterfit. My son opened the box and the first thing I noticed was I couldn't see the upgrade promised by Tony, all I saw was a car charger. My son started to download games from the web which the unit did, very slowly. He went to play a game but no sound came out. I contacted eglobalwireless customer service who issued a refund slip to send the unit back.
I sent it back to them expecting a refund after sending it back at my charge. My son had paid $156.00 of his hard earned money and after crying after the tablet did not work, finally received a refund of $70.00(total). They refuse to send a full refund for defective product.									",Internet

										My wife signed us up for clear internet service about 6-9months ago and in the initial 2weeks the service seemed to work without any hiccups until about the third week. Like most consumers, we didnt pay too much attention to it because we both were barely home and quite frankly we dont use the internet that much once we get back from work. The low speed and often no service from clear became more of an issue as our internet needs grew due to my business integrating the ipad into everything we do to service clients. So I called Clear to let them know that the 3mbps they promised wasn't actually what I have been getting once i tested the connectivity/ download speed. It was during this conversation that the truth was revealed, as the customer service rep i was speaking to asked me if i was a consistent user of the service and that if I wasn't  that could explain why my service speed may have been downgraded. He went on to tell me that the service might not work properly indoors as well. I found is statement appalling considering the fact that I had no desire to set my modem up on the exterior of my house at an attempt to enjoy consistent internet speed. Prior to this, i had spent a few hours here and there trying to troubleshoot the problem, to no avail. Sometimes it works for a few hours and then it will go slower or no service within the same day. So finally 2 weeks ago I decided it was time to stop this waste of money and cancel the service and request for a refund for the last few months. I was promised a call back from management and offered a lower bill to temporarily appease me. Once again I was shocked because based on the offer it seemd as though they knew their service wasn't worth the amount they charged and if you didnt complain then they kept taking your money. I accepted the offer but my issue still wasn't reolved, so i called again a few days later and i was informed of a $40 fee per modem to cancel. This means they intend to charge me a $80 cancellation fee for both modems i have. For a service that is subpar to say the least I dont think its fair and I am willing to fight them as far as I can.

										Had service one town for nearly 1 year. There was a lot of connection and customer service issues as well as downtime with the internet. I never got the speeds I paid for, and whenever it rained my radio would go down. I complained got nowhere finally it fixed temporarily (when we went through a DROUGHT). Still not the speeds I was paying for or close to it. Tech support and onsite repairs was always long waits and weeks almost months before repairs.We ended up selling our house in December and bought a new house in another town. At the end of Dec. I emailed the company and requested information on getting my service disconnected since we would be moving and provided a date of Jan 16 as the absolute last possible cut off date in a second and third email through the company website. Hold times by phone are well over 1 hour for customer service and who really has that long to sit on hold?No one contacted me. I attempted to call them when we closed on our new house Dec. 30 and was placed on hold for over 13 minutes. I ended up hanging up. I called back on Jan 9, 2012 because we were out of the house and no one had picked up the ""radio"" yet. I spoke to Justinwho told me they never got my emails but he would set up the account for disconnection for Feb 2, 2012 because they like to put those way out there. I told him we would take the radio with us as I heard and read other consumers on ripoffreport.com complaining they charge you for the radio (around $300-$600) if they fail to pick it up. I didn't want that to happen. I told him I would deliver it to them in Arlington or they could pick it up. He said they would pick it up. He then asked if I wanted new service at the new address. Since Missy was so good last time I said ok, but I may change my mind because it was about 3 weeks out. I called back a few minutes later on the 9th remembering how badly I had been treated in the past and all the frustration and said I changed my mind just disconnect and leave it. I said to come get the dish or I'd take it to Arlington. he said someone would contact me. We use only cell phones and I have a record of all these calls on my phones! I spoke to I believe Justin again on that call. I figured everything was done and over. We sold our house in Joshua and the new people moved into on Jan. 16th. On Jan 18, 2012 a tech called me from his cell phone and said he was on his way to our new location in Alvarado for install. i didn't answer on my phone as I was busy so he called my husbands phone, again a cell phone. We told him we had cancelled and he was suprised to hear that. We asked him to pick up the radio/dish thing and he said he could not. I immediately called in and spoke to installs and told them we cancelled and the guy that day seemed suprised to hear that as well. He said ok let me fix it and placed me on hold. I didn't have time to wait on HOLD again for something I took care of so I hung up as I was walking into a meeting at my sons school for his special education. I could not miss it to deal with skybeam. I assumed it was finally done and over with. on Feb. 18 I received a bill for nearly $100 saying I was past due and it was deliquent and this account was going to collections. In addition it could hurt my credit. Since this was a shock to me, I attempted to call skybeam on the 18th at 1:52pm. I was placed on hold for over 6 minutes before being ""disconnected"". I then sent 2 emails through their website on the 18th & 20th with no reply and I ended up calling back on 2-20-12 and spoke to Chris. Chris informed there is a huge mishap on my account and a second account billed to me! He gave me a second account number for my NEW address and said I was installed on the 28th! How on Earth do I have service here when I cancelled, when I have no radio here, I didn't install it and neither did anyone else? I cancelled it BEFORE INSTALL! Yet they are charging me. I just haven't received a paper bill as of this posting.Then they are charging me another nearly $100 for a house I haven't lived in since Dec. 30, 2011 and I had cancelled there MULTIPLE TIMES! I told him to fix it and he said he is in Colorado call center and I had to speak to customer service. I am currently on eteral hold for well over 42 minutes now to customer service and still have no hope in sight to get this resovled. I have to keep wasting my time and holding and using my cell phone time and everything to Deal with THEIR ERRORS! They constantly make mistakes and the service was not what I paid for. They mislead you with their tech support that actually closes, I've gotten RUDE service (big suprise), the towers have blown over and took over a month to repair, the other towers are too full of customers and it causes slow speeds and disconnects yet they still charge you full price even though your down. They even claim you get 5 years of internet for free if you refer 5 people, problem is if you refer one you get 1 month yet that one month never seems to apply to the bill either. It sounds too good, because it is. They make it almost impossible to get the customer service and tech support you WILL NEED, and they have so many billing issues they think your going to bend over an pay it. I can confirm a few neighbors had similar issues and went back to DIAL UP and another friend in a different town had major billing issues. This is just not the best company to deal with anymore. They bought out all the good great little compaines around the small country areas giving you them or dial up as a choice. Its really not worth the headache though.I did everything right and being punished for it. It is very bad service and very deceptive as far as charging me for service I did not have, use, and cancelled.									",Internet

										A few weeks ago, I purchased a list of email addresses (to help generate leads) for companies based in the Miami Beach area.

Once I cleaned out the obvious junk, from 2,000 I was down to 150 seemingly pure leads. I sent an eblast out to those 150 emails and 70% were returned, undeliverable. I had spoken on the phone with a salesman prior to purchase who told me that it would have a maximum of 30% undeliverable. Recently, when I called the accounting department to seek a refund, I was sent to voicemail. So then I called the sales department and the rep told me he would have someone from support call me.

There are several things I found out during the course of my doing business with Doba that I hope will save many people headache and heartache. The monthly fee is ridiculous although they will offer you a ""deal"" on an annual subscription to get you in. BEWARE: Once you have paid, you are subscribed for the year. End of story. You cannot cancel. Their ""wholesale"" prices are marked up so high it's impossible to beat any prices being offered by those folks out there getting real wholesale prices. After several attempts at calling and getting hung up on, I emailed them to cancel my subscription and told that I must call in. I called in and the rep was so rude and nasty, I asked to speak with a manager and was told I could not. She informed me no one above her was available ever to take phone calls. I have never been told I cannot speak to a supervisor or manager on duty. The rep was downright insulting and spoke to me as if I were a child, finally telling me I was no longer ""allowed to be a customer"" Now that my account is cancelled (supposedly) I can still log in and now my account says I am past due. Do yourselves a couple of favors if you're interested in wholesale buying/selling:Find products you like and contact the companies directly. Most are more than happy to offer drop-shipping at a slightly higher price than wholesale but it is worth it if that is what you are looking at doing.Check out free resources like http://www.wholesalecentral.com/Dropshippers.html for information a lot of companies out there would love to charge you for.

										If you are interested in involvement with this company as a distributor I recommend you do one thing before forking over your hard earned money. Simply talk to the owner first. I was very interested and ready to invest, but before I did I wanted to talk to people and pick their brains about the business. So I started with them. My conversations were positive until I asked if they had some references of distributors I could speak with. I was told no, but pressed the issue, and was put on the phone with Michael. At first I thought great! I can talk to the owner and get a feel for him and his business. I soon became very disappointed. I was again told ""No we don't provide our distributors info to people for references, they are on our website"". Which I don't have a problem with, I was simply asking as I would prefer talking with someone rather than reading a statement on the companies site. It seems reasonable considering the distributors names and websites are listed, that they wouldn't mind talking to people.  The problem I had is that Michael became very defensive, even insulted that I would ask such a thing. He is obviously easily upset. My impression of the guy is that he is very thin-skinned and does not like to be questioned. I wasn't even trying to get under his skin, but I think that if I was, and pressed him, he would have had a complete melt down. I can't even imagine doing business with someone like that. In the end he told me ""I was not ready for his amazing opportunity, and should look elsewhere"". Hahaha, wow! He was right about that, I'm just not worthy!! Funny. If you can't handle the tiniest bit of scrutiny, you are not worthy!

										I signed up for Century Link service (formerly Qwest) in the first week on November of 2011. I signed up for auto turn on where they just send me the Router and I hook it up myself. The signal was supposed to be turned on on the 10th of November. The directions very explicitly said to wait until 5pm before hooking it up. On the 10th I waited until 7pm that night to connect it and there was no service.I didn't think much of it, so I called their tech support and they seemed at the time to try to be helpful. They ran their ""diagnostic"" and said everything should be up and running. It wasn't so we did the whole router restart thing and nothing.  At 9pm I finally said I'm done and went to bed.The next day I talked to someone in their Tech support team again and they said they would have to get a technician out to see what is going on and that they would waive the $80 for sending a tech out. [continued below]....
									
										..... I found that to be acceptable. They scheduled it for Monday the 14th between 11-4. Monday the 14th shows up and I am anxiously waiting for my tech to show up as we have had no internet since the 10th. At around 4:15 pm I called and asked where my tech was and they said they could have him give me a call. He called me 5 minutes later and said that he would not be able to make it out today. I'm pissed at this point and asked him if he could have at least called me to let me know. After all I did take the day off to do this. He said he was busy and my reply was You are going to come out today and hook this up. I wouldn't take no for an answer at this point. About 45 minutes later he shows up and acts like he did us this big favor with TONS of attitude. He got out of his truck, looked at my house, walked right past me ignoring me, got back into his truck and left. I was irate to say the very least.Then to add insult to injury, he called me 5 minutes later and said that we do not have a Century Link line to our house and that they would have to come out and bury a new line. I asked how long that would be and he said around a week.I called Tech support the next day and they said they had no information about any line having to be buried. So they set the appointment up for November 22. 11am-4pm again.Now it is the 22nd and needless to say I took the day off again, and needless to say at 4:30 I was on the phone with them asking where my tech was. He called me back and told me he was extremely busy. I said that was bullshit and he was going to get his ass out here and hook up our phone and Internet. he said he can make it there on the 23'rd and I said no way, I cannot take another day off of work to get blown off by you again. He showed up 45 minutes later and hooked our service line up. That is where the nightmare begins.The junction box that he has to use is across the alley from our house next to our local convenience store. He did not come equipped to bury the line instead just ""laid it across the alley"". Now I live up north and the snow flies here pretty early. I inquired about this and the tech said they will be back in about two weeks to bury the line. I called the next day and nothing was scheduled. So I scheduled for the line to be buried Dec 1, in the mean time the alley I live by is right next to a lumber yard, so traffic running over my line is high. But at least I have service at this time. December 1 rolls around and guess what, I should have learned by now, I took the day off and the crew that was supposed to bury the cable was a no show again. I was infuriated So I called everyone and their dog in Century Link. I finally got to a man named Doug, out of St. Paul Mn. And he was the first one that was truly helpful. He was a bit higher up in the ranks and he asked me for the best number to call me at and said he would investigate and find out whats going on. In the mean time he explained that the techs do not bury lines, they only connect them and repair them. They have independent contractors that bury the lines.Doug actually called me back the next day and was very apologetic when he told me that the crew will not be able to bury the line because the frost is deep in the ground now. To his credit I understand that as I have worked on farms my whole life. He said the next best thing we can do is have the tech come out and hang the line so it does not keep getting run over by traffic. I was ok with that. Mad that if they would have done it when they said they would have in the first place, it would be over by now.Long story short, the tech came out, said he needs to see if the convenience store will let him hang it from their store and I have never heard back from them again. The line is still in my alley and strewn across my yard. The first time a snow plow comes through our alley, we are out of service. I just wanted to post this up as a warning to anyone thinking about going with Century link. They have the worst customer service in the industry and the most lackadaisical attitudes I have EVER seen. On a side note, they told me that they will be able to come out this spring and bury the cable, and if a snow plow tears the line out, I am supposed to call them and they will send our friendly tech out to repair it. Its not a matter of ""if"" the snow plow comes, its a matter of when. And on a final thought, I just received a bill from them saying that I was past due and I owed them $190 for just phone and internet. I never even got a first bill from them. I called and they credited me $48 for the time I had gone without the internet. What a joke! Their $49.99 a month bundle fee for phone and Internet turned out to be $80 a month. Good luck with these scam artist. The saddest part is a couple of years ago, we used to have Qwest and the service was great and reliable. . . . .Century Link = EPIC FAIL									",Internet

										I woke up to check my bank account online to find 3 different charges for -$1.57 -$5.59 and -$17.84 on my card from WPI*IFRIEND1 and many other transactions not from WPI*IFRIEND1 that already have been taken care of which i did not authorize.So I called the number on the transaction in the statement and i get put on hold many times on the third call after a few checks there was no account on my card and was not being used but i have charges on it? i was told it was some chat site but i dont know nothing about it, i barely use my computer. Upon a google search i came upon this site from a report that was filed a while back. What can i do about these fraudulent charges on my card?EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder

He's also in some funny cable TV service commercials with Shaq. So, I have nothing against Stein. Everyone has to make a living.I don't know anything about Filbert, the squirrel in the ad. I have nothing against Filbert either.At first view, the ad seemed harmless enough. It is wise for consumers to know their credit score, since many purchases depend upon having good credit. To learn more, I visited the FreeScore.com site.That's when things really got squirrely.The site is easy to read and easy to navigate. There are huge buttons on the home page to start the registration process to get those free credit scores. Consumers can get ""free"" credit scores from each of the three major credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion:Freescore.com Home pageThe above page copy also inform users that they can get their credit reports when ordering their free credit scores. Further down the page (out of view when the page first loads) is as a huge button for consumers to click to view a sample report compiled with information from the three credit reporting agencies. A sample report is a good thing to view before registering. A more friendly page design would place that sample button further up the page so it is easier to see.Now, I already know my credit score, so I didn't register for the FreeScore.com service. If you scroll to the bottom of the page, you will see tiny text that is easy to miss, especially if you clicked on any of the large buttons near the top of the page. So, I've repeated the tiny text here:""FreeScore.com is not affiliated with the annual free credit report program. Under a new Federal law, you have the right to receive a copy of your credit report once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting companies. To request your free annual report under law, you must go to www.annualcreditreport.com.Translation: while you can get credit reports at the FreeScore.com site, they aren't free. The credit scores are free but the credit reports have a monthly fee. The tiny text explains why there is a monthly fee:""FreeScore provides you with the tools you need to access and monitor your financial/credit information through the program's credit reporting and monitoring benefits. FreeScore and its benefit providers are not credit repair service providers and do not receive fees for such services, nor are they credit clinics, credit repair or credit services organizations or businesses, as defined by federal and state law. Credit information provided by TransUnion Interactive, Inc.""Translation: the site is operated by TransUnion, one of the three major credit reporting agencies. FreeScore will help you monitor your credit scores and credit reports, but it won't help you fix them should something bad happen. You are on your own if you need to remove errors in your credit reports, or if you are already an identity-theft victim and thieves have made fraudulent purchases affecting your credit scores and reports. So, if the credit reports at FreeScore aren't free, how much do they cost? In my opinion, a better design would have displayed the price along with the credit report offer on the home page. Instead, the consumer has to hunt for the price information, which appears on the FreeScore registration page below. The price is in small type in the right column under OFFER DETAILS:Freescore.com Registration pageI've repeated the tiny copy here so it is easier to read:""Simply click ""View Scores"" on the next page to activate your FreeScore trial membership and claim your 3-in-1 Credit Profile and Triple Credit Score. After your 7-day FREE trial period it's just $19.95 per month for FreeScore. Remember, you can call FreeScore toll-free at 1-800-316-8824 within the first 7 days to cancel, and you will not be charged/debited.""Translation: you get free credit scores only during the seven (7) day trial period. After that, charges apply if you don't cancel your trial membership, which automatically signed up for a credit monitoring service costing almost $20 per month. The trial membership period is awfully short, too.This offer by FreeScore.com reminded me a lot of the pitch by FreeCreditReport.com, a site that pitches free credit reports but enrolls consumers in a credit monitoring program with a monthly fee if you don't read the tiny text and cancel. Yesterday's post discussed the new Credit Report disclosure rules mandated by the FTC. The FreeScore.com site never pitches free credit reports, so I guess that TransUnion believes that they don't have to comply with the new disclosure rules since they aren't selling free credit reports at the site.In my opinion, the FreeScore.com site is the same as the FreeCreditReport.com site. Both advertise X (e.g., get something for free) but really offer Y (credit monitoring for a monthly free) and place the important details in small print rather than say so upfront in easier to read type. Both sites use the auto-opt-in method: the user is enrolled in the credit monitoring service unless they cancel in time. To me, this is a sleezy marketing approach. The old ""buyer beware"" advice definitely applies here.In my opinion, FreeScore.com is expensive since the price includes credit monitoring and not credit resolution services. And, the FreeScore monthly fee of $19.95 is higher than the FreeCreditReport.com monthly fee of $14.95. So, maybe the cost of those ""free"" credit scores is baked into the higher monthly credit monitoring fee.Is FreeScore for you? That's a decision only you can make. You know your credit situation best. Having good credit is critical and monitoring your credit reports is wise to ensure their accuracy. If you are a victim of identity theft and fraud, then monitoring your credit reports for fraudulent purchases is critical, but getting credit resolution service is equally important.My advice: shop around and always read the FINE PRINT at a Web site; especially sites offering freebies and/or credit monitoring services. Know the limitations of the credit monitoring service you are considering. Be an informed consumer.									",Internet

Internet United States of America ",cashadvancedusa.net,6464324559,Cash Advanced USA Officer Brown Cash Advanced USA Loan Scam Internet,"
										On November 24th, 2011 (thanksgiving) I was called on my home number and did not answer the number 646-432-4559 because I had no idea who's number it was. So I searched the area code on my laptop quickly and realized it was from Manhattan, New York area. At that time I a saw that my cell phone went off with the same phone number.I answered the phone and he told me his name was Officer Brown, he told me that I had a lawsuit against me and if i knew about it. I told him that I had no idea what he was talking about. He proceeded to tell me I had a pay day loan and never paid it back. I told him I have not had a pay day loan in over 3 years. He proceeded to say that this pay day loan company has a law suit set up against me and that in 36 hours I will be in big trouble if I don't settle it and it will go to court. I asked him when the loan was done and he said June 2011. And then he proceeded to tell me my personal information like my last four of my social security number, birth date, email address, and account number at Bank of America I had. He said he money reached my account and that I used it and they were tracking me through my email. I told him I will pull up my account information and verify that nothing ended up in my account. He said fine, and gave me his number and said call him back by tomorrow otherwise he would have to proceeded with this lawsuit.I then checked my account on-line and just like I thought there was no deposit from a loan company what so ever. I thought it was suspicious because he sounded like he had a Indian accent with the name Officer Brown, plus I have had this Scam issue before with another company with the same Indian accent. And my sisters boyfriend was over and he wanted to know the name of the company.So as soon as I verified the info of my account I called Officer Brown right back, and told him my name. He said hello what did i find out. I told him that no such loan took place at the time and that I had applied for 3 different laons and they were all denied. I also said I check my bank account and there was no deposit put in. He told me that he was sorry but there is nothing he can do, he was just supposed to contact me and let me know what was happening. I proceeded to tell him that no such loan took place and that this was fraud, I did not feel I should be responsible for such a thing I never received. I then asked what company it was, and he told me Cash Advanced USA. I repeated it out loud so my sisters boyfriend could check it out and he found multiple fraud issues with this company. So he proceeded to tell me that I had 2 options and he had to know right now whether I wanted to fight this and take it to court and pay up to $7000, and I would have to pay $2,435 right now before we go to court or I could settle outside of court and pay $435.At this point I told him this was ridiculous, and he told me that the conversation was being recorded and he needed an answer. He also told me that my father and friend I listed as references were also in trouble because they were on the loan as so. He named them by full name. At this point I was told to hang up after what they found with the scams, so I did. I read the articles and then he called back and I did not answer and added him to the block list on my phone.I did not give him any info, he already had  a lot of it which is scary.

And it was disconnected by TWC without my knowledge. This is fraud at its best. Haven't heard of one like this, getting disconnected because of some other previous tenant.

										THE CHRONICLE OF THE HORSE - FORUMS... Where do I begin? This website is so vile and disgusting that it literally makes me sick to my stomach. If you thought the horse industry was bad, take a look at this drama-package website! It's all the filth, gossip, lies, and dishonesty of the horse business, ALL IN ONE DISGUSTING MELTING POT OF MALICIOUS GOSSIP. The Chronicle Of The Horse Forums, while originally meant to help its users, by allowing different horse-folk to converse about trainers, haulers, training questions, tack shops, etc., Somehow, over the last few years, the website has veered from its original intent, and become a veritable melting pot of lies and back-stabbing. This is the clever part.. When you join the ""C.O.T.H. Forums, you must agree to abide the the ""rules,"" which are included below:Rule 1: ""This is a public forum viewed by a wide spectrum of people, so please be mindful of what you say and who might be reading itdetails of personal disputes are likely better handled privately. While posters are legally responsible for their statements, the moderators do their best to maintain an overall productive and enjoyable atmosphere in the forums, though policing each post is impossible. Outright inflammatory, vulgar, harassing, malicious or otherwise inappropriate statements and criminal charges unsubstantiated by a reputable news source or legal documentation will not be tolerated and will be dealt with at the discretion of the moderators.""Unless you have documented proof of fraud committed by an individual, it is not appropriate to accuse them of such in our public forum. Especially in the outright inflammatory manner you used.THIS IS AN OUTRIGHT LIE!! THE MODERATORS DON'T FOLLOW THIER OWN RULES! I know 12 people who have had their entire careers DISTROYED by this website, because it allowed unproven lies to be posted about innocent people.  Even after BEGGING the so-called ""Moderators""  to remove harmful and untruthful posts, the plees for help were ignored, and they are left to face the wolves alone. We will discuss this in greater detail as we go.  The Chronicle Forums, allows ANYONE to post ANYTHING they want, about any person, farm, business, stable, etc., that they wish, with no need for any form of fact verification. False information can be posted with NO PROOF of accusations, then left to mercy of the Chronicle Forums Moderator,  who decides whether or not the posting can stay live.  The problem with this, is that the forums Moderator is often a worst gossip lover than some of the posters. The more hits a thread gets, the better for the website, so The Moderator is in no hurry to help you, no matter how devastating the matter may be. I have been researching this website and its victims for several years, and I am currently in the process of writing a book to expose the depravity of a website that allows innocent people to be harmed for no reason. Imagine this: your greatest competition/and/or arch-nemeses in life, able post ANY LIE that they wish about you on the Chronicle Of The Horse Forums, and it will NOT be removed, or verified. Even if everything said is a total lie, with no proven facts to back it up, the lies will be posted for everyone in the horse-world to see, with NO way of protecting yourself.  Can you imagine giving your worst enemy in the world that type of power over you and your business? Neither can I, but it's happening FULL-THROTTLE each day on the Forums of the Chronicle of the horse website.  BUT WAIT! We aren't done yet!! It gets even BETTER!!  Now, imagine ALL the false information, lies, slander, etc., that was posted by your worst enemy, being  broadcast as an OPEN CONVERSATIONAL TOPIC  for EVERYONE on the internet to view, andcomment on.  We all know the type of people who get no greater happiness in the world, than from commenting on things they know nothing about.  Horse-folks love a good scandal, especially the ones who have nolife, and have nothing to do but sit on their computers and give their opinions. Most of these ""comment makers,"" aren't true horse people at all. They are bitter little no-bodies, who can only be heard via internet forums.  They are true-blue liars, and drama starters, whose very essence is threatened by any form of peace and truth.  Now that the mood has been set, imagine the snow-ball effect of what will happened to one's reputation, when all of these perpetual liars start commenting on the false, and unproven facts, that have been posted about someone they do not even know.  The results are disastrous! The thread quickly turns into a lying free-for-all, which leaves the innocent victim's reputation totally destroyed. The Bible says, that a good reputation is worth more than all the gold on earth. Now, imagine that your reputation is left to the mercy of your enemies, and total strangers, who get off on the destruction of innocent people's lives.  In my research of the abuse that takes place on the Chronicle Of The Horse Forums, I posted  pretend ""thread"" aboutmy dealings with a fictitious person of my own conjuring. I wanted to see, what would happen, if a thread was started about an imaginary person.  If my guess was correct, the devastatingsnow-ball effect would happen, even to a make-believe person. Sure enough, after just a few moments of posting my pretend ""thread"" to the forums, people started commenting about their personal experiences  with someone who did not even exist.  In just a few days, there were literally pages of lies that had been written about someone who was not even real. I added fuel to the fire by pretending to be the victim of the posts, and then by trying to defend myself. This did nothing but ""spur-on"" thedepraved reputation destroyers in their aggressive destruction of an imaginary person. I could not believe my eyes! There were literally hundreds of comments posted from different people, claiming to have done business with a person whowas not even real.  I think this study says quite a lot about the intent of users of this website. Even a non-existentperson can become a victim on the C.O.T.H.-Forums. In continuing with my investigation, I called The Chronicle of the Horse, at their headquarters in Middleboro, VA many times, pretending to be the victim of harmful threads.The answer was all the same. ""We can do nothing for you. We suggest contacting the forums Moderator.""  If you ask for the phone number of the ""Moderator,"" you will not get one. He/She is ONLY accessible by email, and they NEVER return your emails, even if you beg them to. The C.O.T.H Forums Moderator is a sick and twisted human, who gets great pleasureout of having the power to help or destroy a person. After emailing the ""Moderator"" an additional 6 more times regarding my situation with no response, I decided to call the headquarters back.  I told the young lady who had answered my call about my desperate situation, and what was happening to my business, and reputation on the COFH Forums.  She smugly replied: We stand behind our moderator's decision 100%, and there is nothing we can do.Sorry. "" I stood there speechless, and not believing what I was hearing, but it was true. The Chronicle of the Horse Forums will allow any false information to be posted about ANY innocent person, and will do NOTHING to help stop the lies and slander, and promote truth.  It truly is a sick website where insecure ""nobodies"" can ruin a hard working American's career at the click of a mouse. I'm not suggesting that everything ""thread"" posted is a lie, but a VERY large number are justsimply not true. I decided to contact some of the victims of the ""thread reputation assaults,"" and see how they had been affected by the posts on the Chronicle Of The Horse- FORUMS. I contacted 12 victims of ""chronicle attack,"" to see if they had been affected by the threads posted about them and their businesses. The victims were VERY easy to find, being that the attackers always give the victim's phone numbers, addresses, email address, and more , in order to try to givetheir lies some sort of appearance of validation.  Some of these victims included: Horse haulers, Trainers, Groomers, lessonfarms, Tack-Shop Owners, Stable Owners, etc.  After speaking with them, they all essentially said the same thing; that an enemy had posted a lie about them on the Chronicle Forums, and then the lie started snow-balling.  In one incident, a man who owned a lessonbarn, became a COTH victim when he unknowingly angered a fowl-tempered parent for scolding her child who was whipping her horse excessively.  The angered mother immediately went home, goton the C.OT.H. Forums, and accused the trainer of molesting her daughter.Of course, this was false, because if it would have been true, he would have been arrested. Needless to say, his business and reputation were quickly ruined, and it wasnt long before the farm that he had worked for over 15 years to build was for sale. All accusations were false, and an innocent trainer lost hislivelihood because of a LIE on the C.O.T.H.-Forums.  Another professional hauler was accused of causing brain damage, to a horse, because the person who was having the horse shipped, did not want to pay the shipping bill. There are MANY more ridiculous stories that will be exposed when my book is published.  Most people harmed bythe threads on the COTH-Forums, initially tried to seek legal action against the website, but found it difficult because the website hides behind the ""Freedom of speech Act."" How messed-up is that??!! So, the website is not liable for anything posted. Therefore, they do NOT search out the truth, or even care what is happening to innocent people.  Most people,who were attacked on the forums, eventually had to close their businesses due to bad publicity. This is exactly the outcome that the trouble makers wanted!How can it be, that there is a website, where the evil lairs thrive, and the innocent suffer? Well, believe it. Its all true. The Chronicle Of The Horse - Forums is a breeding ground of lies, and goes unchecked. Innocent people are being ruined financially, emotionally, and respectfully and NO ONE is doing anything to stop it.  Hopefully, the release of my book will do something to help expose this disgusting website, and all of its depravity.  It is my goal in life to expose the evil people who are harming the innocent, and to shutdown a website that condones lying, unproven facts, and malicious gossip. Unfortunately, by the time my book is published, it will be too late for many people who have been harmed by this vicious website. Do yourself a favor, and if you read something nasty about someone on the Forums of The Chronicle Of TheHorse website, contact that person directly before making a decision not to do business with them. Chances are, they arent a bad person. Just someone who was too much competition for someone else.  Lies are a terrible thing, andthose who harm the innocent people will one day get what they gave back 7X stronger. That's just how karma works.  I'm sure this write-up will be met with MANY angry comments, but it is time that the TRUTH be known.  Let's keep it honest everyone! Rather than trying to destroy your competition, just create a better product.  I leave you with this last quote regarding gossip. ""The tongue is a double-edged sword, be careful of how you waggle it, for one day, it may cut off your head. ""									",Internet

I tried to explain that I already went through this and I just need help with the web page.

I filled out the form and asked her to wait on the line while I completed it and received the confirmation number. She did and I got my confirmation number. She then explained I needed to call customer service the following day to officially 'cancel my service' and find out how to return my equipment. I woke up the next morning and called immediately. I spoke to Dominic (They refuse to give last names), and he first tried to tell me I had to drive to Flemmington (an hour away) to return my equipment. I said it was too far so he was nice and said he'd send a postage paid label in the mail for me to use to return the equipment by mail. Great, I thought. He then assured me that my official service cancellation date was July 8 and that if I were charged for the 9,10, and 11th, I'd be refunded. He claimed he noted that in the computer.  About a week later, my mail label arrived, and I mailed out my equipment that very day. They claimed my refund would take up to 12 weeks. Well, I never received any correspondence from them until today. It's October 26th and I just received a BILL FOR $102.53!!!!!! The bill indicated the charges were for internet service! I was confused and called immediately. I was informed by the customer service rep that my records show that ""my services were never cancelled!"" I am livid. She said ""all I can do is dispute your charges and you can wait for a phone call"". I said, ""but I'm looking at my email. It's from YOUR COMPANY confirming my cancellation and refund request! There's even a confirmation number!"" Oh, she said. Really? Really, I said. I gave her the confirmation number but I am sure based on past experience that this is far from over. Consumers like me need your help. Please help!

										Roblox is a kid's website.  My boy started playing on the site about 2 years ago, when he was only 8 years old.  He's now 10 and is a veteran of this site.  Over the years, whenever we have had problems with Roblox, they have been difficult to contact; e.g., they will NOT answer their phone (it's a recording), will NOT call you back (only respond via email), etc.
The specific issue that was ""the last straw"" for me happened this past month.  I had paid $20 for a month of ""Outrageous Builders Club"" membership for my boy, who frankly loves Roblox.  He did ""something,"" it's still not clear to me what, and they suspended him for 14 days.  He was embarrassed and didn't want to tell dad and mom; so, it literally took me 10 days (into the 14 day suspension) to even find out that he wasn't allowed on Roblox.
I got details on his infraction, which involved buying or selling something that Roblox doesn't allow you to buy or sell on the website.  I contacted Roblox.  I made the following points:
1. Roblox is a free-for-all of kids showing utter and complete disregard for the rules!  There's profanity, illegal buying and selling, and worst of all, a variety of scams on this site whereby kids can actually steal other kids ""robux"" (Roblox ""currency"" to be used for legal purchases).
2. The scammers pass their scams on to other kids (again, 7, 8, 9, 10 year old kids are being victimized by these scams or TAUGHT these scams).  
3. Roblox does NOT notify the parents of any bad behavior!  Ever!  So, again, I know for a fact that my kid broke the rules.  He admits it and was punished.  My thing was ...
     A) You suspend my kid for HALF the month of a $20 membership and never say a word to me?
     B) That's an insanely long suspension for a child on a kid's website 
     C) It becomes even more impactful when you consider the cost of their membership!
     D) I know for a fact that worse, far worse, than my kid trying to sell something he shouldn't have goes on with other kids on Roblox and at least in one case, the kid was not suspended; e.g., we had to go through the BBB to get 3,700 Robux refunded to my boy after a kid scammed him out of them.  Roblox wouldn't even respond to my emails!  They only took action after I complained to the BBB.  And ... the kid who stole my boy's Robux admitted it in Roblox chat sessions numerous times and was ... never suspended.
4. I wrote Roblox outlining my complaints.  I should have been notified; it was an overly strong suspension, etc.  I told them either restore 10 days of the suspension or I was done with their site.  The ""customer service"" representative said simply, ""Nope.""  
5. I am done with Roblox.  They are a fly-by-night company that has somehow managed to create a very popular website with kids.  But they are not professional in dealing with customer-service issues, they do not keep parents informed, they do not constistenly enforce rules across the board, and they do nothing to stop the scams, bad behavior, etc.  If you turn your kid loose on Roblox, you had better beware: You are on your own to monitor every aspect of his or her behavior.  Roblox does not help and Roblox acts any way Roblox sees fit.

Expect many months of full time work, loads of trial and error sessions to get things to work since there are no manuals. It frustrates so many users when they pay the monthly membership fee and realize that their customer support questions are IGNORED or left unanswered for days, weeks and MONTHS. This company needs to either hire more people or seriously put some effort in to their manuals and customer support, because the potential to be great is there but enough customers get frustrated at their service and the more of these complaints they''ll see surfacing on the web and stifling new subscriptions.

I asked them to either send me the refund for this charge (13$plus tax) or send me a copy of their records showing when and how I subscribed to their services.

										Hello, my name is Norma Johnson and I would like enter a complaint against AIU. I believe the university should be reviewed regarding second and third party partners.  I withdrew from AIU in the middle of the session due to technical problems with their Original Verification site and Discussion Board scoring system on 9/1/11.There have been other problems I have experience with the third party partners with AIU. I had to complete an algebra course and more than half the course relied on a third party scoring system which often proved to be incorrect. I conveyed my concerns with the instructor and had to fight to receive the grade I deserve. This is the camel that broke my back. I recognized that there was inconsistency in similarity scoring.  I began my semester on July 18, 2011. I successfully completed the first course, obtaining an A, in Macroeconomics. My next class was Principles of Marketing instructor, Connie Morse. The only thing that was different with the class was that she required a 24% in similarity scoring. AIU has a separate scoring base from the (DB), Discussion Board scoring. I submitted an assignment to the Originality Verification site and received 100%, meaning, the Original Verification site preclude that I  submitted a document that was 100% copy/ paste, yet when I submitted the same document to the discussion board, I received a 41%.  I became very confused. Based on the DB score, I had to repost by rephrasing 17% but the Originality Verification score stated that I had to rephrase by 76%.I worked and worked but the Originality Verification site kept giving me scores like 95% and 84% when I had already scored a 41% on the DB. The only way out was to keep reposting the Discussion Board until I reached the 24% required by the instructor and this was unacceptable to me since they offered an avenue to see your score before posting. I have since been in touched with other online universities to continue my education. I dont know that this is possible but, I dont want have to owe two different student loans. I feel this is not my fought, the fought lies with the inconsistency of AIU.  I am trying to move forward at this point. I am looking at Kaplan University as a tool to complete my BBA.What I am asking is that you forgive my loan at this point. I am just asking for a fair shake. I think that AIU should be investigated regarding their third party partners. Currently, I have over 3.67 Average, I have not wasted the monies you invested into me and Im excited about learning.All I ask you to do is to look into what I have alleged before you make your decision. The inconstancies I found are in MKTG205. Please review my specifics in the Originality Verification scores vs my DB scores for Unit 1 DB scores.If you do this and you still think I am in the wrong, I will accept you decision but, I am determined to move forward.Respectively submitted,Norma Johnson									",Internet

										My son had an account on Runescape for a few years.  We never had a problem with it until about 1 year ago.  His account was being hacked over and over again..Which from what I had read now about the game isn't uncommon.
He wanted to go back and play again and had to resubmit his information to regain his account...which he did. For about 1 1/2 months it was fine and then went to log in and the password had be changed..Once again he tried to recover his account (now over the past year he has done this about 4 times).  A red flag should have gone up. When you try to recover your account they want you to  give all the information about that account...all your passwords, last 4 digits of credit card, answer as many of the security information you supplied when you started it, you isp server etc.  this isn't done by private email..you send it through their website..anyone would be able to see all your information.  I've played Runescape and other mmorpg games myself and never do they ask you for any password, or any other personal information.  Jagex blames hacking done by having keyloggers etc..this last time my son did everything possible to avoid his account being hacked..made a new email address in case his old one was tagged or something ..we have a new computer..we always use virus protection he linked it to facebook redid all his private information..tried all we could think of to stop this from happening again.  So this time when he tried to recover it was denied , they said the reviewed it and decided the he was not the original account holder...He sent in passwords he used through out the years and even offered to send them bank statements where Jagex had taken their monthly fee out from years ago. 
Why would a company deny it with proof such as that..how can an account be hacked over and over again if someone (possibly) within the company was doing that?
I know Jagex could care less. They have no customer support to contact for any problems..no email..no way of contacting them other than their billing.  Other games we have played have outstanding support.
So to finish this up. If you have any problems with Jagex your out of luck..play at your own risk

										WOT is host to several, no hundreds of Trolls.  These are users that get rewarded for their efforts in rating as many domains as possible.  The more domains, the more rewards these users get and the more authoritative they become, influencing many other less experienced WOT raters.
WOT is in the business of selling security seals, so the more websites that find themselves victims of bad WOT ratings (I say victims because there usually is nothing wrong with their website), yet they get rated by these WOT Trolls with harmful negative comments.  I paid little attention to this WOT Scam until recently when my own websites fell victim to their scheme.
WOT's negative tactics can only work if you install their addon into your browser.  Beware, even their addon appears to act like a spyware program.  Below is another's personal experience.  The link below also talks about a Church that received very bad ratings, showing WOT goes after any viable business or organization to encourage them to buy their security seals.

This is supposedly a safe browser add-on that will help protect against dangerous or fraudulent websites. Users are supposed to rate sites good or bad. But WOT actively rewards users who specialize in giving negative reports. Some of their top-rated users have done tens of thousands of negative reports, and it is obvious they are not really rating sites accurately. WOT's own statistics show that the overwhelming majority of ratings are negative. The developers of WOT are in the business of selling security seals for websites, so they have a vested interest in making website owners afraid of negative ratings. It is typical for harmless websites to have negative ratings, which cause scary warning messages to pop up in the browser of anyone who has installed with WOT plugin. If the website owners aren't using WOT, they may never even know they have been targeted. At the same time, there are a number of dangerous or fraudulent sites which have no ratings or good ratings from WOT. Overall, the ratings are worthless to consumers and possibly very harmful to people running reputable online businesses. Then, when you realize that this plug-in is worse than useless and uninstall it, it is never really completely uninstalled, but leaves hidden traces behind, in the same way that spyware does. Stay away from this terrible product.									",Internet

Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
 
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   
 
DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
 
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
 
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
 
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. 
 
CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
 
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action.  ",Internet

No live person answers the phone anymore except today but she said she cannot help me and it was only after I had asked to talk to her supervisor to let him know what is going on that she decided she was going to send an email to the billing person. 									",Internet

										Domonic Mongello charged  me thousands and thousands of dollars and made a mountain of promises with his ecoeconow scam business and delivered on none. Once paid he became the most arrogant, narcissistic, social path I have ever seen in my life. It is then he begins to treat people like garbage and everything becomes his way or the highway. Like all narcissus, Domonic is a complete control freak and IF there was a ecoeconow for those who didn't get in line with the way he thinks ""THEIR"" Business should run, he would just cut them off the system until they do fall in line. A con man of a person who claims to be a good Buddhist (yea right) when he doesn't get his way you will not see a good
Buddhist but someone in a bad moodhist. 
Narcissus like Mongello are bullies and like to use verbal intimidation and threats on their victims to get their way. And if that doesn't work, he uses pity stories in a attempt to control and manipulate your emotions such as weather problems destroying his home, internet problems due to flooding, the death of his mother(didn't attend her funeral) sickness and being in the hospital and any other pity party item he can use to buy time, stall progress and manipulate a situation for his own purpose. And finally if he has to become a Monk a buddhist or mother Teresa to sell himself off as a great guy to manipulate you consider it done. And if you asked for a refund, in his arrogant mind he believes just talking with his highness on a telephone justifies his fees like he is some Anthony Robbins guru. What can be done about Domonic Mongello?
The problem is he lives in Thailand and is heavily guarded within it's corrupt system! This gives him the comfort of not worrying about accountability for his fraudulent actions. There is a large number of individuals that's been a victim of this scam artist and my hope is if we can save you the reader of this report from losing your money to a wolf, that's one less person that will need to write their story of being ripped off by this moodhist con man on this forum.",Internet

Also a thing occurs that is called ""rubber banding"" here you will walk forward 2 steps and then get pulled back to your orginal position again due to all the lag. There are frequent outages and server crashes and log in issues with not being able to log in. 
The servers have been like this for months now and nothing is getting better recently they introduced this on the steam network and ever since then it has gotten 10 times worse. 
If you complain about the problem to the staff nothing gets done about the problem. The Game Masters (GMs) in the game are rude and ignorant towards the players and their customer service in game or if you open up a ticket is horrible. 
Basically in game every time you log into the game if you are a free member a large logo comes up telling you subscribe to the game. Which I did because I got sick of seeing this come up every time and opening up a web browser window every time trying to get you to subcribe then when you do subscribe to the game you can't even play the game because of all the technical problems with their server and software.  
Over all the game is extremely buggy even in game as well with lots of glitches and problems. The server I am playing on is NOT a test server this is the full production server and there are this many problems. 
There are frequent disconnects and the server is extremely laggy! 
Now I have asked to be compensated for all of the outages and lag and extremely horribly play and nothing has been done up to this day to compensate me since I am a paying customer and have a commander's level subscription which costs an outragous $29.00 a month. You can go play a lot of other MMOs for a heck of a lot cheaper then that.  Over all this is just yet another rip off. 
This is nothing more than a money grab they want you to subscribe and pester you till you do. And once you get in game if you have to reset your AP you have to buy that from the cash shop with real money. 
This is nothing more than a money grab by this company and they are doing a horrible job at running the game and expect people to pay for this crap! Even once you are a subscriber you get very little and still have to pay for reset injectors (reset your AP) if you screw up and put the points into the wrong location. THis should be 100% free if you are a subscriber.

Here are a few examples of the problems in Fallen Earth these were not posted by me but other players complaining of all the same problems.

This game has already failed once before when it was under control of Icarus Studios and it looks like K2 Networks Inc. is not doing any better of a job at running the game.

Bottom line is if you are thinking about signing up for an account on Fallen Earth don't bother the game is horrible and extremely glitchy and very little if anything is actually being done to fix it. Avoid Fallen Earth it isn't even worth your time or trouble and all of the poor game play and poor customer service that you will receive.

										There was information I received from a Top Rated Seller on Fiverr, which I had also asked Fiverr about, in order to better manage my Gig requests for a writing Gig and Fiverr cleared it. When I reached almost $1,000 in revenue, I received a message that my account had been flagged for a warning because of a violation of the Terms of Service on Fiverr. I sent a request to the online system to ask why. They told me that a certain line in the item was a violation of the TOS and needed to be removed. I responded that it was no problem to remove it, with my apologies, since it was a line used be another seller who had almost 2,000 transactions completed on the site. Two hours later, I received three e-mailed, each timestamped within the same minute, informing me that I had been demoted to having no level on Fiverr. I contacted the customer support department,  to see why, but they cancelled my support request. I placed other, new support requests, but they cancelled those as well. Finally, I logged in to my Fiverr account and found that they had not given me full credit for orders that had cleared and were to be paid that had Gig ""Extras"" attached to them. I attempted to contact Fiverr about this as well, but they cancelled those requests also. Paypal is the payment method Fiverr uses and they refused to help or file a dispute about this company's wrong doings in this instance. DomainsByProxy/Godaddy is the cloaking service used by Fiverr to hide their contact information from any public WhoIs source. They stated that they have no idea how to contact Fiverr, because they never receive the information of the domain that need to be cloaked. Slice Host is the company that hosts the Fiverr website. They only offer online support and complaints can only be filed via e-mail. When I asked more detailed questions, the chat representative stopped responding. It is a shame Paypal, GoDaddy, and Slice Host would all choose to support this company. It is even more of a shame that Fiverr allows themselves to work according to such poor business practices.									",Internet

										Last year in September 2011 I was recommended by AT&T sales person to switch from DSL to U-verse internet, with $5.00 more I was going to get 12 times better speed in my internet , total payment would be $24.95, which normally is $40.00 but this is promotion for one year. I asked the sales person how about after one year do I have to pay $40.00 ? she said no you can call and ask for the same rate. I gave my permission to switch, by the way they charge $100.00 on modem that they said I will get back with $100.00 rebate which I received the rebate 3 weeks ago.  The internet problem started from day one. Every time I call AT&T U-verse center I have to be on the phone for at least one hour to one hour forty five minutes, after 10 days of the service I was told that you can't get the speed that we offered so they lowered the speed to 6. After they lowered it, it started giving me more problems, constantly dropping the connection, very slow speed from 0.68 to max 4.80. I have never ever seen my speed going up to 5 or 6. the last tech person came to see what he can do after 2 hours of working on my internet before he left he saw that my internet dropped to 0.68, he said I can't do anything from this point on I will contact the center tomorrow they will send other tech person to work from outside to bring you speed upper 5. He left and the next day we had phone call he identified himself as AT&T U-verse tech and that he is going to be working on my internet and an hour later he called and said he is done. While he was on the phone I tested and still got the same old speed that fluctuated from 2 to 4. I told him at that moment and he said he can't help me that I have to contact the customer service. So I contacted customer service again, and they couldn't help me after another an hour to and hour forty-five minutes. Now, I started getting higher bills to pay for tech-support and other services that they didn't complete to change the internet speed. Every time I call they put me on hold then after waiting for half hour or so I get disconnected, now I don't know whom or where to call so they can solve this issue, is there anyway you can bring AT&T to listen their customers complain?

										My wife signed us up for clear internet service about 6-9months ago and in the initial 2weeks the service seemed to work without any hiccups until about the third week. Like most consumers, we didnt pay too much attention to it because we both were barely home and quite frankly we dont use the internet that much once we get back from work. The low speed and often no service from clear became more of an issue as our internet needs grew due to my business integrating the ipad into everything we do to service clients. So I called Clear to let them know that the 3mbps they promised wasn't actually what I have been getting once i tested the connectivity/ download speed. It was during this conversation that the truth was revealed, as the customer service rep i was speaking to asked me if i was a consistent user of the service and that if I wasn't  that could explain why my service speed may have been downgraded. He went on to tell me that the service might not work properly indoors as well. I found is statement appalling considering the fact that I had no desire to set my modem up on the exterior of my house at an attempt to enjoy consistent internet speed. Prior to this, i had spent a few hours here and there trying to troubleshoot the problem, to no avail. Sometimes it works for a few hours and then it will go slower or no service within the same day. So finally 2 weeks ago I decided it was time to stop this waste of money and cancel the service and request for a refund for the last few months. I was promised a call back from management and offered a lower bill to temporarily appease me. Once again I was shocked because based on the offer it seemd as though they knew their service wasn't worth the amount they charged and if you didnt complain then they kept taking your money. I accepted the offer but my issue still wasn't reolved, so i called again a few days later and i was informed of a $40 fee per modem to cancel. This means they intend to charge me a $80 cancellation fee for both modems i have. For a service that is subpar to say the least I dont think its fair and I am willing to fight them as far as I can.

										This company was found on the internet by my 12year old son who wanted to purchase a tablet with the money he had saved up from chores and Christmas gift cards. I had read the reviews and not knowing that these reviews are not written by the company consumers but the company themselves went and purchased the tablet for my son. We waited for the tablet to be shipped but, it was not sent to us for a few days after ordering it. I then received a phone call from Tony who said he worked for E Global Wireless and wanted to know if we wanted to upgrade this product.
Tony explained he would upgrade the battery and memory, plus throw in a rapid charger and car adapter normally costing $88.00 for just $43.00. After listening to his offer I accepted this offer. After he charged me he made a mistake he said and charged me $42.00. Finally after a couple of days we received this product in the mail.

My son opened the box and the first thing I noticed was I couldn't see the upgrade promised by Tony, all I saw was a car charger. My son started to download games from the web which the unit did, very slowly. He went to play a game but no sound came out. I contacted eglobalwireless customer service who issued a refund slip to send the unit back.
I sent it back to them expecting a refund after sending it back at my charge. My son had paid $156.00 of his hard earned money and after crying after the tablet did not work, finally received a refund of $70.00(total). They refuse to send a full refund for defective product.									",Internet

										Had service one town for nearly 1 year. There was a lot of connection and customer service issues as well as downtime with the internet. I never got the speeds I paid for, and whenever it rained my radio would go down. I complained got nowhere finally it fixed temporarily (when we went through a DROUGHT). Still not the speeds I was paying for or close to it. Tech support and onsite repairs was always long waits and weeks almost months before repairs.We ended up selling our house in December and bought a new house in another town. At the end of Dec. I emailed the company and requested information on getting my service disconnected since we would be moving and provided a date of Jan 16 as the absolute last possible cut off date in a second and third email through the company website. Hold times by phone are well over 1 hour for customer service and who really has that long to sit on hold?No one contacted me. I attempted to call them when we closed on our new house Dec. 30 and was placed on hold for over 13 minutes. I ended up hanging up. I called back on Jan 9, 2012 because we were out of the house and no one had picked up the ""radio"" yet. I spoke to Justinwho told me they never got my emails but he would set up the account for disconnection for Feb 2, 2012 because they like to put those way out there. I told him we would take the radio with us as I heard and read other consumers on ripoffreport.com complaining they charge you for the radio (around $300-$600) if they fail to pick it up. I didn't want that to happen. I told him I would deliver it to them in Arlington or they could pick it up. He said they would pick it up. He then asked if I wanted new service at the new address. Since Missy was so good last time I said ok, but I may change my mind because it was about 3 weeks out. I called back a few minutes later on the 9th remembering how badly I had been treated in the past and all the frustration and said I changed my mind just disconnect and leave it. I said to come get the dish or I'd take it to Arlington. he said someone would contact me. We use only cell phones and I have a record of all these calls on my phones! I spoke to I believe Justin again on that call. I figured everything was done and over. We sold our house in Joshua and the new people moved into on Jan. 16th. On Jan 18, 2012 a tech called me from his cell phone and said he was on his way to our new location in Alvarado for install. i didn't answer on my phone as I was busy so he called my husbands phone, again a cell phone. We told him we had cancelled and he was suprised to hear that. We asked him to pick up the radio/dish thing and he said he could not. I immediately called in and spoke to installs and told them we cancelled and the guy that day seemed suprised to hear that as well. He said ok let me fix it and placed me on hold. I didn't have time to wait on HOLD again for something I took care of so I hung up as I was walking into a meeting at my sons school for his special education. I could not miss it to deal with skybeam. I assumed it was finally done and over with. on Feb. 18 I received a bill for nearly $100 saying I was past due and it was deliquent and this account was going to collections. In addition it could hurt my credit. Since this was a shock to me, I attempted to call skybeam on the 18th at 1:52pm. I was placed on hold for over 6 minutes before being ""disconnected"". I then sent 2 emails through their website on the 18th & 20th with no reply and I ended up calling back on 2-20-12 and spoke to Chris. Chris informed there is a huge mishap on my account and a second account billed to me! He gave me a second account number for my NEW address and said I was installed on the 28th! How on Earth do I have service here when I cancelled, when I have no radio here, I didn't install it and neither did anyone else? I cancelled it BEFORE INSTALL! Yet they are charging me. I just haven't received a paper bill as of this posting.Then they are charging me another nearly $100 for a house I haven't lived in since Dec. 30, 2011 and I had cancelled there MULTIPLE TIMES! I told him to fix it and he said he is in Colorado call center and I had to speak to customer service. I am currently on eteral hold for well over 42 minutes now to customer service and still have no hope in sight to get this resovled. I have to keep wasting my time and holding and using my cell phone time and everything to Deal with THEIR ERRORS! They constantly make mistakes and the service was not what I paid for. They mislead you with their tech support that actually closes, I've gotten RUDE service (big suprise), the towers have blown over and took over a month to repair, the other towers are too full of customers and it causes slow speeds and disconnects yet they still charge you full price even though your down. They even claim you get 5 years of internet for free if you refer 5 people, problem is if you refer one you get 1 month yet that one month never seems to apply to the bill either. It sounds too good, because it is. They make it almost impossible to get the customer service and tech support you WILL NEED, and they have so many billing issues they think your going to bend over an pay it. I can confirm a few neighbors had similar issues and went back to DIAL UP and another friend in a different town had major billing issues. This is just not the best company to deal with anymore. They bought out all the good great little compaines around the small country areas giving you them or dial up as a choice. Its really not worth the headache though.I did everything right and being punished for it. It is very bad service and very deceptive as far as charging me for service I did not have, use, and cancelled.									",Internet

So Mark, Ellen, Abina, Kimberly Turner, Janet, Laura, James Baker and all you folks at logodesignguarantee.com, 50 dollar logo and every other name you go by... the word is out.
Don't give up if they play hardball with you.  Hire an attorney and file as many complaints as you can.  
It took me 3 weeks to get all of my money back.  So it can be done.  Be relentless and don't let these thieves rip you off.",Internet

										A few weeks ago, I purchased a list of email addresses (to help generate leads) for companies based in the Miami Beach area. Once I paid for and received the list, I noticed that there were many duplicates. Nearly half of the list was duplicated. They lead me to believe I was paying for 2,000 unique emails. Once I cleaned out the obvious junk, from 2,000 I was down to 150 seemingly pure leads. I sent an eblast out to those 150 emails and 70% were returned, undeliverable. I had spoken on the phone with a salesman prior to purchase who told me that it would have a maximum of 30% undeliverable. Recently, when I called the accounting department to seek a refund, I was sent to voicemail. So then I called the sales department and the rep told me he would have someone from support call me. 
This list has been blatantly misrepresented and I'm not interested in support, I'm interested in a refund which I'm sure will never happen. 									",Internet

When the website goes down, there is no moderator who knows how to contact him to tell him that his paying customers cannot access the website they paid for.  Often times, several days will go by before he happens to visit the website, at which time he will finally fix the website.  Meanwhile, his paying customer are left out to dry, without any kind of communication from him.  Even his own moderators admit on the forum that they never hear from him and have no way to contact him in an emergency.
Brent Riley also will not respond to any type of email, PM, or other communication from his customers.  In addition, Brent Riley has held his own contests in which he awarded prizes to his customers, but after 3-4 months, none of the winners have ever received their prizes.  These winners have also stated that their emails and private messages sent to Brent have gone unanswered and therefore assume they will never actually receive their prizes.

										I thought Doba was a great opportunity to partner with in opening an online store since I have no products of my own I wish to sell. There are several things I found out during the course of my doing business with Doba that I hope will save many people headache and heartache. The monthly fee is ridiculous although they will offer you a ""deal"" on an annual subscription to get you in. BEWARE: Once you have paid, you are subscribed for the year. End of story. You cannot cancel. Their ""wholesale"" prices are marked up so high it's impossible to beat any prices being offered by those folks out there getting real wholesale prices. After several attempts at calling and getting hung up on, I emailed them to cancel my subscription and told that I must call in. I called in and the rep was so rude and nasty, I asked to speak with a manager and was told I could not. She informed me no one above her was available ever to take phone calls. I have never been told I cannot speak to a supervisor or manager on duty. The rep was downright insulting and spoke to me as if I were a child, finally telling me I was no longer ""allowed to be a customer"" Now that my account is cancelled (supposedly) I can still log in and now my account says I am past due. Do yourselves a couple of favors if you're interested in wholesale buying/selling:Find products you like and contact the companies directly. Most are more than happy to offer drop-shipping at a slightly higher price than wholesale but it is worth it if that is what you are looking at doing.Check out free resources like http://www.wholesalecentral.com/Dropshippers.html for information a lot of companies out there would love to charge you for. Do some legwork of your own and avoid Doba. It's nearly impossible to beat their prices on Amazon or eBay.  Their business is legitimate but based on the outrageously poor customer service, high prices, outrageous fees, and the inability to escape them once you have signed up.

										If you are interested in involvement with this company as a distributor I recommend you do one thing before forking over your hard earned money. Simply talk to the owner first. I was very interested and ready to invest, but before I did I wanted to talk to people and pick their brains about the business. So I started with them. My conversations were positive until I asked if they had some references of distributors I could speak with. I was told no, but pressed the issue, and was put on the phone with Michael. At first I thought great! I can talk to the owner and get a feel for him and his business. I soon became very disappointed. I was again told ""No we don't provide our distributors info to people for references, they are on our website"". Which I don't have a problem with, I was simply asking as I would prefer talking with someone rather than reading a statement on the companies site. It seems reasonable considering the distributors names and websites are listed, that they wouldn't mind talking to people.  The problem I had is that Michael became very defensive, even insulted that I would ask such a thing. He is obviously easily upset. My impression of the guy is that he is very thin-skinned and does not like to be questioned. I wasn't even trying to get under his skin, but I think that if I was, and pressed him, he would have had a complete melt down. I can't even imagine doing business with someone like that. In the end he told me ""I was not ready for his amazing opportunity, and should look elsewhere"". Hahaha, wow! He was right about that, I'm just not worthy!! Funny. If you can't handle the tiniest bit of scrutiny, you are not worthy! Look for this guy to end up on a dateline investigation someday, when he finds out his hidden cameras are being used against him, his reaction will be a youtube sensation!

										I signed up for Century Link service (formerly Qwest) in the first week on November of 2011. I signed up for auto turn on where they just send me the Router and I hook it up myself. The signal was supposed to be turned on on the 10th of November. The directions very explicitly said to wait until 5pm before hooking it up. On the 10th I waited until 7pm that night to connect it and there was no service.I didn't think much of it, so I called their tech support and they seemed at the time to try to be helpful. They ran their ""diagnostic"" and said everything should be up and running. It wasn't so we did the whole router restart thing and nothing.  At 9pm I finally said I'm done and went to bed.The next day I talked to someone in their Tech support team again and they said they would have to get a technician out to see what is going on and that they would waive the $80 for sending a tech out. [continued below]....
									
										..... I found that to be acceptable. They scheduled it for Monday the 14th between 11-4. Monday the 14th shows up and I am anxiously waiting for my tech to show up as we have had no internet since the 10th. At around 4:15 pm I called and asked where my tech was and they said they could have him give me a call. He called me 5 minutes later and said that he would not be able to make it out today. I'm pissed at this point and asked him if he could have at least called me to let me know. After all I did take the day off to do this. He said he was busy and my reply was You are going to come out today and hook this up. I wouldn't take no for an answer at this point. About 45 minutes later he shows up and acts like he did us this big favor with TONS of attitude. He got out of his truck, looked at my house, walked right past me ignoring me, got back into his truck and left. I was irate to say the very least.Then to add insult to injury, he called me 5 minutes later and said that we do not have a Century Link line to our house and that they would have to come out and bury a new line. I asked how long that would be and he said around a week.I called Tech support the next day and they said they had no information about any line having to be buried. So they set the appointment up for November 22. 11am-4pm again.Now it is the 22nd and needless to say I took the day off again, and needless to say at 4:30 I was on the phone with them asking where my tech was. He called me back and told me he was extremely busy. I said that was bullshit and he was going to get his ass out here and hook up our phone and Internet. he said he can make it there on the 23'rd and I said no way, I cannot take another day off of work to get blown off by you again. He showed up 45 minutes later and hooked our service line up. That is where the nightmare begins.The junction box that he has to use is across the alley from our house next to our local convenience store. He did not come equipped to bury the line instead just ""laid it across the alley"". Now I live up north and the snow flies here pretty early. I inquired about this and the tech said they will be back in about two weeks to bury the line. I called the next day and nothing was scheduled. So I scheduled for the line to be buried Dec 1, in the mean time the alley I live by is right next to a lumber yard, so traffic running over my line is high. But at least I have service at this time. December 1 rolls around and guess what, I should have learned by now, I took the day off and the crew that was supposed to bury the cable was a no show again. I was infuriated So I called everyone and their dog in Century Link. I finally got to a man named Doug, out of St. Paul Mn. And he was the first one that was truly helpful. He was a bit higher up in the ranks and he asked me for the best number to call me at and said he would investigate and find out whats going on. In the mean time he explained that the techs do not bury lines, they only connect them and repair them. They have independent contractors that bury the lines.Doug actually called me back the next day and was very apologetic when he told me that the crew will not be able to bury the line because the frost is deep in the ground now. To his credit I understand that as I have worked on farms my whole life. He said the next best thing we can do is have the tech come out and hang the line so it does not keep getting run over by traffic. I was ok with that. Mad that if they would have done it when they said they would have in the first place, it would be over by now.Long story short, the tech came out, said he needs to see if the convenience store will let him hang it from their store and I have never heard back from them again. The line is still in my alley and strewn across my yard. The first time a snow plow comes through our alley, we are out of service. I just wanted to post this up as a warning to anyone thinking about going with Century link. They have the worst customer service in the industry and the most lackadaisical attitudes I have EVER seen. On a side note, they told me that they will be able to come out this spring and bury the cable, and if a snow plow tears the line out, I am supposed to call them and they will send our friendly tech out to repair it. Its not a matter of ""if"" the snow plow comes, its a matter of when. And on a final thought, I just received a bill from them saying that I was past due and I owed them $190 for just phone and internet. I never even got a first bill from them. I called and they credited me $48 for the time I had gone without the internet. What a joke! Their $49.99 a month bundle fee for phone and Internet turned out to be $80 a month. Good luck with these scam artist. The saddest part is a couple of years ago, we used to have Qwest and the service was great and reliable. . . . .Century Link = EPIC FAIL									",Internet

Upon a google search i came upon this site from a report that was filed a while back. What can i do about these fraudulent charges on my card?EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder

Have you swapped it out ? -- it's like a brand new unit.. it worked this morning why should the unit be bad ... oh ... lightning ? .. ( then it's working the next day) ..well , in an apartment area, we technicians notice we cant supply enough bandwidth for the heavy useage ...they send a service man out who has to schedule with the landlord office to get the key to access the ports on the building ... comes out and replaces some cable jacks ( apt. had painted over some of them - bad connection) --- this made it good for a few days .. then it rained again ( as it does every day in the summer in Florida) ... and it crapped out .. when they schedule an appoint they make it for a 4 hour window .. so u gotta sit home all day hoping they come early but they usually come at the end of the window ....  out-tage ... outage .. outage is still going ...so . the question is .. should you pay for land line cable that is unreliable or just get something else not as fast but at least is not controlled by the whims of the cable company .... well sir, if u upgrade to business class we always respond to those within 4 hours ... ...by then the business day is over 1!!!!

										this is a scam they ask for this First NameLast NameE-MailConfirm E-MailAddressApt, Unit, Bldg (Optional)CityStateZip CodeSend me special offers from FreeScore partners.Offer not available outside the contiguous U.S. Orders to U.S. military bases cannot be fulfilled well its a scam so i think this I know Ben Stein more for his comedy than his economic commentaries. He's also in some funny cable TV service commercials with Shaq. So, I have nothing against Stein. Everyone has to make a living.I don't know anything about Filbert, the squirrel in the ad. I have nothing against Filbert either.At first view, the ad seemed harmless enough. It is wise for consumers to know their credit score, since many purchases depend upon having good credit. To learn more, I visited the FreeScore.com site.That's when things really got squirrely.The site is easy to read and easy to navigate. There are huge buttons on the home page to start the registration process to get those free credit scores. Consumers can get ""free"" credit scores from each of the three major credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion:Freescore.com Home pageThe above page copy also inform users that they can get their credit reports when ordering their free credit scores. Further down the page (out of view when the page first loads) is as a huge button for consumers to click to view a sample report compiled with information from the three credit reporting agencies. A sample report is a good thing to view before registering. A more friendly page design would place that sample button further up the page so it is easier to see.Now, I already know my credit score, so I didn't register for the FreeScore.com service. If you scroll to the bottom of the page, you will see tiny text that is easy to miss, especially if you clicked on any of the large buttons near the top of the page. So, I've repeated the tiny text here:""FreeScore.com is not affiliated with the annual free credit report program. Under a new Federal law, you have the right to receive a copy of your credit report once every 12 months from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting companies. To request your free annual report under law, you must go to www.annualcreditreport.com.Translation: while you can get credit reports at the FreeScore.com site, they aren't free. The credit scores are free but the credit reports have a monthly fee. The tiny text explains why there is a monthly fee:""FreeScore provides you with the tools you need to access and monitor your financial/credit information through the program's credit reporting and monitoring benefits. FreeScore and its benefit providers are not credit repair service providers and do not receive fees for such services, nor are they credit clinics, credit repair or credit services organizations or businesses, as defined by federal and state law. Credit information provided by TransUnion Interactive, Inc.""Translation: the site is operated by TransUnion, one of the three major credit reporting agencies. FreeScore will help you monitor your credit scores and credit reports, but it won't help you fix them should something bad happen. You are on your own if you need to remove errors in your credit reports, or if you are already an identity-theft victim and thieves have made fraudulent purchases affecting your credit scores and reports. So, if the credit reports at FreeScore aren't free, how much do they cost? In my opinion, a better design would have displayed the price along with the credit report offer on the home page. Instead, the consumer has to hunt for the price information, which appears on the FreeScore registration page below. The price is in small type in the right column under OFFER DETAILS:Freescore.com Registration pageI've repeated the tiny copy here so it is easier to read:""Simply click ""View Scores"" on the next page to activate your FreeScore trial membership and claim your 3-in-1 Credit Profile and Triple Credit Score. After your 7-day FREE trial period it's just $19.95 per month for FreeScore. Remember, you can call FreeScore toll-free at 1-800-316-8824 within the first 7 days to cancel, and you will not be charged/debited.""Translation: you get free credit scores only during the seven (7) day trial period. After that, charges apply if you don't cancel your trial membership, which automatically signed up for a credit monitoring service costing almost $20 per month. The trial membership period is awfully short, too.This offer by FreeScore.com reminded me a lot of the pitch by FreeCreditReport.com, a site that pitches free credit reports but enrolls consumers in a credit monitoring program with a monthly fee if you don't read the tiny text and cancel. Yesterday's post discussed the new Credit Report disclosure rules mandated by the FTC. The FreeScore.com site never pitches free credit reports, so I guess that TransUnion believes that they don't have to comply with the new disclosure rules since they aren't selling free credit reports at the site.In my opinion, the FreeScore.com site is the same as the FreeCreditReport.com site. Both advertise X (e.g., get something for free) but really offer Y (credit monitoring for a monthly free) and place the important details in small print rather than say so upfront in easier to read type. Both sites use the auto-opt-in method: the user is enrolled in the credit monitoring service unless they cancel in time. To me, this is a sleezy marketing approach. The old ""buyer beware"" advice definitely applies here.In my opinion, FreeScore.com is expensive since the price includes credit monitoring and not credit resolution services. And, the FreeScore monthly fee of $19.95 is higher than the FreeCreditReport.com monthly fee of $14.95. So, maybe the cost of those ""free"" credit scores is baked into the higher monthly credit monitoring fee.Is FreeScore for you? That's a decision only you can make. You know your credit situation best. Having good credit is critical and monitoring your credit reports is wise to ensure their accuracy. If you are a victim of identity theft and fraud, then monitoring your credit reports for fraudulent purchases is critical, but getting credit resolution service is equally important.My advice: shop around and always read the FINE PRINT at a Web site; especially sites offering freebies and/or credit monitoring services. Know the limitations of the credit monitoring service you are considering. Be an informed consumer.									",Internet
Cash Advanced USA,"  Cash Advanced USA    
Internet United States of America ",cashadvancedusa.net,6464324559,Cash Advanced USA Officer Brown Cash Advanced USA Loan Scam Internet,"
										On November 24th, 2011 (thanksgiving) I was called on my home number and did not answer the number 646-432-4559 because I had no idea who's number it was. So I searched the area code on my laptop quickly and realized it was from Manhattan, New York area. At that time I a saw that my cell phone went off with the same phone number.I answered the phone and he told me his name was Officer Brown, he told me that I had a lawsuit against me and if i knew about it. I told him that I had no idea what he was talking about. He proceeded to tell me I had a pay day loan and never paid it back. I told him I have not had a pay day loan in over 3 years. He proceeded to say that this pay day loan company has a law suit set up against me and that in 36 hours I will be in big trouble if I don't settle it and it will go to court. I asked him when the loan was done and he said June 2011. And then he proceeded to tell me my personal information like my last four of my social security number, birth date, email address, and account number at Bank of America I had. He said he money reached my account and that I used it and they were tracking me through my email. I told him I will pull up my account information and verify that nothing ended up in my account. He said fine, and gave me his number and said call him back by tomorrow otherwise he would have to proceeded with this lawsuit.I then checked my account on-line and just like I thought there was no deposit from a loan company what so ever. I thought it was suspicious because he sounded like he had a Indian accent with the name Officer Brown, plus I have had this Scam issue before with another company with the same Indian accent. And my sisters boyfriend was over and he wanted to know the name of the company.So as soon as I verified the info of my account I called Officer Brown right back, and told him my name. He said hello what did i find out. I told him that no such loan took place at the time and that I had applied for 3 different laons and they were all denied. I also said I check my bank account and there was no deposit put in. He told me that he was sorry but there is nothing he can do, he was just supposed to contact me and let me know what was happening. I proceeded to tell him that no such loan took place and that this was fraud, I did not feel I should be responsible for such a thing I never received. I then asked what company it was, and he told me Cash Advanced USA. I repeated it out loud so my sisters boyfriend could check it out and he found multiple fraud issues with this company. So he proceeded to tell me that I had 2 options and he had to know right now whether I wanted to fight this and take it to court and pay up to $7000, and I would have to pay $2,435 right now before we go to court or I could settle outside of court and pay $435.At this point I told him this was ridiculous, and he told me that the conversation was being recorded and he needed an answer. He also told me that my father and friend I listed as references were also in trouble because they were on the loan as so. He named them by full name. At this point I was told to hang up after what they found with the scams, so I did. I read the articles and then he called back and I did not answer and added him to the block list on my phone.I did not give him any info, he already had  a lot of it which is scary.

										THE CHRONICLE OF THE HORSE - FORUMS... Where do I begin? This website is so vile and disgusting that it literally makes me sick to my stomach. If you thought the horse industry was bad, take a look at this drama-package website! It's all the filth, gossip, lies, and dishonesty of the horse business, ALL IN ONE DISGUSTING MELTING POT OF MALICIOUS GOSSIP. The Chronicle Of The Horse Forums, while originally meant to help its users, by allowing different horse-folk to converse about trainers, haulers, training questions, tack shops, etc., Somehow, over the last few years, the website has veered from its original intent, and become a veritable melting pot of lies and back-stabbing. This is the clever part.. When you join the ""C.O.T.H. Forums, you must agree to abide the the ""rules,"" which are included below:Rule 1: ""This is a public forum viewed by a wide spectrum of people, so please be mindful of what you say and who might be reading itdetails of personal disputes are likely better handled privately. While posters are legally responsible for their statements, the moderators do their best to maintain an overall productive and enjoyable atmosphere in the forums, though policing each post is impossible. Outright inflammatory, vulgar, harassing, malicious or otherwise inappropriate statements and criminal charges unsubstantiated by a reputable news source or legal documentation will not be tolerated and will be dealt with at the discretion of the moderators.""Unless you have documented proof of fraud committed by an individual, it is not appropriate to accuse them of such in our public forum. Especially in the outright inflammatory manner you used.THIS IS AN OUTRIGHT LIE!! THE MODERATORS DON'T FOLLOW THIER OWN RULES! I know 12 people who have had their entire careers DISTROYED by this website, because it allowed unproven lies to be posted about innocent people.  Even after BEGGING the so-called ""Moderators""  to remove harmful and untruthful posts, the plees for help were ignored, and they are left to face the wolves alone. We will discuss this in greater detail as we go.  The Chronicle Forums, allows ANYONE to post ANYTHING they want, about any person, farm, business, stable, etc., that they wish, with no need for any form of fact verification. False information can be posted with NO PROOF of accusations, then left to mercy of the Chronicle Forums Moderator,  who decides whether or not the posting can stay live.  The problem with this, is that the forums Moderator is often a worst gossip lover than some of the posters. The more hits a thread gets, the better for the website, so The Moderator is in no hurry to help you, no matter how devastating the matter may be. I have been researching this website and its victims for several years, and I am currently in the process of writing a book to expose the depravity of a website that allows innocent people to be harmed for no reason. Imagine this: your greatest competition/and/or arch-nemeses in life, able post ANY LIE that they wish about you on the Chronicle Of The Horse Forums, and it will NOT be removed, or verified. Even if everything said is a total lie, with no proven facts to back it up, the lies will be posted for everyone in the horse-world to see, with NO way of protecting yourself.  Can you imagine giving your worst enemy in the world that type of power over you and your business? Neither can I, but it's happening FULL-THROTTLE each day on the Forums of the Chronicle of the horse website.  BUT WAIT! We aren't done yet!! It gets even BETTER!!  Now, imagine ALL the false information, lies, slander, etc., that was posted by your worst enemy, being  broadcast as an OPEN CONVERSATIONAL TOPIC  for EVERYONE on the internet to view, andcomment on.  We all know the type of people who get no greater happiness in the world, than from commenting on things they know nothing about.  Horse-folks love a good scandal, especially the ones who have nolife, and have nothing to do but sit on their computers and give their opinions. Most of these ""comment makers,"" aren't true horse people at all. They are bitter little no-bodies, who can only be heard via internet forums.  They are true-blue liars, and drama starters, whose very essence is threatened by any form of peace and truth.  Now that the mood has been set, imagine the snow-ball effect of what will happened to one's reputation, when all of these perpetual liars start commenting on the false, and unproven facts, that have been posted about someone they do not even know.  The results are disastrous! The thread quickly turns into a lying free-for-all, which leaves the innocent victim's reputation totally destroyed. The Bible says, that a good reputation is worth more than all the gold on earth. Now, imagine that your reputation is left to the mercy of your enemies, and total strangers, who get off on the destruction of innocent people's lives.  In my research of the abuse that takes place on the Chronicle Of The Horse Forums, I posted  pretend ""thread"" aboutmy dealings with a fictitious person of my own conjuring. I wanted to see, what would happen, if a thread was started about an imaginary person.  If my guess was correct, the devastatingsnow-ball effect would happen, even to a make-believe person. Sure enough, after just a few moments of posting my pretend ""thread"" to the forums, people started commenting about their personal experiences  with someone who did not even exist.  In just a few days, there were literally pages of lies that had been written about someone who was not even real. I added fuel to the fire by pretending to be the victim of the posts, and then by trying to defend myself. This did nothing but ""spur-on"" thedepraved reputation destroyers in their aggressive destruction of an imaginary person. I could not believe my eyes! There were literally hundreds of comments posted from different people, claiming to have done business with a person whowas not even real.  I think this study says quite a lot about the intent of users of this website. Even a non-existentperson can become a victim on the C.O.T.H.-Forums. In continuing with my investigation, I called The Chronicle of the Horse, at their headquarters in Middleboro, VA many times, pretending to be the victim of harmful threads.The answer was all the same. ""We can do nothing for you. We suggest contacting the forums Moderator.""  If you ask for the phone number of the ""Moderator,"" you will not get one. He/She is ONLY accessible by email, and they NEVER return your emails, even if you beg them to. The C.O.T.H Forums Moderator is a sick and twisted human, who gets great pleasureout of having the power to help or destroy a person. After emailing the ""Moderator"" an additional 6 more times regarding my situation with no response, I decided to call the headquarters back.  I told the young lady who had answered my call about my desperate situation, and what was happening to my business, and reputation on the COFH Forums.  She smugly replied: We stand behind our moderator's decision 100%, and there is nothing we can do.Sorry. "" I stood there speechless, and not believing what I was hearing, but it was true. The Chronicle of the Horse Forums will allow any false information to be posted about ANY innocent person, and will do NOTHING to help stop the lies and slander, and promote truth.  It truly is a sick website where insecure ""nobodies"" can ruin a hard working American's career at the click of a mouse. I'm not suggesting that everything ""thread"" posted is a lie, but a VERY large number are justsimply not true. I decided to contact some of the victims of the ""thread reputation assaults,"" and see how they had been affected by the posts on the Chronicle Of The Horse- FORUMS. I contacted 12 victims of ""chronicle attack,"" to see if they had been affected by the threads posted about them and their businesses. The victims were VERY easy to find, being that the attackers always give the victim's phone numbers, addresses, email address, and more , in order to try to givetheir lies some sort of appearance of validation.  Some of these victims included: Horse haulers, Trainers, Groomers, lessonfarms, Tack-Shop Owners, Stable Owners, etc.  After speaking with them, they all essentially said the same thing; that an enemy had posted a lie about them on the Chronicle Forums, and then the lie started snow-balling.  In one incident, a man who owned a lessonbarn, became a COTH victim when he unknowingly angered a fowl-tempered parent for scolding her child who was whipping her horse excessively.  The angered mother immediately went home, goton the C.OT.H. Forums, and accused the trainer of molesting her daughter.Of course, this was false, because if it would have been true, he would have been arrested. Needless to say, his business and reputation were quickly ruined, and it wasnt long before the farm that he had worked for over 15 years to build was for sale. All accusations were false, and an innocent trainer lost hislivelihood because of a LIE on the C.O.T.H.-Forums.  Another professional hauler was accused of causing brain damage, to a horse, because the person who was having the horse shipped, did not want to pay the shipping bill. There are MANY more ridiculous stories that will be exposed when my book is published.  Most people harmed bythe threads on the COTH-Forums, initially tried to seek legal action against the website, but found it difficult because the website hides behind the ""Freedom of speech Act."" How messed-up is that??!! So, the website is not liable for anything posted. Therefore, they do NOT search out the truth, or even care what is happening to innocent people.  Most people,who were attacked on the forums, eventually had to close their businesses due to bad publicity. This is exactly the outcome that the trouble makers wanted!How can it be, that there is a website, where the evil lairs thrive, and the innocent suffer? Well, believe it. Its all true. The Chronicle Of The Horse - Forums is a breeding ground of lies, and goes unchecked. Innocent people are being ruined financially, emotionally, and respectfully and NO ONE is doing anything to stop it.  Hopefully, the release of my book will do something to help expose this disgusting website, and all of its depravity.  It is my goal in life to expose the evil people who are harming the innocent, and to shutdown a website that condones lying, unproven facts, and malicious gossip. Unfortunately, by the time my book is published, it will be too late for many people who have been harmed by this vicious website. Do yourself a favor, and if you read something nasty about someone on the Forums of The Chronicle Of TheHorse website, contact that person directly before making a decision not to do business with them. Chances are, they arent a bad person. Just someone who was too much competition for someone else.  Lies are a terrible thing, andthose who harm the innocent people will one day get what they gave back 7X stronger. That's just how karma works.  I'm sure this write-up will be met with MANY angry comments, but it is time that the TRUTH be known.  Let's keep it honest everyone! Rather than trying to destroy your competition, just create a better product.  I leave you with this last quote regarding gossip. ""The tongue is a double-edged sword, be careful of how you waggle it, for one day, it may cut off your head. ""									",Internet

										30 Day Satisfaction Guarantee is nothing more than a HOAX. On June 9, 2011, When signing up for Century Link High Speed DSL internet, the site, literature and bill and customer service rep all assured me that if I was unsatisfied for any reason, I could cancel within 30 days and receive a FULL REFUND. Well, during the first 14 days, I called several times to complain about the slow speeds. It was slower than my old dial up, yet I was paying for the fastest speeds they had available. They kept assuring me they were fixing the problem and promised to call me back. Every time I was promised a phone call, it never came and I had to call them back and start all over. This went on till day 28.   Finally, I said forget it. I want to go back to cable. I asked for my entitled refund. First, they claimed that I had to request it 5 days before the 30 days were up. [continued below]....
									
										..... ??? After several hours and 4 customer service reps, I was finally told that was false and that YES I AM entitled to cancel and get my refund. (I was in tears by this point) They directed me to the web page I needed to go to to fill out my cancellation/refund request. Well, the form wasn't working. It wouldn't accept my information. AN error kept popping up. Once again, I had to call them. This is when I almost gave up.  The person I spoke with made me start ALL OVER. I tried to explain that I already went through this and I just need help with the web page. FINALLY, after 45 MINUTES!!!, she transferred me to her supervisor and Katie (the rep) informed me I needed to be on Internet Explorer. Phew, I thought. I filled out the form and asked her to wait on the line while I completed it and received the confirmation number. She did and I got my confirmation number. She then explained I needed to call customer service the following day to officially 'cancel my service' and find out how to return my equipment. I woke up the next morning and called immediately. I spoke to Dominic (They refuse to give last names), and he first tried to tell me I had to drive to Flemmington (an hour away) to return my equipment. I said it was too far so he was nice and said he'd send a postage paid label in the mail for me to use to return the equipment by mail. Great, I thought. He then assured me that my official service cancellation date was July 8 and that if I were charged for the 9,10, and 11th, I'd be refunded. He claimed he noted that in the computer.  About a week later, my mail label arrived, and I mailed out my equipment that very day. They claimed my refund would take up to 12 weeks. Well, I never received any correspondence from them until today. It's October 26th and I just received a BILL FOR $102.53!!!!!! The bill indicated the charges were for internet service! I was confused and called immediately. I was informed by the customer service rep that my records show that ""my services were never cancelled!"" I am livid. She said ""all I can do is dispute your charges and you can wait for a phone call"". I said, ""but I'm looking at my email. It's from YOUR COMPANY confirming my cancellation and refund request! There's even a confirmation number!"" Oh, she said. Really? Really, I said. I gave her the confirmation number but I am sure based on past experience that this is far from over. Consumers like me need your help. Please help!
My Desired Resolution:
I want the refund I was promised, as well as the current bogus charges eliminated. The refund should be in the amount of $153.32, and the current charges are $102.53.									",Internet

Redwood City, California United States of America ",roblox.com,(888) 858-2569,"Roblox Roblox.com Roblox Unresponsive to Customers Redwood City, California","
										Roblox is a kid's website.  My boy started playing on the site about 2 years ago, when he was only 8 years old.  He's now 10 and is a veteran of this site.  Over the years, whenever we have had problems with Roblox, they have been difficult to contact; e.g., they will NOT answer their phone (it's a recording), will NOT call you back (only respond via email), etc.
The specific issue that was ""the last straw"" for me happened this past month.  I had paid $20 for a month of ""Outrageous Builders Club"" membership for my boy, who frankly loves Roblox.  He did ""something,"" it's still not clear to me what, and they suspended him for 14 days.  He was embarrassed and didn't want to tell dad and mom; so, it literally took me 10 days (into the 14 day suspension) to even find out that he wasn't allowed on Roblox.
I got details on his infraction, which involved buying or selling something that Roblox doesn't allow you to buy or sell on the website.  I contacted Roblox.  I made the following points:
1. Roblox is a free-for-all of kids showing utter and complete disregard for the rules!  There's profanity, illegal buying and selling, and worst of all, a variety of scams on this site whereby kids can actually steal other kids ""robux"" (Roblox ""currency"" to be used for legal purchases).
2. The scammers pass their scams on to other kids (again, 7, 8, 9, 10 year old kids are being victimized by these scams or TAUGHT these scams).  
3. Roblox does NOT notify the parents of any bad behavior!  Ever!  So, again, I know for a fact that my kid broke the rules.  He admits it and was punished.  My thing was ...
     A) You suspend my kid for HALF the month of a $20 membership and never say a word to me?
     B) That's an insanely long suspension for a child on a kid's website 
     C) It becomes even more impactful when you consider the cost of their membership!
     D) I know for a fact that worse, far worse, than my kid trying to sell something he shouldn't have goes on with other kids on Roblox and at least in one case, the kid was not suspended; e.g., we had to go through the BBB to get 3,700 Robux refunded to my boy after a kid scammed him out of them.  Roblox wouldn't even respond to my emails!  They only took action after I complained to the BBB.  And ... the kid who stole my boy's Robux admitted it in Roblox chat sessions numerous times and was ... never suspended.
4. I wrote Roblox outlining my complaints.  I should have been notified; it was an overly strong suspension, etc.  I told them either restore 10 days of the suspension or I was done with their site.  The ""customer service"" representative said simply, ""Nope.""  
5. I am done with Roblox.  They are a fly-by-night company that has somehow managed to create a very popular website with kids.  But they are not professional in dealing with customer-service issues, they do not keep parents informed, they do not constistenly enforce rules across the board, and they do nothing to stop the scams, bad behavior, etc.  If you turn your kid loose on Roblox, you had better beware: You are on your own to monitor every aspect of his or her behavior.  Roblox does not help and Roblox acts any way Roblox sees fit.

My next class was Principles of Marketing instructor, Connie Morse. The only thing that was different with the class was that she required a 24% in similarity scoring. AIU has a separate scoring base from the (DB), Discussion Board scoring. I submitted an assignment to the Originality Verification site and received 100%, meaning, the Original Verification site preclude that I  submitted a document that was 100% copy/ paste, yet when I submitted the same document to the discussion board, I received a 41%.  I became very confused. Based on the DB score, I had to repost by rephrasing 17% but the Originality Verification score stated that I had to rephrase by 76%.I worked and worked but the Originality Verification site kept giving me scores like 95% and 84% when I had already scored a 41% on the DB. The only way out was to keep reposting the Discussion Board until I reached the 24% required by the instructor and this was unacceptable to me since they offered an avenue to see your score before posting. I have since been in touched with other online universities to continue my education. I dont know that this is possible but, I dont want have to owe two different student loans. I feel this is not my fought, the fought lies with the inconsistency of AIU.  I am trying to move forward at this point. I am looking at Kaplan University as a tool to complete my BBA.What I am asking is that you forgive my loan at this point. I am just asking for a fair shake. I think that AIU should be investigated regarding their third party partners. Currently, I have over 3.67 Average, I have not wasted the monies you invested into me and Im excited about learning.All I ask you to do is to look into what I have alleged before you make your decision. The inconstancies I found are in MKTG205. Please review my specifics in the Originality Verification scores vs my DB scores for Unit 1 DB scores.If you do this and you still think I am in the wrong, I will accept you decision but, I am determined to move forward.Respectively submitted,Norma Johnson									",Internet

										My son had an account on Runescape for a few years.  We never had a problem with it until about 1 year ago.  His account was being hacked over and over again..Which from what I had read now about the game isn't uncommon.
He wanted to go back and play again and had to resubmit his information to regain his account...which he did. For about 1 1/2 months it was fine and then went to log in and the password had be changed..Once again he tried to recover his account (now over the past year he has done this about 4 times).  A red flag should have gone up. When you try to recover your account they want you to  give all the information about that account...all your passwords, last 4 digits of credit card, answer as many of the security information you supplied when you started it, you isp server etc.  this isn't done by private email..you send it through their website..anyone would be able to see all your information.  I've played Runescape and other mmorpg games myself and never do they ask you for any password, or any other personal information.  Jagex blames hacking done by having keyloggers etc..this last time my son did everything possible to avoid his account being hacked..made a new email address in case his old one was tagged or something ..we have a new computer..we always use virus protection he linked it to facebook redid all his private information..tried all we could think of to stop this from happening again.  So this time when he tried to recover it was denied , they said the reviewed it and decided the he was not the original account holder...He sent in passwords he used through out the years and even offered to send them bank statements where Jagex had taken their monthly fee out from years ago. 
Why would a company deny it with proof such as that..how can an account be hacked over and over again if someone (possibly) within the company was doing that?
I know Jagex could care less. They have no customer support to contact for any problems..no email..no way of contacting them other than their billing.  Other games we have played have outstanding support.
So to finish this up. If you have any problems with Jagex your out of luck..play at your own risk

										Signed up for their Trial on July 11th 2011 for their 14 Day-trial - canceled the account on July 16th,
cleaned out my test folders [they are an online data storage company].
Received an email from them, aknowledging my cancellation - but also asked for an email back to state the reason why. I hit reply in outlook, and my reply was sent.
Did not hear anymore from them. On July 27th 2011, the company charged my bank account anyway.
My accountant sent me a snapshot of the WellsFargo account.
I contacted Livedrive.com by email again, requesting an immediate refund for an unauthorized charge.
Again, did not hear back from them. Until today, where they tried to charge my account AGAIN.
Since there is no phone number listed for the United States [where they supposedly have an office], I called London. Dealt with Kevin [thick english accent/hard to understand], who asked for my verification number, which I gave him. [continued below]....
									
										..... Immediately I was bombarded with the accusations, that it is my fault for not replying. I tried to get a word in to tell him that I have all email records right in front of me. But he simply continued talking that it is all my fault. My voice got louder to get it through to him, that I had something to say and that I have proof [delivered sent email in Outlook], but he simply said finally to me SHUT UP.
I said, you don't say to me shut-up, he replied ...I just did, then continued to say several times shut-up, shut-up, shut-up.
I stopped trying to proof my case and went silent, then in a patronizing voice he said - not, we get somewhere, it would only have taken 3 seconds if you would have shut-up, instead of the 5 minutes on the phone [mind you - I am paying for this call], we will refund your money.
I ended with the request to send me an email, so I have proof of that statement.
Did receive an email right after, starting out with the same accusation, that I never emailed them - but they will refund my money in 10 business days.
It is apalling, how a 'customer' get's treated - they should not be able to do business in America, where there is hardly any recourse. I had never been treated so rude. This tactic may work in England - but is not tolerated in America.									",Internet

										WOT is host to several, no hundreds of Trolls.  These are users that get rewarded for their efforts in rating as many domains as possible.  The more domains, the more rewards these users get and the more authoritative they become, influencing many other less experienced WOT raters.
WOT is in the business of selling security seals, so the more websites that find themselves victims of bad WOT ratings (I say victims because there usually is nothing wrong with their website), yet they get rated by these WOT Trolls with harmful negative comments.  I paid little attention to this WOT Scam until recently when my own websites fell victim to their scheme.
WOT's negative tactics can only work if you install their addon into your browser.  Beware, even their addon appears to act like a spyware program.  Below is another's personal experience.  The link below also talks about a Church that received very bad ratings, showing WOT goes after any viable business or organization to encourage them to buy their security seals.
Posted on 2011-04-20 09:53 by DBCJR
http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/2707869/posts
This is supposedly a safe browser add-on that will help protect against dangerous or fraudulent websites. Users are supposed to rate sites good or bad. But WOT actively rewards users who specialize in giving negative reports. Some of their top-rated users have done tens of thousands of negative reports, and it is obvious they are not really rating sites accurately. WOT's own statistics show that the overwhelming majority of ratings are negative. The developers of WOT are in the business of selling security seals for websites, so they have a vested interest in making website owners afraid of negative ratings. It is typical for harmless websites to have negative ratings, which cause scary warning messages to pop up in the browser of anyone who has installed with WOT plugin. If the website owners aren't using WOT, they may never even know they have been targeted. At the same time, there are a number of dangerous or fraudulent sites which have no ratings or good ratings from WOT. Overall, the ratings are worthless to consumers and possibly very harmful to people running reputable online businesses. Then, when you realize that this plug-in is worse than useless and uninstall it, it is never really completely uninstalled, but leaves hidden traces behind, in the same way that spyware does. Stay away from this terrible product.									",Internet

										I have noticed that this company SB *SAVINGS2GO 888-272-5027 TX253279 has been taking out money out of my account without my permission.  I have already contacted the portion of this company to not take any more money out of my account.  This company has taken out a total of $44.85 out of my account in the past 3 months.  I want my money refunded and also my name taken off this account.  I need my money, times are hard and a company that just takes money and doesn't have your permission to take the money is a scam and needs to be reported.  I am very angry about the way this company has taken advantage of me.  If I see any more deductions of money from my account I will get me a lawyer and see if I can get some of your money.  I do not like a company that takes advantage of people who don't know what is going on until they have taken hundreds and hundreds of dollars from poor people.  I am a disabled person and I live on a certian amout of money and I don't need a company that thinks they can get by with scamming you on your money because they can.  
Again this company SB *SAVINGS2GO 888-272-5027 TX253279 has ripped me of of $44.85 in funds that they were not supposed to take from my account.  Please refund this amount to my account as soon as possible.  I AM VERY DISPLEASED WITH THIS COMPANY AND I WANT MY REFUND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.   LIKE BY FRIDAY OF THIS WEEK.  AUGUST 29. 2011.  IF I DO NOT HEAR ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY ABOUT THIS MATTER I WILL CONTACT A LAWYER OR A BETTER BUSINESS PERSON.   EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
 
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
 
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   
 
DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
 
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
 
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
 
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. 
 
CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
 
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action.  ",Internet

										It seems every month, as a new customer, I'm seeing the overbilling. Of course they advertise the special price on their website and why does it not surprise me that the bill is double. To make it even worse, I was a Comcast high-speed customer for years with 100 mbps service for same price as what Centurylink bills for 1.5 mbps DSL. Talk about a blatant rip-off and false advertising. If anyone reads this, you do have consumer rights! Email the Attorney Generals office in your state and they are highly efficient at getting these erroneous and fraudulant billing tactics rectified.I dont like being taken advantage of and neither should anyone else. This game they play is outdated and, judging by the drastic losses in their yearly revenues, they are still way out of touch with all their customers.

										A STERN warning to anyone considering signing up with QUIBIDS!  Read this now... 
I signed up for QUIBIDS today and I was shocked to see that QUIBIDS IMMEDIATELY charged my credit card for $60.00!
NO warnings about the $60.00 billing and in all that I read BEFORE I entered my credit card  I was never given a option to be billed for ANY amount.  
Now I understand that that I must buy bid points to participate in Auctions, but ""I"" and all members should always have the option to select the amount of points WE wish to buy!  It's as simple as that.
In truth, I wanted to buy $25.00 to start and everything I read said I would be able to buy my points ""later"" after I signed up, but $60.00 is a lot of money that I never expected to spend. 
*** I sent a message to support@quibids.com requesting a FULL refund and I received a automated response.  Tomorrow I will contact my credit card company to see if there is anything they can do to. ***
I think everyone agrees, these kinds of deceptive 'sign-ups' should be against the law!  The QUIBIDS sign-up page should CLEARLY include a message right up-front that QUIBIDS intended to bill new members $60.00 and how difficult is that?  If I knew of that policy I never would have signed-up, but they didn't bother to do that.  In my estimation it is both dishonest and deceptive for anyone to do business like this.
Readers please, KNOW you WILL be billed $60.00 right up front!  You have been warned.
I promise to let everyone know how QUIBIDS responds to my complaint.  If QUIBIDS fails to refund my money I will escalate my complaints to the State of Oklahoma, the Better Business Bureau, all of Oklahomas'  politicians and to every federal agency I can find. ",Internet

										So I was looking at my bank statement online yesterday. This has never happened to me before, but guess what? I had $3.89 when I still had a week to go before pay day. I was trying to save up, and I'm trying to pay off my credit card bills after I get some money in savings. Geico had taken $62.75 (or something like that) from my account when I had already paid them for this month and did not authorize another payment transaction. I'm a single teacher so I was mad and terrified at the same time. I called up Geico, and talked to this girl named Heather who told me that I was on automatic payments, and that that was how that came up. She told me that Geico would not refund that payment even though I told her that I would pay that payment immediately on the 15th. I never have and never will authorize automatic payments, and I told Heather this. She got irritated with me on the phone and told me that no one at Geico would have put me in for the automatic payments but myself. I told her that it was not possible that I put myself up for that. I'm always careful not to do that as I need a little cushion to get me through the rest of the month. She also told me that the automatic payment thing had been up since March, but there were never any sudden deductions like the $62.75 I saw. I was seething mad after talking to her so I just got off the phone as quickly as I could. Now I'm going to have to take some of the money out of savings that I just put in for this month. I am soooooo mad!This is not the only time Geico has tried to do something stupid. They have tried to get double payments from me in the past when I paid them during the month until I called them on it. Some man tried to get me to pay more on my mileage once, and when I called him on that he tried to act all innocent. I hate Geico. I'm thinking about switching to Progressive or some other auto insurance company.  If I had enough money to sue them for the misery they have put me through, I would.									",Internet

										Regarding a UniBlue.com product purchased/refunded, BBB, Chicago admitted that Cleverbridge Inc., third party processer facilitated the transaction.  BBB did admist that UniBlue had the authority to deal with the refund and chose not too, sending it to Cleverbridge serveral weeks later.  At that point, Cleverbridge claims they knew little to nothing about the situation and then since my transaction was done by ""Gift Card"", knew little about that too!  Please note, UniBlue.com web site does not record Gift Card payment or refund procedures for any company.  At this point Cleverbridge contacted VanillaMasterCard, found out company policy and instructed me to follow it.  Little did I know, by doing so would render myself responsible for all fees initiated by the company.  BBB, Chicago agreed with Cleverbridge's misinformation and believes the company acted appropriately.  The point of my complaint....although it cost me only $10 dollars...is to inform all UniBlue.com customers of Cleverbridges deceptive customer service techniques.  Be very careful...watch how you pay for your purchase....check out other internet sites first...you might find a better provider.As for BBB, Chicago...Not to suprized....Cleverbridge Inc., does pay a membership fee...so a consumer may not expect a fair or as Ms de Courtenay would like you to believe ""neutral investigation.  Although requested, BBB would not provide me with a copy of the investigative report!R.GrantBelow is a copy of BBB, Chicago email response from M. de Courtenay, Director of Operations.....................................Dear Mr. Grant: Thank you for contacting the BBB regarding your complaint against Cleverbridge, Inc. We appreciate the opportunity to respond to your concerns. As you may not be aware, the BBBs value to the business community is based on our neutrality. The purpose of the BBB system is not to act as an advocate for businesses or customers, but to act as a mutually trusted intermediary to resolve disputes, to open communication, and to provide information on ethical business practices. The BBB is neutral and therefore does not take sides in a dispute. The BBB works to promote an ethical marketplace and tries to seek a mutually satisfactory resolution in disputes between businesses and customers. Businesses and customers both have rights and responsibilities in the marketplace.  In your e-mail you asked how Nita Virghes arrived at her decision to close your complaint as administratively resolved. When a BBB receives a complaint, we present the complaint to the business and request its assistance in resolving the dispute with the customer. We give the business an opportunity to present their side of the story and address a consumers allegations. The complaint handler reviews all the information submitted by both parties and bases their decision on the information in accordance with national policies and guidelines.  In reviewing your complaint file, we noted Cleverbridge alleges they facilitate online payment processing transaction for Uniblue Systems, where you purchased the software from. However as an online payment processor, they allegedly do not provide any support or technical assistance for Uniblue Systems software. Further, Cleverbridge alleges because Uniblue has the ability to process refunds on their own, Cleverbridge was not made aware that the refund was issued to a gift card until the second e-mail correspondence with you on April 22, 2011. Cleverbridge also alleges they had no prior knowledge of these terms and conditions or standard fees until they extended their efforts to assist you by contacting Vanilla MasterCard to attempt to resolve this issue. We have noted that Cleverbridge has included references to their companys Privacy Policy Payment Procedures as well as the Cardholder Agreement found on the Vanilla MasterCard website in responding to your allegations. Additionally Cleverbridge alleges, By using the prepaid gift card, according to the terms set by Vanilla MasterCard, Mr. Grant agreed to present both his receipt and the gift card for all returns and/or exchanges and also rendered himself responsible for all transactions initiated and fees incurred by use of his gift card. Based on our review of all the information submitted by you and the company therefore, we have determined the case was processed appropriately as it appears the business made a reasonable effort to resolve the dispute by issuing a full refund to you, which you stated is your desired resolution. While we are unable to assist you further regarding your complaint, we thank you for giving us an opportunity to be of service to you. Thank you. Maria de Courtenay | Director of Operations Tel: 312-245-2647 Fax: 312-832-9985Email: mdecourtenay@chicago.bbb.orgwww.bbb.org | Start with Trust									",Internet

										I was doing a search for a deceased family member of mines on google. When I narrowed down the search to the city and state of my family member I noticed this site called faqs.org. This site was very disturbing to me due to the fact that I swore that social securities numbers was still covered from public record other than for immediate family. And I know that no one gave permission to post that information anywhere.
Contacted Social Security and they gave me some crap saying that once a person is dead that there is no longer any privacy to personal information can be posted anywhere. Social Securities numbers are tied together with dependents and parents. This is a complete security issue.  When I asked the Social Security rep what is the social security safeguards to if a decease's person social is being used for any reason. He could not answer that question other that I will need to contact a lawyer to advise me on that matter. The most that he done was give me some U.S.C. laws that doesn't state that social security numbers aren't covered under the privacy act once someone is deceased.
I am presently looking into a legal means to handle this whole situation bout on this website and the loophole that Social Security said had no grounds to stop or ensure that this this information wont be used.									",Internet

										I am writing this letter tocall to attention everyone out there who is looking for a web designer to
create a website DO NOT USE SMART DESIGN AND PRINT OR The Smart Marketing & Media Group Ltd
If you have been searching for a website creator, been quoted a small fortune to create it, been asked for money upfront and promised the earth both in terms of the service and the website content and design and have then been horribly let down by appalling service and well-below-expectations in content and design, then read on 
I am creating an A business from the UK to South America and have been searching for a website creator to produce my website. I started searching in January and, four months later, feel compelled to w rite this account:  
My first bad experience took place in January after I provided my first web designer (who asked me for 402.50 upfront as a deposit (about a third of the total price)) with all the details necessary to start building my e-commerce site. As per their own website they offer you the world including 100% satisfaction guaranteed or your money back. Nearly four months later, I only had one page sent to me (which was all of my own design anyway!) , let alone have my website delivered to me  completed and to my satisfaction. I have requested return of my deposit and am still waiting For this very first occasion I confess that I didnt do my homework, such as contacting some of their clients to ask how they felt about the company that built their website. So I paid a very high price for not doing that.  
In a desperate urge to make some tangible progress, I made a search on the internet and I found a website called  WWDC which web design company  be confident in your choice. Hmm.
I contacted them; and four web design companies contacted me. After talking to all of them I decided to go for one which, by WWDCs opinion, is a PINK POWER MEMBER (which means they
are great). Smart Design and Print were fantastic over the phone.  I asked if I could visit them and the answer was yes. The samples provided seemed like a dream come true for me; and the price was attractive as well but  again - with 50% deposit to start the job (so nearly 800). Having been bitten once already, before writing my cheque, I decided - as a last thing to do in order to be 100% sure - to contact ten of their clients just to get their confirmation of how good the company had been. The feedback was devastating: the first call the phone rang and no answer. The second client told me that they would recommend them; however they struggled with the site optimisation (something the company claimed to be their speciality) and there was no support; and calls were not returned. It took ages for the site to be built. Also I was told that, having taken their money, they were constantly phoning to advise that the site needed a boost and that consequently more money was needed. Then on to the third company: this company told me that they would not recommend the web designer at all and warned me of the dangers of getting involved with them [web design company] because of lack of communication, requests for more money and generally not delivering what was pitched before taking the money. So this is a letter to show how horrible it can be and how you should not trust what you read in so-called review sites because you have to understand that these reviews can be made up as well in order to attract and then ensnare clients.
The other 10, got no better!!!! 
The moral?
       
Be suspicious about paying a large deposit up front. Bona fide companies should not insist on that (e.g. would you expect to pay 50% for the price of a car before you took delivery of it?);
       
Make sure you get an agreement about how long they will take to build the website and what they require from you in order to do so (remember that you still have to provide the content;
       
Do your homework. Get a list of clients for which the company has created websites and contact
them direct;
       
Read the small print and be sure you understand what your money is getting and what it is not getting;   
       
Flashy sites, and grandiose claims are no guarantees of satisfaction;
        
Above all, please do not take a chance. It is a sure guarantee that you will suffer. Do some extensive research and you will be okay.

										I had internet only installed in my apartment while working at a temporary job. I had service for 3 months. I singed a contract but was not aware it was a 2 year obligation. The installer did not make this clear and I was unaware I had signed up for 2 years. I absolutely was not informed there would be a fee if terminated early. I moved back to GA from Atmore, AL where there is no Mediacom service available. When I turned in the equipment I was informed I had signed a 2 year contract. They called and when I returned the call-no one answered. So, I left a message re the contract but got no return call. I thought they had dropped the issue. Two months later I get a bill for $211 plus $40 service charge. I had no phone calls or bills prior to this. So, now I'm being charged an outrageous fee for no service provided, purged from their system and therefore can't deal with Mediacom and charged with a service fee w.o any opportunity to address this bill before being turned over to collection. This is sneaky and predatory plus deceptive by not offering any remedy before turning over to collection. I would not have a problem paying the regular charge for the 3 months insted of the discounted price which would be $40 instead of $20.

										On February 13, 2011, I bid on eBay Real Estate and won a duplex in Cleveland, OH. The seller is Kendal Mason, his eBay user name is Calcap196, his company he calls Pac West Corp, Inc. He described the duplex as: Fantastic investment, large renovated duplex, move-in ready after a little paint, minor fix-up and cleaning, beautiful tile, hardwood floors and carpet, individual furnaces and cooling units, electric and gas meters and breakers, solid exterior doors, newer roof in great condition, renovated and in fantastic shape, plumbing and electrical intact throughout the property, water heaters and furnaces in great shape, etc., rents for $625 to $700 per unit, not one of those cheap junk properties you see advertised, where after purchasing you find out the property is boarded up and looks nothing like the photos.
But this is exactly the case! According to the property manager I hired, who inspected the interior and sent me photos, absolutely nothing has been remodeled or renovated! These are the problems: Peeling wallpaper, paint peels of the ceiling (water damage), all units need painting, carpets need replacing, no sinks in kitchens, no vanities, mirrors or shower units in bathrooms, no water heaters, no working furnaces or ducts, front door and frame broken, several windows broken and boarded up, front porch floor, steps and banister rotten, needs plumbing and electrical wiring, the roof is so bad, the shingles fly off, plus this is not a good neighborhood, and rents are only around $350 for an apartment.
Before I bid on the duplex I asked questions about the amount of work it would need, and Kendal Mason wrote an email saying, that the repairs would come to about $600 to $800. Now my contractors bid is $21,500, and that does not include a new roof! So naturally I feel cheated. I only bid on the place, because it was renovated. I did not want a fixer-upper.
I sent an email to Pac West Corp, Inc., demanding, that he either take the property back and refund the money I paid, or pay for the repairs needed to bring the duplex up to the condition it was advertised at. His answer is: Sorry you are not satisfied with your purchase. We can not be held responsible for any damages which may have occurred two months after your purchase of the building. No fraud has been committed in the sale of the property, and we do not place any value in third part reports as to the condition of the property. The property was sold under these specific terms: Purchaser understands and agrees that she is purchasing this home in ""as is, where is, how is"" condition, with ""No warranty  expressed or implied"". Any representations of this property are simply the opinion of the seller...
Since February Calcap196 sold 2 more properties on eBay, with nearly identical descriptions, also advertised as renovated, when in reality they are far from. I talked to these buyers, they feel cheated, too. I tried to inform eBay about this scam, but so far got no response. Real Estate is not eligible for eBay purchase protection programs. He now got negative feedback from one of the buyers, and he is trying to blackmail her: Change the feedback, if you want the deed for the property! But if he changes his user name, he could get back in the (scamming) business again. There should be much stricter rules for selling real estate, and the true identity of the seller should be in the listing, too.
So I want to warn others, who might want to invest in real estate, buying properties on eBay. Stay away from properties offered by Kendal Mason, ""president"" of ""Pac West Corp, Inc."", which I found out is not even a legally registered business or corporation, their business address ""268 Bush St., San Francisco, CA"" is nothing but a UPS Store, the phone number ""415-963-4330"" is just voicemail.",Internet

I have talked to their CS over 10 times over the last 7 months and they all lie lie lie. Today i called again and was told that the promotion never reflected on my account and they cant go that far back to help me, but they can give me another promotion of $14.95 or cut my bill to $24.95 for 6 months OMG!!!! What do you say to that.

										Hello,
About a month ago I had ordered a server and a full C Class for our online marketing company. The sales person Colin Joyce was very good in helping to assist me in the process. When it came time to actually get the service, I did not get what I had paid for. 
The IP that I was given were listed on SPAM HAUS which basically makes the ranges unusable because of someone spamming on their network. Colin was nice enough to try and get this replaced and he did which was awesome. 
However the next range again was not usable. When I had asked for a refund because the service had not been replaced. The abuse department did a fantastic Bait & Switch. Citing that I was in breach of the contract, which I was not. 
And that a refund would not be issued. In addition the ""abuse team"" most likely ran by one guy, would not identify himself. 
Avoid this company at all costs. I know personally of another company that they have rip offed for tons of money. Don't take my word for it though. Check out these others posts:

										This is not a uncommon thing, being ripped off over the internet. Although, it is uncommon for the website you bought it off of to have 94 other affiliates profiting from your purchase. Let me set the stage for you. As a good gesture to my husband, I had the marvelous thought of buying him a Scottish Clan ring for his birthday. He is full Scots-Irish so this the ideal present. I went on this website, 4crests, and saw a wonderful array of choices to be made by the public for any reason need be. I usually check out a website before buying anything from it but somehow this one evaded me.  I chose a beautiful and classy Clan ring in solid 10K gold. The picture was gorgeous and everything seemed fine, until the second or third day. They promised ""An order status and tracking number"" for my order and if I needed them ""Please, do not hesitate to contact us"". Well, I did. Once. Twice. Three times. Still, no order status nor tracking number. Finally I was fed up with their lousy customer service (for which they have none and I have proof to back that up. It is owned by one single man. I will not post his name unless I take legal action). I spent 806 dollars of my hard earned money for something I am never going to see. Not only am I never going to see my money or my product, his 4crests site promotes leeching and theft. Here is a copy of the ""benefits"" of becoming an affiliate (clearly, a fraud business):

We will issue you a check every month that your commissions exceed

 If you need more proof of them being frauds I have an email stating how ""long"" it was going to take just for my ring to be engraved. Anyway, I am up to date on the Law in the State of Washington. Second degree Theft is defined as such: if the item or service is over 750$ but less than 5000$, it is second-degree theft. 
 A complaint has been made to the BBB and they have not responded as of two days ago. I have read where they have done this to others, I think this constitutes action but that is just my opinion. I may not get my 800 dollars back, but I want to shut this man down and shut him down hard. ",Internet

										Nearly a month ago, I entered two of my logo designs into the following HatchWise.com contest hosted by Erica319 (Ms. Anderson) for a chance to win her set monetary prize:
http://www.hatchwise.com/contest_detail.php?contestid=257306#
On 02/19/2011, Ms. Anderson expressed (using terms like 'good' and 'favorite') in the comments that she liked both of my designs (entries #306527 and #306528), but only one received a 5-star by her:
http://www.hatchwise.com/entry-for-257306-306527
The contest was ending in a short while. When it did no winner was declared, which is typical. Days go by and still no winner. Since, the contest was not prepaid, it dawned on me to check into the history of Erica319 (Ms. Anderson). I found that she had hosted other contests on HatchWise.com none of which had a declared winner; either they did and HatchWise.com did not make it known through their system. Nevertheless, I looked into Ms. Anderson's ""Women in Diplomacy"" contest:
www.hatchwise.com/contest_detail.php?contestid=1701
I noticed roBailey's entry #130229 was rated a 5-star, however not chosen as a winner. So I figured that would happen to me and it was going to be just another abandoned contest. I kept looking anyway and wondered if any of the designs were being used. After doing my research, I came across this:
http://www.facebook.com/pages/Women-in-Diplomacy/139941756592
Interesting enough, this logo representing this organization is located on Ms. Anderson's undeclared winner HatchWise.com contest for this organization (further research states she is the founder of Women in Diplomacy and the list continues). The logo was designed or submitted by zadaku with entry #134365. People have every right to change their mind. However, it was not reflected that she did on HatchWise.com. Who knows why not? Is it possible she stole that design?
Now, it's time for me to remove/withdraw my designs from HatchWise.com. Too late, because HatchWise.com does not permit designers to do so once the contest has ended. No good. I guess I just have to hope and pray she won't steal my designs.
Days go by, still no declared winner on HatchWise.com and I didn't get any messages if she chose me. I manage to locate this blog she claimed the logo would be used for within her brief details for the contest I entered. There's no content and no logo on it - a new blog. Days go by and still nothing on her blog and no updates for her contest. Eventually, her blog has content and with my logo sitting rather large and pixie in the header, which continues to sit there:
http://fortheloveof-by-erica.blogspot.com/
I have not given her consent to use my logo, nor did she pay me for it. (The thing I hoped and prayed would not happen has happened). I try to give her the benefit of the doubt, even though, according to the law, she has absolutely no right to use my logo without my consent any of course not paying for it. So, after realizing I won't be paid nor declared winner (there was still no declared winner on HatchWise.com), I seek counsel.
OK, let's try to settle this. I send her a message through HatchWise.com to also make them aware of her infringing and thieving activity. Here are the following correspondences sent (I'm just going to copy and paste so excuse the formatting):--- 1st Message ---

Hi Ms. Erica, 
I hope all is well. I have a question to ask you. Will you be declaring and paying me for one, or both, of my logo designs (http://www.hatchwise.com/designer/entry_detail.php?contestid=257306&entryid=306527 or http://www.hatchwise.com/designer/entry_detail.php?contestid=257306&entryid=306528) in your contest here: http://www.hatchwise.com/designer/contest_detail.php?contestid=257306?
Moreover, Hatchwise.com does not give designers, like myself, the option to withdraw entries AFTER the contest is over. Therefore, I will document it here, that my entries will be withdrawn, by me, within 12 hours of the time stamp on this letter, should you choose neither of my logos are suited for your blog nor a winner.
According to the law, here in the U.S.A, you are not legally permitted to use my logos for any reason. Furthermore, it is only when, and if, I give you permission to use either one of my logos, will you be legally within your rights to use it. However, since you have not paid for either one of my logo designs submitted to your monetarily prized Hatchwise.com logo contest, For the Love of, nor received permission, byme, to use either one, you are, therefore, prohibited from using my logos anywhere. Choosing to disregard the above terms, and using either one of my logos, constitutes as theft. Therefore, receiving monetary restitution outside of Hatchwise.com will be taken against you in a court of law, here, within the United States' justice system.
Thank you,
Hasina (Hatchwise.com member di-vahyn)

I did not get a response from Ms. Anderson nor HatchWise.com. But I'm on top of this, so I go check HatchWise.com and noticed I've been declared the winner. Hmmm...I guess HatchWise.com had another computer glitch in sending out notifications - go figure. I'm already in the mode of not trusting people because of what I've found. Then George of HatchWise.com expresses by threatening he and his team will steal my logo and charge me. What is going on here?! Now I have to deal with two thieving characters: Ms. Anderson, who has already been caught and now George of HatchWise.com, who out-of-the-blue freely (he has a right to freedom of speech, but of all things to exercise the right on) threatens to commit the crime against me. Are they working together or what? Because that is one bizarre response to the situation I was not obligated to share. I would have been better off never telling him about Ms. Anderson, one of his contest holders who used his site to commit thievery.
So, did Ms. Anderson really even get my messages, declare me winner and pay HatchWise.com? They both have crook's mentalities.
I email Ms. Anderson the same day:--- 2nd Message ---
RE:Winner of ""For the Love of"" contest.
Hi Ms. Erica,
HatchWise.com is not being so wise. They have decided to give you an illegal replica of my design; when they know they are not legally allowed to do so. That's like the HatchWise.com design staff creating and selling you a replica of Facebook's logo. When Facebook finds out about you using it (probably much like how I found out about you and my logo design), they might not be so merciful and just outright sue you for using their logo without their permission. And, your only defense, 
before a court judge, is you paid for it. You may go a bit further to shift some of the blame by stating HatchWise.com design staff sold you the logo, and the list goes on. The court will rule in Facebook's favor.
However, depending on certain factors, you might win in a lawsuit against Hatchwise.com for selling you a pirate copy of the logo. I wouldthink, HatchWise.com knows how these kind of cases play out in court. Well, now you know.
Nevertheless, if you did pay HatchWise.com, then you need to inform them to send you back only $85, which is $150 minus $15 (the HatchWise.com Admin Fee of 10% taken out of the prize monies owed to winning designers), in order to pay me. Please send the remaining $85 to my PayPal account to hasina@gmx.us, so you can legally have your files and not get caught up in HatchWise.com's decision to give you an illegal and unpaid replica of mylogo design. (The fraud, thievery, and admittance of intention to become a thief and fraud is ridiculous in this world. To top if off, is the willingness and audacity of those people to drag others down with them--how selfish).
Moreover, when Hatchwise.com issues you your $85 return, I have uploaded your source files so you can get them immediately upon paying at the following secure PayPal link:

Hi Ms. Erica,
I have given you ample amount of time to pay me. Since you have made the decision to not pay me, as well as ignore me (I have not heard back from you), then my offer is retracted. I will not be selling you my logo and rights.
Thank you,

Re: You still have not paid me. My offer is retracted.
Hi Ms. Erica,
If that is so, then simply request a refund from Hatchwise.com. George of Hatchwise.com has a crook's mentality, much like your illegal activity. So if you did pay him, don't be surprised if he refuses to refund you your money. Besides, I've already told you his intentions in which he foolishly, openly, and freely expressed to me. When and if that happens he'll be in violation of the law and a double whammy for you. You might want to acquaint yourself with the laws, Erica. And, if you 
don't understand them, then seek a lawyer to put it in layman's terms.
On the 7th, I informed you how to pay me and receive the original source files, even when my calculations were off (which I would have honored anyway). But for some reason you refused and outright ignored me. I guess this is just some kind of game to you.
As far as your question, re-read the emails and tell me which part you don't understand (that's rhetorical)?
All the best to you and be blessed,
HasinaEND OF ALL CORRESPONDENCES
You hear of contest holders creating contests to only abandon it and steal the logos. So here I am making all designers aware of this particular contest holder who was caught by me - what are the chances, huh? I don't know if George has terminated her account or what. He should have. But be aware.

										What ever became of Mike ""Zappy"" Zapolin the famous Internet Warrior?
He's gone!
I purchased ""Zappy's"" book, ""Internet Warrior"" written with Alys R. Yablon in 2009. The subject of the book was How to buy & sell domain names on the Internet. 
After reading the book, I paid to join Mr. Zapolin's ""Internet Warrior"" members group to learn in detail how to value, buy and sell domain names for profit.
Initially, there was someone to answer technical questions not covered in the book or on the website.
Shortly thereafter however (I'd say approx 45 days), no one answered  the customer support number. After days of retrying,  a man finally answered the phone. Although he knew who Mike ""Zappy"" Zapolin was, he had no idea where he was. He also didn't know anything about the abandonment of the Internet Warrior website (www. [continued below]....
									
										.....internetwarrior.com).
After grilling this gentleman for a while he  told me the Internet Warrior Customer Support number actually rings into a distribution warehouse  for a Pharmaceutical Company. He further explained he worked for the warehouse and was paid to answer the Internet Warrior Support number.
When I asked him for Mr. Zapolon's contact info he gave me a disconnected number. When I called him back (took many calls to get him to answer again) he told me all he could do was pass my contact information on to Mr. Zapolin and Mr. Zapolin would contact me. I thought this bizarre since earlier he had said he did not know anything about Mr. Zapolin's whereabouts.
NEVER did get that call from ""Zappy""
Next I tracked ""Zappy"" through Google. I actually found him and befriended him on both Facebook & LinkedIn.  I messaged him and asked what happened to the website and for my money back. Again, he NEVER replied!
I gave up until today when I saw his name pop up on the Internet.
Now ""Zappy"" has a company named Internet Real Estate Group (www.internetrealestate.com). He is listed as the CEO of this company on the website. The address of ""Zappy's"" new company is: 188 Needham Street, Suite 255, Newton, MA 02464. 
Mr. Zapolin did not have the professionalism to respond to me after disappearing with my ""hard earned"" money. I wonder if there are any others out there he ripped off?
Please understand the money in question here is not life altering. However it is the principal of it all. It doesn't take much for a guy to make allot of money if he can find a thousand suckers.
""Zappy"" is a smart marketer with lots of testimonials and pictures of him surrounded by celebrities and politicians.
My advice is if you run across him or anything he has to sell be very wary!									",Internet

They said it is spelled out. I did find the automatic renewal in their terms of service policy which was linked in very small letters at the bottom of their website. Buried in the document is this:
4. Automatic Renewal Program. Upon your acceptance of an offer for the purchase of an All Access Pass or any other subscription-based Paid Services , you will be enrolled in Memory Lane's automatic renewal program to help ensure that there is no interruption of your paid member privileges. Under this program, you authorize Memory Lane to automatically renew your subscription at the end of the term of the subscription you purchased, and each subsequent term, for the same term length of the subscription you initially purchased (unless otherwise stated in the offer you accepted). Unless you take the necessary steps to remove yourself from Memory Lane's automatic renewal program, at the time of each such renewal you authorize Memory Lane to charge your credit card (or other payment method) at the then-current, non-promotional price for the renewal of your subscription-based Paid Services. If you no longer want to be enrolled in Memory Lane's automatic renewal program, you can change your renewal status at any time by logging onto the ?Account? portion of the Website, clicking on ""Account & Billing"", and changing your renewal option from ""automatic"" to ""manual"".

Wavee in one place on their web site they say a shipping date is 14 days,in an other place they say that if you don't receive your item in 3 weeks to call them.
  
I won an auction on 3/1/2011 , and paid by credit card , anticipating delivery with in 3 weeks but in reality the 1st estimated shipping date that I was given is 5/10/2011 then it was changed to 5/31/2011 ( UNREASONABLE for consumer ) .I was told that due to unexpected growth shipping is backed up. They are just now delivering items from January. No place in their web site states that expected delivery will be 2-3 months . When I spoke with Customer Support I told them that the bidder should be aware of lengthy delays in shipping . I won a printer , bid too much because I needed that printer ASAP. Now they have my money and my printer and I have nothing but a 3 month wait. If a lengthy delay in shipping was posted on their web site I would have never bid .
I won the bid using 202 credits and paid $ 48.88 for the printer and was told that I could get my $48.88 back but that they would not replace my credits. At $.75  those credits cost me $ 151.50 which in these tough times I can not afford to lose .
 It is almost obscene the amount of money that they are making. My winning bid was # 46.89 and there is a $ 1.99 processing fee . So each bid being  $.01 and each bid costing $ .75 , 4,689 bids becomes $ 3,516.75 that Wavee receives for a $ 299.99 printer.
I told them that they should either make the bidders aware of the lengthy shipping delay or curtail their auctions till they can achieve reasonable shipping times.									",Internet

										I have purchsed several thousand dollars worth of FAKE Watches from both the Always AT Auction website as well as their other site Coupon cabin Auctions.  I also purchased many ""autographed"" sports memorabilia items.  These items were such a ridiculous case of forgeries that it is almost funny now, but not.  Most of the pictures I purchsed are so fuzzy and printed on paper of such a poor quality that no clebrity would have ever signed the item in the first place.  Second the otems arrive smelling of fresh ink, very odd for a signed Mickey Mantle, as he has been dead for 16 years now.  When I contacted them for a refund I was called by the owner who attempted to calm my problems with the forgeries and I even bid again and was sent even worse examples of forgeries than the initial items were.  I also bought several watches that are all FAKES and advertised as Swiss-made timepieces, are actually made in China just the boxes state on them.  I bought a watch listed as Rose Gold, not gold colored, well of course it is NOT gold--surprised I was not.  I filed a case against them with the Texas State Attorney General's Office as I take theft seriously.  This company is taking advantage of people liking to collect memorabilia of their favorite sporting stars.  I also noticed that the only people that are the supposed experts on their ""COA's"" are unknown or outright known as jokes in the field such as Dr. Nicholas Burczyk.  All items with his so-called signature were poor quality black and white copis of a COA with his useless expert signature on it.  Also used in the forgery are a Christopher Morales whose website I imagine is owned by the same Always AT Auction company; seems to not answer any contact?  Again, not very shocked at all with that response.  I have collected autographed memorabilia for over twenty years and even the new pictures lose the smell of Sharpie after a few months.  When I mentioned the smell of ink as my main comapint the subsequent photos I purchased no longer smelled as they had dried the ink especially for my order as I had complained about the smell--good one.  In my own collection I have noticed how colors of Sharpies have changed over the years. and also that no celebrity hardly ever exclusively uses one color.  ALL items on their site, save a very few, are signed in fresh Blue Sharpie.

I WAS LATE ON PAYING my internet bill with Charter Communication by 3-4 days, and they usually just disconnect my internet and i call and pay on the phone and they connect me back right away.  I do not deny being late, and I admit that i do need to pay, and the bill was paid, so this is not the issue.
I run my business at home, and i had no intention on cancelling my service with Charter because I need my internet as i am an internet business, and i have VOIP phones that require internet.  I have been a LOYAL customer for a long time of Charter Communications.  I cannot afford to have my internet down at all.  If i let them take the equipment, I could not afford being down for a week or longer just to get a $90 bill paid, in which it was paid already.
Strangly, there were 2 technicians that came to my door to take my equipment and go in my backyard and disconnect the internet cabling.  I told them niceley that i will call Charter and pay the bill as i am a customer and i have no intention on cancelling my internet service.
The technician did not care, he insisted on taking the equipment and disconnecting me per the Work Order he had on hand.  
I very politely asked this technician to leave my property 4 times as he was standing on my front porch and refused to leave and insisted on taking my modem and disconnecting me in my back yard.  I told him NO and to leave my property.  He refused to leave my property and he took 2 steps towards my back yard, and i stepped in front of him and said NO!  He was in my face and refused to walk away, so I pushed him off my front porch because after 5 times, he refused to leave my property.  
I DID NOT push him in a violent manner, i did not push him on the ground, i did not cause any bruises, i did not cause any harm, i simply put my hands on him and pushed him off my front porch and told him once again to leave my property.  The only thing that happened was his feelings got hurt.  What he should have done was walked away the first time i asked him to leave and just report that he was unable to collect the equipment, and they would have noticed that the stupid $90 bill was paid already that day.  
He did not care if the bill was paid or not, he was just there to get the equipment.  I have never did any harm to anyone in my entire life!  I have never been in a fight my entire life!  I thought that as a Home Owner in America, you have a right to ask anyone to leave your property and prevent anyone from entering your property.  The Police Officer agreed with me, but he did tell me that i should have called the Police to force him to leave as that is considered TRESPASSING.
He then called the Police and the Police Office told me this was total non-sense and should not happen, but he had to write me a Misdemeanor Battery citation.  Now i have to go to court in March 2011 because of this.   Charter Communications should have called me to try to resolve this, and I never even received a phone call from them.
What is funny is the Police Officer questioned why I was using Charter Communications.  When i spoke to my attorney, it was even more funnier that he even questioned me why I would use Charter Communications as well.  It appears that Charter Communications has a very BAD reputation for quality of their products, unreliable equipment that does not work, and their horrible customer service.  This is coming from the Police Officer and my Attorney.
I am requesting that Charter Communications dismiss this case if they want me to continue being a customer.  However, i will NEVER do business with Charter Communications EVER again.
This same sitauation may happen to any customers who decide to do business with Charter Communications.  
I AM NO LONGER A CUSTOMER OF CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS!

										This is an online penny auction. On two items I was bidding on, I had utilized their bidding assistant wherein you determine at what dollar level you want to bid, what dollar level you want to stop bidding at, and how many bids you will make. You must first buy bid packages for 30, 100, etc. bids, which you use individually to bid on an item to increase the purchase price of the item by $.02. On Saturday, Feb. 19th, the countdown clock ended with my bid for a Coach Gathered Sofia handbag, however, the &quot;bid ended&quot; notice never displayed. I refreshed the page, logged on from another device, and the same thing happened. 
Later, the bidding ended at $2.92 with another announced as the winner. On a subsequent bid for a Louis Vuitton Odeon handbag, the bidding stopped again on Monday morning with my bid as the last bid. I contacted the company at the phone number listed on Monday, Feb. 21st at approximately 11:45 a.m. EST and spoke with Courtney. She said they were just reviewing the bids and that I was indeed the winner at a price of arond $29.50. She also said she was seeing the same thing on her computer, and that the clock was stopped at zero, and I was the last bidder. Because of the computer issue, she was sending a request to her corporate office to investigate. 
When I check the website around 2:00 p.m. that same day, the auction was still running, and the bid was above $40., and my bidding assistant was continually bidding on my behalf, whittling away at the bids I had paid for. I was shocked, called the 877 number again and spoke with Louis, who said Courtney was out to lunch, his supervisor's name was Robert, and Louis was unable to look at the CRM at all. He also refused to understand that I had a prior conversation with Courtney, she said she saw on her computer was I was seeing on mine, and Louis insisted it was a problem with my computer. 
I called back at 2:20 p.m., Louis answered, and when I asked for Robert, he hung up on me. I redialed two more times immediately, and the same thing happened. At 2:22, I called again and spoke with Candace, who said she had just come on that shift and that Courtney wasn't there. When I asked to speak with Robert, she indicated he was in a meeting. I advised her that I was filing an Internet Crime Complaint and contacting my back to refute the charges.									",Internet

Palo Alto, California United States of America ",,650-543-4800,"Facebook  Facebook disabled my account aka: ""leafBuilder"" for no apparent reason, no forewarning... Palo Alto, California","
										Without any forewarning, Facebook disabled my account yesterday on 2/6/2011. I believe their decision came as a result of collaboration with corrupted adversaries of mine in the cable news media industry, possibly corrupted government sources too who have been suppressing business ventures of mine as well as my voice. These sources are corrupted and I've been stating so for some time now.
I gather I've been a target of these obscured sources since 2005. However the INTENSITY of the ongoing badgering, FREEDOM OF SPEECH SUPPRESSION and BUSINESS INTERFERENCE I believe is a direct result of me essentially telling a GS-14 who worked at Homeland Security (ICE) as a law enforcement agent that President George W. Bush dragged America into war based on false pretenses, causing the U.S. unnecessary loss of limb, life and treasury funds. One official actually called me a terrorist; this jerk probably never served a day in the Military but had the nerve to call me (a 3-term honorably discharged navy veteran) a terrorist. [continued below]....
									
										.....Henry Waxman who served as Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in 2007 received a request from me (via Margaret Daum) on 1/29/2007 to investigate certain individuals within Homeland Security for corruption, individuals I believed illegally targeted me. I never received an official reply back from Mr. Waxman's office with an extent to how far my complaint was pursued, or whether or not they would pursue it at all.
On the other end of the spectrum one may question how does my problem involve cable news media? Well, during the time I expressed my not so popular opinion to the aforementioned law enforcement official, who so happen to have had friends and associates within the same social sphere. One of these friends (who I won’t invoke by name but will say African American) was an avid Bush supporter who I believe had contacts inside CNN during Richard Parsons' tenure as Time Warner's CEO. Not to suggest that Mr. Parsons engaged in any targeted activity toward me personally but he himself was an avid Bush supporter; Mr. Parsons is now Chairman of Citigroup. I believe the African American referred to earlier -- his associates, and/or the law enforcement official began spreading malicious rumors and lies about me throughout the Time Warner conglomerate, particularly among CNN’s journalists.
One has to also take into account that during the time of my gesture to the Homeland Security law enforcement agent of Bush's RECKLESS decision leading our Country into war that Bush was still popular among many supporters in Texas, particularly among the social sphere for which I had chosen to exchange political dialogue; needless to say most individuals I conversed with were former military turned law enforcement or veteran civil service law enforcement types, Caucasian and between the ages of late 40s to late 60s.
Hence atop the rumors and lies cloaked under a massive infrastructural network of cable news media and entertainment with some very powerful people within their ranks I believe emerged a COVERT SMEAR CAMPAIGN against John Christopher Sudds for calling Bush out on America's costly Iraq war.
Other media interests such as Fox and MSNBC I believe joined in on the targeting perhaps not so much for me calling out Bush on the war but for simply targeting the cable news industry, which they probably interpreted as a destructive act on the industry itself, and/or toward journalists themselves.
Many of these sources I believe were monitoring my comments on Facebook as I would sometime get glimpses of mocking-rhetorical blowback from journalist programs hosted by CNN's John Roberts (who's now with Fox) and his co-host Kiran Chetry (who's a former Fox employee), CNN's Kyra Phillips program who's now married to John Roberts, Ali Velshi's program as well as Fredricka Whitfield for where ever she was fitted in, usually between weekdays and weekend sessions concerning Mrs. Whitfield. Interestingly enough now I know why John Roberts appeared to have been targeting me early on when it seemed there was no reason to do so; it was because he is married to Kyra Phillips.
On Fox 4's Good Day Dallas broadcast; particularly Tim Ryan and his co-host Lauren Przybyl I've a strong suspicion of; perhaps John Roberts has Fox 4 plugged into my private yet open-book life for now.
MSNBC I won't comment on publicly but my suspicion are there as well, certain folk I believe knew I was being targeted illegally.
I can't say with any certainty at this point whether or not these entities and their employees were involved in violating my privacy rights explicitly or implicitly through the use of wire taps, video streams and online internet tracking but I'd feel most relieved if the FBI would question these sources as well as the editors and senior people they work for as to whether or not they knew to ANY extent the existence of such illegal activities.
FBI and Justice Department (perhaps Civil Rights Department within too) would be further invited to question these entities and/or individuals on my behalf as these issues would have resulted in not only a violation of my privacy rights but also a piercing of my company's veil under false pretenses.
CNN's Mrs. Kyra Phillips has recently covered several negative stories against the FBI and that in and of itself raises my suspicion even more as I believe the FBI may have already begin looking into misconduct CNN's editors, journalists or senior leadership has been engaged in. From what I understand Mrs. Phillips also has friendly ties to the U.S. Navy's journalist and/or public affairs community. I do not trust Mrs. Phillips sense of purpose ""period."" She's always into America's private lives and bedrooms, as she so eloquently demonstrated during her program on 2/7/2011 with a cleric, scolding Americans about their obsession with porn. If I want to look at porn I'll look at porn, even in front of her; it's my constitutional right to do so -- and mind her, wherever the desire as a result thereof takes me behind ""MY"" private doors then so be it (get a life). She tends to be an out of control feminist who feels she's the right to change the ways of men. Mrs. Phillips I'd have you know that sin is also over participating in many things, and that includes eating too; that's right -- it's a sin to over eat. And I'm sure it's a sin to illegally spy on thy neighbor. You are living in sin too Mrs. Phillips so don't be so quick to barge into other individual lives.  
As for Facebook, so long and GOOD LUCK; the trust I conferred your venture proved to have been a mistake at best. I should have known that wherever there's corruption and inexperience at the top of a corporation, with tons of money and so-called power involved then there's probably little for right or wrong, only bottom lines matter. As I see it Facebook and the corrupted sources within its circle that consistently targeted me with calculated Facebook feeds and awkward ads as a means to demoralize me failed miserably, as it was Facebook and puppet-cronies who could not endure my witty obscured replies, and the only way to have saved face was to disable my account and to affix some shady-calculative explanation about why it was disabled, ""ONE-MAN"" against many -- now imagine if I had funding behind me, I'd suppose nightmarish for many. Anyways, there are many other up-and-coming social sites I'll consider in the future; meantime Facebook, growth and bottom lines are not always the priority -- in most cases I'd say it's about doing what's right, and I believe your venture has fallen well short of that calling in your deeds leveraged against me on 2/6/2011.

Does Rehabilitation Work?       Report Attachments:                  
										.....3333px 'Times New Roman';"">Does our judicial system still work ? I 
wonder at times especially when I see a convicted murderers get their death 
sentence commuted to life, or when we see a rapist get his prison time cut in 
half for ""good behavior"". Better yet, when I see two bit criminals like Mary 
Prantil play the court system for damn near three years.  We let pedophiles and killers out on early 
release to walk the street and some times even allow them write books in how to 
carried out their unlawful acts such as in the O.J. Simpson case.  Our system of law seems to be burdened down 
with so many rules and regulations that it actually impedes the the due process 
of law, in my opinion.  Most persons being processed through the 
courts on various charges, or through the criminal justice system, have several 
opportunities to plea out for reduced sentences, or no actual sentence aside 
from community service or paying a few fines.  I believe that justice must be tempered with 
mercy and further, that the crime must fit the punishment yet, in todays courts 
the justice we speak of seems to be watered down to a dangerous level when it 
comes to certain crimes.  It's watered down as a result of excessive 
lobbing under the civil rights codes outlining societal civil liberties. Again, 
I will just say that one can adhere to the law so rigidly that they themselves 
can actually violate the law in which they so earnestly try to 
enforce.  It's time for us as a Nation to recognize 
that some individuals simply can't be rehabilitated no matter the educational 
resources you offer them in a prison setting or rehab center upon 
release.  It doesn't matter how many church meetings 
you force them to sit in on or how sorry they come off to the victim or victim's 
family in a parole hearing.  The time has come when we as a Nation must 
recognize that some folks only wish to feed off of society while refusing to 
yield to any of the laws that make up that civilized society. These folks not go 
against the tide of a peaceful society but further add parole to those of us 
that attempt to live by the laws passed by our government.  Example:Do you really think our newest 
assassin feels compassion for his victims?Or that he even thinks about the 
long term damage he carried out against the innocent fallen? I for one believe 
he is very sorry he didn't kill more folks from the sickening smile on his 
face. Perhaps this is his look of sadness and remorse for the 
cameras.  Do you think he will find Jesus once he's 
locked away in a very clean federal prison? Maybe so, but he should know that 
there are some crimes against humanity that are unforgivable by both God and 
man.  Will the parole board feel compassion for 
him thirty years down the road after his lawyers have filed one partition for 
continuance right after another. Perhaps the Governor will commute his stay on 
death row to life in prison once the names of the victims have been forgotten by 
all except the grief stricken family members.  Doesn't these possibilities concern or scare you? 
That something like this could even occur in the United States in 2011. Well, It 
happens everyday. Doesn't it bother you that a psychopath, or lunatic likeJared Loughner murders 
all these innocent folks and seriously wounds several others, then smiles at us 
all from behind prison bars.  It bothers me 
greatly and I hope that justice against him works in this instance, and I don't 
mean twenty or thirty years from now.  Do we think 
that this broken personality can be fixed? I don't think so, what do you 
think?. We also have several problems plaguing us in America to date that we as 
a Nation must contend with, as you all ready know.  We have high 
unemployment, health care issues, overseas terrorists and apparently confused 
factions of government here and abroad just to name a few things. Do we really 
need home grown terrorists like Jared Loughner? Or the long line of home grown 
terrorist that preceded him? No would be my answer to this.  Ok, let's take 
another look at Miss Prantil's records below after a few initial statements made 
on my part. Mary Prantil has a long history of being suicidal and suicide 
attempts along with a lengthy criminal record going back three years at least in 
New York.  Prantil has 
several restraining orders against her in the state of New York, issued by the 
state of NYC. She's been sent to Rikers Island for two court orderedPsychiatric 
Exams, as the record shows. And was subsequently picked up on a warrant for 
violating her Parole that was eventually Revoked. Please view records

										.....    I believe that prantil is 
anything but beloved person in the state of New York and further, is a little 
egotistical in declaring herself to be on ""a mission from God"". Especially when 
this person is in direct opposition of God's Holy Laws in every way.   She once proclaimed that 
she was on a mission from God to bring down cyber scammers such as her. I wonder 
how this is working out for her four years later? Not very well from what I 
have observed.      Miss Prantil states that 
she likes to bring laughter to the world One laugh at a time however, I think 
it's more appropriate to say that this cyber Troll harms society via procreating 
one tear at a time through her malicious and evil actions.   This is all very typical 
behavior coming from a individual like this as you can see on the cyber stalking 
and Cyber Troll profiling sites.    Below, is a wonderful list 
of resource sites for both adult and child victims of this type of situation 
being carried out against them and thus, we would strongly exploring the offered 
sites as they are a great source of comfort. (YOU ARE NOT ALONE IN 
THIS).   Given the daily or pre 
existing stresses of the world felt by everyone, life can be trying at best 
however, when you throw in constant harassment from a Cyber Troll like 
prantilcould give anyone a horrific and or, an unbearable 
existence.   Persons with prantil's 
personality were often times childhood bullies whom further caused much pain to 
the children around them. Basically, Prantil is the bully that we all hated and 
avoided in school. The type of person that lived closed to us that eventually 
filled our young lives with dread and fear on a daily basis.   It is personalities such 
as prantil that have grown up psychologically; yet, have never evolved 
psychologically, and still remain the bully at heart. Instead of harassing us on 
the playground, behind the school or on our way home, they now harass us on the 
Internet, over the pone and through the email.    Social Networking is now 
their playground in which they stalk, harass, torment and kill persons on 
occasions as is unfortunately the case from time to time.    In short, we've all grown 
up into law abiding citizens trying to lead our lives in a peaceful, God fearing 
and prosperous way.   Yet, they being the Cyber 
Trolls like prantil have regressed into a neanderthal personality whose only joy 
is in causing others emotional and psychological pain for prolong durations of 
time just for the sake of being noticed and or validated.    Many of these articles and 
profiles below will warn you against FEEDING THE BLOG TROLL and Cyber Stalker by 
not responding to them if at all possible, I believe in this tactic regarding to 
some situation but not all.   I was taught early on that 
if you can't go over, under or around a Bully problem, YOU GO THROUGH THEM. To 
avoid this sort of a problem through inaction does nothing more then postpone it 
temporally, It will only come back to haunt you at a later date.    Basically, inaction is the 
same principle that states, ""If I don't move maybe he won't shoot me"", or ""If I 
give the blackmailer the money, perhaps he won't squeal on me"". A criminal is a 
criminal that typically doesn't live by the same rules as you and I do, and 
that's what makes them criminals in the first place.   Rational and moral thought 
process,or the equal rules of fairness and engagement doesn't apply when dealing 
with criminals. I don't condone just ripping someones ass at the drop of a hat, 
I do strongly believe peaceful resolution if at all possible however, If this 
doesn't work then I am certainly for dealing with the problem head on. 
   As can be seen in my 
previous reports and the profile reports of others below. These criminals are 
freaks of humanity, or simply bullies that never grew up into adult life, who 
have absolutely no regard for your rights as a human being.    They most certainly don't 
have any real fear of the legal system so why should they care about what their 
activities do to others.    No fear, No Remorse, No 
Mercy is what most Cyber Trolls and Cyber Stalkers like prantil are made up of 
yet, these qualities won't save them in the end no more then these same tactics 
save a rabid dog.   I agree with a lot of the 
statements made on these sites, but mostly with the statements having to do with 
record keeping and the gathering of evidence. This in itself will save your 
reputation from idiots like this little 95 pound stalker bag of sh_t named maryprantil.    Miss Prantil often times 
says on her trash sites that Fear Is Only In The Mind. This statement in 
itself shows us her personality, doesn't it? Fear for this particular Troll is 
in being exposed internationally, or throughout the world simply by yielding the 
facts of her criminal life.    In our particular 
situation with our little stalker, scammer, cyber bully and Troll, we learned 
that she is many things rolled up into one big ball of criminal crap. In 
essence, a very mentally afflicted person whom likes to torment and rip off 
Internet businesses, nothing special.    The thing that makes me 
angry is in that people like this remain free through the inaction of public 
officials and or law makers. But even this is a small matter as Mob Rule will 
handle this type of thing quite nicely.    Like any bully or cyber 
stalker, a good punch in the nose usually remedies the problem and thus, our 
reports on this fool is exactly what this is. Now our little stalker is begging 
for us to stop mentioning her name yet, she persist in mentioning ourson a 
daily basis,and in derrogatory ways. This just goes to show you what a freak 
job she really is, in my option. You know, I often wonder how many people have 
become very sick emotionally and psychologically in the past as a result of 
prantil's perpetual harassment and stalking of them?   I wonder how many suicides 
she may have driven people to as a result of her criminal torment treatment 
against them? I've been told by many in New York law enforcement circles on 
numerous occasions that she has done this same thing to countless private and 
professional people down through the last 20 years.    Again, I ponder on 
occasion the question, could prantil have caused a child's death at anytime such 
as was the case with a 46 year old woman that was just indited for cyber 
stalking and manslaughter against a fifteen year old?   The Mother didn't like 
something the girl had said to her daughter and thus cyber stalked and bullied 
the young girl so much that she commuted suicide by hanging herself in the 
closet.    Who's to say that prantil 
wasn't responsible for contributing to the death of another in her past as a 
child, or perhaps a responsible for an undocumented or unreported event on the 
Internet etc.?   It's people like prantil 
that have the emotional makeup to carry out things like this against a person.In fact this is their goal in some instances.    Really, all the police see 
is the suicide and really miss what caused the suicide in the first place. To 
which leads me to another interesting point, Miss Prantil uses the terminology 
of Cyber Murder a lot.   We know that everything 
prantil says, or charges another with, is in fact what she is either planning to 
do, or has carried out at some point in her life against another.    I just find this a 
interesting choice of words on her part, that seriously makes me wonder what 
this stalker is actually capable of as a general thought.   Another statement prantil 
had made about a year back was in accusing us of allegedly having homeless 
people buried in our back yard and that we had also allegedly 
Sacrificedhomeless peoplein satanic spells. Again, makes me wonder; as mary 
prantil usually has already done or is planning to do the exact thing that she 
accuses others of.   In the past, most folks 
didn't really see the importance of this grievous issue however, I've noticed 
that more and more coverage is given to this matter of Cyber talking, Scamming, 
and Cyber Bulling as a dangerous criminal activity.    Especially on social 
networking sites like Facebook, Eblogger, Twitter, Google Profile and other so 
called social media web sites. Prantil is on and uses all of these sites along 
with the scam sites to propagate her criminal activities.   As far as I'm concerned, 
prantil and those like her are criminals that have both very disruptive and 
dangerous personalities. I only have total loathing and contempt for these kinds 
of societal misfits and believe we need to send them all to a lock up for good. 
Again, please read the links below and guard yourself, your children,and those 
you love against imposters, cyberbullies, stalkers,andcriminals such as Mary 
T. Prantil. ( more info on skank Mary found on ""A Shrine To Queen Lilith"" )          
										.....    I believe that prantil is 
anything but beloved person in the state of New York and further, is a little 
egotistical in declaring herself to be on ""a mission from God"". Especially when 
this person is in direct opposition of God's Holy Laws in every way.   She once proclaimed that 
she was on a mission from God to bring down cyber scammers such as her. I wonder 
how this is working out for her four years later? Not very well from what I 
have observed.      Miss Prantil states that 
she likes to bring laughter to the world One laugh at a time however, I think 
it's more appropriate to say that this cyber Troll harms society via procreating 
one tear at a time through her malicious and evil actions.   This is all very typical 
behavior coming from a individual like this as you can see on the cyber stalking 
and Cyber Troll profiling sites.    Below, is a wonderful list 
of resource sites for both adult and child victims of this type of situation 
being carried out against them and thus, we would strongly exploring the offered 
sites as they are a great source of comfort. (YOU ARE NOT ALONE IN 
THIS).   Given the daily or pre 
existing stresses of the world felt by everyone, life can be trying at best 
however, when you throw in constant harassment from a Cyber Troll like 
prantilcould give anyone a horrific and or, an unbearable 
existence.   Persons with prantil's 
personality were often times childhood bullies whom further caused much pain to 
the children around them. Basically, Prantil is the bully that we all hated and 
avoided in school. The type of person that lived closed to us that eventually 
filled our young lives with dread and fear on a daily basis.   It is personalities such 
as prantil that have grown up psychologically; yet, have never evolved 
psychologically, and still remain the bully at heart. Instead of harassing us on 
the playground, behind the school or on our way home, they now harass us on the 
Internet, over the pone and through the email.    Social Networking is now 
their playground in which they stalk, harass, torment and kill persons on 
occasions as is unfortunately the case from time to time.    In short, we've all grown

I wrote them that I had done nothing wrong with my account or websites and I wanted some specific information on what I did to cause my account to be disabled. The response I received basically said that it was a ""terms of service violation"". Now how is anyone supposed to respond to that all inclusive phrase. I used my only option and appealed their decision and stated that I had done nothing wrong with my Adsense account. They still denied my appeal referencing the ""terms of service violation"". Since they do not pay out earning until 2 full months after they are received due to verification of clicks and earnings, etc I lost the over $4,000 in my adsense account that was already verified as legitimate from prior months earnings. What I have an issue with is the prior months earnings that had already been verified as legitimate and were just waiting until the end of the next month to be paid out.

It was $99.00 plus $5.00 for 3-5 day shipping and $14.00 for 2 year warranty for a total of $118.99. On 12/1/2010 I tried to contact them to find out why they hadnt shipped my purchase yet being that I paid for 3-5 day shipping. I called at least 3 times and remained on hold for 20-25 minutes each time with no luck talking to anyone. So I emailed them 12/1/2010 asking them when I would see my purchase. On 12/2/2010 they emailed me and told me that it takes 48-72 hours to process orders. So since they had already used up their time frame to process my purchase I got nervous and looked up reviews about this company. Sadly I should have done this first, the reviews where horrible. Then I emailed them telling them I wanted to cancel my purchase. Then I called M+T bank to dispute the charges and cancel my card. On 12/3/2010 they emailed me back Orders may not be canceled during Peak Holiday Season, per our website. Then I replied, Well don't bother sending it because Im disputing the charges with the credit card company. Never in my life have I ever dealt with this poor customer service. I guess the 8801 reviews of your company were right-the worse to deal with and a scam.   (((ROR redacted)))Then on 12/5/2010 they replied back, Sir, there is no scam whatsoever. Per the return and cancellation policy, which is clearly stated on our website.....orders may not be canceled during peak holiday season I apologize if you did not read the return and cancellation policy prior to making your purchase, but I am liable to the terms, as are you.   If you would like to receive your net book with the shipping notification, and send it back for return after the fact, you are able to do so. Our return fee and cancellation fee are the same.   On 12/5/2010 Then I replied, as I said don't send it. I will refuse it! And by the way as far as your peak seasons no cancelation- you clearly don't state when your peak season is nor does my receipt of my order even if I didn't find it to read it in the first place. How simple it would be just to cancel. Rather you instead want to ship it to me then charge me a restocking fee and then make me pay for shipping, just to be a pain in the ass. So I guess since you have chosen to be difficult I will be contacting the attorney general office, better business bureau and New York state district attorney as many before me have!  On 12/6/2010 they replied Are you aware of our cancellation fee?   Which I replied why would I? Its not clearly written! Only during peak which are? Other wise there is none. Thank you so much for this pleasant experience. Ill sure to spread the word! d  Then they replied Cancellation fee is all year around as stated on our website, Peak season is Holiday from Thanksgiving till New Year.  As you can see they are being difficult to say the least. And even if I still wanted the purchase it still hasnt been shipped yet! So why would I pay for faster shipping and still not get it anyway! I hope this has been helpful. If you go to the links above youll see all the bad reviews about them and if you go to eglobals web site and read the reviews about the purchase they said the product is great.-scam? I havent received my purchase and hope they dont send it. I will be contacting the better business bureau and the attorney generals office about this also. ON 12/16 THEY SHIPPED MY ORDER ANY WAY!

										Yes, I won a TV on priceshuffle.com. This was BEFORE I found out I was charged $149.75 without my consent. On the FAQ on said website the first question and answer states that you create an account FIRST for free and after you do that you then pick a bid package. This is NOT how it really works, they lied. You create an account entering in your credit card information at the same time. I used a code for free bids, I was then taken to the next page to bid on items. When I won I went to my bank account to make sure I had enough money to buy the TV and shipping and I see the charge. They never once asked me if they could charge this to my account, and never once did I recieve a email confirmation saying I had been charged and never once did it say on the website that I was charged. I have noticed that the site will not let me log out and the sign up page is different then the one I org signed up on.

I manually selected which ones on the list, but the SYSTEM included the one I did not want. I called GoDaddy and the rep told me it would be removed. I told him I was NOT renewing it and letting it go. NEVER renew from the list they send you. ONLY do it within your account if you choose to stay with GoDaddy. It's just a matter of time before someone else is another victim. I seldom log onto my account and again saw that it was still there last month. I was very upset and called again ... This time I didn't allow the rep to dictate the chain of events ... I demanded it be refunded and stated I was NOT renewing ... I was NOT donating this site or my time or money to an organization that no longer existed.I logged on tonight to see it still renewed for another year. Not taken off my account or refunded. I told the rep TAKE IT OFF MY ACCOUNT AND REFUND ... he told me I was out of the 5 day grace and there would be no refund.I've been a victim of theirs one too many times. But they always corrected it. Not this time. They received the last $$$ they will ever get from me. One can only be taken advantage of if you let it happen. I refuse to be a victim of their ripoff.

400mm f2.8G ED VR Lens that was advertised as being in BRAND NEW condition but
with an open box. I called immediately after placing the order (Friday at 9AM)
to inquire about why the box was open and if the lens had been used in the
field. I was assured that it was brand new and that they ""open the box of
all high end lenses to make sure all components were included"". I did not
buy this but felt they had assured me that it had not been used in the field to
that point in time. I asked when I would get it and was told it would ship late
that day or early Monday and I would have it by Wednesday...in time for the
football game I was shooting Thursday.  Monday I had not received tracking information
and after a few e-mails I called and was told they were having trouble getting
my order approved by their bank...I asked why their bank was concerned since my
AMEX card had already authorized the charge. I was subsequently told that they
would ship it Tuesday AM and I would get it Wednesday.  On Tuesday morning at 10 I followed up again
looking for the tracking information and was told that my charge had not passed
their verification department until that morning and now that it had it would
ship that day and I would get the lens on Friday.  Later Tuesday11/23, at 5:19 in the afternoon, I
got an e-mail telling me that my order had not passed verification and that I
would receive a full refund of my $7,498. I called and inquired as to how they
had managed to decide that a transaction that Amex had approved was not a valid
transaction especially since my e-mail is tied to my photography site that
lists the same name and address that they had on the order....the gentleman
continued to be insulting and dishonest with me....Amex later verified that
they had gotten an authorization for the charge from Amex on the day of
purchase, but never put the charge through to request payment...so his claims
had all been untruths including his statement that they had issued a
refund....I called him back and got some other story about how he was choosing
not to do business with me and then I got a separate e-mail saying that my Amex
rep was not telling me the truth and that the lens ""was not the most
pristine condition"". Yeah, I bet Amex is the dishonest company here.
 I would not shop here if you are counting on
getting what you are trying to get...it cost me the opportunity to have the
proper equipment when I photographed from the sidelines of my first NFL
game...I will make due with a shorter lens and a tele-converter...you would
have a tough time solving the problem they leave you with just before the
holidays.  To fall short of delivering an item is bad, but
it happens....to provide such poor customer service along the way is
deplorable....to be repeatedly dishonest and insulting on the phone and over
e-mail for 5 days is inexcusable.",Internet

I am going to spare you all the details and sum it up as fast as I can. Aside from the past issues we have deal with I will only tell you about a recent one. Simple Request to Integra Telecom:  Several day ago I requested to have one number call forward to another number so that calls would be picked up by our a phone tree on the system period. What happened: After explaining to the Integra Telecom rep (Cheri Baum) what needed to be done I thought she had a firm understanding. Well  she did not and created a DEAD END for all customers who called in SO when people called in they got the OLD phone tree that had extensions that she had canceled!!!! AND FOR 5 DAYS of business we did not receive any calls?!?! Being that we merged offices with another company and the phone was ringing for them we didnt think to much of it until emails started coming in with the completes. We soon realized that customers were unhappy and business was lost immediately I called my Integra Telcom rep Cheri and she actually blamed me for doing something to the phone tree she actually said you must have done something to the phone tree to create these issues and then said we are not the experts nor do we claim to be  That was really reassuring let me tell you, although this lady was nice she had absolutely no clue what she was doing they should use that recording for training of what NOT to say to customers. Lastly, If you are thinking about trying Integra because of some smooth talking sales guy sold you on the BS Savings I recommend that you think again. I DO NOT KNOW of one company who has been happy with Integra Telecom.  I dont see the savings but if it is there is savings, NO WAY it has made up for the money and time that has been lost having these guys as a telecom provider.

You, or someone with access to your credit card, performed a chargeback of which we were informed on September 24. Please contact your bank regarding the credit card you had on file with us and reverse the chargeback. -------- END EMAIL QUOTE ----------------- Their response of ""or someone with access to your DynDNS.com account""... seems a little more correct this time, but again they are assuming that it is still my credit card that was used. It was not. They still insist on me contacting a bank to reverse a charge back that I never initiated in the first place. Any access to my account for any purchases made in the last 6 months was and is at this point, unauthorized. The only remedy to this situation is not one that can possibly be done, because it involved actions by an unknown and unauthorized third party.I want my currently registered domains to be unlocked and transferred to another service provider. Their policy regarding charge backs does not take into consideration that accounts can be accessed fraudulently and their inability (or unwillingness) to investigate such unauthorized access is cause for serious security concerns. I have been a customer for DynDNS for several years and have never in the past encountered any billing problems, however until such policy is revised, I can not subject the security of my products to a company so grossly negligent.

I attempted to comply but my email program would not send the attachment. I immediately emailed the prize redemption dept. and Carly who is the Director of Customer Relations. 8 days and another email later, I received a response from Carly who stated they would not send my GC without receiving the release - supposedly to verify my mailing address. I explained again that I could not do so, and that I was going to file a BBB complaint if they didn't send me my GC. I told her it was the same as what was stipulated already on my account. She then sent me an email stating: ""Ill need you to reply to this e-mail confirming your address and that you agree to the terms and conditions outlined in the release form we sent you:""  I replied with the required information. She then sent an email stating: ""The gift card will be mailed next week."" This was on July 16.  I have saved all correspondence with her.  On August 10 I sent Carly an email stating I had still not received my GC. She did not respond. On August 12 I send another email inquiring about my GC. On August 13 she responded, stating that my GC had still not been sent because ""we have yet to receive your completed release form."" I sent her an email stating that wasn't true and attached the release AGAIN, as well as HER email to ME stating the GC would be sent. I have now sent her that 3 times, and she has not responded.

That was in August of 2009.I called Qwest today to cancel my DSL service as I absolutely had to have something faster than what I was working with and they could not provide me with a faster service (not to mention I was being charged $45 a month for 1.5Mbps that maybe got 700Kbps on a good day). I was informed that I was under a two year agreement with them until August of 2011 (even if I had agreed to the service agreement at the time, it still should have only been until March of 2011 at the latest, they extended the agreement at the time that I moved) and that it would be $200 to cancel it early.After spending 45 minutes on the phone with a representative, I was at least able to get them to acknowledge that they had indeed extended the contract. However they didn't even acknowledge that until I informed them that I had records showing the same account number as my current location that dated back to March/April of 2009. They refuse to prorate the early termination in any way (I would happily pay a prorated amount) on an agreement they deceptively entered me into.Consumer beware, if you are looking at Qwest for your Internet services, they are not clear that you are entering into a contract, and they show no willingness to compromise or work with a customer when you find out about such an agreement.",Internet

Carson City, Nevada *EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back into your bank account that someone wrongfully takes it from you!"," On 7/16/2010, I looked at my back account and I noticed a charge of $99.95, from a company called Platinum Services.  I do not know anything about this company.  I Have never given them permission to go into my checking account and take any money out. They have fraudulently went into my account and tok $99.95. So far, this has incured $60.00 worth of back fees. I also have more items coming into my account and so the ending result of the fees is unknown.  I did not get any help from my bank and the bank Space Coast Credit Union refused to close out my account.  I had another account that I asked them to transfer all the incoming charges to, but they refused, so I took all the money out.  I am not going to let any body steal my hard working money.  If the bank refuses to close out my account that it going to be their problem.  I want these people caught and I want them to pay with criminal charges. Aida Barr EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder RipoffReport.com Author of www.ripoffrevenge.comRip-off Report PO Box 310, Tempe, Arizona 85280 									",Internet

										In March my coworker purchased the Cricket Broadband modem from the nearest Cricket store. The promotion at the time was first month free, 45 a month and a rebate on the modem... He took the modem home and discovered over the first three weeks that he did not like the service he was receiving. He never had a strong signal, nor was his service fast. I told him I had thought about using the service, so he let me borrow the modem to use at my house, where dial-up was the standard. I took it home and where I live, being on the other side of town, had great service. I spoke with him about the service and buying the modem off of him. He told me that he had to check with Cricket. I went to the store where he bought the modem and spoke to their representative, Jim. He told me that Cricket Broadband was contract-less and that for me to use the modem all I would need is to put the automatic bill pay with my debit card.I thought it to be okay, so with my friend's permission, I switched over and began to use the account. A day later, I receive an email bill from Cricket stating that I was required to pay for the modem plus the ""next"" month's bill, coming to roughly 91 dollars. I told my friend and we both agreed to end the service, as there should have not been so high a fee.My friend went to the Cricket store and returned the modem and had the account deactivated. We thought things were over.Months pass, and since then I had gone paperless on my bank statements. I had received an ""account low"" email from my bank, so I went to them to check out why. I knew how much I was supposed to have, and it shouldn't have been below my threshold. I discovered that the day after the modem was returned, I was charged $91. Then for the two months after I was also charged, once 55 and the other 45. I went to find the Cricket store that I had gone to and it was no longer there. My friend went to the next Cricket store he found and they said there was no account remaining in his name and that my bank account had NOT been charged. He told them that yes, in fact, it had. They asserted to him that NO, they did not charge.My bank printed statements from where I was charged by CRICKET WIRELESS with their 800 number on it. I called them and their customer service lady, outsourced in India, told me that there was no account with his name. I gave her the account number and she told me that since it was not my name I could not do anything. I contacted the BBB and have been going back and forth with them, each time with them giving me the run-around. The latest response from them to the BBB states that my friend is the only authorized user of the account and that I cannot file a claim against them because the account is not in my name. I know it was not smart to believe them. I did not think a company like them would go out of their way to lie and steal. I guess I should have checked the BBB or Ripoff report first, huh...",Internet

However selected few, as well of yourself, made a contempt approach on this selective issue which left me in a state of displeasure with this community. A solution which leaves me to voluntarily suspend my presence from all threads so you may continue your personal services in a believed state of order.I bid you farewell.---------------Which the site owner proudly decided to go directly into the storage units of the website and attempt to harass the person though instant messenger since they were not able to do it though their own website.

Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action.

When realpages.com merged with yellowpages.com, my internet ad went from the top 2 ads on page one to page three because they combined all the the advertisers in the United States and the ones who paid the more than me were a priority. It took several months for them to correct that problem. It didn't make sense that it happened again when www.yellowpages.com merged with www.yp.com. Instead of me being in 3rd place for the last 6 months, I am on the lower right below the map. They think that's a better placement because they said it works for Google. Well I called them in the beginning of April because I noticed my phones have dipped drastically and when I looked on my online advertisement, then I saw why.  They said the the advertisers bought more points etc to be higher so in the middle of my campaign I get thrown down. I complained and the manager of my Salesperson said I will be placed back on top again within 10 to 14 days until the end of my contract and here 3 weeks later I am in the same position. I didn't advertise in 2008 because I was so upset with the realpages.com & yellowpage.com merger  and now its happened again. I want my money back for advertising with this company !!!!!!!!!!!Now my hands are tied because if I don't pay their bill, my phone will get discounted.  ",Internet

										I woke up this morning to learn that our Comcast internet service was out. This was most likely due to the storms that came through our area last night. Since we receive our dial tone through the internet, our home phone service was out as well. I used my cell phone to call Comcast to report the trouble. After some brief troubleshooting the technician said they will need to roll a truck. He then stated that he didn't have any appointments available to schedule, and I will need to call back after 9 a.m. This isn't the first time that I've heard this story from Comcast. I am in disbelief that a company the size of Comcast, after confirming there is a service problem thinks that I need to call back because at the present time, they can't schedule a service call for me. Seriously?? How about logging my call, and calling me back when you have the time scheduled? Perhaps I don't want to call back and wait another 45 minutes on hold only to learn that you still don't have an appointment available to schedule? This is crazy and ridiculous. ",Internet

I hope this is helpful in your decision making for anyone looking for fast cash on the internet when you are in a hard spot for money. Thanks. EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action.

										This website at first seems to be a sure-proof, friendly role playing site as it was brought attention to me by a couple of ""victims."" I wasn't exactly sure how they could have been victims by people other then trolls, but apparently the majority of this website is not only trolls, but the owner of the website itself will use the personal information that you use to registered for the site against you directly. I had to fish myself into the dog-pit to see exactly what was going on, and the last couple weeks, the owner himself has been hassling everybody on that website. Unless you want to set yourself up for blackmail, I suggest you not join this website, and spread the word of possible identity-theft if you do register. The word of the mouth is stronger then the hand of hate.Here are a few of their selected harassment notices that myself and others have received. They had asked to remain anonymous, and comments may contain statements over PG13 ratings.================You and your wife are embarrassing piles of scum. Who calls themselves a ""professional role player""? LMFAO. Gosuck off your wife's bulging scrotum.================Sorry you're a giant faggot who couldn't survive here. Go somewhere easier on you, maybe a good kiddie site.================One of the messages that was brought o my attention was that someone had sent a message directly to the site owner, which read as followed:---------------I was well aware of your efforts of extrapolating the profiles just moments prior of your notice. However selected few, as well of yourself, made a contempt approach on this selective issue which left me in a state of displeasure with this community. A solution which leaves me to voluntarily suspend my presence from all threads so you may continue your personal services in a believed state of order.I bid you farewell.---------------Which the site owner proudly decided to go directly into the storage units of the website and attempt to harass the person though instant messenger since they were not able to do it though their own website. Kind of sad considering that this website is owned by young adults that act as though they never went past the third grade.Do not join this website, and spread the word of it before it is to late.

When realpages.com merged with yellowpages.com, my internet ad went from the top 2 ads on page one to page three because they combined all the the advertisers in the United States and the ones who paid the more than me were a priority. It took several months for them to correct that problem. It didn't make sense that it happened again when www.yellowpages.com merged with www.yp.com. Instead of me being in 3rd place for the last 6 months, I am on the lower right below the map. They think that's a better placement because they said it works for Google. Well I called them in the beginning of April because I noticed my phones have dipped drastically and when I looked on my online advertisement, then I saw why.  They said the the advertisers bought more points etc to be higher so in the middle of my campaign I get thrown down. I complained and the manager of my Salesperson said I will be placed back on top again within 10 to 14 days until the end of my contract and here 3 weeks later I am in the same position. I didn't advertise in 2008 because I was so upset with the realpages.com & yellowpage.com merger  and now its happened again.

										I woke up this morning to learn that our Comcast internet service was out. This was most likely due to the storms that came through our area last night. Since we receive our dial tone through the internet, our home phone service was out as well. I used my cell phone to call Comcast to report the trouble. After some brief troubleshooting the technician said they will need to roll a truck. He then stated that he didn't have any appointments available to schedule, and I will need to call back after 9 a.m. This isn't the first time that I've heard this story from Comcast. I am in disbelief that a company the size of Comcast, after confirming there is a service problem thinks that I need to call back because at the present time, they can't schedule a service call for me. Seriously?? How about logging my call, and calling me back when you have the time scheduled? Perhaps I don't want to call back and wait another 45 minutes on hold only to learn that you still don't have an appointment available to schedule? This is crazy and ridiculous. ",Internet

Well when  went to log on the next day,  I couldn't.  When you set up the account you are issued an alpha-numeric password that you cannot change, the info is sent to you in a conformation e-mail.  I got on the site that night and looked around most of the auctions ended the next day so I figured I would hop on right before they ended to bid.  When I went to retrieve the password from the email message, the message was gone and I did not delete it.  When you click on the ""forgot my password"" button it doesn't offer to send you your password via email like most sites do.  They give you a number to call, but it leads nowhere.  It was at this point when I did a little digging and found that others have made the same mistake I have, and thats when I found this site.",Internet

										I called BrightHouse to come out and do an internet install in my mobile home. The tech that shows up is from Knight Enterprise his name is Robert strange. He asks if he can do the install in the back of the home and I tell him that the only thing back there is a bathroom and my sons room and I would like it in the front where my office is. He somewhat gets upset and argues with me for a minute and then finally agrees to do the install where I need it to be. He asks me how my roof is and I say we do not want anyone on our roof. He says OK and I go inside. I then hear him stomping on my roof. ""I coudn't freakin believe this!"" I was busy at that moment so I ask my wife to go out and tell the tech to get off of the roof right now. She does and comes back and says he did get off the roof and almost hit our 4 year old son with his ladder.So he leaves and I go into my office and there is a huge mess where he drilled a hole smack dab in the front middle of our home and left the mess for us to clean up. [continued below]....
									
										..... I couldn't believe it. Well a couple days go by and it is raining and there are multiple leaks in my office and den.We never had a leak before this. So I call Bright house as it is raining in my house and ask them who is going to come out and repair my house so they send out Knight enterprise to talk to me about what happened. I tell them that their tech walked on my roof and caused damage so bad that I have multiple leaks. I said I would like it repaired he asks what else is damaged I mention that my printer was ruined and my rug was soaked and my wife desks and books are ruined. He says they have a repair guy that they can send out to look at the roof and repair it for us. Then he asked if we might want to settle for maybe $300-500 dollars I say no because I'm not sure what the extent of the damage is and I need to have it repaired. He then threatens me by saying that the techs have a million dollar insurance each but the insurance company will probably deny me a penny. So I tell him if they do I am more than willing to seek legal help from an attorney and he continues to say that they have attorneys to they have many attorneys he says with a snicker. So I tell him look I have 3 small children and my home is being ruined after every rain I just want the damage the tech caused repaired. So come to find out the so called repair guy that came out to look at the damage was there to asses the roof in any way to make them not guilty for what the tech did he went back and told them there was no damage from their tech and they had an insurance guy come over Jeff Dumbrowski from Auto owners insurance company 727-530-5461 ext 11 he says I'm going to be honest with you my tech denies being on your roof and it is so old you don't have a case I'm not doing anything further with this. Now keep in mind that Brighthouse and Knight Enterprise is taking the word of their tech Robert Strange who I did a background check and come to find out he is a criminal and an alcoholic he has criminal charges for Trespassing,DUI and Resisting arrest with violence and he has done time in a correctional facility and they are taking his word over mine and my wifes can you say Credibility? So my only question at this point is which one of these people told Mr Strange to deny being on the roof. So the story goes on after this I call Bright house and say look you sent Knight to my house it is not my responsibility to deal with them I called you and you sent a criminal/Drunk from some other company out to my house and he damaged it how are you going to take care of it So I talk to Candace a supervisor who says she will have Ricco from quality control call me in 25 minutes and then do a follow up to see how things went. Needless to say I got no call and 3 days later I call bright house again and ask for another supervisor i get Angie who says she will have someone from their we care department call me and again no call back with no surprise an obvious run around. So I call their quality control Department and the department of the president and they say that Jack Bennett from their construction department says they did not do the damage so they will do nothing more with my claim. I have contacted the BBB and consumer affairs as well as 8 on your side with no avail I have contacted an attorney from legal aid who could not help me (No attorneys are in this field of knowledge they are all injury). Now keep in mind I have had 2 roofers come out and 2 roofers say that there is new damage and footprints on my roof that has caused the damage also keep in mind that this roof is a carport with an addition built under it and no one in their right mind would walk on it and Bright house is even adding this to their defense saying that their protocol is to use a PVC pole to run wires over houses and their trained tech is not stupid enough to walk on this kind of roof or any roof for that matter. I will not stop until justice is done in my case and I will and have now made myself available to anyone who wants to team up with issues they have had or are having with Brighthouse networks and Knight enterprise.

They withdrew money out of my bank account for some online credit for purchases. the lady at the call center said I applied for it. Even though, I told her at the call center I did not apply for this and their were two withdrawal of $99.45 from my account. She said she could give me $99.45 back if I keep the other account open. When I told her no she said their no refund of my money because I refuse to keep one on the account. This is something I did not apply for and do not want. The only thing they could do is just cancel the account. I had to cancel my bank account because I think they will try again even though they said the accounts are closed and cancelled. I want this company to be investigated and I thinktheir main location could be in another country. Yes one more thing, Their never a supervisor available. EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder RipoffReport.com Author of www.ripoffrevenge.comRip-off Report PO Box 310, Tempe, Arizona 85280 									",Internet

HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action.

So I listed approximately 1,000 items on eBay and after selling 4-5 in the first couple days, I went to process the orders only to find out that DOBA had set the default shipping at $4!

So I don't know what to do to stop them from Rosa EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account. Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E. According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far. Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done. Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute. Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything! Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com. And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site! If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site! Either way, be persistent! DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state. Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get. And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge! But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state. Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was. Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away. In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge. In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges. If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here. Remember Don't let them get away with it! Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!

										I work for a major online media company and we handle the online advertising for thousands of clients.  Not once have I ever dealt with a situation or a customer like Chris from Dow Superstore Inc., aka www.dowsuperstore.com.  This company illegally and fraudulently paid us for advertising using a pay pal account.  I want to warn other media outlets and buyers about this comapny.  Pay Pal told us that we should should press criminal charges so we are.  In the mean time, if you are allowing this company to advertise or if you are buying from them, beware because they are scam artisits.  Dow Superstore paid JP Commnications Inc for advertising through pay pal. Pay pall released the funds into our account and we processed the funds to Dow's account.  We gave Dow Superstore Inc. $1,000 in pay per click funds and we started designing an email for them which cost $800.  Services were
given to Dow.A few days later, Pay Pal took money out of our account telling us that
Dow was a fraud company and that they did not have any funds in their account. 
On July 9, 2009, Dow emailed my company and told me that he sent us
$1800 for advertising on Top Ten Wholesale and for our company to
design and send an email. Pay Pal cleared the funds and we added $1,000
to his pay per click account and spent hours designing and testing out
the email he paid $800 for. 2-3 days later, Pay Pal took the $1800 out
of our account and said that the payment Dow sent us was a fraudulent
payment. I contacted Dow, and Chris told me it was an error. He then
told me that he would have the funds to us shortly and never paid. On
August 21st, 2009, Chris told me that he would send us a check for the
advertising seeing as that he already used the funds up. Dow never sent
the check and he owes JP Communications $1800 for PPC funds spent and
time spent on designing, coding, and testing email.I have had multiple conversations with Chris Dow and one conversation with Jimmy.  They both pretended that it was an error and that they would have the funds back to me.  On August 21, 2009, I called Chris Dow from www.dowsuperstore.com and he finally picked up the phone.  He told me that he would send me a check for $1,000 to start making good on his bill.  I was at trade shows most of the month of August and returned on Sept. 2.  Dow Superstore did not send the check.  It does not take more than 5 business days for a check to get mailed.  If anyone is interested in learning more, I have saved all our email contacts so I can prove to you that the owners and others staff memebers at Dow Superstore Inc. are liars and scam arisits.  Here are just some of the email conversations between Chris Dow and myself:I will call you monday afternoon.   On 8/14/09, Jonathan wrote: Hello Chris.

Anyway, long story short I called Easy White had them to cancele ALL and EVRYTHING with them, rep could not refund full amount ($78) but could rece it to $24 or send me other things, I did not agree with either offer and told him that I will dispute with my bank and report this. Dazzle white on the other hand could not do any refund ($89) but instead showered me with offers of other products which I did not even know what they are, of course I did not agree with them either and told them same thing as other company. Both companies were claiming that I'm out of trial period, which was not same anywhere. One place indicates 10 days other 7days some other 15 days who knows. On top of that it starts day you order. Next step, I informed in writting, via e-mail, both companies, that I will be disputing transaction and reporting them. Easy White responded back to me with e-mail stating they will do full refund and do no further charges, I can keep product as their gift to me, and to alow them 2-3 business days for processing, and they DID what they said. Yes, I did go through some hoops but so far I'm ok with how they handeled it. Dazzle White is different story. As I did as I said. I called my bank to dispute transation and lady that I spoke, after I explained what's going on, said go ahead and send product back or what's left of it back to them, alow them 60 days for refund if they don't we will take next step. I did not know where to send it back, so I called cus. ser. # provided. Rep. pulled my acct. and started in same way as the other rep I called first time (terms& conditions bla, bla) I told ther that I'm simply calling to obtain address and all other necessary information to return their product as advised by my bank and that I will not talk about anything else anymore. She provided me with RMA # and address where it's going. We'll see what happens next and if I will get refund. Even if I end up getting refund for Dazzle White I will still be upset for all this time used and all this hassle on top of paying for S&H for something that I could not even use. Absolute waste of time and money. I also noted, since I have been visiting ""mom's story"" page often and diging, pages that you're linked to from that page are changing consistantly and so is name of the product that they are offering.

										Dear rip-off repoters,
My credit card number was taken and used to access a nudity sight on the internet (BLASTH.com).  I found this out on my monthly bank statements.  I called the company on this right after I noticed it.  That was sometime in late Dec. or early Jan.
I am owed for two months of billing (120.00)and have been repeatedly told that I would see the credit at the end of the month.  That was for two months, Jan. and Feb.
I do not know what else that you need, but I hope that you can help.  Again, the internet sight is "" BLASTH.COM "" and I guess that the parent company is "" CURIOUS TV.COM "".  The bottom line is my credit card and I got screwed by a porn sight and we did not even enjoy it.  Secondly, I want my money back.
Also, please note that this is not a case of carelessness on my part.  The only time that I used my card on the internet was to sign-up for an internet provider.
Please contact me if there is anything else I can give you to help get these people to do what they said they would do.

										In late February, I purchased a Compaq Presario computer.  When I installed the computer, I read that MCI WorldCom offered a ""three month trial membership"" for internet service for $9.95 per month.  I gave MCI my credit card number.  The internet service was started.  I recieved a bill about two weeks later for over $150.00!  They hadn't bothered to note in their offer that there was  ""$5.99 per hour"" access fee to get their internet service.  It was a 799-xxxx number, which is a local access number here in Lewiston.  Evidently theirs was not a local number, although all that showed on the ""connect"" screen was the 799-xxxx.  I immediately cancelled the internet service, mainly because my credit card rejected the charge.  I started receiving telephone collection calls from MCI WorldCom - every night until I threatened them with legal action.  They also called after 9:00 p.m at night - which is against the law.  I set up an agreement with them to pay $25.00 per month - which I have made two payments.

e-bay,"  e-bay  2005 Hamilton Ave. # 350 
San Jose, California U.S.A. ",,408 369 4830,e-Bay .. not who they say they are .. ongoing IFCC investigation,"
										I am writing concerning a certain company that I feel NEEDS some SERIOUS investigating done into their policies and procedures and also their accounts receivable. The company E-Bay whom I was a registered member of has a policy in which you have to give a credit card or bank card number in order to sell products on their auction site. 
There have been numerous reports to this company from all over the world from registered members as to certain people that are taking money from them for won auctions and either not supplying the products at all or sending Fakes in place. E-Bay only suspends the user name from their auction site but HAS to know when the frauds make a new name and use the same bank account numbers or the same credit card number. 
E-Bay also has the responsibility to inform buyers of this information and warn them NOT to send money to the no longer registered members. They DO NOT do this. It is strictly by luck that a few people such as myself warn others whom have won items not to follow through in sending money. I would also like to make note that as I said earlier I WAS a registered member with e-bay. A certain individual by the name of KARL has suspended me for what he claims is I have given false contact information. I have NOT! I have an ongoing case registered with the IFCC. Case number I00071211587844. This case was begun over a certain ring in Pasadena whom are taking people's money and not fulfilling the product or sending fakes. 
I have been in contact with many people over this same ring and I went through the proper channels of E-Bay's so called investigation team. This ring is still operating and still selling under e-bay using different names but still the same address for payment. I have listed this ring and the address in the bad traders list. 
Right after I filed the case with E-Bay and the IFCC, at that time I had my UNPUBLISHED PRIVATE home phone number listed in the e-bay registry. I began to get calls in all hours of the night from this Lisa Baker making threats and indecent comments. My children can no longer answer the phone now for fear it is the harassment group again. So I changed the registration information in E-Bays contact info and gave my pager number. My pager can except phone numbers OR messages. My address did not change in the registration information. My daughter's name whom she is an Officer is listed now in place of mine. But again, the address is the same. In any event, this KARL without leaving a 
message on my pager or without sending a letter to my physical address pulled me from being a registered member now and contacted others and informed them that I was no longer a registered member. 
I had before I was suspended from e-bay under this name made another name and used it to investigate this ring again. I found another user name whom gives the same address to request money 
for items and I forwarded that information to E-Bay and to the IFCC under my case number. E-Bay did nothing. This person is still selling under that name and is making quite a living I might ad at taking consumers money. 
I had the other registered name for 3 days when once I sent the information to them all of a sudden I get a warning from e-bay stating again that they were going to suspend me for inaccurate contact information. I wrote them back requesting that they pull my registration and suspend it. I told them that they were 
embarrassed by the fact that I found out more on this group than they have and quite frankly they don't care to as they are collecting quite a bit of money for this group to list the numerous items on their site. 
The IFCC has all of my information on that account and the findings along with it. There are several points I would like to point out. But I think that I have been wrongly accused as I have given all accurate information in their contact form and yet they suspend me KNOWING there is an ongoing IFCC 
investigation going. They did it not once but twice and for the same reasons. 
Granted under the alias I used the second time to catch this group I wasn't stupid enough to give my real identity knowing that this group would find out it was me. 
Also let it be noted that E-bay is so interested in the registered members giving ALL accurate CONTACT information on themselves but yet E-Bay doesn't return the same. The public number that is listed for E-Bay has been disconnected.  Ebay Incorporated, 2005 Hamilton Ave. #350, San Jose CA Tel:408 369 4830. I have another number for a Mr. Brandon or Mark whom work in investigations at E-Bay and I called it to see if he could possibly look into the matter that is on file with the IFCC case number I00071211587844. He was not concerned at all with the fraud that was taking place on the E-Bay site. His concern was how did I get his phone number. when I refused to divulge how I 
got his number his reply to me was he works in investigations, not fraud. 
It is also my understanding that we do NOT have to be forced into giving out our Private Unpublished phone numbers as they are trying to do here. I was also under the impression that any business that is legit is to supply a public phone number for contact by the consumer. Personally it is now my belief that 
I have been suspended from E-Bay because I am too close to something bigger than the ring in Pasadena. E-Bay leaves a lot to be desired as far as taking care of it's consumers and with their own contact information. 
It looks to me with all the money they have from collecting of these fees for sell items in their auction site that they would have an automative way to catch the same address and bank card information on a potential seller and their so called 
investigation team could research it if it is kicked out to verify that this particular account number has been used by a now suspended seller and protect the buyers on their site. It also looks to me that they could WARN the already won buyers of a persons suspension before the unexpecting buyer sends 
money to that seller. And considering that I have been harassed by this ring in which I am bound and determined to make sure has a day in a FEDERAL court, I don't feel I should be suspended for not giving and making public my Unlisted private home phone number. 
If this Karl had done his job thoroughly he would have found that I do in fact live at this address: 4461 Green Creek 
Memphis, TN 38125 and that the pager number is in fact mine 901-533-0789. I have my house note and my utility bills along with my pager bill to confirm all of this information. I have also received numerous won items from sellers on E-Bay and I have a Perfect feedback. 
This KARL employee of E-Bay did not even bother to check with the sellers whom have left me a positive feedback to see if I have given accurate information. I am going to send you a copy of the e-mails I received from this KARL. And also a copy that there is in fact an ongoing Investigation with the IFCC as I send you a copy of their reply to me and my case number. I URGE you to look into the records of E-Bay as a company and their collections and the records of the people selling and that 
have been suspended under different names for reports filed against them for fraud. I have several reports that I would be more than happy to share for the asking. But I refuse to give E-Bay anything else. I personally feel they are and should be held as accessories to the fact for allowing this kind of thing to continue and by making a business out of collecting fees from those without thoroughly checking them out as sellers before allowing them on their auction site. I also URGE you and beg that you look into their procedures as to giving out private phone numbers. 
And the fact that they themselves have NO registered CONTACT information for the consumers. I thank you for looking 
into this matter as our world becomes more and more Internet. It is easy to take advantage of people on the net. Our president signed the E-Bill but we first have to look into these kinds of companies that not only allow fraud on their site by collecting fees from sellers without thoroughly researching them through their bank cards or credit cards given to collect their fees but 
also these companies that demand what they DON'T themselves give. 
A working Contact phone number. I personally feel it is against my rights to be forced into giving private information in order to join an auction ring or any other type of organization. To me that is discrimination.  Thank you for your time. I will send the e-mails I received from this E-Bay's employee KARL and a copy of my case with the IFCC and the pertinent information that may help you.

Owings Mills, Maryland U.S.A. ",,410.356.2000,Poetry.com nearly ripped me off as well.,"
										January 2001 - I spent many hours working on a poem and came across poetry.com.  Not knowing what I now know about this unethical company, I submitted my poem to enter their sweepstakes. After several weeks, I was notified by mail that I was a semi-finalist and much closer to receiving the myriad of prizes displayed on their web site!! I was so excited as I was just starting out writing poetry and never expected to be recognized for my talent (or lack thereof!). I called up my friends and family to tell them the good news.
After a few weeks I got another letter in the mail congratulating me and offering the opportunity to purchase ""The Silence Within"", the anthology my poem was featured in for ~$57... supposedly a greatly discounted price from the post-publishing date. My mouth drooled and I promptly sent in the order form...
6 months later I have received nothing, and believe it or not I completely forgot about the anthology until I read a complaint on here about poetry.com. I checked my card statements and was reminded... so I decided to e-mail them. 
They were rather unprofessional and sarcastic in their e-mail. Their web site stated the release date for ""The Silence Within"" is 6/1/01 and that it would be shipped 3-5 weeks later. I was informed that ""The Silence Within"" was a ""working title"" and that my poem would no longer be featured in that book, however, it would be shipped July 21, 2001 in a different book called ""The World Awaits"". I e-mailed them back asking why this happened, and what was to stop them from switching the anthology my poem would appear in the future? They did not answer this question, but instead offered to refund my money if when I received the anthology I was not satisfied.
Since I did not want to wait another 3 months to receive my anthology I told them to refund my money, to which they agreed to. About a week later I got an e-mail from them saying ""Sorry, your anthology is near it's ship date and we cannot stop shipment at this point. Please return your anthology and you will be issued your refund"". 
I was furious. I sent them another e-mail indicating that they had assured me the refund would be issued, made mo mention of any delays in acquiring that refund, nor anything about the ship date being too close.. and I told them I refused to believe they couldn't stop shipment 1 MONTH ahead of the actual release date. I did this in the calmest of manners, as I believe that being profane or rude achieves nothing. I was firm and I told them legal action would not be out of the question if they did not credit my account within 30 days of the day they initially agreed to do so (per Mastercard regulations). 
They sent a smart reply back saying ""Thank you for your kind response. Your refund will be issued shortly"".
And you know what? IT WAS!!! I was amazed.. but if only I knew what I now know about poetry.com, I wouldn't have had to go through this frustration. And had I not requested a refund, I wonder how many more books my poem would have been switched to.. I see I am not alone in having this happen to me. This company may not be doing anything illegal, but it SURE IS UNETHICAL. Telling people they are a select few chosen as semifinalists and publishing EVERY poem they receive is, if not fraud, definitely a pond-scum-like thing to do.
20/20 and abcnews have both done reports on poetry.com (AKA International Library of Poetry). Also, check out this web site.. it has a screen shot of a guy who posted his poetry.com rant demanding a refund and it got posted to their web site! It's pretty funny.. you can post anything there and it will get posted to their web site along with the copyright notice and everything, and you will be sent a notice saying you have been selected as a semi-finalist too.

When I called they said they could not reimburse me! I sent a letter to the president of the company recipt requested. Never heard from them.
Went through the BBB and they totally blew them off too. So they took me for about $150. I dropped them of course and got a mailing today they want me back! Guess they are aiming for $200.									",Internet

Greg responds and said Im sorry for this but sometimes this happens and I will send refund right out. 
on Dec20 no refund no e-mail answer, on Dec 23sent email asking If there was a problem because they are located in New Jersey and I am across the bridge in New York no responce.

										About 6 months ago my Visa was charged online for sports wagering at Fairdealsports.

I still have all the emails and the IP information that he sent me, with shows the proof of his crimes being committed for the same amounts of money charged to my visa from him.  I contacted AOL about him, but they never reply in the least about this scammer.

										This company hires work at home employees /contractors. Anyone wanting a position with this company has to pay 10.00.You have to go through there endless hours of training and when you are done with training you are promised to be put with one of their client companies doing data processing and clerical work.
After the long process of typing ads all over the internet and people paying the 10.00 fee then you go to one of their client companies.But you will be doing the same thing you were doing with the previous company just taking less money from potential employees/contractors and you are paid less if at all.
This chain of companies are very misleading.They do not give you a data processing job they simply have you go spread your name and email address all over the internet looking for employees and taking their money.
You are never placed with a real work at home position it is a circle of you taking money from others that want to work at home, nothing more.I have been scammed and mislead.
As of today I still not yet have been paid,American secretarial has informed me that I will be paid soon I doubt it.
This type of work at home employment is a total scam and the only way you make a dime is if you get others to pay.I should of stuck to what I always believed in and that was NEVER pay for a work at home position and I did and got screwed.
Now I have no job,and no income comming in.I give up on working at home and will be seeking employment out of my house when my kids start school.It is a shame because 80% of the people that apply at this company are moms wanting to stay at home with their kids.

										I am very disappointed with Comcast High Speed internet service. For the past month as they have transitioned from @ Home to Comcast I have had nothing but problems.  It is difficult to ever reach a customer service rep and when you do they often are unable to help or simply put you on hold again to transfer you somewhere else.  I have spent the past month trying to resolve problems with them with no success.  They refuse to schedule a technician to come to my home.
I have been unable to receive e-mail for the past week now.
However their bills always come on time.  
I transitioned to this service for quicker connection to the internet.  I transitioned from AOL and swapped quality for speed. Now I am paying over $50 per month for internet service that only works half the time. I have lost address books, files and never received countless emails because of the poor service of this company.  I wish I could tell them to go to hell but they don't answer the phone.

										While balancing my accounts, I noticed a billing for $9.98 charged by Eldorado Sales five times from 11/06/01 through 03/08/02, which is the last statement I have available, so I suspect there are additional charges that I'm not even aware of yet. 
Neither me nor my husband have any clue who this company is or what on earth they are charging us for. Since today is Sunday, I could not even contact the bank to identify the company and was finally able to do so by doing a reverse lookup of the partial phone number listed on the statement. 
Understand that my husband and I are not novice Internet users and that we regularly do business with respectable online companies whose trust and service we cherish, however, in all cases, we know exactly what we purchase and from whom and look forward to receiving something we value in return for our hard earned money. 
Although I plan to take further action with the bank first thing Monday, while attempting to research the issue, I ran across the ripoff report site and since I believe I am a victim of this outrageous practice, I felt compelled to respond.

AGM international,"  AGM international  Israel 
Jerusalem, Israel U.S.A. ",,011-97226792959,AGM international ripoff fraudulent ripoff business ripped off and scammed screwed others too jerusalum Other,"
										MY EXPERIENCE WITH AGM INTERNATIONAL First of all, Id like to thank Overture for letting me list this page in their search engine, because I know its keeping a lot of people from being ripped off. I only wish I found another like this one, when I did a search on AGM before I joined. 
My name is Steven Bennett and I have NOTHING to sell you. I am not using AGMs name to sell you some other lame get rich quick sceme! I am paying for this webpage Mostly out of my own pocket, because a CRIME has been commited against me and many others. My ONLY motivation for writing and publishing this webpage is to try to keep others from being taken.  
AGM has basically STOLEN $2000 dollars from me. Their site is money4u.net It is a very slick very compelling website, but don't be fooled, this program is nothing but a SCAM! The owner calls himself ""Mark Bennet"" and he lives in Israel. Their so called ""business packages"" cost anywhere from $1,250 to $45,000. They offer an income guarentee of $12,000 to $200,000 per year, and they also guarantee sales will be made on your behalf (to give you the illusion that you will recoop your investment right away) and they said they made 3 for me but I was NEVER paid for them.
  I know for a fact that three of the people they have on their website as testimonials , Kim Henson (888) 249 7040, Edwin Garcia (888) 249 7041 and Simon Hill, have actually left the program years ago, when they were ripped off by this scam artist. I know this because I have spoken with them myself. AGM insists on leaving their testimonials on the site, with phony e-mail addresses. When people E-mail them for information, they have imposters (or Mark Bennet himself) reply on their behalf AND LIE ON THEIR BEHALF. Michael Boyd is actually a testimonial AGM copied and pasted from the Herbalife website! As far as all the big name merchants they claim you can sell for with your very own ""internet mall"" , I called the corporate headquarters for Macys, Bloomingdale's and Dell, and they said they have NOTHING to do with AGM.  AGM just puts their links on their website to make them look legit (which is one of the reasons I joined). Another reason I fell for this scam is because it seemed like the perfect work at home opportunity. I emailed all the testimonials and they all praised the program. I would later find out (after speaking with Edwin Garcia and Kim Henson) that imposters (or Mark Bennet himself) were returning my emails, and not the people on the testimonials page. Also Mark Bennet was calling me every day from Israel and telling me how well I would be doing with the program, and that if it didn't work out, I could just get a refund. 
When you wire your money to his bank, you receive access to an online workshop (click HERE to see the online work shop, my username is r10229/password is u1409uzt. go ahead and take a look) where you download pages to edit and submit to all the search engines. By the time you realize you have been taken, you have helped this scam artist ripoff 10 to 25 more people by mass marketing his bogus websites. I hate to admit it, but he has set himself up with a scam so self sufficient, it runs on ""autopilot"". He basically sits back and has all his victims spread his business around the web like a virus! I believe this is why my website is still up TO THIS DAY, even after I expressed my DISGUST with his program. It must be making him money, cause God knows, I'm not making a dime from it! (just a lot of spam!) At first their online support seems ok (Email only cause there is NO phone help). But as soon as you go beyond the normal request for help, they cutoff all support, and leave you hanging. I believe there is no other person answering the emails accept the owner himself. He portrays his company as this big global operation, and it does have global reach, but I believe this is just some lowlife sitting behind his computer in Israel taking in money from people all over the world. He also has an answering service in Montana he uses as a front to make people think he has offices in the states. I also believe he has many aliases such as the ones you see on ""live help""such as ""jennifer"" or ""dan"". When you chat with someone on live help, I believe your speaking with the owner himself, cause every time I try to make contact with him he HANGS UP!! The ONLY time this scumbag can be contacted by telephone is if you pretend you are a prospect, and fill out this form . When you do he will call you back almost INSTANTLY and try to sign you up! Go ahead and fill it out and you will see what I mean! 
  When I stumbled across this webpage and that's where the trouble began. Naturally I became alarmed when I read this page full of people who had been taken for millions by this con artist, so I decided to try and get my money back as quickly as I could. I called my bank and tried to get the money transfer recalled, but it was too late. Of course the only payment this prediter will accept is a bank transfer, because he knows one can always reverse the charges on a credit card if they get stiffed, not so with a bank transfer. I made countless phone calls, but my messages were never returned. I sent many emails and finally I got them to agree to give me my money back. They said it would be wired back into my account on 4/1/2002, of course it was not. I've sent countless emails inquires to every department listed on the website about my refund, and they have all been ignored.
If you would like to get more information I not only welcome you to contact me, I encourage it. I will even pay for the call. Why? I don't want to see another person throw their hard earned money at this scam artist, and never see it again. Also maybe someone knows a way to STOP this thief from stealing from innocent people and CLOSE HIS SITES DOWN! 
   In closing, Id like to thank all of you who have come foward after reading this page to tell me of thier horror stories with  AGM, and those who contacted me that were going to join,but decided not to after reading this page. Im glad to hear my website prevented you from getting ripped off. If we keep the complaints flowing into the FTC, and Attorney Generals office, HOPEFULLY we can STOP this crimminal from stealing from innocent people who just want a better life. Unfortunatly, we will probably NEVER see justice done or see our investments of MILLIONS ever again. Id be happy just to see his sites closed.
Thank You,

Newburgh, New York U.S.A. ",,203-595-8255,"NSS Magazines & Synapse Group. Unauthorized Charges to Debit Card - BEWARE Possible Resolution. Newburgh, NY","
										This organization made charges for 3 magazines to my debit account. Not only have I not received these magazines, I have not received the now famous ""cards in the mail"" for me to cancel them. Obviously, having not received the magazines, I wasn't aware I needed to cancel a subscription which I had not placed. 
I called the organization at: the number my bank gave me 1-800-920-3667 and cancelled the magazines on the automated system. Later, wanting to check on the validity of the cancellation, I called another number 1-800-205-9198. I received the automated message. However, after dialing 0 several times, it finally turned me over to an operator (after warning me there ""might be a long wait"". The ""long wait"" turned out to be about 4 seconds. 
I spoke to two separate women there who were friendly and did *not* try to sell me other magazines. Their names were Sharon Anderson and Lena Rhodes. After talking with them to be sure that the orders had been cancelled, I was assured that my debit card would be credited within 1-2 months. I was pleasantly surprised to see the credits this morning - 2 days later.
Unfortunately, these 3 unauthorized charges caused my account to be overdrawn. My bank refuses to reverse the charges, so I called the 2nd number again to ask about reimbursement. I spoke with a young woman named Keesha who took the information, including the amounts of the overdraft fees, and said I would either be reimbursed within 1-5 business days or that a customer service person would call if there were any questions re: amounts, etc. I'm not holding my breath on getting this money back, however. 
I'll update when and if I receive reimbursement of the overdraft  fees.

										I, too, have received a bill from this despicable company! Here's the short version... My address appeared on the bill, but the phone number was not mine. In addition, I checked my computer and no files appear to have been downloaded. I started investigating this bill this morning and have learned the following: (1) the number on the bill is registered in another couples' name -- 
I called them and they appear to be innocent bystanders, but may have been the ones who actually (mistakenly) logged onto to the website; 
(2) for some reason, Verizon long-distance has my name registered at the number on the bill; after three calls to Verizon, it was determined that Verizon uses an outside company for certain Toll Inquiries (i.e. directory look-up services) and for some reason, my name is associated with the number that appeared on the Alyon bill. (My hunch is that Alyon uses the same service as Verizon to find addresses to send out its bill; therefore, if this directory services company has a lot of mistakes, this would explain all the incorrect bills.) 
(3) Verizon is going to call me back after they investigate why my name is associated with the incorrect number; 
(4) thanks to the rip-off report, i was able to find the Secaucus, N.J. number for Alyon and spoke to a customer service representative (by this time I had been on the phone for 3 hours and was late for work, so I was less than cordial;); 
(5) Verizon is sending me a letter saying that the phone number on the bill is not my phone number and the Alyon customer service representative said to forward this letter to the Norcross, GA address. 
Needless to say, this is complete bullshit and I am wondering whether anyone here would be interested in contacting an attorney in Secaucus, N.J. about beginning a class action suit against Alyon. Although some states require the Attorney General to enforce consumer protection matters, other states allow consumers to hire attorneys themselves. We might be able to convince an attorney to take the matter on contingency. Some problems might be: 
(1) is this company really based in N.J. and does it have any assets there? 
(2) there appears to be at least two types of complaints: 
(a) people, like me, who didn't even have the service downloaded, but somehow got erroneous bills; and
(b) people, who, through no fault of their own, had the software downloaded and who were then billed for services. 
It may be that both claims may have merit under some NJ comsumer protection statute. Nevertheless, I am not using my real name here because this whole incident has made me a little paranoid about the internet, and I simply want to be through with it. However, if there is interest in a class action suit, I would consider joining it.
Also, I want to commend ""Gregory"" and others for the excellent work in putting together a checklist for others to follow.  After getting called a fool by Rip Off report creater, Ed Magdenson, I decided to post my complaint under my real name! 
I would be particularyly interested in hearing from anyone who, like me, received a bill with their address, but a different phone number.  (For example, in my case, I was in another state on the day (December 26) that Alyon claims the call was made.)
As of Jan. 8, I am still waiting for my letter from Verizon, but I mailed a letter to the Norcross, Georgia address today to: (1) dispute the charges, (2) inform Alyon that another letter is coming; and (3) inform Alyon that I will be charging them for the time and effort that it took me to resolve this claim.  I plan on sending Alyon an invoice with my letter from Verizon.  I hope to post copies of these letters in the coming days.
Finally, I'd also like to hear from anyone else who has called Alyon customer service at the N.J. address/number.  Many/most of the reports here state that the individual could not contact Alyon, but I had relatively little difficulty reaching them yesterday morning at the 201-865-7600.  Also, if anyone has gotten a response from the FTC, Attorney General, Mayor of Norcross, etc., I would appreciate seeing a copy.

										INTERNET USERS BEWARE!!
Approximately One Year ago, I subscribed for a Three (3) Month period to Ancestry.com via the Internet, as my Mother and Grandmother wanted me to do some checking on our family history.  Because I had ""heard"" of Ancestry.com, I foolishly assumed that they were a trustworthy, up and up organization.  
After the three month period was up, I was received a phone call from a representative of Ancestry.com asking me if I wanted to renew my subscription.  I told the representative that due to personal circumstances (my fiancee' became very ill) it was not feasible for me to subscribe again.  I told this representative to call back in a few months and ask again, as I might want to subscribe after things became more manageable for me.  
Last night my fiancee' took a phone call at our home from another ""Representative"" from Ancestry.com, who asked him if we wanted to Continue our membership, at which time he informed them that we have not been members for quite some time.  He was then informed that we had not cancelled our membership, and our credit card had been charged every three months, without our consent.  Needless to say he was livid.  Mind you, the three month fee is only $24.95, but when finances are tight it does make a difference.  
My fiancee' had very heated words with this ""representative"", after which he hung up very angry.  This morning I personally called Ancestry.com to discuss this issue.  I was told that my membership could not have been cancelled as I thought it was, because the representative who would have called me would have given me a ""Different"" phone number to call and cancel.  This was not the case.  
I informed them that I would be contacting the Better Business Bureau, as well as my attorney and yourselves to attempt to not only receive a refund for the unauthorized charges to my Check Card, but also to attempt to educate anyone else out there who might not understand the deceptive practices used by Ancestry.com for their membership subscriptions.  
My advice to anyone thinking of subscribing to this internet service would be to think again.  They are deceitful, rude and a definite RIP-OFF!

Meanwhile they assumed that charging me for no service was ok and sent me a bill two months later for the month that I was without service plus for the present month. 
I called at that point and asked if the service was up again and also asked why I was being charged for the month without service as well as the present. The answer was short again "" Sir you did not notify us that you where without service and so you owe us for service. 
I reminded the smart ass that the shut down of the excite at home had been telivised on national tv and the nice lady on the telivision said that your company would not charge customers for the lost service and on top of that all customers would receive 2 free days for every one lost for the total duration of the down time while the new service was put together. 
The man on the other end of the line repeated sir you did not notify us that you had lost service so you will have to pay for the prier months service. I can only say I felt that the company does not care how many people the screw over and the employee's are nothing but androids. I eventualy gave in and decided to start the new AT&T online service dispite the frustration and that was a huge mistake. 
After a long set up phone conversation with a AT&T representative I folowed a word by word instruction on seting up my computer to receive the new online internet service. All seemed well after the set up until the next morning when I tried to start my computer up and all I could get was a AT&T cornel Error to come up on the screen. I called for assistance from AT&T and was told that nothing they have on there system could posible cause this problem. 
I responded with how can you tell me nothing could posible cause this when the computer worked just fine the day before installing the new online service. I was met with well sir can we do anything else for you and I replied yes fix my computer. Sorry sir can we do anything else for you. I could go on and on with conversation after conversation and not one person was willing to help. 
What kind of inhuman treatment is that. This company really should have there service band from the public. I would love to see them fall to the bottom of the scum barrel.

										These people are rip off bastards on ebay.I have a list of over 10 people thay ripped off in one auction alone. They must be stopped before it happens to you.
What happend to me was I bid and one a dutch auction (multiple winners) for a flat screen tv projector. The contacted me immediatly after the auction for there money which I paid through pay pal. As weeks went by no delivery I kept trying to contact the seller (the Duncans)no answer. So I decided to contact some of the other winners of that specific auction, and they told me the same ,they didn't get anything either
Finally, I contacted the seller and they say its in the mail as weeks go by again nothing. So now I am stuck between a rock and a hard place because the auction was only for 23.00 dollars and no one wants to help me get my money. 
I have contacted paypal and e bay but they dont seem to care because again I am only losing 23.00. So I keep filing complaints and sending the seller emails once a day until some one will finally give and give me my money or help in getting it back.
I don't know what else to do because no one seems to care if you only lose a little amount of money and I guess these people are sitting back getting rich little amounts at a time and I cant do anything about it.So I am filing a complaint here so maybe someone will see this and help me or at least not bid and warn others about these fraudulent e bayers.

Batavia, New York U.S.A. ",,800-6496518,Wonderfulbuys.com ripoff Unauthorized charges I Batavia New York,"
										I ordered a Lionel alarm clock December 3rd for my son as a Christmas present. I was promised that I would have the order by the 18th. I did not receive the clock and I kept calling the company regarding it and kept receiving lies after lies but never the item I ordered. Finally I had enough and I cancelled the order on January 12. However the company did not remove the charges from my card which they placed on even though they never sent the item, so I wrote numerous letters and asked repeatedly that they remove the charges. Instead of removing the charges as I requested, they sent a clock out on January 31st with an e-mail apologizing about the inconveniences they caused. I requested once again that they remove the unauthorized charges, but they refused, stating that I have their item, therefore they will not remove the charges. At first my understanding was that the clock was a compensation gift since the company had charged me for the item since early December and I not only bore inconveniences but also accumulated finance charges for a charge that should have never been on my card to begin with, but after, I realized that if the clock is not a compensation gift, then the only reason they sent the item out so that they could say now that the order was delivered, so that they would not have to remove the charges from the card and so that they would not have to pay for the finance charges I had requested for them to pay. 
So, instead of rectifying the situation and remove the unauthorized charges and reimbursing me for the finance charges, they sent the clock out to protect themselves. After not getting anywhere with the company I contacted the BBB and the Attorney General's office. After one of their response I called Wonderfulbuys and talked to Mr. Nick Kossovan who suppose to be their Director of Sales and explained to him what exactly happened and that I would like him to remove the charges. He said that if I send him the letter I read to him during our conversation which I received in regard to the clock, he will remove the charges. However, when I did send him the e-mail/letter I received regarding the clock he did not stand by his word either and it was just another lie. Lying, cheating and deceiving must be company policy because several of his employees did the same during the time I have been dealing with them. He kept saying that in order to get a refund I will have to send the clock back but when I inquired about the finance charges and shipping and handling he refused to answer as to how would he take care of that. 
I have decided to send the item back COD cash so that I would get paid for the above mentioned and asked that he prepares a check but the company ignored my request. 
Bottom line is that the company charged me for an item I did not order. As a result of their mistake I accumulated several months of finance charges and the company refuse to take the clock back COD cash or address the issue of the finance charges and shipping and handling. I should have not been charged on the first place and after what the company did and after all the pain they caused to my family (since this was a Christmas present) they added to that pain more aggravation instead of rectifying their mistake.

										Dear Everyone,
DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY. I am a investigator and usually deal with other people's fraud. Now here is where I am the victim: 
Approximately a month ago I ordered a bug culture, (called Springtails), to provide a dietary supplement for my pet frogs. I ordered one culture online and paid through thier website with my credit card. The total was approximately $10.00. About a week later I recieved my shipment. The said bugs were supposed to be in a small jarlike container. Upon inspection, I observed nothing but a dirt.  However, according to the directions that even though you don't ""see"" them, that shipping is hard on them and the ""eggs"" contained in the culture would hatch. 
So I dilligently followed instructions. Approximately 2 weeks later, I still just had a jar of dirt. So I emailed the company. I got a response and was informed that maybe I didn't follow the instructions because thier culture is doing fine. So I responded again and demanded a new ""good"" shipment or my money back. I recieved no response. Approximately 1 week later I recieved a new shipment. Guess what?.......I GOT MORE DIRT! YAY FOR ME! So anyhow to conclude, to this day I still have no bugs and I paid $10.00 for not even a handfull of dirt.

										The BTCI bank in west africa sent my mother a letter saying that i was the next of kin to some 8.5 million to be exact. So i follwed up on it!
finally i hired a attorney and was told to send various money for fees to the high court, fees for an oath, and other fees, this add up to $3000 dallors.
then when this was suppose to be it i had to sen money to open and account in my name $500 dallors for that and $3500 for a revadation fee, all this time from the begining  asked why not take it out of the inhertance?
I was told by my Barrister that his money was tied up in litagations, and that he was a poor lawyer, in a poor country.
So then when you think everything is through, i was told the money would be in my account in 72 hours, guess what it was not!
So next i had gotten astop order saying that i had to pay for a drug clearence cetificate, $2000, so guess what i sent that too!
Then this was suppose to be the very last money to send, see how they just keep holding a string over your head the closer you think you are the farther you are, away from nothing!
The IMC international monetering committee this is the IMC supposely stop the payment they want noe $18 thousand dallors for valadation to make sure the money is not drug or terrist money or whatever.
Did i send the money no, by all this time stuipd sees that she has been apart of a scam a con a rip-off, and the bottom line to this story is i borrowed a lot of money from friends and they are very upset with me because they to believed in me!
They to thought that they would get their money back in 72 hours!  Never use a barrister in africa by the name of william kingrade he is a rip-off.
Do no business with africa on the internet or other wise about money, becareful period when it comes to money you to can get ripped-off like i did, don't laugh and say not me because it can happen to you too! becareful out there, if it's to good to be true it is.

This was in march.  In july my account was frozen for some reason so I called customer service.  To my surprise my account info had not been updated, well it had been updated just with someone elses info. It showed that i was living in oregon which I've never even visted much less lived.

To make a long story short I now have a charge-off on my credit report for $104.  
Although I have paid my bank the account was stilled closed and can't be re-opened and my name is in some kind of bad check system. The bank said it would help if i could get a statement from dell saying that there was a mistake in the billing of that account so i called dell and was told that this was not possible and when i spoke with tina (supervisor #sup0989) i was that even though the mistake was theres i had to pay for it.  because one of there own employees gave the wrong info a have a bad mark on my credit report and they wont try to fix it although they can. so to my fellow consumers watch out!!!

Quincy, Massachusetts U.S.A. ",,617-770-0523,"Memories Promotions Melissa Seiler CEO false promises, tricked and lied to us, deceptive company, fraud Quincy Massachusetts","
										On 7.7.02, 11 days prior to the 2D3J Fan Convention (to be held in Boston, MA July 18 - 21, 2002), Melissa Seiler, CEO of Memories Promotions (the ""Company"" sponsoring / organizing the aforementioned Convention), asked Khristel Hoffer, Vice President, to forward a message to attendees stating that the Convention had been ""somewhat"" canceled, the itinerary had been changed, and made a written promise stating ""If you want your money back we will send it back.""
A very kind offer, considering their website stated ""no refunds.""
I began pursuing a refund at this point.
On 7.12.02, Ms. Seiler responded to my request for a refund by saying ""Everyone is going to get a full refund of money as soon as possible"" and further explaining that they needed to obtain a refund from the Sheraton Boston before they could issue refunds to those not attending.
On 7.15.02, Aviva Chow, Senior One Call Sales Manager at the Sheraton, Boston, emailed confirmation to those seeking a refund that ""The Sheraton Boston was forced to release the contracted space because Memories Promotions did not send us the agreed full pre-payment for the entire event by June 30, 2002.""
This shows that Memories Promotions not only didn't pay the hotel with the money forwarded to them by Attendees of the 2D3J Convention, but that Ms. Seiler was dishonest when she said she was waiting for a refund from the Sheraton in order to issue my refund.
On 7.17.02, an event attendee (located in Cincinnati, OH) who was seeking a refund, received a certified letter containing her full refund.  
Why should Memories Promotions refund one individual, and not all?  
To date, my attempts of getting a refund have been ignored by Memories Promotions.  They have ignored written requests, email requests, phone calls, and refused to sign for Certified Letters, including a 30-Day Demand for Payment letter that will be filed with Small Claims Court.
In addition, they are insisting that because their website said ""no refunds,"" they are not required to give them.  However, they made two written promises saying a refund will be given (one to all attendees, one to me individually, both documents  are availble to be presented in courts) and provided one person with a refund already.  
These acts are disorganized, dishonest, and fraudulent.

After I Found That They Were Not Able To Set Up The Service For The Phone To Be Billed On My Phone Bill As Promised With My Local Phone Company And That The Internet Service Was Hard To Log Onto And All Of The Updates I Was Getting From Were Nothing But Putting Adware On My Hard Drive I Decided To Close My Account With This Company.
This Was About Three Months Or So After Activation That I Called In April Of 2001.
I Called The Number Listed On My Seperate Phone Bill From Them
As Now I Had Two Phone Bills To Deal With.
I Talked To Someone There And Quit The Service And Was Told All Would Be Handled And Informed Them For All Of My Phone Services That I Went Back With My Local Phone Company.
Then I Found That I Had A Credit Of $4.00 Or So And Monthly I Would Get Mail Informing Me Of This So I Called Around June Of 2001 And Told Them I Did Not Want Anything To Do With Them And Asked What I Could Do To Stop Them From Sending Me Mail Of My Credit For A Account That I No Longer use.
The Person I Talked To On The So Called Customer Service Staff Knew That I Was Irritated And Said He Would Close Everything For Me And Get Me Out Of The Computer By Sending Me A Check For The $4.00 And Change That They Had As A Overbalance For Me.
I Was Shocked When I Did Get A Check About Three Weeks Or So From Them And All Billing Seemed To Stop.
I Am Not A Person Who Checks My Bank & Credit Card Statements Real Close Except For The Balances I Think Should Be There As I Do Not Make Alot Of Tranactions On Either And If They Look Right As In Very Close To What I Think They Should Be I Do Not
Check Very Closely.
This Was A Mistake On My Part As When I Called My Bank For Some Info On A Charge That I Had Not Seen Before Lo And Behold After 11 Months At&t Worldnet Had Been Sneaking In Charges On My Account Since March 18, 2002.
These Charges As I Stated Were Not Supposed To Be There Because I Was Told In June 2001 On My Second Contact With This Company My Account Was Closed.
They Were Charging Me From March 2002 To September 2002 For A Service That I Thought Was Closed For Over 11 Months As Ther Were No Charges On My Card For Over 11 Months All Was Fine And That The Worldnet Software Had Not Been In My Computer Since Feb Of 2001 So Again Irritated Beyond Belief I Called Them To Try To Get This New Developement Resolved.
I Called And Talked To A Donna And Was Informed Of Their Scam And Their True Intentions By Her Telling Me That I Never Called Them To Cancel This Service And In Their Policy It Says They Can Charge Your Card For These Services If Your Phone Number Changes Or Your Phone Billing Changes Or You Move.
The Fact That I Had Called Two Times To close This Account With The Number Provided On The Seperate Bill They Sent Me Did Not Matter As They Are Seperate From Phone Service Side Of Their Company I Was Informed.
Talking To Donna Further Was Like A Conversation With A Robot Repeating The Same Things Over And Over Even When I Asked Why I Was Not Charged April 2001 To March 2001 If This Account Was Active As She Said I was Informed That This Was Due To Their Customer Verification Procedures.  
The Conversation With Donna From This Point On Did Not Go Well As I Could Tell At THis Point They Were Running Me Around And With Intent Were Going To Rip Me For Seven Months Of Unused Service And That Further Conversation With Donna Was Not Worth It And That I Could Get Just As Far Talking With A Brick.
So At This Point I Asked To Talk To Her Supervisor And Was Told None Were Available At This Time All Of Them Were On Calls And This Did Not Surprise Me!!!!
So I Got Off The Phone With Donna Had Some Things To Do And Called Back A Few Hours Later In The Evening And Waited For About 15 Minutes To Get To A Contact To Ask For A Supervisor And Waited For About 10 Minutes For One Of Them And Lo And Behold I Got To Talk To One Named Tracy.
Well Again I Retold All To This Tracy And She Could Not Even Find My Contact Records In Her Computer As If To Say I Never Had Called As Far As She Could See And Wanted To Know If I Had The Contact Information Of The Person I Had Talked To A Year And A Half Before And Of Course I Did Not.
After This I She Informed Me That They Would Not Refund My Money For Services I Did Not Use Even Though She Said She Understood How I Felt When I Informed Her That It Was Clear That You Stole This Money From Me And That This Was Their Intent
Because They Did Not Call Me Or Contact Me By Mail In The 11 Months If They Had Questions On Their End And To Let Me Know
This Account Was Still Active After 11 Months Of Me Not Even Thinking Of This Company In My Life Anymore.
She Then Informed Me That They Did Make A Attempt To Contact Me In June By Email At The Account I Do Not Use The At&t Email Address I had With Them!!!!
In My Opinion Their Intent Is Clear By Signing Up With Them They Will Use Legal Loop Holes In Their Contract And Even If You Can Prove Incompitance On Their Part Which I Think This Is A big Problem In This Company They Will Rip You Off If Possible.
In My Opinion This Is A Bad Company Not Ran Well This Is Very Evident From The Problems I Had And The Things Posted By Other People On The Internet.
I See At&t Is Running A New Deal On Tv Again Be Smart Use Aol
Theres A Reason Why They Are Number 1.
Or At Least Use A Isp That Cares About It's Customers And Runs A Company Where The Right Hand And The Left Hand Are Attached To The Same Body And Each Knows What They Are Doing !!!!

I e-mailed freeadvice about this, and they sent me a "" CEASE AND DESIST "" e-mail, stating I am BARRED for 5 yrs. from using posting on their site.( due to the objectional post ) from before they deleted.
They have not BARRED the other (2) members that were in violation of their Terms and Conditions"" that started harrassing me.

										This afternoon, I called Netrocket Technologies(702) 459-2138 and I asked for a Mark Defoyd because his name was listed as a contact person when I did a whois on netsol.com for ""dot.com"" company for which I was trying to contact to verify one for business purposes. The tech support person who only answered ""Netrocket"" without identifiying himself told me that that I had the wrong company, called me a ""dweeb"", asked if I was brain dead"" and then hung up on me. 
Later when I called again to try to get a different tech and ask for the owner of the company, he actually said ""f*ck you"" to me on the phone. I asked for his supervisor or the billing department and he refused. I think the guy on the phone is running a business out of his house. There is no street address for netrocket.com. 
If I had ever treated a customer the way he treated me at one of my former jobs, I could have been fired. I think this low-life piece of scum is probably the owner. I tried to look up the people who took out the business license or ficticious name ""Netrocket Technologies"" in Las Vegas or Clark County and I found no records. I think Netrocket is running a business without a license and they are not paying their business taxes. 
Do not use this company for webhosting or computer consulting. They may have the technical expertise to do their jobs, but they definitely do not have the customer service skills to treat their future customers.

So after about 9 messages on his voice mail my long distance calls, 9 or so e-mails, and 4 weeks, he finally sent money via paypal.
His M.O. is these are small ripoffs $25.00 or so, if he makes a lot of these he pockets money for free, but most people are not going to raise hell over such a small amount. Except me!

Since it was overdrawn I was charged 30 bucks for a NSF fee ""non sufficient funds"".  This company not only ripped me off 30 bucks but ripped the bank off and now the bank is involved and their mad.  DO NOT buy anything over the internet whatsoever,  also take note that this company buys people' information like credit card accounts, social security numbers etc..  They are a major SCAM and slam you with a bill, if you were a victim take note that they do refund that I can see but you may have been charged by them more then once from what i've read on message boards that they charge you every year and rip you off more.  I have contacted my lawyer and am thinking of filing a lawsuit against them to teach them not to mistreat people and steal from others, they deserve to be in prison for a very long time.

Now for about a year I've been trying to get my email address back, i've asked hotmail to help me, they told me if I filled out there little questioner about my account they would reset my password so I can access my account once again. 
 Well I ""flunked"" my questioner from hotmail!  They ask me the screan name and password to my account and I got it wrong!  I gave them my screan name and password I used when I had access to my account, but its not the same password now so they wont reset my password!After several emails to Hotmail support they finally told me they were not going to assist me in trying to get my account back.. Otherwords, they think i'm trying to break into this persons account!  I had this account stolen from me and I'm being punished from Hotmail!  I wouldnt worry much about this account, but this person is pretending to be me!  I thought that was identy theft?  I thought that was illegal?  Can anyone suggest any help?  Thank you very much.

" Featureprice.com, Hosting-Network ","  Featureprice.com, Hosting-Network  1516 Jackson Street 
Ft Meyers, Florida U.S.A. ",,800-605-4883,"Featureprice.com, Hosting-Network fraudulent rip-off Ft Meyers Florida","
										I signed up for Internet hosting with FeaturePrice in December of 2001.  They collect a full year's fees up-front, which seemed acceptable at the time, but after numerous problems with their service over the course of 3 months, I moved all my sites to another hosting service and requested FeaturePrice (FP) to refund my money and cancel my account.  
They refused, citing their online 'contract', which contains clauses that are clearly punitive in nature -- and should be unenforceable. Essentially, the only 'reason' for a refund would be a technical issue they could not resolve. 
Their method of determining whether or not there is a valid technical problem is unknown and FP is the only one 'qualified' to determine if there is a valid reason for refund. Therefore, it is unlikely you, or anyone else you know, will ever receive a refund from FP, as nearly as I can tell. 
In leaving, I cited numerous reasons:
1: When I experienced several days of not being able to email a client using their servers, one of their technicians deleted ALL my mailboxes and inserted one of his own to test the results.  I found out about this the next morning, when I could not receive or send mail from one of my commercial sites. Any non-technical client would have been S.O.L. Fortunately, I was able to reconstruct all my mailboxes and only lose whatever mail was 'bounced' overnight. This is completely unacceptable and FP has never responded to this issue.
2: Their Front Page response time is excruciatingly SLOW.  I regularly update my sites and the speed of their servers is roughly 20% of what it would be on any other provider's servers.  This is completely unacceptable with my volume of updates. They have never addressed this issue. They don't even respond to the topic.
3: In February of 2002 they were hit with a DOS attack which rendered all my websites off-line for more than 36 hours.  This amounted to two full business days with no email and non-existent websites.  At the time, several other commercial hosting companies were also attacked, but were back online in a matter of 2-4 hours (typical response time for a competent hosting service).  
Obviously, FP does not have the expertise in security to host commercial sites.  During this time I could not send or receive email on any of my sites -- and customers (and potential customers) attempting to reach my sites received error 404 - page not found messages.  This is the 'kiss of death' for an Internet-oriented business such as mine. 
I would like to point out that during the DOS attack, Featurprice's site was never down. When queried about this, the representative said their site was on a different server. What does this tell you? It tells me they don't trust their own hosting for their own commercial site.
4: Their mechanism for handling customer service issues is an arcane web-based interface.  It is not possible to simply email them with requests.  To find out what has happened with an issue, one must log back on to their Customer Service system, attempt to navigate it and search for the results.  As soon as they 'reply' to a trouble ticket, it is marked as 'closed' and the client is responsible for 're-opening' the issue if it is not resolved (mine rarely were). 
This is unacceptable. In trying to document my correspondence with FP for my credit card company, I found all records of my Incident Tickets erased - not a single transaction remains. In other words, they can cover their tracks when they want to avoid refunds. Since they will not communicate via standard email, the client has no local records to fall back on when documentation is necessary. This is very sleazy. 
FP no longer responds to my emails.  They refuse to communicate with myself or my other clients who have requested refunds on their contracts ( names withheld ) and have moved their sites to new providers.  Both of my clients continue to do battle with FP in an attempt to have their fees returned. Even though FP has re-billed my credit card company (CapitolONE) and received their funds back, two of the IP addresses I paid for in advance are still blocked.
Given my experience with FeaturePrice, I suggest anyone considering cheap web-hosting to avoid them like the plague.
If you have had a negative experience with Featureprice web hosting, I suggest you file a complaint with the FTC (www.ftc.gov) and the Florida Attorney General's Office. 
To date, Featureprice has failed to respond to the Florida AG requests to resolve this issue, but if enough people file complaints, perhaps some of us will get our money back.
I have also filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (bbbonline.com)and FP has yet to respond.

Plano, TexasU.S.A.STOP! ..before you think about using the Better Business Bureau (BBB)... CLICK HERE to see how other consumers were victimized by the BBB's false or misleading information. Don't be fooled! It has been reported, when there are thousands of complaints and other investigations underway by authorities, the BBB has no choice but to finally give an UNsatisfactory rating to a BBB member business that is paying the BBB big membership fees every year. When a business is reported that is NOT a BBB member, BBB files WILL more likely show an UNsatisfactory rating, then reportedly shake down that company to become a member of the BBB. One positive thing about the BBB is, either way, if a business has an unsatisfactory rating with the BBB, you can be sure, the business is bad. But what about all those BBB member businesses that had complaints filed against them? Consumers never get to hear about them. What about the BBB advertising to the public? Is this a false and misleading perception they are giving about consumer confidence when dealing with a business? Click here to understand more of what consumers and business alike are saying about the BBB. You decide. ..Remember. The BBB membership is not earned, its paid for! ",Internet

										MAJOR SCAM WITH Possible CRIMINAL/(censored) ties - Al-Yon? 
Alyon technologies is not a legitimate business in any way. I have never signed up for any service/product relating to this ""firm."" The address they provide is a P.O. box and the phone number for customer service is useless. Furthermore, I strongly believe Alyon is a major scam with possible criminal/terror ties.  
I worry that the money that they are collecting through these vile criminal tactics will be used for other criminal means - perhaps even (censored) activities as was listed previously on this site: ""Alyon Technologies has computer ties to Spain, the Netherlands, and Guinea Busseau."" ""  
The fact that they also request sensitive personal information to ""resolve billing disputes"" i.e.: a copy of a minor's birth certificate and verification the minor was living at the address of the phone number they have on file. 
Can this lead to identity theft and perhaps securing credit and ID's - maybe even passports? Perhaps they are tied with some (censored) organization?  Al-Yon? Do not visit the site. Write your local news station and representative. Let them know.

										I incidentally noticed while looking over my credit card statement a charge listed for approximately $23.87 from MONTSR.COM 8008978063 LOD (This number is actually the 1-800 number to the Agency Monterstar which facades as a Customer Service Site for the Internet.) 1-800-897-8063.

Of course they told me to call Monters.com inwhich I did only to be told this was actually montsr.com and not affiliated with them. They did supply me with the number which was right under my nose all the time. 
I tried calling the number and was put on hold for some time. Which I stuck it out, finally getting a represented who request my account number which I only gave to her after she insisted it would be the only way she could help me. She verified my username and password which was correct and said I had signed up for services for the Internet site "" Massive Media TV"" After explaining I had no recognition of this, she said it may have been a pop-up ad stating I had been pre-approved for this service from this site, but could not tell me or explain what service it was. 
I told her regardless it either wasn't me who entered the info or it had been fraudulently gotten by other means. She said she would have to report it to thier Fraud dept and be investigate. After asking to speak with her supervisor, she gave me someone's name and work ID number or something to that sort.
I immediately hung up and did a serch for the company on the Internet, which had several links concerning this site as being fraudulent. After reading a couple, I once again contacted my Credit card company and reported what I knew. They then turned me over to their customer svc rep that handles frauds. She said she would send me a form stating I did not authorize the payment and after they received it back they would credit my account. 
She was aware of the the site and the reports of them being fraudulent. She assured me they wouldn't be able to charge the account again, nor did she think they would try being that I had already spoke with them about the reports of them being accussed of fraud. She said she wasn't sure exactly how they did it but usually if you subscribed to some free svc or promotion on the Internet and give them your username and password this is some how passed on to this site for Massive Media TV along with your credit card info.
Immediately contact your Credit Card Company for any charges showing up on your credit card that seem odd or tht you do not remember making.

Fort Myers, Florida U.S.A. ",,800-605-4883,Featureprice.com fraudulent ripoff business poor excuse for a web host Fort MyersFort Myers Florida,"
										I paid FeaturePrice (a web-hosting provider) in January 2003 to host two domains for twelve months.  Although I published my WebPages on the servers, FeaturePrice failed to configure the servers properly and the result was the public was unable to access my websites.  I tried working with FeaturePrice to correct this situation, but it became clear over the course of several weeks that FeaturePrice technicians were unable or unwilling to get its servers working properly.  I moved my web presence to another hosting company and asked for a refund for the remaining unused months I paid in advance for.   FeaturePrice has yet to respond to this request.   It is clear to me that many others who thought they were dealing with a reputable company share this or similar unfortunate situation.
My FeaturePrice account number is 132, CY Joint Businesses.  The account has two Premium hosting subscriptions (websites), cytechandprofservices.com and stuff-n-gift-baskets.com.  I paid $228.40 on 30 December 2002 for 12 months of hosting for cytechandprofservices.com and I paid another $228.40 on 21
January 2003 for 12 months of hosting for stuff-n-gift-baskets.com.   I moved these domains and websites to a new web-hosting provider (Host Rocket) on 21 April 2003 and I submitted help tickets to billing, sent e-mails, and sent letters to FeaturePrice on 21 April asking for refund of my money.  The
help tickets remain open and unread.  All other communications returned to me as undeliverable.  Telephones are not answered or are out of service. 
Although the $456.80 I paid to FeaturePrice is probably beyond any recovery, I am very concerned co-owner, Fathi Said, of FeaturePrice has established operations in New York as IX Web Hosting and is doing so with out any agency determining his involvement in the misdoings and criminal mischief occurring
these past months at FeaturePrice.  FeaturePrice took money from thousands of customers in the last four months and has now abandoned them.
Law enforcement and consumer protection agencies have yet to take a serious investigative interest in the money trail and continuing fraudulent business activities of Travis Johnson and Fathi Said.  Of the two, I'm more suspicious about Fathi Said.  I'm clueless of Fathi Said's true affiliations and allegiances, but his background is mysterious and significant amounts of
money are leaving the country for parts unknown.  To put it simply, I have concern Fathi Said's shady business operations in the USA and other countries are a possible funding source for terrorism.   Travis Johnson's past is better known.  He is no stranger to unethical and problematic activities.  His motivation is probably greed and personal enjoyment of easily gotten wealth.  I desire scrutiny of continuing and new business
operations of these individuals and I seek accountability for  their wrongdoings at FeaturePrice.   I appreciate any inquiry you are willing to do into these matters.

										This posting is fairly long, if you have the time, I do recommend that you read over it, but if you are in a hurry, please be sure to read the last 4-5 paragraphs as they contain important information about the above mentioned company(s).
My first encounter with this company came when I signed up for a shopping jobs website (Which is also run by onlinepaidsurveys.com) and I was offered 2 free airline tickets for joining. I received an e-mail which instructed me to print it out and send along with a $20 check made payable to 'The Guest List' at the address provided, which is exactly what I did. 
My second encounter with the company (unbeknownst to me at the time) came when I was searching for a part time job that I would be able to do from home. I came across a job listing seeking directors to help raise funds for cancer awareness. I thought, 'Geez, that would be nice. I can earn money and still help out a cause at the same time.' of course, I did not realize that the two free airline tickets were the same airline tickets that I had signed up for, just from a different website. 
After I signed up, I got the bright idea that I would promote this opportunity via the online auction as well as to all my neighbors, family, and friends. All was going quite well. I explained the program and stipulations thoroughly on all my ebay auctions and that part of the money would be going to a wonderful cause. 
I began to put two and two together when 60 days had elapsed and I had not yet received my tickets or any word from the company. I then saw that the physical address for the director's website was in the same city as the Guest List, and on top of that, the very same street. Still, I thought very little of it and assumed that the reason the Director Position website could give out the plane tickets was simply because they were located so closely to the Guest List.
I made sure to check my banking account to make sure of the date the check was endorsed and cashed by The Guest List (if you include from the date I actually sent in my payment, it would have been 72 days I was without my tickets, but I started counting from the time the check was cashed). I sent a notice to The Guest List stating that 60 days (8 weeks, they have a 4-8 week processing period, which of course was not stated ANYWHERE on the forms I had submitted...I found it out simply from my investigations) gently asking how my ticket registration was coming along. Still no word and it is 75 days later. At this point is when I decided that I need to do some much needed investigation. 
I first started at the eBay help/community section as one of my auctions was cancelled because of these ""plane ticket vouchers/choice travel vouchers"" and I saw numerous complaints from people who had purchased these tickets and received nothing, and many of them came from The American Cancer Aid Foundation (which is the operating name for DirectorPosition.com), that is when ALL the red flags started to fly.
I do not want to be a part of such a dishonest company, nor do I want any legal recourse as I have referred numerous people as well as accept money for these ""plane ticket vouchers"" and I had no idea that what I may have been involved in was an elaborate scam.
Here are my findings on this company: 
There are at least five (5) other websites, with three (3) different physical addresses, four (4) different phone numbers, and five (5) different contact e-mail addreses, all registered/owned by the same person, one Jeff Augugliaro ~ I found this out by some careful examination of the registration info from the whois lookups.

Bingo ~ that is the exact same address as The Guest List. How can that possibly be? And why is the e-mail address @ massmarketingprogram.com? Doesn't people helping people have it's own address?  Actually, according to its website it does and so does director position. 
My conclusion, this company is a scam, and if by some grace of God it is not...it's definitely trying to hide something. I do not mean to rebutt anything from another report in my own, but I will pull off of something that a Mr. Allan Parker had said in regards to another person's complaint with MassMarketingProgram.com, and I quote ""We don't have a whois so I don't know what phone number you are talking about. We handle support through email. And if you send us an email, you get a response."" 
I wonder if Allan Parker actually knows what he's talking about because if he truly believes that he ""[doesn't] have a whois"" he is sadly mistaken. Every registered website has a ""whois"" at very least with their registrar. I also conclude from his response that he is not this Jeff Augugliaro, because Mr. Augugliaro had some semblence of what he was doing. He has duped people with his numerous websites and he's duped innocent webmasters who are just starting out with ""false"" hits generated from a rerouter from Taiwan ~ but that strays from the subject of my complaint, if you paid for hits from massmarketingprogram.com, I sincerely suggest that you check out where those hits are ""coming"" from and create your own rip off report. 
He obviously wanted to cover his tracks as all the phone numbers that the websites were registered with are false and the only address I know to be legitimate is The Guest List address (of course, so he can receive his money). I truly do feel bad for Mr. Parker if he is just a customer service employee because I'm sure he's unaware of the sham of a company he works for. Then again, he may very well be Mr. Augugliaro's less than educated sidekick who gets his cut without actually knowing how the whole things works. Then again, it could very well be Mr. Augugliaro playing dumb. Then again, Mr. Augugliaro's information could just be borrowed indefinitely from an ID theif and con artist.
In closing, I plan to report my findings to the Better Business Bureau, IFCC (The Internet Fraud Complaint Center ~ otherwise known as the internet FBI), The Garden City NY Police Department, The Postal Service (as the company committed mail fraud by accepting payment via the USPS, and mail fraud is a very serious offense) and a few other law enforcement agencies and a lawyer as I would like to file a class action suit against this ficticous company(s). 
If you are or ever have been affiliated with, conned by, or dealing with any of the following companies or people:
MassMarketingProgram.com
InternetExecutive.com
DirectorPosition.com (American Cancer Aid Foundation)
SupportPHP.org (People Helping People)
eCommerceControl.com
Jeff Augugliaro
Please contact me through the rebuttal I will give you instructions for filing your claims as well. If enough people react to this, the IFCC and the police department will be forced to take action, and if Mr. Parker's claim that ""[Mass Marketing Program] has over 10,000 customers..."" then it truly means there are far more people getting conned then I ever imagined. Just by the numbers that I know, this company probably has scammed more than a quarter million dollars from innocent people (based on the reports I read in eBay, my research online, and by Mr. Parker's own admission of 10,000 customers). This company needs to be stopped before he goes too far.
Again, please contact me with any information through the rebuttal and make sure that your contact info is correct so that I may further communicate with you if needed.

I pulled out past statements only to find they have been charging me $8.95 a month for the past year and a half. The charge is so small I didn't notice it until it was the only charge. I called the 800# and spoke to a supervisor and asked who they were then advised them I did not subscribe to their service. 
She advised me that my card number was given to them through an internet purchase in Dec 2002. I advised I was unknowingly enrolled and demanded to discontinue my membership and my money back. She said that because this was the first call I had made to them she only refund three months charges. I wasn't satisfied with this. She offeres six months refund. No, I want the whole year and a half. Nine months? No, all of it. She offered me twelve months refund and refused any more. 
Please be wary of any purchases made over the internet. Stay away, if you can, from Questsavers. They are stealing money from many people who don't even realize it. Not to mention it's a useless service they say they offer.

										Just today I receive an email about this job with Auction Road.  As many others have stated I got a fast paced sales pitch that made this job sound like a piece of cake and a great money maker.  After giving (Joe) my credit card information allowing him to charge me ""$9.95"" I find out that they are actually charging me for a year ($99.95).   
I told him that I didn't have that much money in my account to pay for it.  He then stated that he would wait until midnight and try again or that I could call back after my Husband got home and switch to another credit card.  After 20 min. of trying to get him to just cancel I said OK and immediately called the # he gave me to cancel.  
For 20 or more min. I listened to a recording about Auction Road ""and how great they are"" before someone actually came on the line.  I gave the gentleman my information and he said that he canceled my membership with them and according to my bank, nothing has been taken out of my account (""yet"").  
I'm still concerned that they might keep trying. I asked him if he could send me an email confirming that the account has been canceled and he said ""No"" then he gave me a Cancelation Confirmation number.  I'm telling ya, If these Idiots charge my card after canceling I will have a lawyer on their butts quicker than you can say ""Rip Off!""  
I had this problem once before with a credit card company that promised me a credit card for a fee and kept charging my checking account rusulting in bounced checks having never even received the credit card.  It has been almost 2 years since that incident and of course they got busted but I'm still waiting on that refund which is over $200!  I'm so sick of these SCAMS!  
All I want is a legitimate work at home job so I can stay home with my little girl!  A job that doesn't cost me anything to start.  Think about it:  When you've been hired outside the home for anything like factory work, secretarial work etc. have any of those company's asked you to pay them to be able to work there?  I THINK NOT!  I wish there was something that could be done to stop these rip off artists, I am so sick of It!

Blue Bell, Pennsylvania U.S.A. ",,800-876-3832,Ridley Telephone Company AKA Tralee Telephone Company Internet Cramming consumer fraud ripoff Blue Bell Pennsylvania,"
										To whom it may concern,
My name is Barbara. I was scammed on the Internet.  I am a victim of Internet cramming.  I have absolutely no legal way of proving this.  I only have allegations, but I do have a feeling in the depths of my soul that something is seriously wrong here.
My fifteen-year-old daughter went to a web site that offered phone cards and free plane tickets.  She typed in her name and our home phone number.  That was her only sin.  The web address is telcovalue.com.  They also operate under the name Tralee TelephoneCompany.
http://www.telcovalue.com/t004/index.cfm?caid=104402
The company she sent our phone number to used that information to begin billing our Qwest account for $25.77 a month.  Yes I am legally responsible to check my phone bill every month.  I openly admit that.  In my defense phone bills are notoriously hard to read.  The charges looked like a legitimate charge.
We discovered these charges ten months after they had begun.  My husband called Qwest.  They referred us to a third party billing service USBI, phone number 1 888 481 8124.  They in turn referred us to the Ridley Telephone Company, phone number 1 800 876 3511.  He called them and they agreed to refund the charges for February, March and April.  What they neglected to tell him was they had been billing us since August of 2002.  Ask yourself, if a customer calls about an unauthorized charge shouldnt you tell the customer you have been billing them for ten months?  I personally find their behavior unethical.
We received another Qwest bill and once again USBI had billed us for $25.77 from Ridley.   Once again my husband called Qwest where he learned that Ridley had been billing us since August.  I contacted Ridley on Monday June 9.  They agreed to refund the charges pending corporate approval.  I asked for a phone number to Ridleys corporate office.  They refused and gave me an address, P.O. Box 1566, Bluebell PA, 19422.  I asked for names of corporate officers.  They refused.  (How creepy is that??????)  A reputable company wouldnt be afraid to make a phone number available to its customers. I have since found another telephone number for these people.  1 800 876 3832. 
One more point of interest, if I was supposedly getting phone cards where are they?  I was supposedly getting plane tickets, where are they?  Hello, -- no cardsno tickets-- Nothing of that nature has been sent to me.
I am not the only victim of this fraudulent act.  According to the FCC homepage, this is a two billion dollar a year scam. Once again may I state I have no way to prove this legally. 
Thank-you

Hawkesbury, Ontario Canada ",,514-344 4747,J.D.Marvel Products Inc. misleading Hawkesbury Ontario/Montreal QuebecHawkesbury Ontario,"
										June 6, 2003  placed order with J.D.Marvel.  Lindsay took the order. She told me it would be $71.64.  This amount to be taken from my Visa.
After my phone call I check the items I was purchasing and discovered (within 30 minutes of the call) that my order should only have been $55.14.
I called back and spoke to Carole. (You have to realize that it takes for ever to finally get a live body to talk to.) Carole went over the order with me and she came up with a figure of $51.31.  I figured she was taking a different tax than I was.  I ordered the items from one place to be delivered to an address in in another place. Our tax is 15% their tax is 7%.  However, I would take the amount she came up with.
During the week I checked my Visa on line only to discover that they had in fact debited my account $50.86 US and charged me $70.14 Canadian.
I immediately started calling but never able to get a live body.
Finally on Saturday June 14, 2003 I decided that I would just keep holding (as they tell you to do) and an operator will be with you shortly.  I held on the line for 45 minutes and then gave up.  I called again that night about 8:55PM and got a recording saying our office is now closed.  I was TICKED!
I called Monday June 16, 2003 and eventually spoke with Marcello.He went over the whole scenario with me and said he was putting through a credit for $18.83.  I asked when I could expect to see that on my Visa.  He said it would take several months as they are not set up for handling refunds on the computer.  I said well you certainly are set up for taking my money from my Visa immediately for the order.
I told him I needed to speak to a Supervisor.  He said they were both busy but he would have one of them call me.  I told him I thought I should be reimbursed for the 45 Minute hold on Saturday.  He said he did not understand that as they are not open on Saturday!!!! Give me a Break!
It is now Wednesday, June 18th, and do you think I have heard from a Supervisor - NOT.  I want them to issue a cheque to me personally, never mind a credit to my Visa.
I just needed a place to VENT!!  I have become so frustrated over never being able to get through when I call.

Usight, ePenzio, and other entities presented a web building program in Indianapolis.I signed up for the program, but within the three day recision period, I cancelled the contract.
They(usight, and others), refused to acknowledge the contract cancellation, and still today retains my money.
This was not a stupid act on my part, but a decision was founded on further research.
They had already processed the paperwork, and refuse to answer phone calls, faxes, or other attempts to reach them.I just recently was put in touch with the Utah Division of Consumer Affairs.
 Hopefully, something positive will come from this contact.They(usight, and other similar names) are very sinister , deceptive, frauds. Be aware, you could be the next victim. I have not included the address due to their moving, or refusal of documents at the last known address.

										I ordered Denise Austin's Stretch and Tone Workout System through the 800 WebMall.  I paid for my order on 4/18/03 by check.  The check was cashed - paid to Fleet Bank in April.  There were two different cancel stamps on the back of my check. One did not have a date, the other had a date of 'APR - 4  01',(something is wrong with this picture, right?).  Both stamps were to the Fleet Bank.  I got back on the internet to try to find a phone number to this company to ask them if something was wrong with the canceled stamp on the back of my check because of the date and then find out what my tracking number was and when my purchase was shipped out so I knew when to expect it.  
I only got a voice message that was rather unhelpful.  I thought I'd try to call again another time due to the time difference and speak to a real human being but only got the same voice message.  Then I called two different phone numbers that serviced different mail order companies, but was still unsuccessful in locating Tri Star Products, Inc.  One lady that I spoke to suggested that I call the bank where the check was cashed and try to locate the company that way.  
So, I searched for the bank on the internet and found Fleet Bank in two different states. One bank was located in Meriden, Ct. and the other bank was located in Malden, MA.  I called the bank in MA. because I did not know which bank handled Tri Star Products, Inc.'s business and thought the bank's business practices were similar to those of the tri-States back East.  The individuals at the bank were very helpful until they pulled up the account on Tri Star Products, Inc.  Then they became quite cool and reserved and referred me to the BBB in MA.  
I asked them for the phone number for the BBB since they were right there in MA. and I was here in OK.  At this point in our conversation she became rather unhelpful and uncooperative, but still tried to remain pleasant.  After trying unsuccessfully to contact the BBB concerning this company I tried to find Tri Star Product, Inc.'s phone number so I could call them and talk to someone regarding my purchase.  
That is how I found this site and why I am writing my ripoff report.  It is now almost July and I still have not seen my purchase or heard from anyone to either get my merchandise or have my money refunded. And talk about getting the run around!!!!  What I've had to do so far is rather ridiculous!!!!! I hope you can help me.

CLICK HERE to see how other consumers were victimized by the BBB's false or misleading information. Don't be fooled! It has been reported, when there are thousands of complaints and other investigations underway by authorities, the BBB has no choice but to finally give an UNsatisfactory rating to a BBB member business that is paying the BBB big membership fees every year. When a business is reported that is NOT a BBB member, BBB files WILL more likely show an UNsatisfactory rating, then reportedly shake down that company to become a member of the BBB. One positive thing about the BBB is, either way, if a business has an unsatisfactory rating with the BBB, you can be sure, the business is bad. But what about all those BBB member businesses that had complaints filed against them? Consumers never get to hear about them. What about the BBB advertising to the public?

Vancouver, British Columbia Canada ",,604-6858363,Verb Exchange Inc. ripoff deceptive company Vancouver British Columbia,"
										Beware of the true intentions of this company!
I have decided not to invest in a Certified Agency with the company.  
I believe that the company is more interested in collecting the $15000-$25000 Certified Agency fee than they are in hiring good business/sales people.  This is my opinion and I could be wrong, but ""if it sounds too good to be true"" bla, bla, bla... 
Reasons why I decided not get involved:
1) If they have such a great thing going then usually you would want to protect it a lot more then what I saw them doing.  They should make sure that only very qualified people would ever promote and represent the company.  They don't seem to care too much about whom they sign up, a warm body with a pulse (and $15000) and perhaps a wee bit of business experience is good enough for them!  They never truly interviewed me to determine my sales-skills and aptitude.  
If they don't want to hire me for my good sales-skills and business acumen, then I must be careful.
2) I find it peculiar that the company is so interested in selling this through a Master Agency (MA) that perhaps costs $150,000 and up.  The MAs are allowed to sell (and profit!!) when selling up to 20 Certified Agencies in each major city within their territory?  I was informed that the telecom industry used this method successfully in the 90.  
Maybe, maybe not I wasn't convinced.
3) My lawyer commented that they don't have enough geographic area and industry (verticals they call it) protection clauses built in to the agency contract, and I believe that it's a potential lawsuit pending with regards to territory protection and infringement (a candidate at the company presentation commented on this as well).
4) The CEO is hired and works as a Director for a Canadian mining company........., why, what does he know about mining? Mining companies,... we have all been told to watch out for them!! 
5) My lawyer commented that the contract layout had a ring of ""pyramid"" to it?
6) One of business associates has a colleague that had been somewhat involved a while back and was surprised that the hand to hand selling aspect of the business was what made it work, and not the product itself.  
7) I turned down this opportunity over the phone explaining that I found them to be more interested in selling the $15000 agency then their products, and they certainly did not have a different story try to tell me (read sell me) right there over the phone!
This is why I decided not to invest my $15000 and I do believe that I am right about this company, but please check it out for your self.  I certainly could be wrong about the company and this might turn out to be the next best thing, so I will watch the stock and perhaps jump in with $15000 when the time is right!

I called the number and couldnt get through until on the following Monday morning, March 3rd, Someone answered the phone by the name of Universal Business Strategies, Inc. On the t.v. ad that they ran when I made the purchase I made the purchase they stated that if youre not satisfied with the product, return it in thirty days and get a full refund. 
I told them that $255.95 was taken out of my account, I sent the product back to the sender, and to please give me a refund. He asked me why and I told him that $255.00 is way too much money when I thought I was only spending $54.00 and something, so please put it back. And secondly wasnt really interested in that idea of making money. He said that the money would be refunded.
By the March 5th, I called again and some other guys voice answered the phone. I told him I had returned the money making packet and that I was waiting for a refund. He looked up the record and told me that the money would be back in my account in it usually takes about thirty days. He asked me if I would try out the 900 phone line at nearly $500.00 a piece for four, three lines for about twelve hundred something, I said no-thanks. He  gave his word that my money would be refunded.  	 
He nearly pleaded for me to at least hear how it works. Comes with Free Web Site, Free to put in your own personal web pages links, personal call counter number, lots of good stuff. I winded up purchasing two 1-900 phone lines at $300.00 a piece. I also had to purchase a bogus 16 thousand dollar merchant type of credit card for $199.99. She was telling me good luck with my new web site and if I purchased the card then, instead of $8,000.00 I would get $16,000.00 worth of credit to help start my web site business. I said okay, let me get my card. She said that she already had the numbers but needed my permission.
On the following month 24 Protect Plus withdrew $109.95 so I called them up and asked them what was it that I purchased, and when did I put in for it. They said it was some kind of protection or whatever, and that I was indirectly signed up by the money making T.V. Show. I told them to cancel it and refund the money. So they returned that money. I still had to pay a $30.00 overdraft charge. 
I have a total of four overdraft charges in two months, and one late rent assault fee for $25.00, not counting all the dead end long distant phone lines they put me through, my total comes to $1,199.99 worth of damages.

Everytime you call them the recording says their mailboxes are full or you get a busy signal another company told me they closed their doors.
If there is a class action against these guys I would like to join. I want to nail these guys.

										Today I notices a 7.00 charge on my bank account from a company I have never heard of before, ""Reservation Rewards"".
I called the phone number 888-688-5995 and found out that I was on a monthly memebership. They took me off the memebership and said they would refund my account in 5-7 business days.
The lady said that I authorized the memebership by purchasing something on ""BCnow.com"", a web site that their company advertises for. I don't ever recall going to BCnow.com or authorizing anything.
WFI Reservation Rewards is also known for charging your account for 7.00 a month by purchasing movie tickets on Fandango.com, half.com and other various web sites!
This is a scam!!! If you have the charge on your account, call the phone number right now! I even asked the lady how she slept at night knowing she worked for a company that was ripping people off!!

										I recently receieved my monthly ATM statement. In the report, I noticed a charge for $39.99 from a company called Verisoft. I did not conduct any business transaction with this company, so I immediately became suspicious.
I called the number on the statement and spoke to a man who could not give any specific information about the nature of the business, other than the company ""provides internet software to other companies"". 
I asked and how my number was accessed and who made the charge. He refused to answer my question. He asked me for my name, my address, and my bank account number. I refused and asked that the charge be removed from my account. He refused and told me to call the bank and hung up on me.
I immediately contacted my bank and informed them about the situation. The bank rep got on the phone and called the company herself. The man apparantly gave her the same run around, until she announced she was calling from the bank. She demanded the money to be refunded. 
In 5 days, I was contacted by the bank and informed that my money was refunded. 
I still have no idea how this company accessed my account and who made the charges. All I know is that it happened without my authorization. I can tell you that the person at the comapny I spoke to was no help and all and he seemed to be covering something up. He was unwilling to help out at all.
So, the bottom line is..... watch for unauthorized charges on your account from Verisoft or else, you might be the next one who they try to scam one over on.

Saint George, Utah U.S.A. ",,888-814-0634,"I Works, I Works Inc., Incomeworks LLC, Net Success, Net Success Now RIPOFF Worst Kind of Scam Artist VERY Professional approach, to provide training from ""Proven Professionals"", working only with serious prospects but in reality, left me emotionally and financially drained. Saint George Utah","
										Note: I cannot in detail describe everything that has happened in this section. I will try and hit some highlights to shed light on the major inconsistencies I have experienced with iWorks.
iWorks calls for serious people ready to make money via the internet. A ""qualification process"" is used to select only qualified people, who in turn, will work with their Proven Trainers. The company appeals to all who are tired of internet opportunities that have left them flat without Hands-on Support.
Their claim is the more successful the purchaser becomes, the more credible and successful they become as a training company. It is mandatory for the purchaser to give testimonials afterwards about their success. 
Basically the promise is, ""HANDS-ON TRAINING"" from PROVEN, EXPERIENCED trainers; therefore eliminating TRIAL and ERROR which costs time and money. The mindset of the plan is ""IT IS UP TO YOU."" Give 100% committment, be motivated and dedicated to success, and they Warrant your success.
The Reality: I am emotionally and financially drained. I feel humiliated and embarrassed that I could fall this hard at my age, especially after I researched the supposed company. No amount of hard work, due diligence, research, could remedy this for me.
I paid up front, $8,600.00 for this mistake.  I do not want others to go through this. I worked patiently without giving up. I gave the benefit of the doubt when misinformation occurred, marking it up to company growing pains. That mentality gave way for me to lose more money because of the expenses and time spent. 
My trainer and I were both frustrated. After a long period of time, he finally confided in me the salesmen/trainers were not on the same page. The trainers felt the web company rushed things, and  prices for services and products were inflated. He was to talk with his supervisor about adding lessons for me after commenting I had worked hard, had already spent too much money and he wanted to see me succeed. After that, I never heard back from him, leaving me short on the original lessons I paid for.
Again, there is too much to report in this space but some details in brief include: 
The entire transaction took place in a series of phone calls. The company name given to me when researching was MIT, and was in good standings with the BBB. When my charge card statement arrived, the charge read Real Estate training. Later I later learned it was iWorks.
After two weeks a company called with a similar offer charging $4,000.00. I thought it was a different company, but later learned it was iWorks. I had purchased an auction guide and that is how they got the information to begin contacting me by phone.
Realizing many inconsistencies, I tried contacting the original salesmen. After four attempts by email and phone messages,  no response. One salesman was no longer employed there.
Promised: Full Technical support, so no excuses. Reality: All messages left on the technical support machine were never returned. 
Promised: Training support from all knowledgeable trainers on staff, in addition to assigned trainer.   Reality: I would ask trainers questions about information given from salesman and they had zero knowledge of what I was talking about. (e.g.)The website for customer support.   
Initial Sales Pitch:  First salesman in the qualifying process implied they were chosen from the EBAY staff to train how to supercharge business without taking years of trial and error. This would result in more people using ebay for selling and accrediting them for their training. It would be a win-win-win situation, for EBAY, trainers, myself. I later learned there was no affiliation with EBAY.
Inside this company, the right hand does not know what the left is doing, or even who they are. The company was not who they portrayed themselves to be.  No one knew the other or what promises had been made.
I tried for a refund. I soon learned, there was no chance for that happening.
A last attempt, I talked again with a lady in customer service. A possible glimmer of hope: She did not feel I had a trainer with enough experience and admitted she would have felt exactly as I did with all that had gone wrong. She convinced me this would be worked out.
Long story short: 1) She credited my charge card $2,000 2)Was supposed to credit 6 months of web payments (I have already paid nearly $200.00 for nothing) 3) She said she would hand-select a new trainer to contact me. The trainer would give six 30-minute lessons. She sent me a form to sign and return acknowledging these updates, which I felt would be at least a chance. This would get my cost down to $6,600.00, and a chance to apply what they would teach me to make money.
Now, it has now been over a month. I have never heard back from any trainer or the customer service representative. To this date the unnamed salesman has not answered my phone calls or emails. AGAIN, this is ONLY a portion of all the details. Every staff member I have talked to acknowledges the inconsistencies and misrepresentation, but will not remedy the situation.

										On July 12, 2003, I posted a Free personal ad. I immediately got 8 responses, so on Aug 14 I paid for One months service.  Before I could do anything I received an email informing me my account had been Suspended because it was ""obscene"" 
Several emails to customer service only got me an auto response.  An email to Cheaters.com's webmaster got me an email saying they had No responsibility or control of their own site.
On July 24 I finally received an email from Nicole at customer service who said she could find nothing wrong with my profile, had re-instated it and changed the renewal date to reflect the lost 10 days. She also gave me two extra 'credits' to make up for the trouble.
When I logged back in, my inbox had been erased.  In the next two weeks it quickly became obvious there were Serious problems with their site. Searches in a '25 mile radius' returned matches in the Old Soviet Union, I live in California.  I would find the same picture on 3 or 4 profiles.
On Aug 12 I informed Dream Mates I did Not wish to renew.  On August 19 I got an email from Nicole saying it had been taken care of.  The next day I received notice from my bank that Dream Mates had put through an E-check on Aug 19.  On contacting Dream Mates I was told the e-check had been sent through on Aug.
15th.
Bearing in mind that my renewal date was August 24 because of the unexplained suspension, I was charged 9 days before it was due.  A call to Dream Mates (a number that is Not on their website) I was told that they simply do not make refunds, period.
So far I am out $24.95 to dream mates, a $22 bad check charge, a Second $22 for check I had outstanding, and $3 per day from August 19th till Sept 2 for being Overlimit. 
All this over an Unauthorized Charge.

Greensboro, North Carolina U.S.A. ",,800-441-1875,AOL and Allied Interstate ripoff Greensboro North Carolina,"
										This rip off started when I purchased an item in Comp USA, in Orange Ct. During this purchase I was offered a discount for AOL for I beleive it was 6 months. I was not explained of the details in the contract by the salesman. Then before the 6 months were over I made the call to cancel the service. Guess what? They wanted to extend it. Reluctantly I agreed. I really didn't want it, but they were convincing enough so I granted the extension. 
Before the extension was over they did it again. I called and they said it wouldn't hurt to try it for another month or two and it was free after all, So I did. Finally enough was enough. I cancelled the service and that was that.
They didn't say anything about if service was used after closing the account that it would reopen it. I left closing the account as a completed cancellation. My daughter had an old laptop that still had the cancelled password and used it once or twice with out me knowing. In my mind it was completly closed. When I found out I told her it was canclled and don't use it again. 
WELL little did I know I recieved a bill from them for more money after the date I finally closed the account. I denied payment after they charged it on my credit card and complained to my credit card company. My credit card got the reimburssment back. That was OK, now AOL has submitted my name to Allied Interstate a collection agency and when I called them they wouldn't listen to my story they just hung up on me. 
So what shall I do? I'm a disabled veteran on social security now and can't afford to pay this bill especially after I did what a regular consumer would do to close an account. I feel I'm being discriminated against and being taken advantage of. Of course I told Allied that and they didn't care. I responded in anger and said, ""Then I'll have to take you to a law office to resolve this."" Their reply was, ""Ough you do have money to pay if you can afford a lawyer."" I was dumfounded and ready to blow up.
I'm on morphine, depression medication and heart pills all prescribed for my illness. Like I need this. I was dizzy out of distress and got sick. I tried finding a number to talk with AOL directly but couldn't find one. If any one reading this can help please respond to this letter please respond and ask for my E-mail Thanks.

										I bought a computer in October 2000.  I got the rebate for signing up for a 3 year contract with MSN.  I viewed it more like a loan which I would get internet service on top of just paying the money back.  It SEEMED like a good bargain.
I have paid monthly and have fulfilled my end of the contract.
MSN has been unreliable, frustrating, and impossible to get ahold of.  Each time I have talked to them I feel like they are talking down to me.
A few months ago, I called to check when my contract would be up.  I was told that my contract would expire at the beginning of November.  My last bill would be October 10, 2003.  Seeing how I have paid my end of the contract, I called October 29th to cancel and get it over with.
My parents also have an account with MSN.  The representative got us confused and tried to verify my father's information as mine.  Incompetent employees are only part of the reason I have hated dealing with MSN.
I was informed there would be a $6.00 cancellation fee.
According to my end, my obligation is overwith.  I have paid my end of the bargain and REFUSE to pay any cancellation fee.  They informed me they will be billing me Nov. 10th when they say my contract expires.  
I already had checked that my contract would be over in November, last payment in October.  So why would I have to pay a cancellation fee if I've paid in full?  They already got the money.
MSN has been one of the MOST FRUSTRATING and LEAST CUSTOMER-ORIENTED business I have ever dealt with.  My person favorite thing is how when you have trouble connecting to their service, they tell you to visit their website.

										Nov 7, 2003 a charge of $25.00 was made to my Visa account by ""JP Media LTD"".  Along with the charge on my statement their 888 number was listed.  I called and asked who they are and what was this unauthorized charge for.  The said they needed my credit card number to assist me further.  I of course said, No, what is ""JP Media LTD""?  The guy on the phone stated he ""has no idea, they are just a third party customer support line"".  I then asked,  what does the company your doing customer service for sell, he finally then said, ""Pharmaceuticals and access to websites via telephone lines"".  
I pressed for further into, he only became more evasive and said he needed my credit card number to be able to assist me further.  I then hung up and began to investigate ""JP Media LTD"" myself, online.  Here is what I found by simply going to www.netsol.com to do a ""whois"" on the domain name.  In doing so I found a connection between www.jpmedialtd.com and another site www.eshax.com, a supposed online Merchant Solutions and Hosting company.  Also with the same operating address as JP Media LTD!  
After looking up the info on the two companies I also called the number listed for the registrar to both these companies domain names, Kristian Meier at 702-369-5416, I got an answering machine saying ""Hi you have reached Kristian and Lindsey, we can't come to the phone right now so leave a message and we'll call you back.  I did leave my name and number.  Let's see if they call me back.  None the less, I find this interesting that there are several ""Rip-off Reports"" listed in regard to this company.  
My bank is cool and has reversed the charge already, but I do have to go through the hassle of having my card cancelled and re-issued.  I am curious, being a Las Vegas, Nevada resident, how in the hell did they get my Visa number????  I have no idea what kind of scheme or scam is going on, but I'm sure it is something illegal!  I know I was only hit for a mere $25.00, but none the less this really pisses me off!  Below is the info I found on JP Media and eShax online:

Not knowing they were the same company, I ordered another cartridge thru ESaver USA.com and was charged for this as well.  I only received One order.  They acknowledged they owe me a refund but still have not sent it to me.  
I recently sent them an email advising them of my new home address and email address, since I moved from NY to Florida and wanted to pursue it more diligently.  I can't let them get away with this.

										In April I cancelled my membership with AOL and was asked for a free 2 months for $1 which I refused. I did not realize they nonly charged me $2@$1 each month but then they charged me $12.95 after I deleted all their programs on my cumputer and I was told it was cancelled.
They lied and stole my credit card number to charge me. I still don't know if I was credited or charged for something I did not nad never wanted. Never sign up with AOL because if you do, you can just about beleive they will steal your credit card number and never cancel even if you want to cancel. I will never sign up with AOL and I am not the only one who got ripped off. 
I will tell all my friends and friends on the internet what has happened, we must stop this robbery and false advertising by AOL.

										I was a customer in June 2003. I discontinued service the same month. I have not received a bill on my account since that time up until October.

The email stated I would recieve a credit to my account in 7 business days. 
As of today I have not received any credit to my account. I contacted them again by email, could not contact by phone. I could not resolve through email. I could not get a name of the person responding to my emails. They simply stated they were not respoinsible for the overdrafts according to there terms of service. 
I informed them that I was not a customer for serveral months now. They asked for my cancellation number of which I am sure is long gone. I am not in a habit of keeping this type of info for more than a few months after verfying debits have been discontinued.

										I was initially contacted by someone who said they liked my site, wanted to include it in their mall, free. I could call them about it. This was the bait and switch for getting a very high pressure sales job from 2 salesmen from Internet Advancement. They promised lots of hits, orders, gave me a reference who said that indeed, this had happened to her site (wish I could remember her name and website, Vickie somebody). They were going to give me a deal: instead of the usual $2000 (approximately) for six months, they'd charge me $984, about half payable up front, the rest in equal monthly installments. Within two months, hits should start to go way up. 
Kraig Michaels, one of the salesmen, also promised me that if I wasn't happy for any reason, I could get my money back. 
Hits had been about 3-4/day prior to signing up with IA. After two months, no change. Close to 3 months, hits edged up to about 7/day. I complained, they said wait a bit longer. 
I finally called, and asked for my money back. I was told that I couldn't get my money back. When I asked to speak with Kraig Michaels, I was told he was on leave due to personal matters and might not be coming back. 
And in fact, legally I may not have much of a leg to stand on. To the naive, which I was, the contract looks splendid. Within 60 days they will get you ""at least a top 10 placement on one or more of Client's ""key words"" or ""key word phrases"" (determined by company's optimization of same) on at least 6 of the major search engines for the 6 months of htis agreement. This guarantee begins 60 days after Company's initial optimization of keywords..""
Keywords is important. They help you come up with keywords, but if you don't know how keywords work in this business... well, lets just say picking keywords is an art. Now, in hindsight, I know that some keywords are so general that they are worthless in terms of getting hits. But those general ones are the keywords that got top ten billing on search engines. The keywords that are more specific--that might have gotten me some hits--never get those top placements. That's my experience, at least. But I had no idea about that when I signed up. 
Moreover, you have about 14 different keywords and key phrases. All they are promising is that one of these will be in the top ten on six search engines. 
Furthermore, 6 out of 16 search engines doesn't necessarily mean you'll get onto the good ones. 
In summary, the promises they make are underwhelming if you really understand what's going on.

No one knows where my machine is although they said it was shipped within 45 days per contract. I sent them lists of locations to place this machine - had one appointment. When I would call the location department they were rude because I was pressuring them to find a location for the machine. They were condescending to me and then I was put on total ignore.
I have called them repeatedly - they do not return calls. I asked for a refund since I have never received the machine and no one knows where it is - they got angry and refused bouncing me from one person to the next in their business stating they honored their contract. But no one knows where this internet access machine is - is it a secret? Meanwhile I am out this money with nothing to show for it.
Is there anyone else out there that is going to file a suit against this ripoff company? Please contact me and maybe joint forces will help us.

										Another Nationwide Cyber Sucker!
I hate to admit it but I too coughed up $15,000 to be one of select few distributors in the state of Washington for Nationwide Cyber Systems.  I purchased only one machine but was told, ""It's not where you start but where you finish!"" 
I have had my machine in place for 3 months and have generated a grand total of $59 (about what I was told to expect per day) and of which I will only see the cash portion ($21) since it has not produced enough credit card activity in any one month to cover the $30 per month handling fee for the service.  
Not knowing what to do, I went to eBay to see if there were any other NCSuckers out there trying to offload their Kiosks and imagine my surprise when I saw two (one for $5K one for $6K).  I contacted one poor soul in IN and found that her experience was identical to mine (down to the fine lady in Columbus, OH who traveled with her lawyerly husband to FL before investing to make sure it wasn't a scam).  Strangely enough, however, she purchased her money making machine a full 10 months before I did. 
Needless to say, I am looking for others who have similar experiences with Nationwide Cyber Systems.  I do not know about DCA, DCOA, Tele-King or the like.  If they are one in the same, so be it.  I don't know what to I intend to do once a group has been identified but I know I will feel better know that I am not alone.  If nothing else, a group cyber hug sounds good to me.

										Maybe some of you remember, last year, AOL began their infamous DSL program. As a member, I was promised by AOL that they would honor the ""do not show pop-ups"" scheme. But, what they didn't mention is that they would be bombarding their customers with a ""pop-up"" of their own for their new DSL program. I did not want it or need it, but each & every time I logged on, they sent me multiple pop-ups. I complained repeatedly, but got no response.
Since I was tired of their onslaught, I decided to go ahead & try their DSL. However, after thinking more about it, I went online & attempted to stop the order within 3 days. Their message said ""it will be cancelled,"" yet I received the equipment within a couple of weeks anyway.
So, I went ahead a attempted to set-up the system, but my Presario needed some more accessories in order to make it function properly. I did not sign up to spend more money.
However, due to previously incorrect billing on another incident, AOL owed me a refund, which is verifiable with documents. So, I held their DSL equipment until I received my credit due.
However, according to a very very lengthy statement on their site, ""if the equipment is held for longer than 30 days, the customer will be billed $99,"" the cost of the equipment. I became extremely irate when I became aware of this.
I have asked repeatedly for my full refund (they only refunded $50 of the $99 so far). This to me is a fraud. Since I have not gotten a response, I have filed complaints with the FTC, as well as, Atty Gen Lockyer (CA), & of course, my favorite website, The Rip-Off Report. COM.

This turned out to  be too good to be true. They created a so-called website  for me.
I was told that i can keep all the profits i make from the web site, (wrong! this turned out to be  a big lie as im going to explain.
This is  the article I read from the information given to the clients
4adults information 
 ""We take care of all technical requirements and hosting while the site itself automatically manages all payments from start to finish - leaving you with 100% of the profits which are paid directly to you.""
I ordered a web site from them and I was ready to advertise in a couple of newspapers and adult magazines, which cost a lot of money, to promote my new web site.
But first I spoke with a friend mine and asked him to join  my web site site, to see if everything works properly, which he did. 
The web site charged him 10 pounds for a one week  trial.
This following information has been taken from my web control panel :

** The transaction fee covers the card processing on your website, you are welcome to use your own merchant account as an upgrade (price on request). You will find that we offer the best fees. Saving you time and money.
We do not charge for sending your cheque"" 
At this point I am laughing !!
This is what they call the 100% present profit I will make, so from 10 Pounds the give me  5.29.
I contacted the company last friday  to report that the web site is  not work properly, and why they have charged me 4.60 for the member that joined (which was my friend).
I was told to contact technical support which I have done, but when I mentioned  ""what happens about the people who join the site and pay their money"", he said ""don't worry its not a problem"".
He did not answer my question and he closed the phone on me.
Then finally today when I checked my web site, the problem is STILL there i phoned them up to complain about it and to tell them that they are ripping people off, and once again, he hung up on me again.
technical support
I called again asking for my money back (145)which I had payed them by cheque. He said they can't pay me back, so I then said that I was going to report them.
He said ""no problem bye bye"" and he closed the phone on me for a third time!
*  I forgot to mention that i asked for a phone number for Technical Support,and he said they dont one, and the only way to contact them is via e-mail.

Activeunit Web Development Company,"  Activeunit Web Development Company  1702 Ski Slope Drive, Austin, TX 78733, USA 
Austin, Texas U.S.A. ",,866-5464678,Activeunit - Web Page Express Termination Of Agreement Low quality work lies delays unproffesionalism and finally termination of website design and development agreement (contract) Austin Texas,"
										AGREEMENT (Contract) to build me a website was signed with ActiveUnit on 1st of August 2003. ActiveUnit's logo states: ""You Demand - We Exceed"". Big lie. Their work is of a low quality, especially the script and the technical side, bad spelling, extremely slow and delayed work, I had to remind them all the time to make proper changes to the project, many updates and changes were ignored, I had to remind them what they still have to do even if that was clearly described in the Features List attached to the Agreement. 
Over 6 months later after project has started and after 6 months of very stale and slow progress ActiveUnit finally decided to terminate our Agreement (which is actually full of mistakes, they even switch ""Contractor"" and ""Company"" places in certain places in the Agreement). Their reason to terminate the Agreement is that I am TO DEMANDING (see what their logo says!) and that they got tired of my ""personal attacks"" on them! 
Those ""personal attacks"" rather was my impatience after they did nothing for a week or two or did a completely incorrect work. That is just an excuse for them to quit since they realised they are not professional enough to create such complex websites. I could go on and on with the story, but the conclusion is very clear - STAY AWAY from this company! Other projects of theirs are either deserted (same termination of agreement?) or inactive or of a low quality even if their design in parts is quite ok.
AVOID! STAY AWAY from ACTIVEUNIT A.K.A. Web Pages Express!
They have at least one more company name and an additional differently named website and their ""European office"" is in Belarus.
More info will follow on the case.

Through email they never asked for anything like that. I was told to call a phone number, in the Netherlands. So I went a bought a international phone card to call them. When I contacted them, they answered a cell phone and simply said ""Hello"". No company name given.
I asked questions like, did they have a website, is it legal to play an international lotto, how do I get my money. They said they were not aware of it being illegal, they were a new company called ""International"" and they do not yet have a website.
As far as getting my money, they said it would have to be insured if I chose to send it through the mail. I asked for insurance company names in the Netherlands.
They said that they could insure it for 5000.00. That is when I said that I was not a stupid american and I was going to report it to the FBI.

										PayPal offers no recourse for merchants of services if the customer demands a refund. In PayPal's ""proof"" they require of merchants to consider denying a customer's request for a refund they require ""proof of physical delivery."" This is only possible in the case of tangible objects shipped to an address. That means if you are a merchant of a service, and deliver the service as promised to the customer, they can still go ahead and demand a refund, and they will get it, leaving you high and dry with no recourse, for no reason other than that customer knows this and wants to scam you, or they just don't feel like paying even though they know they got the service from you. 
In fact, PayPal will allow customers to reverse a payment to you MONTHS AFTER THE FACT! And no proof is required from the customer to request that their payment be reversed. Merchants of services will continue to be ripped off until they change the terms of what must be submitted to dispute a customer's request for a refund. Doesn't it occur to them that the merchant of a service does not have a U.S. Postal Service or UPS receipt?

Columbia, South Carolina U.S.A. ",,803-790-8381,Consumer Research Corporation / Subscriberbase ripoff apparently very wide scale spammer offers of free merchandise outright lie Columbia South Carolina,"
										Thank GOD for another complaintant against these people for publishing these creep's phone number! I am located in the same city as this band of spammers, and even armed with an address, was able to track down a phone number for these purveyors of internet fraud only after it was published by another complaintant.
I own & operate a small truck brokerage company that is very internet dependant, as my customers tender business to me via e-mail & fax. (Ironically enough in this situation, I also receive my faxes via an e-mail fax service). 
While reviewing my e-mails one morning several months back, I was suckered into doing a ""product survey"" with the promise of a ""free"" laptop computer. (I am not only a trusting soul, but an outright idiot to fall for this ""free stuff"" crap.)  
Anyway, after being suckered into answering page after page of ""survey"" questions, I finally hit the part of the ""survey"" to where I had to buy something in order to get my ""free"" laptop computer. Honestly, by this time I had nearly forgotten the promise of ""free"" anything.  Anyway, once I realized I was being scammed, I exited the website, but it was too late. These creeps had my business e-mail address and my personal information, which thay had obtained by 100% deception!
Since that fateful morning, my business e-mail has been bombarded with 30 - 50 pieces of spam mail daily from these creeps. I now have to sort through all of their ""free"" offers & such to get to my legitimate e-mails. 
And of course, Consumer Research Corporation uses every spammers trick in the book to weasel their way into my e-mail box. I opt to ""block sender"" on each and every piece of spam I get from these jerks, but they simply change a letter or 2 in their sender address and it gets through. 
They offer very complicated round about ways to opt out of their mailing lists, which I have tried without any success. Some of the ""opt out"" links I have followed at their instructions havr locked down my computer, causing me to have to do a hard restart.                                                                                                          Today, their phone number was published on the www much to my delight. I called and asked to speak to the person in charge. I was told that his name is Brian Benenhaley, that he was busy at the moment, but if I would leave my number, he would call me back. Of course I did, and HE DIDN'T. I guess that Mr. Benenhaley is a busy man that doesn't have time for me!
I am also a busy man, the owner of a small business that has spent countless hours, sent hundreds of returned e-mails (begging them to stop spamming me) and endured a great measure of grief trying to get these people to leave me alone. So, I am all for turning Mr. Benenhaley and his band of lying deceptive spammers over to the FTC for their fraudulent practices. I hope that eveyone that has had a problem with Consumer Research Corporation will do the same!

										In January 2004 I called to cancel my netzero and juno accounts, because there was no access number in my area. After being told it was not a problem to cancel and give me a refund JUNO decided they wouldn't cancel, but NETZERO did. 
I finally got through to them and it is now MAY 2004. They have been charging my account $14.95 a month for six months now. They told me that they would give me a refund for 2 months, but no more. I asked them why they would not reimburse me for the remaining 4 months, and they told me that I never called to cancel. 
After arguing, and talking to 5 different people for 1 1/2 hours, they never moved on their position. So I told them I would have JAG take care of it, and they were still confused as to what I was telling them. I highly recommend that no one ever use JUNO!

FT WAINWRIGHT, AlaskaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish you file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has  been  more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you  properly at the 800 # , and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/comptroller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										I too am a Victim.
I was mislead in to getting a Web store by nothing but lies
Around two years ago I called about an ad, which said Work at Home Working with Websites full or part time no exp necessary, When I spoke to the sales person he told me that I can have my own Web Store and make money the next day. I told him I was a single mom and I' m not working because I am disabled He said no problem you will have the site up in a day and make the money back in a day after you get the site up and running. I told him I still did not have the money to do this but he went on and on about everything like how my site will be submitted to the top search engines, marketing ads plus 24 hr support, etc. I would be able to make the money back with in 24 hrs and the store would pay for its self .He also told me I will not be charged until I am ready, All LIES. I had to pay for everything. Merchant account, access account, hosting, marketing ads, search engines, act. A few weeks later I called asked for the same guy, they told me he was fired for misleading other people. I told them my situation that I felt I was taken advantage and tricked in to getting the store. I told them I could not pay for the store and I was still disabled and I would like to cancel the lease, Well he told me it was a non refundable lease and that I had to Pay 82.95 a month for 4 years. That is almost $4000 I have paid over $2113 plus everything else I paid out. I have been back and forth with them in last two years. The company was very rude, mean and nasty and would not help in any way. In last year I also found out they went bankrupt and a new company took over. The new company, Irvine Web Works doesn't even have my information, yet they are still taken money out every month. I still have never made any money!  
Let me know if any one else is a victim of this scam, so we all can get this company to pay every sent they took!

										I saw a completely unauthorized charge on my bank account for $179.00 from KMS Privacy Plus. I had never heard of this company and certainly did not register with them or agree to be charged anything by them. 
I found out that they are a partner of AOL so I called AOl's customer service. They gave me the number to contact the company, however, when I suggested that AOL should be aware of one of there clients practicing such unethical and (if it's not it should be)illegal practices, the person tried to blame me and say that I gave the company my bank account information. 
I know for a fact that I never gave KMSPrivacy Plus any information, so they must have received it from aol.  The company has agreed to refund my account but I am canceling my AOL account and I want to file an official complaint, as well as spread the word.
Kim
Santa Monica, CaliforniaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish you file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has  been  more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you  properly at the 800 # , and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/comptroller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.

Seller shipped item (Maxtor 40G Firewire Drive) via UPS and it was received on 5/28/04. The item powered up and appeared to work OK so I foolishly posted positive feedback withour fully testing item. 
Within minutes the drive had died. I contacted the seller immediately (within the hour) regarding what happened. I told him I'd like to return the item and wanted a full refund. Seller (Calvin Tang) suggested I hold onto the drive while he tries to file a UPS claim. After waiting for 1 week I again wrote asking for a refund and was told NO. Copies of all email correspondence is available on request. 
I have filed claims with PayPal, SquareTrade,  Internet Fraud Complaint Center and U.S. Postal Inspector and will do so with eBay.com as soon as I'm able (must be 30 days after auction)

I called them for the first three months that I received the bill and all I got was sorry, you owe this.  I don't want to pay it. It is not fair.

										I had received my bank statement this month and saw a company had charged my bank account through my debt card for 9.95.  I tried to get ahold of them and they were closed.  I have only used my debt card two times on the internet, one was to order concert tickets and the other was to get ahold of old classmates for a high school reunion through classmates.com.  
To find out who this company is I looked them up on the internet and found out I was not the only one trying to find out who Simple Escapes2 were.
I finally got ahold of the company and after about a half hour of being on hold got to talk to someone who was then have computer problems and so I had to sit on hold for about fifteen minutes. 
The employee (James) got back on the phone and I asked him what this company is and how they got my information.  He had told me that I signed up for their membership while on classmates.com. I had asked him again what there company did and who they were.  He told me I should have already received my membership package, and would say anything to avoid telling me anything about them.
Finally I had made it perfectly clear about four times that i wanted my bank account credited and i wanted to see no more charges on my account in the future. James promised me I would be refunded in 2 days.  I hope he will keep his promise.
So now I am cancelling classmates.com as well and will never use my debt card online again.
I hope someone gets MWI SIMPLE ESCAPES2 and charges them with something more than money.  Just for all of my worrying and the hundreds of others who now wonder when this company will scam them for more of their hard earned money.

CompuServe,"  CompuServe  Po Box 28650 
Jacksonville, Florida U.S.A. ",,800-848-8990,CompuServe billing after cancellation Jacksonville Florida,"
										I am writing this letter about my CompuServe account where they say I owe $ 43.90. I do not believe I owe this money. 
I have had this account since September of 1999. I have never missed a payment or was late on a payment. My contract ended on September of 2003. This account has been paid in full.  After that, I was on a month-to-month arrangement. On October 10, 2003, I called CompuServe to cancel the account and the representative that I spoke with gave me three months free. I was under the assumption that I had October, November, and December free. I called again in January to cancel the account so I wouldn't be billed again. The representative gave me one extra month free and told me that if I continued I would only be billed for $14.95 per month. I called again in February (verified by a customer service rep on June 4, 2004) and cancelled again. 
Never once, not at all once did any representative tell me that I was delinquent on my account because I never was. I paid my account faithfully for four years. I hardly ever used the account except for checking emails. They never wrote me anything telling me I owed money and I KEPT CALLING TO CANCEL. If I owed money, why would they keep making arrangements with me to receive free access? If I owed money, why would I call to CANCEL my account? If I owed money, why would they not say that to me when I called up and spoke with a LIVE PERSON when they had access to my account and then they tell me I could keep my account and never mention anything about me owing them any money? I never received a letter from them, never received an email about not paying my account and never received a phone call and when I called them, they NOT ONCE said anything about me owing money. The first I heard about this was the collection letter.
They tried to keep me as their customer, and I didn't want to be. Now they are trying to get money from me that they are not entitled to.
 I was a faithful customer of theirs and now after this, I will never recommend them or ever get their service ever again.
*On 6/11 I called CompuServe customer service to get the address and telephone number of the collection agency that CompuServe gave my account information to as I had misplaced the collection letter at home. I was going to send them this letter.
*Alistair Conway on 6/11 says my Visa expired on 10/01 and that's why I owe Jan and Feb totaling $43.90. He says he cannot give me information about collection agency.
*I spoke with Sharon Simon, who says her complete title is Supervisor and at first she says I owe Jan and Feb. When I told her a previous rep told me I owe Dec and Jan, (on 6/4/04) she says, Oh yeah, that's right. You owe Dec. and Jan. She says no one in the billing department has information about the collection agency. I asked her what dept. has that information and she says no department has that information. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she said she doesn't have a supervisor. When asked who she reports to, she could only give me the name of Joel Davidson and his fax number. When asked for his phone number, she says she only has a fax number. I say, By the way, I called last week and a rep told me that I called on February 21st to cancel my account. She says there is no record of me calling in February. 
As you can see, I do not believe I owe any money to CompuServe. I am getting a complete run-around from every representative that I talk to. I don't even know who I am supposed to talk to. I am sending this fax to Joel Davidson, but how do I know that is the right person to speak with regarding this?

										We, like so many others on this site, were taken in by slick advertising and fast talkers.  We won't go into all the grisly details but we will sum up our situation. We bought 4 public access internet terminals in April 2003 from Nationwide Cyber Systems.  They were all delivered to our house and not to the locations as promised.  We had nothing but problems placing the first two. 
When the other two machines were finally placed, the location owner of the first two machines informed us we had one week to remove the machines.  We now have two machines in our garage and two machines losing money every month because of dsl charges, etc.  
Profits were exaggerated, operational and start up costs minimized and/or left out, advertising revenue misrepresented and commission fees were skewed.  We don't know what to do now or if there is anything that we can do.  It doesn't look like we can sell them at all, let alone get even a fraction of our money out of them.  
We would like to get our money back, but mostly we just want to get rid of the machines.  They have become a constant reminder of our gullibility and a major source of financial contention.  Can anybody help us or give us some advice?

Alex,
Absolutley right, in fact we will make sure that you are approved and then we will take it out of your first wire when you have already begun to process. We don't want the fee upfront let us get you approved to where you are running business and then we will take care of it. So if you can fax in your application we can get you up and running by next week.

if not approved, is it refundable / ie ... can it be a setup fee

I filed a complaint with the FBI and the FTC.  I will proceed to call my credit card company in the am.  But I'm afraid that they will ask me to call this company again only to be told that I'm not listed and there is nothing they can do.

Washington, District of ColumbiaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish you file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has  been  more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you  properly at the 800 # , and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/comptroller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

I am going to call my Attorney General!  I think EVERYONE should! Anyway, that is all for now! I wonder how long it will take for them to illegally obtain my NEW CARD! If they do get that one, then...I will declare war! File a Law Suit maybe! Good luck to all you other victims out there!

When i called Liberty Sun Info Services they were very rude told m that 279.00 is what it cost to send me the information package and that they do not give refunds.
Liberty Sun led me to beleve they were the internet provider from the beginning they never said of additional cost. Do not do buisness with Liberty Sun Info or Xtreme Isp internet they are in it together to rip people off that dont have the money to spare.

										I recieved my Verizon bill on 8/16/04, and noticed a charge in the pay-per-calls section.  I turned the bill over to see what it was, the company Faq900.comZz showed up with a $40 charge for a 2 min call.  I called Verizon and explained that a charge had shown up on my bill I didn't make and I wasn't paying for it.  They said they'd send the bill back to whoever Faq.comZz is and then the dispute would be between me and them and wouldn't interupt my phone service.  I also had Verizon put a 900 number block on my phone line so this can't happen again. I then went to my calendar to see if the call was made on a day I was working, which it was (8/1/04 at 9:47 am).  The woman at Verizon tried to explain that maybe it was somebody else in my household that had gotten the charge on the bill while I was at work, I then told her I was single and nobody lives with me so that was impossible.
When I was all done talking to Verizon I got on the computer and started a search engine for Faq900.comZz, the search engine turned up an error saying it couldn't fine that site name, but this website was underneath that.  So I clicked on this website and it told about how there was a scam going on with Faq900.comZz, and to place a complaint about what had appeared on my phone bill.

When I returned to the PC, the browser was locked, so I rebooted and spent about 4 or 5 hours cleaning spyware/adware crap off of my machine so I could use it. There were about 700 spyware items on my computer when I scanned it. All I did was hit the reset button, I don't even attempt to work around this stuff, if it looks freaky I shut down my PC. So, there is nothing that I did that be construed as agreeing to accept this software, whose sole purpose is taking my money for no service rendered.

When I called to complain, U.S.B.I. was evasive about who they were and their relationship to Global Crossing.  The informed me that they are a ""long distance clearinghouse.""  (what the hell does that mean?)  They agreed to credit the charges of a little over $50.
This month my bills shows over $150 worth of calls to the UK (442073350525) by U.S.B.I. and a company called One Call Comm.  I've done some research online and see where other people having been getting these same charges. 
When I called, I was informed that someone utilizing the internet from my home had signed an electronic agreement to access a site that would bill my home phone.  (horse crap)  They did agree to credit my account.  I've since restricted all 3rd party billing and long distance service to my home phone.

I had 6 calls by One Call Comm and one by Telliss.  I called the phone company. They told me to contact USBI.  If USBI wouldn't help then the phone company could mechanize the charges (charge them back to USBI) so the phone company would no longer be involved and it wouldn't show up on the phone bill.  The phone company said they have had a lot of these.  
USBI transferred me to One Call Comm and gave me the phone number to Telliss. One Call Comm gave me a one time credit for all their charges and said it would take 2 billing cycles. Telliss finally dropped the charges after I called back a second time and asked for their Form 499A Filer ID# and Registration # so I could file a complaint with the FCC.  As soon as I asked for the numbers and told them what they were for they dropped the charges.  
I got conformation #s and names and gave them to the phone company.  They were grateful. Hope this helps you fight your battle.  Careful, I think this is because of an internet virus that can dial to these numbers.  I am still going to file complaints.

										I have a friend who tried this service which appears to be an online dating service. The fee was $49 for a three month trial. If you read the fine print though they have unbelievable restrictions on use. They also have various membership levels form Basic to Silver to Gold. 
Basic membership is free however this service functions on email contact between members, basic memebers cannot send emails thus this level is useless. You can them upgrade to Silver which is $49 for a three month trial. If you read the fine print though Silver members are restricted to 25 emails per month thats sent and received combined.
You have no way of knowing if the member you are mailing has already reached their quota for the month and if so you may have very well wasted one torward your mail maximum. They do though have the Gold level which will cost you a bit more change per month but at this level they allow you 100 mails per month. 
I noticed that everywhere you go on this site and no matter what menus you select they will always place you on a page which prompts you to go Gold after which you can then make your way to the section you wanted to begin with. The odd thing is they also tout the fact that Gold Memebers have faster emails. This is odd that a mail system would deliver faster for one level over another. It is even odder that as a test I had two other members send replies to my friends silver member level mailbox. This has been almost two weeks ago and those mails have yet to show up.
My guess is the entire site is a money scam. I sent their customer service three emails over the past week and have had no contact nor reply from them. It does of course say though that Gold Members also get faster customer service, imagine that. 
Basically I believe this site is a front for a non existent service. They simply collect money and that's as far as it goes. All emails between members and to the site administrators most likely fall into nowhere land and are never seen again. 
As a final test I have set up an account and have now requested cancellation of that account. I will wait to see of they comply with this request of if I end up having to block their charges through my card issuer. Take this advice as I have already given my friend. If you're on a sexsearch stick with chatrooms in your local region their free.

Tyrone, GeorgiaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/comptroller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										I recived an email from Barrister Gani William stateing that my uncle Michael Slaughter was killed in a car wreck along with his family. If I could prove he was a realtive I would inherit his bank account over 9,500.000 with Citizens International Bank  Pic, Lagos, Nigeria.
He wants me to send them my bank account so they can deposit this so called money in my account. He has called me several times and has sent me several emails, along with all kinds of affidavit of claim as next of kin, suppose to be from the high court registry, Lagos, he also sent a investment deposit slip that shows Michaels name on it and amount of $9,500,000. suppose to be from Citizens bank, he also sent me a letter of Administration from the probate registry at lagos state judiciary holden at lagos.
He wanted me to send him $2800. for cort cost, but I told him I wasn't rich so he claimed he paid the fee. I have played along with this guy just to see how far he would go before he would ask for my bank account or social security number. He needs to be put to a stop before he does get to someone that would believe him and get ripped off.

										Today I reviewed my phone bill and found a charge for $40 on it from FAQ900.COM. This was funny to me as I had requested the phone company setup blocks for 900 number on my phone lines. I called the phone company (QWEST) to find out they did not do this. I had thiem do it right away. Do this if you havent already!!!!!
Then I check the date of the transaction, this date was when we where moving into this place. We had not even setup out computers and phones yet and were not home at the time of this transaction. So there is no was this transaction came from this address/phone number. 
The phone company was not willing to help other than to give us the 800 number for Integretel, its 1-800-736-7500. 
I called them to have the charges removed. They did not want to do this, but after I told them we had just moved in and we did not have any phones of computers setup, she agreed to reverse the charges. 
If you get this type of charge, disput it right away can report it to the proper authorities as this is one BIG SCAM!!!!!

										I got up on a friday morning and checked my account balance online only to find a $79.99 charge to my account from a company I have never heard of.  I called the phone number on the charge only to be told that there was no record of me ever purchasing anything from the company (they searched using all sorts of different information).  The company asked me to send a fax of the charges which I did.  I called back four hours later and they told me that they did not know what was going on and that it would take three days to figure it out.  They kept telling me that I was obviously a member if they charged me, like I was stupid or something.  I asked to talk to a supervisor and they continued to tell me that, even though they have no record of my membership, I must be a member.  Finally my fiance talked to a supervisor at this company and found out that they had renewed an aol service from two years ago (a service that I cancelled a few weeks after signing on for).  Now they tell me that it will take 10-15 business days to credit me back and that in 30 business days they will decided whether or not the overage charges which I incurred because of this will be reimbursed.  They caused the overage, they should reimburse my money.

										Earlier this year I purchased (3) EZLINK terminals. What a huge mistake that was. I was told by the sales staff that the terminal was ""pre-loaded"" with 12 national advertisments, and that I would make appx. $6,000 a year from each machine as income from those ads. Also that Pantheon Holdings would take 20% of that revenue for them selves for providing the Ad's. That seemed fair.
Once the machine was installed and asked where the ad's were? I was told that the policy had changed and that I now had to get out and find my own local advertisers. And that they would continue to cherge me a 20% fee for those ads. They also said that you can purchase Pre-paid cellular phone minutes and rechage pre-paid Mastercrds at the terminal. Untrue. I have been fighting with tech support for weeks now to get them operational.
Speeking of Tech support or the complete lack of it. A company called Sitanium is firm contracted by Pantheon to do its tech support for the terminals. If you can even get through to Sitanium you will find a very untrained and unprofessional tech support staff. Leaving messages on the machine when they don't answer the phone is completely usless. Also they only operate

										What a Nightmare!!!
I went thru a pop-up for a 15 page web site and merchant account, and if it sounds to good to be true,""beleave it is"".
I spoke with a very nice salesman who sold me a great ""package deal"" for a 15 page website and merchant account which sounded wonderful since I have no tech about building a website and a merchant account is a must have.
Well, after the fact you learn they are suppose to be two different entities,""So said Ladco when I closed My account and they couldn't take anymore of my money anylonger"" They said the merchant account had nothing to do with the website,"" It was Free"" Ha!
Every thing will be set and ready in 12 to 14 days, ""which is they are trying to cover the 10 days you have to cancel any lease over $50.00 deadline""
Well, this is what I received. My credit card machine, them telling me I sent my info in incorrectly for 2 months,then they changed their system so you could send it, rude service when you could reach anyone or not knowing what your talking about.
There costomer sevice exsist of sending in a ticket and waiting 2 to 4 days for a reply, they tell you to read the 150 page do it yourself and you are the only one haveing this problem.
I could never get my website up and running right because their help is non-exsisting and was told they didn't need cusomer service by one of their Great Employees.
I closed my checking account,sent their machines back ""register mail"" and now they are calling and sending letters about the lease.
I was suppose to be charged $54.00 a month, which turned out to be more like $90.00 which gave me overdrafts to pay. I called to see what the extra charges were, was told it was for credit card transactions, which I never had 1 order for them to process.
I want in on a class action for the money I paid and the overdrafts I encured for their over chargeing me. 3 months of total agravation.
There should be something done NOW, They putting folks out of business before they can get started everyday by this scam. If there is a list who are starting a class action, Please contact me!

During doing research on this I found  in Feb 2002, FTC filed a complaint on Landmark Merchant Solutions, AKA- Certified Merchant Services for unfair and deceptive practices related to the marketing of credit and debit card merchant accounts to small business nation wide.
They settled out of court before being found guilty and apparantly changed their name. We need to stop this from ever occuring again.

										I purchased 50 sheets of their Tattoo Paper for a children's fundraiser on May 16th. They were due to be shipped to me by UPS on the 18th. When I had not received the paper by the 24th I called them and spoke to a girl at reception. She said they had ""forgotten"" to send the paper and would do so immediately. 
Again I did not receive the paper. Mind you I ordered this paper from their website and the $105.00 payment showed up on my credit card statement on the 16th of May. I called again on the 1st of June and was told again that there had been a mixup and that they would guarantee that I would receive it on the 2nd. Needless to say I didn't. Called the 3rd and asked to speak to the manager. I was put onto Maria Novaton. She said that I could keep the paper (I didn't need it now - the fundraiser was over) and she would credit me back my $105.00. She said that she would get Sophia in accounts to call me back. Sophia never did. 
On June 7th I spoke with Sophia after I called her and she said that Maria had never spoken to her. She said she would call me back within the hour. She never did. On June 8th I called again - mind you I am also paying for all these long distance charges as well. Sophia said that she had spoken to Maria and Maria had told her that I had to send the paper back (at my expense) and then they would refund me - well is that a different story from what I had been told. Lucky for me I keep very good notes when I am dealing with difficult companies. 
So I told Sophia what Maria had originally told me and Sophia said that there was no way that Maria said that and that I was making it up. So great a customer representative calling me a liar. Wonderful. Needless to say on June 9th I called and left a message for the owner and surprise surprise never got a call back. I
 did not send the paper back because the way this company deals with things I figured that I would lose the paper and not get my $105.00 credit back. This company stinks and I would never deal with them again.

BLAINE, WashingtonU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form.

										Same as all the other reports - received a bill from Telliss (via USBI) on my Verizon Bill - for a call I never made, followed one week later by a bill from 'Premier Premium Telecomm' for a pay-per-view website that I never saw nor heard of ($ 65).  Phone number 'reached' same as all the other reports.
On or about Oct 15 - I notice some unusual files on my C-Drive (root node).  Upon investigation, I learned that this was a 'trojan horse dialer program' that was installed via the internet without my knowledge.  Virus scan programs did not pick it up.  But Ad-Aware (a free shareware program downloadable) did identify and clean it.  I urge all of you to do this to make sure it is off of your computer.
Received a $25 from Telliss on my Verizon Bill.  Went to the Telliss website and was stunned to see the same trojan horse program install on my computer again via there website!  
I repeated this process on Monday at my office - the file names were changed, in order to confound Ad-Aware, but the same dialer program download!  Today - now that there are so many reports - I notice that it is not happening on Telliss' website.  
Regarding Premier Premium - I notice that older fraud reports refer to www.nationalone.com which has an indentical website to 'www.premierpremium.com'.  Mailing addresses are identical as well.  I don't understand why the USPS doesn't seize their PO Box.
Verizon - North Jersey - gave me no problem taking the Telliss part off of my bill - they seemed familiar with it.  They warned me that Telliss/USBI might still direct bill. 
Regarding Premier Premium, they have received a letter from me threatening a harrassment/fraud lawsuit.  I am serious about it.  My lawyer is waiting for my instructions.
The US Postal Service has an online mailfraud report form.  Since the bills go through the mail, and PO Boxes in New Hampshire are being used, I recommend you take advantage of the service - https://www.usps.com/postalinspectors/fraud/MailFraudComplaint.htm

										I contacted Sprint and Integretel and used this statement from Clark Howard : Web site Fraud Ring   
The Federal Trade Commission has issued a statement saying that you do not have to pay your local telephone company for these charges, regardless of what they say. You should ""refuse to pay for anything you did not authorize, as long as it's not a transmission charge,"" FTC officials said. The reason being, charges for hijacked calls count as charges for content not transmission.

										I got hit with this scam last week.  I received a bill from Premier Premium Communications for $120.00 then got socked on my long distance bill for 97.00.  I called the phone company and got the charges dropped from the 44 207 335 84 UK number.  I wrote to the FBI, Ohio Attorney General, BBB in Fort Worth local newspapers and local TV.  I was contacted by a local TV station who is coming to the house to interview me next week.
DO NOT PAY THE BILL THEY SEND YOU. Don't go to their web site and give them any more of your infomation.  They already have your phone number.  Clean out your computer and start over.  Put a block on your long distance calling NOW and any 10-10 you have NOW.  Call your phone company stay calm and try to get this UK charge taken off of your bill.  If you don't hear your modem dialing into the line then you are getting hooked again.
Hope this works boy this has been a pain and I hope that its get cleared up soon.  In the meantime there are several companies running this scam.  Be carefull and don't try to call their toll free number as you will never get hold of them.  If you are on hold you will be there forever.

										I am a victim of fraud called telephone cramming which is a scam that places unauthorized charges on a consumer's local telephone bill by a ""third party"" billing company like USBI. 
Local telephone companies like Cincinnati Bell are getting rich by billing consumers for unknown services that were never authorized. Cincinnati Bell will not stop, block or even try to prevent third party billing and they know telephone cramming is a multi billion dollar fraud. 
Cramming charges normally appear hidden on local phone bills and in very general terms, such as service fee, service charge or monthly fee. These or other unauthorized charges can be crammed onto a consumer's telephone bill without the consumer even knowing the companies involved in this fraud, like Tralee Telephone or USBI or Opticomm. 
Cincinnati Bell will NOT stop, block or prevent third party billing, and they know telephone cramming is a multi billion dollar fraud.

Cincinnati Bell keeps charging me each month and they say they are not responsible. USBI keeps billing Cincinnati Bell each month and USBI said they are not responsible. The charges originated from Tralee Telephone, unauthorized, unsoliciticed and unwelcomed. Tralee Telephone has many phone numbers and many addresses. Please help stop this national problem.
If You Think You've Been Crammed
Take the following actions if unknown charges appear on your bill:
Immediately call the company that charged you for calls you did not place, or charged you for services you did not authorize or use. Ask the company to explain the charges. Request an adjustment to your bill for any incorrect charges. 
Call your own local telephone company. FCC rules require telephone companies to place a toll free number on their bills for customers to contact with billing inquiries. Explain your concerns about the charges and ask your local telephone company the procedure for removing charges from your bill. If neither the local phone company nor the company in question will remove incorrect charges from your telephone bill, you can file a complaint with the regulatory agency that handles your particular area of concern. 
Non Related Telephone Charges - like service charges or membership charges - contact the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) 1-877-FTC-HELP or use the online complaint form on ftc.gov 
Telephone Related Charges - between two states or internationally you need to contact the FCC (Federal Communication Commission) fcc.gov

										I recieved a bill from Premier Premium Communications on Friday, Nov 12 stating that I owe $90.00 for services that I did not use. They also stated that my phone bill will be charged $1.99 as well for each minute.  I contacted my phone company and yes, the charges are there.  Kind of surprising because I have a long distance block on our phone line due to our exclusive use of phone cards.  
I was not even on the internet when the charges occurred.  (They seem to think they have that covered with their nice little ""frequently asked questions"" section on their website.)
I even have to manually plug and unplug my phone line each time I use and disconnect from the internet, therefore, there is no way I can be connected without knowing it.
If Premier Premium Communications reads this...
I will not be paying these charges!  I will not only be contacting my personal laywer, but also the FCC, the Better Business Bureau, and anyone else who will listen to me!

I sent a ticket (request for investigation) (ticket number 2205)to ask them to do an investigation into this matter, and explaining that we have had trouble with virus's, spyware, adware, and autodialers. I got back a form letter stating that this is legitimate and that we accessed ""Live Web Cams"". We NEVER agreed to any disclosure they say we have agreed to. 
I contacted Clark Howard (a consumer advocate here in atlata, ga) and they suggested I contact all three credit reporting agencies and ask PPC to send me a detailed report proving that we did, indeed make the calls. Ive done that, and of course, have gotten NO responce back via email from PPC regarding the proof.
Yesterday, (saturday, 11-13-04) we got our phone bill, and we have SIX calls to the UK, all on the same day as one of PPC's billed dates, totalling $71.64. The billing companies look like USBI at 888-474-8724, and/or TELLISS at 877-770-2022.

I also received a bill from Premier Premium Communication for 2 6 minute charges of $30.00 each. After numerous attempts to reach them by phone, I finally got through and was again threatened that if I didn't pay for these charges that were never authorized, they would charge me an additional 4.95 per month until they were paid.  They also offered me a ""deal"" of a 5% discount if I paid by credit card.  This company is nuts if they think I would give them access to that information.
We have never made those calls to the UK. We never authorized any charges.  After viewing the reports on this site, I found the virus on my machine that others have reported.

Rebecca
harrisonville, MissouriU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.

Dennis
orem, UtahU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action.

Miami, Florida U.S.A. ",,800-577-3722,"Pantheon Holdings EZLink Internet Access Terminal rip-off! Broken Promises and Lies! Holy Rip-off, Batman! Miami Florida","
										This is the chronicle of our unhappy experience attempting to be customers of Pantheon's turnkey EZLink Internet Access Terminal business opportunity' for the better part of a year. During the sales process, the salesman, Jay Mayne assured us that wiping down the machine regularly and simultaneously scooping up the endless piles of bills would be our biggest concern. Sadly, this was simply the first of an endless string of lies and broken promises.
This business opportunity was clearly marketed to the senior demographic and we were assured that Las Vegas was a fabulous opportunity and we were lucky to be the first into this untapped market as there were so many extraordinary locations on the strip, we couldn't help but rake in the cash. 
My partner Carol and I have made every effort to make this business work. It should be noted that Carol is an elderly recent widow (the first anniversary of her husband's death will be on Thanksgiving day, by the way) who looked at this business opportunity as a way to support herself now that her husband is gone after a protracted illness during which she had been his sole caretaker. She has no other source of income at this time besides her meager widow's Social Security benefit. 
During this entire ordeal she was recovering from a crushed right arm injured in a freak accident and was clearly risking her life driving with only one hand in 115 degree heat all over Las Vegas, checking out the fabulous' locations found for us by Pantheon's locations department. All the locations were miles from her home, nowhere near the Las Vegas Strip (the hot business opportunity location we were sold on by Jeff Cooper and Jay Mayne) and in bad neighborhoods. 
It should be noted that Carol is a 39 Year resident of Las Vegas but her knowledge of Excellent Strip Locations was been repeatedly denigrated by Todd Nechtman, Jeff Cooper, Al and others in the locations department. She gave detailed feedback on every location she was presented with and rejected by us, to their locations department after personally visiting each one.
She provided Pantheon's advertising department with hundreds of business names and contact numbers for advertising. She contacted potential sites on her own as well, but to no avail. Our wish list' of potential sites which was requested early in the process by Pantheon and which Carol laboriously produced seems never to have been consulted at all.
When we rejected unsuitable sites we were made to feel that we were being way too picky and the inference we both received was that we would soon not be helped with finding a location any longer since we were being so unreasonable'. That location assistance was just a favor' and not really required under the terms of our contract, although this was something that was very clearly told to us numerous times during the sales process. Finally we accepted a location in a branch of a chain of Gyms. We were dubious about the income potential of this site from the beginning. 
This is a neighborhood gym and it seemed unreasonable to us that people would be flocking this site to use the hotspot or even to use the Internet. There is no walk-in business, only gym members who would most likely find it far more practical to just go home to use the internet on their own computers.  Our doubts were totally discounted by Todd Nechtman who told us that we should just let Pantheon, the experts in this field, do their job. This was not an ideal location for us, but we thought we would try it based on Pantheon's promise to find us a new site and move us if this one didn't work out. 
As soon as we accepted the site, the machine was delivered to the gym weeks before Pantheon could schedule the TAP evaluation and we could possibly get the DSL and phone lines installed. As the weeks passed and TAP (the contracted installation vendor) was not being responsive, we were told by Todd (although we were not supposed to let ANYBODY know that HE told us this), to contact TAP directly and we would be expedited. 
We did call, we were expedited, but this breach of policy was thrown in our faces later by Jeff Cooper later when we had additional problems as we had now interfered with the process' and we had no business contacting the vendor directly. That was Pantheon's job. We contracted with DSL.net, the Pantheon recommended DSL supplier and the cost to install was much greater than we were quoted by Ariel. 
We were quoted $99 (after $400 rebates which are paid out over 6 months or more of continuous service, not immediately  but we were never told this up front either). The installation took much longer than planned. The DSL line was not terminated at the location of the kiosk but in the demarcation point in the phone closet. Nobody told us to make sure a jack was brought to the wall where the kiosk was to be installed even though it seems that this should be a common recommendation to new internet access terminal owners who know nothing about telecommunications.  DSL.net insisted that terminating the line at a jack near the installation site is not normal and customary and we required the services of an electrician (at extra cost) to put in a jack for us later. 
When the DSL line was finally installed and Pantheon finally arranged for actual installation of the kiosk, more and more technical problems cropped up. The installer was unfamiliar with the functions of the kiosk and could not adequately test the machine. It took 5 hours to install the machine due to lack of any written instructions. 
It seemed that the new DSL line interfered with the Gym's own DSL lines although DSL.net denied any culpability for this. Pantheon always insisted their machine worked perfectly, DSL.net insisted that their line was functioning perfectly as well. Since we never had a chance to totally debug the installation, we don't know for sure, but it is telling that as soon as the DSL was disconnected all the problems with the gym's own DSL lines that started with the installation of our line, miraculously went away.
We were never told by Pantheon that they had negotiated a deal with the gym that this was really only a test' at this location and that they could pull it out at any time, totally discounting our costs and time invested in installation, and also that we would give 20% of gross to them as their split. We found THIS out directly from the manager at the gym later. Again, these terms were NEVER discussed with us and the cut we were told we would be paying to the location was 10%.
Every step of the way we have had detailed notes as Carol has been meticulous about documenting all of our experiences and problems to me and to our various contacts at Pantheon, the gym manager (who tried to help us as much as he possibly could, spending hours with the techs and the kiosk trying to get it to work properly), the installation companies, the DSL provider, etc. We have a 3  pound stack of hard copy email printouts, copies of which we shipped by  priority mail to Pantheon  (and which seem to have spontaneously combusted upon arrival  another bizarre twist to the ongoing saga) to document our case.
The bottom line is that the machine has never worked properly. The machine would not send pictures, the machine would not accept bills initially, although that was resolved sometime later. The very important credit card feature, which we applied for months prior to the installation of the kiosk, was never activated. The machine did not print a receipt. Porn sites displayed prominently (unacceptable in a family gym). The kiosk shut itself down repeatedly. Winston Wu, the Pantheon tech who was trying to help us over the phone, felt that it was very important that he come to Las Vegas to check it out since we had so many unusual' problems, but he was never given permission to do this by Pantheon. 
We were asked to remove our machine from the gym location after one month. DSL.net still wants us to pay the early termination fee even though removing the line and canceling the service was not a capricious act on our part. The DSL account is not transferable to a different site. We are very fearful about installing this machine at another location without being checked out by a tech to make sure all the features work before starting this whole nightmare over at a new location, no matter how good the location may be.
During the sales process, we were told that advertising alone would bring us $720 per month (12 advertisers who paid $75 each month is $900 less 20% to Pantheon  Could you guys use an extra $720 per month?) therefore we would realize $8400 per year JUST ON ADVERTISING over and above the massive revenue from the internet access. Who could pass that up? However, despite filling out detailed demographic information required by Pantheon advertising department and hundreds of advertising leads provided by Carol, not a single advertising contract was secured and the blank spaces on the screen where the advertising would have gone were extremely conspicuous and unsightly.
Pantheon advertising personnel have told us that there is no advertising lined up whatsoever for the kiosks from any local vendors, but that they are waiting for National' advertising contracts to kick in after a few months which we would be included in, although somehow I doubt that any bulk advertising contract with national advertisers would yield any kiosk owner $75 per month each. 
The fabulous income to be expected from advertising contracts was a significant sales point as not only would we receive income from the many varied kiosk functions, but we would be making a ton of money from the minimum of 12 businesses to advertise on the home page. Of course, this was totally misleading as well. There was no advertising and no revenue from advertising.  
The manager at the gym was wonderfully patient and helpful but after one month of being online and having the machine receive less than $6 in cash and several member complaints requiring refunds of some of the $6 received, the gym manager insisted that the machine be removed. By the way, it has been several weeks and the machine is STILL at the Gym. Packing materials were ordered by Pantheon from an LA location, shipped by ground and somehow mistakenly sent to Florida after a week in transit, instead of to Las Vegas. Finally we called and emailed asking for new materials to be air freighted this time, they did ship packing materials by air freight but they sent the wrong size. The base machine fits into the box, but not the stands. 
The company Pantheon uses to do installations in Las Vegas now has made appointments to pack up and remove this machine (Carol can't lift the machine due to her arm not being completely healed) and have agreed to help her move it to her house, although this is not something they normally do. FedEx cannot ship it to her home because by law they cannot enter a private residence and she needs help getting it into her house. We agreed that Carol would store it in her home since we were anticipating a new site, but this makes no sense at this point.
We have written numerous letters to Pantheon demanding a refund of our purchase. This refund was promised to us in May when we initially cancelled our contract within 5 business days (the Pantheon contractual deadline) of the date of our purchase order, May 3, 2004. Jeff Cooper immediately called to say that he was a special assistant to the president, speaking to us on the president's behalf, and who had asked Jeff to personally give him (the president) a chance to prove that he could get this done for us. If we gave them this chance and for any reason we were still unhappy, the president would return our money, no questions asked. The president has apparently forgotten this conversation as has Jeff Cooper.
Unfortunately, we believed Jeff, but failed to get these promises in writing. Of course, after we rescinded our cancellation letter we never heard from either of them (Jeff OR the president) again except upon receipt of the various follow up letters we sent demanding our promised refund. 
On Sept 30, 2004 we wrote a letter addressed to Maya Lazarevic, who was the president at the time we purchased our unit although we learned that Alan Glaubman is now the president. Carol received an intimidating call from Jeff Cooper stating that the president doesn't speak to anyone, that Pantheon had fulfilled all the terms of the contract by shipping the machine to the site within 45 days and that is all they have to do. They don't HAVE to find us a site, or find us advertising or make sure it is functionally operational. 
He said they only have to deliver the machine and their job is done and anything extra is as a favor' to us but not required by our contract. He denied that Pantheon made the  arrangements with  the gym that the gym manager revealed to us. Apparently we are to believe that the gym manager is a liar, but not anybody at Pantheon, of course.  That this was a business involving computer equipment and we should expect glitches' and needed to work them out ourselves. 
The actual wording of the contract is  If the seller fails to deliver the product, equipment or supplies necessary to begin substantial operation of the business within 45 days of the delivery date stated on your contract, you may notify the seller in writing and cancel your contract. It seems to us that substantial operation of the business could be interpreted as something significantly more than delivery of the kiosk to the site to be stored in a locked room for months. Substantial operation of the business NEVER occurred at the  Gym.
We continued to try to work with the machine to find another site after disconnecting it at the gym location, even though actual removal from the wall occurred 7-10 days later, all the while looking ugly on the wall, turned off and disconnected. On Nov 8, 2004, we wrote another letter. This time Jeff Cooper called Carol again, and spoke to her on speaker phone with Todd Nechtman in the room as a witness. He informed us that Pantheon routinely records all calls to protect themselves, apparently from evil, lying, ungrateful customers like us. 
Even though it is totally illegal in the state of Florida to record calls without the prior notification of both parties, all we can say is HALLELUJAH because a simple review of these illegally recorded calls would reveal all the promises that were made to us by Jeff Cooper which have been subsequently categorically denied by him in attempts to intimidate and threaten us. Unfortunately, we actually believe that there are no recorded calls and this is just another in the long series of lies we have been told by the wonderfully honest people doing business as Pantheon Holdings, as there have been no transcripts or copies of the tapes forthcoming as we have requested. 
During this most recent call Jeff alternated between trying to intimidate us by telling us the calls were recorded and threatening to see us in court in Florida' and that we had sabotaged the success of the business ourselves by refusing to be reasonable about sites they found for us, and then whining about how we could possibly do this to them when they have tried so hard to be our friends and did everything they could humanly do to help us. And this is the thanks they get for being so good to us, we were so ungrateful. 
He said we never let him know we were unhappy and didn't give him a chance to fix it (I don't know what the hundreds of emails sent to Pantheon over the past few months were if not notification of our frustration and unhappiness') but then when we MENTIONED the 3  pounds of printed emails, copies of letters and  other documentation we sent to them and which were tragically destroyed in the freak fire which broke out immediately upon receipt, Yeah, we saw all that. We know all about it. 
On our own we contacted another site that Carol had scouted out, a Sports Bar that could have potentially been a great location, and we even got preliminary agreement from that site to let us install the machine. However, negotiations broke down when they insisted on 50% of the revenue which we feel is way too steep considering all our expenses and the need to recoup the cost of the machine. Todd found us another site, finally, on the strip in a shopping mall. We were mildly enthusiastic since it was a mall location. However, this site is a very small coffee shop and it is questionable just where the machine will be mounted. 
The FINAL STRAW, however, occurred on Tuesday the 23rd of November when Carol checked in with Todd to see about the installation of the DSL line in the coffee shop location that Todd promised that Pantheon would take care of for us. Yes, Todd actually promised that PANTHEON would not only credit us $300 for the installation of the DSL costs. This credit was supposedly to compensate us after our complaints about the exorbitantly high and unexpected installation costs with DSL.net, all the problems we incurred during the attempts to get the machine up and running, and the early termination fee we have to pay to remove the line from the gym.  However after speaking to Megapath, the new DSL vendor currently being recommended by Pantheon, it seems that this is an arrangement Pantheon has made for ALL its customers so we are really not getting any special consideration from Pantheon after all.  
Todd stated that they would also make all the arrangements for installing the DSL line, having the kiosk delivered and installed at the new site and that we would have to do nothing this time except show up at the site. When Carol told me this I was incredulous at first, and asked her if she was positive that Todd promised this. She insisted that he DID say this and in fact, she had asked him several times to clarify what he said and that he would not even give her the contact information for Megapath, stating that since they would take care of everything  she had no need to know the contact information. I suggested she put her understanding in writing to Todd and she did this in two separate emails over the past week.  She has received no response from Todd, either confirming or denying this. 
Today, when Carol called to check on the status of the new installation, she was verbally berated by Todd for wasting' a week not getting the DSL line installation ordered, and he emphaticaly denied he ever said Pantheon would take care of the installation, that it was totally her responsibility to do this, not theirs.  The new DSL installation by Megapath would take 3-4 weeks from the time of ordering.
This is really all we can take. We simply cannot work with Pantheon any longer. Nobody takes any responsibility for anything. They accuse everyone else of lying when THEY are the ones who are doing all the lying. Carol is ready to have a nervous breakdown. When I speak to her I can hear the exhaustion in her voice, the frustration over these repeated broken promises and lies. I fear for her health. She has no one to take care of her. The business opportunity we hoped would bring her a steady income in her retirement has been nothing but a nightmare since May. 
Fortunately for us, Carol has documented EVERY communication with anybody at Pantheon, the manager of the gym, DSL.net, LV Geeks, etc. We have over 500 pages of very detailed notes, letters and printed email correspondence made over the past months since the beginning of May. There are also the illegally recorded calls' that Pantheon made without our consent or knowledge to protect themselves, which will serve to show who is really telling the truth, if they truly do exist, which we doubt.   
A Pantheon employee, whose identity we need to protect, told us they had no advertising for anyone and no hot locations' lined up in Las Vegas either, although this was clearly promised to us during the sales process.
One last time, on Wednesday the 23rd of November, we asked them politely for our money back. Since Las Vegas is just opening now, they could easily resell this machine to any one of the numerous suckers, er.. I mean excited EZLink customers, they say they have in line just begging for a hot site in Las Vegas.

										I just received a $40 charge from Integrel on my Bellsouth bill.  I'm the third one (that I've read so far) with the exact same complaint. If they're reaching through out computer, watch your credit cards and bank statements. It seems as though there should be grounds for a lawsuit for invasion of privacy or even worse.  I haven't contacted Integrel yet.  I'm about to.  I'm not too concerned about the $40, I'm more concerned with what other information they may have obtained through my computer.  Reversing the charges just isn't enough for me.  Getting into my computer uninvited is just the same as coming into my house uninvited.

										I received my bank statment and was balancing my checkbook when I noticed two debits for $6.95 each on the same date.  I never shopped on line or purchased anything so it came to my attention quickly.  My statement says internet purchase and from Back Office (who ever that is).  
I called my bank and disputed the charges.  They gave me another bank number to call, which was long distance, charging me more to dispute.  That bank then gave me the phone number to call, did not have a name for the company. 1-888-751-0744, this number only has a message for you to dispute any charges by going on line at cardholder.paysystem.com There is no such address and I have no clue who this company is or where they are located.  
How would a company like this get someone's debit card number?  It's all unclear. I just hope this does not happen every month, it's scary to think someone out there has your card number and can make debits on anypersons account.
Cindy
Charlotte, North CarolinaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

I have tried calling this company many times and have tried e-mailing as well.  I have received only one e-mail reply which did nothing but give me the same status available to me at their website.
I believe this company is certainly involved in questionable practices.  It seems they count on people losing patience with their ""gliches"" or ""mistakes"" so that they won't have to fulfill their end of the bargain!  I can't believe how much people have to go through to get what they were promised.  My recommendation to anyone considering their program is to be ready to invest a lot of time, and be prepared not to receive what was promised.
I plan on involving every agent at my disposal to ensure this company fulfills its agreement.

										Timeline
----------
1)I sent in a box of books on August 19th, 2004.
2)End of September -- I began to wonder where my check was. Customer service informed me that two of the books that I sent in were missing. They told me to file a claim and send in a proof of mailing. The proof of mailing form they provide requires only a date stamp. They claim that they can ascertain the weight of the package that I sent in from a stamp that says, ""August 19th."" I sent in a claim.
3)October 19, 2004 -- Well, you knew this was coming. They say that my claim never arrived. I requested that a check be disbursed for the books that they admit receiving. Which I also requested in September. I attempted to use the online customer service chat agent. Did some work with it running for over an hour and nobody ever came on to respond to me.
4)December 14, 2004 -- Called and spoke to an agent named ""Tanel."" She was quite hateful. She didn't have her microphone in font of her face so I could barely hear her. She did not state her name when she initially took my call. I had to ask and she mumbled it...so I requested that she say it louder so that I could understand...She spelled it and then put me on hold. A supervisor named ""Debi"" picked up who informed me of the following: (1) if books from a buyback order are not in the box (which they were) they assume that the other books are being shipped seperately and will hold payment for a period of time. I asked her if she thought that August to December was enough time to hold the check and she said they would send the check now ($70 short because of the books and claim they lost). (2) I asked about the online chat agent and she informed me that there are agents assigned to work with it. She said she would see what was going on with it. 
I will never use these people anymore...I would have tried to negotiate a credit for the missing books...but as a graduating senior it does me no good. I would suggest to everyone to use a more reputable online book provider like amazon.com. I have even had great success with ebay. Oddly enough, individual ebayer are much easier to deal with than the ""professional customer service agents"" at ecampus.

They offer programs that are Free to the public that you can download from anywhere tricking you into thinking they're legit Once I realized this I submitted the request to cancel to refund my money.
They offer a 7 day money back guarantee and that's a total lie I sent them numerous requests and numerous emails to refund my money I even called their Bogus Phone Number at different times just to find out I was scammed.I don't see how they are still online this very minute.What's worse is people are getting

san jose, CaliforniaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

Paypal,"  Paypal  Paypal.com 
Nationwide U.S.A. ",,888-221-1161,Paypal ripoff holding my money without reason will not allow access to funds Internet,"
										I have been an upstanding Paypal account holder for more than 4 years and haven't had a complaint in over a year {out of more than 100 transactions in that time} and the one a year ago wasn't legitimate. 
I have also been a holder of an ebay auction account for more than 5 years and I have a current feedback rating of 757 and haven't had a negative on more than a year. that's my credible background. 
Recently, {about 3 weeks ago} two friends of mine made note that two different game systems {Nintendo Ds and Playstation 2 slim version} were selling at much higher prices on ebay than the items could be purchased for in the store. Target, Wal-Mart and other stores were selling them at the suggested retail price of $149.99 + tax. These two systems were selling for an average of over $200 apiece on ebay plus shipping. The reason for the high price was due to a shortage across the country and a high demand for them only a few weeks before Christmas. 
So we decided to see if we could acquire some of these items and resell them to make a few extra dollars. Well, we made a deal that if my friends purchased the items I would list them and ship them due to my high ebay rating helping to make me a credible seller. So my friends managed to scrape togther a total of 38 systems after driving to every Target, Wal-Mart and Best Buy within 100 miles. 
I listed about 6 to 10 a day and they were selling pretty well with a 1 day listing and a gaurentee to have them delivered before Christmas. As the items were paid for I was transferring the money from my Paypal account to my regular bank and I was going to withdraw it the traditional way to split it up. I made good on my shipping promise as well and I was shipping every item within 24 hours of payment and in most cases the same day. 
I insured the packages and was going to put a delivery confirmation on each one also but the post office told me it wasn't necessary since I was insuring the items for more than $50 {$150-230} because they said they could track it with the number on the insurance slip. I was fine with this and everything seemed to be going smoothly. I had sold 32 of the systems as well as several other items of my own just to make some extra Christmas cash. Then on Sunday Dec. 19, 2004 Paypal put what they called a ""Limited Access"" on my account due to what they termed to be ""Suspicious Activity"" and stopped all transactions of money and even reversed some of my withdrawals. 
I was requested to send them a good many items via fax { Copy of my Driver's License, My Social Security Card, Copies of proof of shipping, my business account number, proof of inventory for items being sold {ae the game systems} and an expanded use number via a credit card billing they did to my card. I did all of these things and I called them 6 times to try to get to the bottom of this. 
Every time I was on hold between 20- 65 minutes before talking to someone. The first three times I was informed to just send in the required information and a review team would make a determination in 3-4 days. They could not give me an answer as to why all of this was going on other than ""an increase in activity in my account"". I was unsatisfied with that answer and on the 4th and 5th call I requested to speak to a supervisor. Both times I was put on hold for 20-30 minutes and then given a voicemail recording to leave a message. I did on both occasions requesting a return call but I recieved none. 
The 6th time I called and told the person I wanted to speak with a supervisor and not get a voicemail. An hour {I am not exagerrating} later I spoke with someone that informed me that there had been a great deal of fraudulent selling of these systems lately on ebay and they were holding my account as a ""precautionary measure"" to protect themselves as well as my buyers. 
I then informed them that I had sent ample proof of my mailing of these items and told them they were welcome to contact any of my buyers to see if they got their item as well. They informed me that I had to have a delivery confirmation tracking number otherwise they could hold my money up to 180 days ""just in case"" anyone filed a complaint. They had at this point $3471 + held up in  their system that I could not access. I told them that I did not see how this could be legal and she read me the user agreement which has a very vague statement in it which according to them gives them the right to do this without any reason. I was stunned. 
I went through a very long and drawn out process of proving the items were shipped and the woman told me she would not release the account at this time but they would review it and I should hear something in a few days. She said they would email the buyers to get feedback on whether or not they received the items. I said that was fine. 
I waited two days and today Dec. 22, 2004 I finally got an email that stated ""Paypal has decided to discontinue doing business with you. Your account will be closed and the funds you have available can be disbursed by one of two means."" I was given the choice of either refunding the money to my buyers or waiting the 180 days and they would send me a check. All of this was done to me when I had done nothing illegal and Paypal nor Ebay had received no complaints from anyone. Just like that I was stuck with a loss off the $3471 in the account they are holding + the fees the charged me to take that money + the ebay listing fees + the shipping fees. My total loss was over $4000. 
It is now December 22, 2004 and I am searching for help with this problem. How can they do this without any reason. As stated, I have done absolutely nothing illegal and I have all of the evidence to prove it. I even sent ebay a request to look into this but they probably aren't going to help since they own Paypal. I told ebay they could contact every buyer I've had for the past year to see if they were satisfied. 
Anyone that can advise me please do so because this is completely unfair and I am sickend by this entire thing only days before Christmas. My friends and I can hardly afford this kind of loss. Most all of the items purchased were purchased via credit card with the intent to pay them off as soon as payment was received. Now we are all left wondering what to do.

It looks like ""One Call Comm"" is a parent company for lots of other company.
To help you out, I would suggest you call your local phone company and ask to have the charges ""Mechanized Adjusted"" this mean the phone company sends back the bill to the company who made the bills.
Then call each company shown on the statement with fraudulent charges on it. And ask them to remove the charges. 
There was a posting saying to ask for ""Form 499A Filer ID# and Registration #"". I have done that, but supervisors at each company have no idea what it is and could not tell me the numbers. I am not sure if they are hiding it, or really did not know it. Either way, I asked for their address. This may be of some help.

										Timeline
----------
1)I sent in a box of books on August 19th, 2004.
2)End of September -- I began to wonder where my check was. Customer service informed me that two of the books that I sent in were missing. They told me to file a claim and send in a proof of mailing. The proof of mailing form they provide requires only a date stamp. They claim that they can ascertain the weight of the package that I sent in from a stamp that says, ""August 19th."" I sent in a claim.
3)October 19, 2004 -- Well, you knew this was coming. They say that my claim never arrived. I requested that a check be disbursed for the books that they admit receiving. Which I also requested in September. I attempted to use the online customer service chat agent. Did some work with it running for over an hour and nobody ever came on to respond to me.
4)December 14, 2004 -- Called and spoke to an agent named ""Tanel."" She was quite hateful. She didn't have her microphone in font of her face so I could barely hear her. She did not state her name when she initially took my call. I had to ask and she mumbled it...so I requested that she say it louder so that I could understand...She spelled it and then put me on hold. A supervisor named ""Debi"" picked up who informed me of the following: (1) if books from a buyback order are not in the box (which they were) they assume that the other books are being shipped seperately and will hold payment for a period of time. I asked her if she thought that August to December was enough time to hold the check and she said they would send the check now ($70 short because of the books and claim they lost). (2) I asked about the online chat agent and she informed me that there are agents assigned to work with it. She said she would see what was going on with it. 
I will never use these people anymore...I would have tried to negotiate a credit for the missing books...but as a graduating senior it does me no good. I would suggest to everyone to use a more reputable online book provider like amazon.com. I have even had great success with ebay. Oddly enough, individual ebayer are much easier to deal with than the ""professional customer service agents"" at ecampus.

Santa Maria, CaliforniaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish you file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has  been  more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you  properly at the 800 # , and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/comptroller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										This company has billed us for pay per view that absolutely did not come from our PC.  Our phone company also billed us for these long distance ""calls"".  The phone company had since removed the charges and put a block on our phone number.
However, PPC continues to bill us adding ""late fees"" even after we have written letters, emails, and made phone calls to them. There is no way we made these web site ""visits"".   We didn't even know such things existed!  What can we do to make PPC leave us alone??

Later I saw a charge for $79.95.  I called the only phone number I could find, for SGADA.  The phone number in my statement was not a complete number.  I had to look up SGADA to call them. They are the billing company for ""New Healthy Savings (NHS). SGADA gave me the number for NHS.  
The man was un-helpful, I said it was a scam he, of course argued it wasn't.  He said he would refund the money, he hasn't.  My bank is now investigating them for fraud. 
I called SGADA and talked to a manager who defended NHS, and said I had to have gone to their website.  I said I didn't, he said unlimited music downloads was their website, and I didn't read the fine print, and I did sign up for NHS.  
They are just as bad as NHS.  I thought they would want to know that NHS was a scam; SGADA are in collusion with NHS.

Paypal,"  Paypal  Paypal.com 
Nationwide U.S.A. ",,888-221-1161,Paypal ripoff holding my money without reason will not allow access to funds Internet,"
										I have been an upstanding Paypal account holder for more than 4 years and haven't had a complaint in over a year {out of more than 100 transactions in that time} and the one a year ago wasn't legitimate. 
I have also been a holder of an ebay auction account for more than 5 years and I have a current feedback rating of 757 and haven't had a negative on more than a year. that's my credible background. 
Recently, {about 3 weeks ago} two friends of mine made note that two different game systems {Nintendo Ds and Playstation 2 slim version} were selling at much higher prices on ebay than the items could be purchased for in the store. Target, Wal-Mart and other stores were selling them at the suggested retail price of $149.99 + tax. These two systems were selling for an average of over $200 apiece on ebay plus shipping. The reason for the high price was due to a shortage across the country and a high demand for them only a few weeks before Christmas. 
So we decided to see if we could acquire some of these items and resell them to make a few extra dollars. Well, we made a deal that if my friends purchased the items I would list them and ship them due to my high ebay rating helping to make me a credible seller. So my friends managed to scrape togther a total of 38 systems after driving to every Target, Wal-Mart and Best Buy within 100 miles. 
I listed about 6 to 10 a day and they were selling pretty well with a 1 day listing and a gaurentee to have them delivered before Christmas. As the items were paid for I was transferring the money from my Paypal account to my regular bank and I was going to withdraw it the traditional way to split it up. I made good on my shipping promise as well and I was shipping every item within 24 hours of payment and in most cases the same day. 
I insured the packages and was going to put a delivery confirmation on each one also but the post office told me it wasn't necessary since I was insuring the items for more than $50 {$150-230} because they said they could track it with the number on the insurance slip. I was fine with this and everything seemed to be going smoothly. I had sold 32 of the systems as well as several other items of my own just to make some extra Christmas cash. Then on Sunday Dec. 19, 2004 Paypal put what they called a ""Limited Access"" on my account due to what they termed to be ""Suspicious Activity"" and stopped all transactions of money and even reversed some of my withdrawals. 
I was requested to send them a good many items via fax { Copy of my Driver's License, My Social Security Card, Copies of proof of shipping, my business account number, proof of inventory for items being sold {ae the game systems} and an expanded use number via a credit card billing they did to my card. I did all of these things and I called them 6 times to try to get to the bottom of this. 
Every time I was on hold between 20- 65 minutes before talking to someone. The first three times I was informed to just send in the required information and a review team would make a determination in 3-4 days. They could not give me an answer as to why all of this was going on other than ""an increase in activity in my account"". I was unsatisfied with that answer and on the 4th and 5th call I requested to speak to a supervisor. Both times I was put on hold for 20-30 minutes and then given a voicemail recording to leave a message. I did on both occasions requesting a return call but I recieved none. 
The 6th time I called and told the person I wanted to speak with a supervisor and not get a voicemail. An hour {I am not exagerrating} later I spoke with someone that informed me that there had been a great deal of fraudulent selling of these systems lately on ebay and they were holding my account as a ""precautionary measure"" to protect themselves as well as my buyers. 
I then informed them that I had sent ample proof of my mailing of these items and told them they were welcome to contact any of my buyers to see if they got their item as well. They informed me that I had to have a delivery confirmation tracking number otherwise they could hold my money up to 180 days ""just in case"" anyone filed a complaint. They had at this point $3471 + held up in  their system that I could not access. I told them that I did not see how this could be legal and she read me the user agreement which has a very vague statement in it which according to them gives them the right to do this without any reason. I was stunned. 
I went through a very long and drawn out process of proving the items were shipped and the woman told me she would not release the account at this time but they would review it and I should hear something in a few days. She said they would email the buyers to get feedback on whether or not they received the items. I said that was fine. 
I waited two days and today Dec. 22, 2004 I finally got an email that stated ""Paypal has decided to discontinue doing business with you. Your account will be closed and the funds you have available can be disbursed by one of two means."" I was given the choice of either refunding the money to my buyers or waiting the 180 days and they would send me a check. All of this was done to me when I had done nothing illegal and Paypal nor Ebay had received no complaints from anyone. Just like that I was stuck with a loss off the $3471 in the account they are holding + the fees the charged me to take that money + the ebay listing fees + the shipping fees. My total loss was over $4000. 
It is now December 22, 2004 and I am searching for help with this problem. How can they do this without any reason. As stated, I have done absolutely nothing illegal and I have all of the evidence to prove it. I even sent ebay a request to look into this but they probably aren't going to help since they own Paypal. I told ebay they could contact every buyer I've had for the past year to see if they were satisfied. 
Anyone that can advise me please do so because this is completely unfair and I am sickend by this entire thing only days before Christmas. My friends and I can hardly afford this kind of loss. Most all of the items purchased were purchased via credit card with the intent to pay them off as soon as payment was received. Now we are all left wondering what to do.

										Post made December 23, 2004
I am using QWEST. Just recieved my bill, Was charged twice for a 20 minutes call to U.K. and twice for 20 minutes call to Reno, NV. Total cost is over 500$. No one in my family know any body in U.K. or Reno. 
When I called them, they told me they are an entertainment internet site, but I do not believe them. I see alot of other people complaining that they have been charged 20 minutes phone call. The number seems to be common, 20 minutes call. 
Who or what are they? and how are they doing this? how are they ""hi-jacking"" my line and calling U.K., Reno?  Please let me know, so that steps can be taken to prevent them from doing it again.

										Been calling several different companies to have charges removed from my billing statement. 
It looks like ""One Call Comm"" is a parent company for lots of other company.
To help you out, I would suggest you call your local phone company and ask to have the charges ""Mechanized Adjusted"" this mean the phone company sends back the bill to the company who made the bills.
Then call each company shown on the statement with fraudulent charges on it. And ask them to remove the charges. 
There was a posting saying to ask for ""Form 499A Filer ID# and Registration #"". I have done that, but supervisors at each company have no idea what it is and could not tell me the numbers. I am not sure if they are hiding it, or really did not know it. Either way, I asked for their address. This may be of some help.

										I had never heard of SGADA til charges started showing up on my credit card statement 11/19/2004.  I first noticed the charges on 12/15 when they hit me for $48.00 twice, then reverse one of the entries. I contacted my credit union, who advised me to file a dispute with their cardholder services people. 
This I did but by 12/27 I had heard nothing. When I pulled up my statement online, not only was the $48 still there but a new charge of $79.95!  Went back to cardholder services who started the 'fraudulent use' cliam process as well as changing my credit card number. But they also advised me to contact this SGADA and gave me 800-370-5012  ( the '800' did not show up on the statement).  
When I called them I was advised by 'Nick' that he would refund the charges but that I needed to call 'New Healthy Savings' at 646-495-8107 to cancel this. Something about they could still run the charges through for 2-3 months even if the card number was changed. (How the heck is THAT possible?!). 
I called NHS and a very polite Asian lady, 'Karen', explained that I had infact subscribed to 'something' because they had my e-mail address etc.  I told her we were talking about $1, not $48 - not $79.95. She insisted I give her the cc number in order to cancel. I reminder her she already had that - HELLO!  Anyway, I gave her the number and assured her that a fraudulent use investigation is in progress.   
After reading all the reports about these thieves I'd be very surprised if it really goes down like this, but someone needs to put these criminals out of business.
Ed
Acworth, GeorgiaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish you file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has  been  more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you  properly at the 800 # , and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/comptroller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										I see I am not the only person being victimized by these criminals!
I received my Verizon Phone bill yesterday & was shocked to see $189.44 in charges for INTERNATIONAL calls placed to Diego Garcia! Six calls were placed on November 29th, 2004.
The first call was at 5:41pm for 7 minutes = $15.86
Second call, 5:50pm, 2 minutes = $7.67
Third call, 5:52pm, 20 minutes = $37.17
Fourth call, 6:13pm, 20 minutes = $37.17
Fifth call, 6:35pm, 20 minutes = $37.17
Sixth call, 6:57pm, 20 minutes = $37.17
I recall having to delete numerous things from my computer around that time because, once again, my computer was ""infected"" with a slew of auto-dialer software. It took quite a bit of searching to find all the files & manually remove them all. I even had to edit a number of malicious entries made to the registry. I assumed that these were the work of Alyon Technologies - the ones who had victimized me a few times in the past & had sent me bills for hundred of dollars in unauthorized internet calls (calls placed by the auto-dialer while no one was home). 
Do a search on Alyon - you will see thousands of complaints. I am guessing this is them again, just hiding behind another facade.
I guess I am once again forced to unplug my phone lines everytime I am not using them. Is this the only way to protect myself? Apparently security services, firewalls, virus protection, privacy services, spam & adware-eliminators do not help whatsoever. It boggles the mind how much garbage still easily gets through to my computer & creates so much havoc & aggravation.
I will be calling USBI & Verizon first thing in the morning to complain & demand these charges be removed. I am now prepared to deal with the rude, uncooperative representatives I expect will answer my calls. It doesn't matter how rude they are, I've delt with their BS before, and they still will not get one cent out of my pocket.
I will be filing complaints with all appropriate agencies. I will be contacting every TV news station & every newspaper to voice my complaints & let others know of these scams!!

										In May of 2004, I briefly subscribed to a ""free trial"" of earthlink that came with my new PC.  As soon as I was able to download my main internet provider onto my PC, I called and cancelled my account with Earthlink.  I had learned in the past to get a confirmation number from a previous experience with Compuserve where they took me for about $100.00.  So this time I made sure to write down my confirmation number after cancelling the account.  
Sure enough, on this months (12/04)credit card statement I found a charge from earthlink for $21.95.  I called customer service and was asked several times if I was sure that I had cancelled my account.  After I told the representative that I had and even had my confirmation number, I was put on hold for approx. 1/2 hour waiting for a ""supervisor"" to confirm my cancellation.  
When a ""supervisor"" finally did pick up, I was told that I had been given some special ""6 months free"" offer by the original party that had taken my call.  It was only after giving this confirmation number and insisting on my money back that I was believed.  Watch out for these tactics from Earthlink and other internet companies.  I guess I should thank Compuserve for teaching me a lesson in all of this.

										This program is one of hundreds on the internet which pay people to read email. They are currently 12 months behind in payouts and have deleted thousands of people's accounts who they owe money to. They are flagrantly exploiting members by making them hang on and stay active many months after the member has earned their money. They do not make enough money to pay members yet they keep the company online while they (admittedly) pocket upwards of $1,000 per week. 
They deleted my account several months ago, owing me $227.90 because I confronted them about payouts at a forum which was not part of their program but which has to do with the ""Get-Paid-To-Read"" Industry. I had been waiting for payment for months when I went to log into my account one day and found it had been deleted. Their reason? Forum abuse. The ""forum abuse"" clause had been added many months after I had requested payout so even if I had of broken their Terms of Service, (which I did not), the debt should have been paid and then my account deleted. Also, using ""forum abuse"" as an excuse to delete members is in violation of contract law as it is much too subjective and one-sided. 
The owner threatened to countersue me for speaking out about the fraudulent practices of the program owners. 
I am currently seeking legal assistance because there is so much fraud and deception occuring in the industry by other program owners also, and I believe there may be valid evidence to support holding Hosting Companies and even Internet Service Providers accountable for perpetuating and allowing the fraud to continue even when they are well aware of the exploitation.

Tax Evasion

Advertising Violations

Misappropriation of Funds

I cancelled my account before the next month started. I paid for the first month.  I cancelled by writing them an email {that is the only way to contact them}. I never recived a reply confirming that I had cancelled, but they stopped billing me the following month, so I figured that everything was ok, until the next month when I started getting billed again I called up the credit card company and explained the problem to them and they desided that they were going to issue me a new credit card with a new account number so they would not be able to bill me any more. They credited me back the 12.99 for that month, they told me that would take care of the problem, they also told me to send buy mixed tapes  another email telling them about this problem, I did, I sent them 3 emails to make sure that they would get them with no reply again.   
Well the following month I was billed again I could not beleive my eyes.  I called the credit card company again and they told me that they would contact the buy mixed tapes web company and take care of the problem for me, they also found a number on the credit card next to the charge so they called it while I was on the phone with them it was a voice mail number  and they could not reach anyone. I also left a voice mail and no one called me back. I sent them a few more emails and they never replied. Now we are going into the 3rd month and they are still billing me   I called the credit card company again and they are writting a letter, again, they are suppost to be crediting me the 12.99 again I have to wait and see about this month.

										I got fooled into signing up on the musicdownloadforfree.com.  The site said $1 a month would allow you unlimited access to the service.  When I went to the site found out is was pretty flimsy, just a few pages with links to free downloadable software like Kazaa.  Before I was able to figure out how to cancel the subscription my credit card was billed $48.  When I called the number on an email I received I was given another number to call - NewHealthy Savings.com.  The customer service rep said it was the music download or I wouldn't have known.  This was over the holidays and I wasn't able to get in touch with the company.  I read a ripoff report that said that I had unknowingly signed up for 4 years of the service to be paid in lump sum.  When I didn't follow through, I was notified by email again by sgada that my credit card was charged.  I phoned them to find out how much and see if it was NewHealthy Savings again.  The customer service rep said it was $79.95 and again described this as a music download.  And again it is over the weekend and can't get in touch.  After researching a little more, making a report to the FTC and a couple other consumer groups.  I responded to the email from sgada.com.  I informed them that I had made reports and would be going to the bank Monday.  Here is my response:
Dear Valued Customer,

Nationwide U.S.A. ",,800-276-1111,USBI - One Call Comm  Ripoff 4 min call to UK XX @ $10.84 Nationwide,"
										We looked at our phone bill online last night and notice that it was about $12.00 higher than what it should have been (yeah, I know. Cheap compared to the rest of you).  So we looked at the details and saw a 4 minute call to UNTD KINGD XX 441277770100 for $10.84 from One Call Comm/USBI.  I called and they said that this company was know for putting charges on peoples phone bills because they clicked on a pop-up ad while surfing the internet.
So... I decided to search the internet for USBI and found RipOffReport.com and read the most recent 15 (out of alomost 300!!!!) complaints on USBI and quickly got an idea of what kind of company I was dealing with.
The following is my Journal Entry (MS Outlook) recording my experience with these people (the first line is the note on my phone bill with the phone number to call for questions on this charge):
The following transaction is billed on behalf of:  ONE CALL COMM for questions & rates, call 1-800-276-1111
Upon calling this number, I got a recording asking me to enter my home phone number that the charges showed up on.  After entering my number, I received a recording giving me a different number to call:  1-800-472-8889.
When I called this number, I was instantly connected to recording telling me that my call would be answered in the order received (no ringing, just straight to the recording), then hold music.  It was a very short amount of time (less that 5 seconds) before a woman answered the phone.  She said her name was Christal and proceeded to take my info:  Phone number, date of charge, name on the account...  She the started to tell me what the charge was for and I kind of interrupted her and asked her what company this is:  USBI or One Call Comm?  I think she said One Call...  Then I clarified myself, I asked her what company she works for.  She said she works for North West (or North Western) Nevada Telco and that they provide customer service for USBI/One Call Comm.  She then, once again, started to tell me what the charges were for.  
Once again, I interrupted her and said that I don't care what they are for, that I knew they were fraudulent, that I was surfing the internet and found 300 complaints on USBI , and that I just wanted them removed.  She asked me which web site and I told her that I found these complaints on the ""RipOffReport.com"" website.  I was a little short/rough/assertive with her.  She mentioned that this was only her 7th day on the job and that she has heard complaints about these companies and attorney generals were going to take action and other things.
She told me that she would remove the charges from my phone bill and it would take 1 or 2 billing cycles to show up.  She also gave me a confirmation number.
I hope this is helpful for others with the same problem.

										This website advertises a variety of interesting and really cool t-shirt designs, many with retro themes and characters, not necessarily offensive, but funny and interesting.  This looked like an ideal place for me to place an order for my husband's birthday on 1/13 and my son's on 1/16. 
Placed web order for 3 t-shirts from T-Shirt town on 12/13. Website indicated there was PLENTY of time for Xmas delivery '04, based on method of shipment requested (USPS Priority).  Apparently, shirts are all custom-made by the fella in charge, Robert Tipping, though there was nothing indicating that a delay in shipment was evident.
Did not receive my items in time for Xmas, so phoned in early January to see if delivery by my husband's birthday on 1/13 would be feasible, and representative Robert said YES. Emailed again 1/15 after not receiving products in time for birthdays, but having been charged $46.02 on our VISA, have not heard back from company regarding product delivery or refund. Email copies of complaints to the Prescott AZ BBB and AZ Attorney General's Consumer Complaint Division have gone ignored.

										I noticed a charge of 79.95 on my bank statement.  I called the number listed and gave them a reference number which was also listed on the bank statement.  They asked me for the first 4 and last 4 of my credit card (which is a visa/debit card from my bank).  They told me that this charge was from New Healthy Savings for movies, games and music and that I would have to contact that company to dispute the charge. 
I called New Healthy Savings and a man answered stating that he was at the front help desk.  He sounded foreign.  I explained that I had no knowledge of this transaction and was concerned that this charge had been made.  He asked if I had signed up with a ""free"" music download site called Free Music Outlet Online.oom.  I advised no.  He said that when people sign up with that they get a ""free"" trial of New Healthy Savings and that if they don't cancel the ""free"" trial, then they will be charged the 79.95/month.  After some conversation, he asked if I wanted him to remove the charge and cancel my subscription with New Healthy Savings and Free Outlet Online.com.  I said yes since I had never signed up with either in the first place.  He said that he needed my credit card number in order to credit my account.  Then, he asked for my email address, phone, etc.  I advised that he had my credit card number since he had already charged my account and that he must have had some email address for me if this transaction was done online.  He said that he didn't have any of that info since he was only at the front help desk.  I requested that he give me a number or transfer me to the appropriate department who had all my info already.  He said that was not possible.  I told him that I would not give him any more information and would just go to the police and tell them what has happpened to me.  He said that he would be glad to credit me but how could he do that if I didn't give him a credit card number.  I asked him how he charged me in the first place?  No answer, just argumental conversation...  I hung up and contacted my bank right away.
Luckily, my bank is handling this now.  I filled out a fraud report and they reversed the charges.  I am having to get a new bank debit/visa card but that is okay.  They also advised me to contact Equifax and let them know that I had an episode with identity fraud and measures can be taken to avoid any further episodes like this one.
I would like to know how they got my information..They had my name, address, bank card number, and who knows what else.  I even looked up the site just now and jokingly put in my email address to see if it worked and it DID!!!  It almost seems like the companies involved are doing the identity fraud not one invisible person.  The only site that I have ever signed up with re: music was LimeWire and that was last year.
Can anyone else out there relate to my story about this individual experience?  What a SCAM!!!

Seattle, WashingtonU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										I recently had an altercation with a company that had charged an unauthorized fee to my credit card through Orbitz website. I was just wanting to warn other credit card holders out there who are unaware of this (what I feel to be a) scam.
Essentially this company that came up on my credit card statement on 1/25/05 as ""AP9* Connections 888 840 6299 CT"" charged $9.95 to my Mastercard without my consent. When I called, ""Frederick"" told me I clicked ""OK"" to a pop up for a trial subscription to a company that offers discounts to other businesses. 
Two things, first of all, I have pop-up blocker, so the odds are that is a false statement. Second, I am going through some financial hardship right now, and would never before (especially not now) allow anyone to charge my credit card for ANYTHING, not to mention a subscription that allows me discounts on indulgences I would not otherwise afford! I caught it in time, but the next person may not, I feel as though that is exactly what this company relies on.
I contacted my credit card company, and the girl I spoke to seemed relatively incompetent. She claims that because I saw the charge on an online statement as opposed to a paper statement (by mail) it's not technically charged to my bill yet, and until it gets charged to my bill, there's nothing they will do. 
Also, if it did get charged to my bill, they would only call the company and ask them to remove the charge, which is moot because I did that before I even called my credit card company! So technically, I should have waited to call, because AP9* Connections won't get reprimanded because I am diligent in my bill keeping? Doesn't make sense...

Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action.

Grand Exchange,"  Grand Exchange  83-85 Grand Avenue 
New Haven, Connecticut U.S.A. ",,203-772 1460,"Grand Exchange - Gary T. DBrizzi ripoff dishonest selling practice, misrepresentation of item New Haven Connecticut","
										I, won an auction on eBay for a Sony Clie Personal Digital Assistant Model Number PEG-TJ37 from the seller Gary T. DeBrizzi (grandexchange) on November 1st 2004. I paid with a money order from my credit union Community Financial in the amount of $ 198.00 USD. On or about 11/08/2004 payment was received by the seller in the amount of $ 198.00. When it was received on or about 11/12/2004, the item was clearly not as described. 
The seller Gary T. DeBrizzi (grandexchange) falsified the ebay listing 5727842227. Clearly when evidence is presented by several exhibits I have gathered, this item was not as described. Furthermore, the seller Gary T. DeBrizzi ommitted the following facts. One fact is that the Sony Clie TJ37 was badly scratched on the back. Some of the scratches are one inch in length. Others are encircled around a general area with encompass forty percent of the surface area. Secondly, the lcd screen is cracked. Nearly one quarter of an inch along the mid-line near the right side. Thirdly, one screw missing from the device. Finally the battery last a little over eighteen minutes.
I have pictures for all three exhibits explained above. Also a receipt from CDW that was enclosed by the seller Gary T. DeBrizzi. This provided the original purchaser which I was able to track down. Furthermore, her sister lives in Connecticut, the same state as the seller.
.
When I, informed the seller Gary T. DeBrizzi (grandexchange) that I was not accepting this device for $198.00, he wrote back the following. ""Leave negative feedback and get lost pal. That item was perfect.
You are a scam artist and a liar. You must have had one already that was messed up and figured you could pull a switch w/ some unsuspecting seller. Sorry. NOW 'GIT boy! ""
I have proof that this device in hand left Sony to CDW. From CDW to the original purchaser. From the original purchaser to her sister. From her sister to Gary T. DeBrizzi and the from him to me. It was very easy for me to track this information from the serial number which is on the back of the device. The fact is that Gary T. DeBrizzi called me a scam artist and a liar both of which are defamation of my character and lible. Another fact is that this obviously was not as described by any means to what the device actually is. Furthermore, Gary T. DeBrizzi has no evidence whatsoever to refute this complaint. He basically gave me the evidence in the package.
In summary the seller Gary T. DeBrizzi (grandexchange) falsified the eBay listing 5727842227. I want him to pay me to send the unit back to him and receive a refund in the amount of $ 198.00. I have issued complaints to the Federal Trade Commission, the United States Postal Inspectors, the IFCC, to eBay Safe Harbor and I also initiated mediation with Square Trade which so far has failed. If this is not resolved by the Michigan Attorney General's office or the other agencies involved, the last alternatives I have are alerting the New Haven Police Department and the Prosecuting Attorney in Connecticut.

										Our Verizon bill included a fraudulent $40 charge for a 2 minute call to InfoServic ZZ 900-444-0222. 
We contacted Verizon who directed us to Integretel (their name & number does appear on the bill, above the charge). Integretel insisted this was a legitimate charge but I told them I had read numerous other complaints about their fraudulent billing and I would be filing a complaint with the Feds. They agreed to remove the charge and and stated a credit would appear on my bill within the next 2 billing cycles.
Verizon was not at all helpful and simply recommended that we allow them to put a block on all 700 and 900 outgoing calls (which we did) and that we should upgrade from dial up to DSL for a safer connection (which we are considering).

										It was a shock to open my phone bill and see seven calls to Sweden for a total of $210.  I called the local telephone company, who referred me to USBI, who referred me to Tellis, who told me the charges were legitimate.  
Emails and further phone calls have let me know in no uncertain terms that there will be no discussion on these charges, and Telliss will force me to pay them.  Telliss tells me the calls were for internet access to a pay site.  
This is very odd, because our computer is connected to a different phone line, through a DSL connection, and the number billed is a contact line for a support group, and is connected only to one telephone, and not to a computer.  Of course, Telliss has told me they do not believe me.  
The support group yanked the phone line out of my house and refuses to pay any of the normal charges they have reimbursed me for.  This has not only been stressful, but has damaged my reputation in the community as well.

										AOL has a long established history of billing practices which are at least a nuisance when they refuse to discontinue service even though there is no long term contract involved.  They go beyond a nuisance however when they employ a collection agency for $23.90 and adversely impact my credit rating.  I am now claiming economic harm and wish to join a class action suit.  If there is not one in progress then I want to start one.
I was an AOL customer for over 5 years.  When I upgraded to broadband I no longer required AOL services.  I cancelled in writing.  I canceled on the phone.  I cancelled via the AOL service.  AOL refused to quit billing my credit card.  I refuted the charges with my credit card in writing.   Even though I had my credit card account for over 15 years I had to cancel it because of AOL.   Eventually the credit card agency seemed to win because I stopped getting notice of charges by AOL on my now cancelled credit card account.
However it seems I was overly optimistic.  After over a year of not using AOL and not receiving a notice of charges by AOL, I got a letter from a collection agency claiming I owe AOL $23.90.   Now my credit rating may be affected.

										I am very saddened to find that when I used the words TELLISS and USBI in my search I found this site.  Not saddened by the fact that this site is on the internet, but by the fact that I am not alone in this scam that is taking place.
On Feb. 14th I recieved my bill from my phone service provider and was shocked (BLEEPING out alot of other words) to see that I had been charged $140.63 for four(4) calls made to Sweden.  Those calls were made at 2:52, 2:59 and 3:16 A.M. and the last at 4:26 in the afternoon.    
All of the calls were made on 1-31...A monday.  As a first shift worker I have contacted Telliss and assured them that I could not an would not have been awake at those times to make any such calls.
I found out they were supposed to have been made from the modem of my computer, which makes it ever more so absurd because the only other two in my family are my wife and my six year old.
I have contacted my local Co. and they have put the charges on hold for 90 days and I have also contacted Tellis with the number given on my phone bill and they also assured me this billing would be put on hold for 90 days and that they would put a block on the number.
I have given them 10 days for a response from the e-mail I sent, with none coming I am taking the next step I deem is necessary and sending a letter directly to them.I will give them another 10 days + 2 days delivery time for a response. I hope , FOR THEIR SAKE, I get one. If not I will not be very pleasant the next time I am forced to call.

										Ok!!! I have seen some companies that are hard to deal with but this one takes the cake in a big way.
I moved somewhere out next to BFE. and therefor not alot of options are available.
The story goes like this: I Called up the sales and of course I asked tons of questions.. like whats my up and down speeds. They told me that I should get downloads at speeds of 500k/s and in some cases up to 700k. and uploads from 50-70K. I said Cool. I was on the phone with several sales reps and none of the said anything about this.
http://www.mydirecway.com/mydw/common/2way/fap.jsp
Funny they cut your bandwith down if you download or travel the net too much. (most free dial up services do this)
In anycase I bought the ""DISH"" and all was dandy at first. I was spiking at around 2.1 megs a sec then it would goto 640 or so K a sec. Not bad I said.. Then it got bad. about a week and a half after it was setup. My speeds dropped to 2.4 K a sec. Now my speed on upload were still 56-110K. so it was not a signal problem. For 3 weeks now I have spent (no joke) 7-11 hours on the phone between the people in asia (who only read from a book) then I found a direct number to florida and spent the other half of my life on line (not online (phone)) They kept having me do speed test here.
http://satspeedtest.direcpc.com/cgi/launch.cgi?variable=
and I registered around 684k download speeds
A mental note here that is a speed test done on direcway.com so you are doing a speed test on there network.
I told them this and I think it stummped them
That test is invalid. The tec(s) asked why do you say that. I said....
for 1 that is a un-compresed  text files and it is on your network. I am trying to browse outside your network (the actual internet)
I ran tests on these site which when I first setup the dish was getting my speeds they all told me the same thing. I was the tortus. after several hours on the phone and several days at that. what they said they offered.
Broadband speeds up to 500k I am getting 2.4 K they then said that they do not guarentee speeds beyond there servers and made it out like 2.4k speed was the max i will be getting for now on.
I somewhat stummped there tec when I told them I was a netword admin and computer tec and that I also have webserver and such.
They limit the bandwith to user and try to pawn it off by saying that we do not guarantee speed of up to 500k. they never said I would be lower then a 28.8 modem. 
All in all they really are rip offs. They try to run you around and around to hope to get you to give up. More lare

Electronic Arts,"  Electronic Arts  209 Redwood Shores Parkway 
Redwood City, California U.S.A. ",,650-628-1500,Electronic Arts EA Games Ulitma Online Ripoff 91 Month Old Account Banned For No Reason Redwood City California,"
										I have been playing Ultima Online for 91 months, since the game began. In case you are not aware of what Ultima Online is, it is an ongoing role playing game that people get involved with which is owned by EA Games. People spend thousands of hours a year building characters skill, gaining property like houses and pay a monthly fee. My account was a complete advanced account and I have spent thousands of hours per year and time building the characters and their skills.
My whole family plays the game and I have referred a lot of players to EA games. The nature of my issue and complaint: I played a shard, called Baja which is a server, the company has numerous servers serving players from all over the world. I never had a problem in Baja, with the Game Masters or account issues. Recently I transferred my entire account over to Legends which is another server. I did this because the connection speed with my new adelphia cable connection (4.5 megs) plus the ping time (packet loss which caused lag when too high on Baja) was unbelievably better on the legends Shard.
Making my game time experience much more enjoyable. I have been on the Legends shard for maybe 3 months at most and have had nothing but problems with the Game Master's on the shard. They have already banned me once for 72 hours, claiming that I was using a 3rd party program. In this game there are guild wars, and guilds get frustrated when they cannot kill another player or catch up with them, well this isn't my fault that they have dial up or a slower connection. These players in retaliation and out of pure pettiness call a Game Master and report people for using a 3rd party program. You can imagine if these people/guilds have friends that are Game Masters who have the power to ban someone, especially if that game master happens to be a member of the same guild located on another shard.
I have already attempted to explain to them with the first bann that my adelphia cable connection was new previously and it more than doubled my connection speed, they refused to reply and banned my account. I took the ban, and 72 hours I was back up and playing- but this is a highly unfair business practice and poor customer service for not even giving a reason or have the ability to tell someone what program they are being banned for. If you ban an account, you better make sure you have a good reason for it and better have the proof to back you up. This time, the same issue happened, but my account is apparently permanently banned for using a apparent 3rd party program. Which means my 91 months of playing and my possessions which in real money would be about $2,000.00 within the account are to be deleted not including the 7.5 years worth of payments I made to EA games for Ultima Online.
This apparently is how they treat a person who has been playing for 91 months. To add insult to injury, they even sent me an email stating that I have no right to call or email for any information or proof of to what 3rd party program they are referring to. 
How can EA Games accuse someone of using a 3rd party program, without actually hacking into the persons computer and finding it? 
Please under stand that I am not nieve and I certainly have computer experience behind me. If they decided to take it upon themselves hack my gaming computer, then I certainly would like to know this as I will proceed to file criminal charges with my attorney. If they cannot bring proof upfront of the 3rd party program they accuse me of, then I believe I am innocent until proven guilty and my account should be reinstated with an apology.  My 91 month old account should be immediately reinstated with an apology in writing. Or they should send me a reimbursement of my money for the 7.5 years of billing that I have given to EA games.
I will also mention that There is no way to even to speak with anyone in EA games in regards to this issue. I feel I have been completely discriminated over this matter.

We respectfully ask that you please do not phone or email Electronic Arts regarding this matter from this point forward.

I am not the only one that they have banned just for an alleged 3rd party program. I am like one of the people that will speak out and I know there is alot of others that hasn't pushed this issue as they should have.So I am taking my rights of speech and expression in advising people how EA games has treated a dedicated 91 month account. They have threatened not to contact them in these regards because they cannot back their reasoning up without actually hacking into a persons computer and physically finding the program.
I AM UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THEY THINK THE 3RD PARTY PROGRAM IS A SPEED HACK WHEN I AM ACTUALLY USING HIGH SPEED CABLE MODEM FROM ADELPHIA WHICH IS ADVERTISED AS 4 MEGS BUT I GET 4.5 MEGS--THANK YOU ADELPHIA
I only can think that this so called 3rd program is being mistaken for my lightening fast connection speed of 4.5 megs. This is outrageous and ridiculous!!

Victorville, CaliforniaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action.

No. I did not renew any order for Ancestory.com or MyFamily services, but I was charged for a year in spite of this and the fact that I additionally had cancelled a year ago not more than a month after trial and was thereafter contacted by email and telemarketers, all of whom I informed of the above and that I was unlawfully billed over and over. 
I continues get email subscription billing confirmations and was continuously charged, so , I wrote the main company and informed all of the situation whenever they contacted me. I mentioned I was so dissatisfied with this problem that I regret ever considering a site visit to this unethical company that continues to charge me for a service I cancelled not more than a month after trying it last year!!! 
This company should reimberse me for this and if it does not I will take every measure availible, including leagal services to see that I am properly reimbursed for this and never improperly charged by this unlawful company again! Please be informed that this company has violated several consumer and financial laws and can be held accountable for those actions. I have kept copies of all contact and can prove this.

										I was looking over my Verizon bill from January and noticed a charge from USBI on behalf of One Call Comm to the UK. I had no idea on what this company was so I decided to call. They told me it was for internet acess to one of the sites they had. I asked which one, I of course first suspected my husband had been ""exploring"" adult websites and ""forgetting"" to tell me. The woman said she couldnt tell me, it wasnt in there system. 
So I called my husband ( he is deployed in Florida right now ) and gave him the worst chewing out he had had in a while. I come online to see what kind of stuff the company does and the only site I found was this one. I read how other people were going through the exact same thing and I re called USBI and they told me I would have to call my provider and they could tell me how to bring up the site it was from my computers memory. 
Well, I have a system washing software that would have done away with anything like that. So I am gonna try it out, maybe this software isnt as affective as it says. Verizon says they are aware of the problem, even though I dont know what they are doing about it. I blocked 3rd party billing to prevent this from happening again. I dont know how they got my info to begin with.

Chula Vista, CaliforniaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										In January I noticed a charge of $16,95 on my local phone bill from Orbit Telecom.  When I inquired with my phone company they told me it was an internet voice messaging service and told me that they had no control over this charge and that I must take it up with Orbit.  I called the phone number on the bill and was told that the service was ordered in October 2004.  
They gave me the exact date and time of day of the request to activate this service.  They then told me that this request had been made by a woman I had never heard of but was told that was the name on the account.  I explained that I had not ordered this and told them that I thought it was fraudulent.  
They told me that they could only credit the latest invoice but I demanded a full refund and was eventually told that I would be refunded but that it could take several billing cycles.  I again had the charge on my February bill but 3 months of credit were also on the bill.  I inquired and again was told that since I requested the credit in the middle of a billing cycle that they could not stop the February billing and was assured that I would again be credited for this amount next month.  We'll see.  
A tip: look at your phone bill closely.  This got past us for 3 months before we noticed it.  It blended in with all the other charges very nicely.

										I would like to know if anyone has heard of a company posting on CareerBuilder.com about a job where people send you money for software and you wire it to germany.  I received an email about a job opportunity it sounded good so I sent for the contract and looked it over and everything sounded legit. I had contact through email everday so I thought everything was good.  Then it happened.  I received my first check from Qchex.com and emailed the company who then in turn gave me instructions to Western Union the money to an individual in the United Kingdom which I did.  
Then just the other day I recieved a not so good phone call from my bank telling me that the check was no good and that I needed to make arrangements to pay back my bank the money in the sum of $1,600.00 or I was looking at fraud charges.  I said What I could not believe that this was happening to me.  All I did was post my resume with a very well known CareerBuilder.com and recieved this email.  I was only looking for a better job not looking to getting scammed and my life being upheaved. 
When I was notified by may bank yesterday I tried to send an email to the address I had been using for the past 2 weeks the email was returned to me by mailer deamon and it said that they were not accepting any email from my address. I found out this was a scam when I typed Qchex in a search and up came the Website ripoffs.com so I started looking around and that is when I came to a complaint similar to mine from a Steve in LongBeach California who had a similar thing happen with a company name Teledin Sys in Frankfurt Germany.  I have saved all my emails and correspondance I have had with them.  
Today I received another Qchex from a Todd Thomas.  I also have other names that they told me would be sending me checks.  Good thing I never throw anything away.  I am looking for some help in either getting the money back that I have to pay (that I do not have) or getting some kind of justice.

Miami, Florida U.S.A. ",,800-5773722,Pantheon DBA EZ Link Internet Machine Ripoff deceived and lied Miami Florida,"
										Ok, people this is a HUGE rip off.  I purchased one machine in late August early September in 2004.  I STILL DON'T HAVE A MACHINE!  I knew I was in trouble when 2 weeks after paying the $19,800, the lady that was so kind and ""helpful"" in selling me the machine no longer worked there.  I don't want to go into great details here, but just know that I have an attorney in Florida that is considering suit.  I have talked to Jeff (cooper ?) Cuba several times.   He only tries to make ME feel like I'm the jerk, impatient company owner.  
After nearly 6 weeks of not getting my machine, I stared noticing that people were no longer working there that had been working on locating a place for me.  It all started right after they got my money.  The locator said he would call me back in a couple of days to give a great location... he never called.  He no longer works there.  I was finally given to another locator that called me a couple of times...then disappeared.  He no longer works there.  I was given to a 3rd locator...  he called and we talked a couple of times.  He offered me a location at a DRIVE UP COFFEE STAND!  I said no thanks... he stopped calling and now he no longer works there.  I tried was days and days to reach, and left message after message for Sonya (the locations manager I guess), but she wouldn't return my calls either.  By now I knew I was in trouble.  
One person told me that the reason I didn't have a machine was because a typhoon (or something like that) had destroyed the company in Taiwan where the machines where made, and it would take a few weeks to get caught up.  Jeff Cuba told me later (like in late Nov) that a hurricane had stopped work on the machines where they were made in JAPAN!  I knew they were just trying to cover their butts because of what the aggreement state on item 1.  I told Jeff that since I hadn't received my machine in the 30 days that the aggreement directed, that I was intitled to a refund.  He argued with me for a while and then said ""Well, it doesn't matter anyway because the FTC gives us 90 days to deliver.""  I was shocked!  Then, a few days before Christmas, I get a call out of the blue from Sonya.  She acted like we were the best of friends and that everything was just peachy keen.  She tells me that they have a location for me in a Mexican deli.  If I was interested I should go look at it and then let them know.  Then she said something that was very curious... ""If you don't feel safe there, just let us know.""  I didn't think so much about this statment until later.  This was a Wednesday.  I told her that I wouldn't be able to look at it until the weekend.  She called back a couple days later and asked if I had seen it... she really wanted me to make a decision.  I said no.  
On Monday, she called me again.  Over the weekend I did go see the place, and it was some kind of terrible hole in the wall!  I would have put a $20 machine there much less a $20,000 there.  I told her no thanks.  Two days later, my wife and I came home from a late appointment and were shocked to see several large boxes sitting on our porch.  I had no idea what it was.  On further inspection, it was the EZ link machine!!!  I couldn't believe it.  Now Jeff's converstaion to me about having 90 days to get it to me was as clear as a bell.  Too bad, though, because they were about 4 days late!!!  Now that I saw the boxes on my porch, I couldn't believe what kind of sleezy terrible company Pantheon was and is.  They couldn't care less about me as a ""customer"".  They didn't tell me they were sending the machine and THAT was why they wanted me to make a quick decision about the location.
The most recent is that a new person has now been working on finding me a location.  His name is Elmer.  He seems like a decent fellow.  I have accepted a location on a place about 2 hours from my house.  I am a whopped puppy! They have had my money for 7 months, and I make payment on the 2nd mortgage I took out to get the machine.  I'm not making any money, so I really don't know what to do.  My attorney in Miami says that I have a real case, but even if I win, Pantheon may not pay, and I could just loose more money of attorney's fees.  I would LOVE to file a class action law suit against Allen Gluabman (president), Jeff Cuba, or Cooper whatever his name is, Ernest Borgnie, Sonya, and everyone else there.  But, I don't have the money to really go for it!!  I would love to hear from everyone who is in the middle of a ""fight"" with Pantheon.

										I was paying bills when I noticed a sharp increase in my phone bill.  There was an additional charge from ILD Teleservices, Inc. for $15.40.  The detailed explanation of the charge claims that some type of Email service was provided by Memeber's Edge, LLC.  I called their 800 number to ask what and who they were and who in the world had authorized the account for services.  I was on hold for about six minutes when someone picked up only to disconnect me.  I called back slightly more angry and waited patiently for over ten minutes to finally speak to a woman who's first language certainly wasn't English.  I asked her about the charges and she insisted that I had ""clicked"" on their site and for that I was responsible for a set-up fee for the account and now I must pay monthly to maintain their services.  I asked to speak to her manager and she reluctantly transferred me.  The number just led to a voice mail where I left some choice words about my ludicrous ordeal and the ""quality"" of their customer service.
I've called back many times and demanded to cancel the account and to have the charges dropped, but they are steadfast in the position that I still owe for their services for the initial set-up and then one month's maintenance also.  I refuse to pay.  I had never even heard of ILD Teleservices or Memeber's Edge before receiving a bill from them.  In fact, out of curiosity, I typed in their name in my yahoo search only to find tons of sites dedicated to complaints, claims, and other people, like me, who have been ripped off by this company.  Some of the claims were from as far back as 2002.  It would seem that nothing at all has been done about this company over the years.  I hope to change that very soon.

Registered SMS.ac members authorize SMS.ac to send invitations to self-designated contacts of their address book, in return for a number of daily free messages that can be used on SMS.ac.  No invitations can be sent out, without the registrant first providing SMS.ac with a legitimate email account AND that accounts corresponding password   By providing these, the new member is entitled to communicate with the invited member via daily allowances of free text messaging it's a win-win scenario. The registrant is able to invite all, some, or none of the contacts in their address book to sign-up at SMS.ac.
=====================NOW TO THE ORIGIONAL REPORT THAT WAS FILED 
=====================
SMS.ac, Inc. has sent email to me, the Email said they've sent the email on the behalf of my friend and asking to register. It's all fake. Even if you don't recognize the name of your invitor friend(Most you will not recognize) 
The email said 
""Don?t recognize the name above? Click the link above to learn more about the friend who invited you or to block future invitations.""
The link will bring you to only register page. And in the register page they need you to give hotmail.com account number only(You can try other email server, it will ask you for hotmail.con again and again). 
Then the suspicious asking HOTMAIL PASSWORD page will appear. They claim that they will help us to login to our account and automatically distribute SMS.ac advertising to our address book list from Hotmail. However, I tried to give the fake password and they said they can well communicate with my account. For my opinion, they didn't check anything, just record our Hotmail account and password for their future use! Sound not good.

										This guy is a seller on ebay and also runs an internet based store selling DVD's, CD's, etc. 
I used the ""Buy It Now"" feature on ebay to purchase a new DVD (Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival). 3 weeks (and several unanswered emails and phone calls) later I still don't have the DVD and haven't been able to reach Mr. Lecarl Butler.
As an ebay seller he has ripped off many other people, which is proven by his low positive feedback rating and feedback left by others. He also has an internet based store with which I'm sure he uses the same scam: Take the money and don't send the items.

										When I receive my phone bill, I noticed that it was way to high. As my normal bill runs around $30.00, and this one was $296.02. When I was looking to find out why, this was when I found 3 calls to Dallas TX and 2 Calls to Reno NV totaling $119.38, 1 call to the United Kingdom for $9.07, and 2 calls to InfoServicZZ totaling $123.29. I do not know any one who lives in these places and had never heard of InfoServicZZ before. 
So I call the SBC where I have my service from, and was told that I had to pay for these calls or they would send the bill to Collections and the phone would be shut off. That I had to call the billing company about the calls. So this is what I did. But when I tried calling Integretel using the number that was on my bill for them I got a recorded message saying that calls from my area code was blocked. So I tried the number from one of the complaints that was listed here on RipoffReport.com. I was able to talk to them. The woman that I talked to said her name was Monica she was trying to tell me that I accepted their terms and downloaded their program from the Internet. When I told her that I did not download anything and that I knew nothing about this. and want these charges taken off my bill. She tried tell me that I had to pay them because I downloaded it. I told her that No I did not download anything, and that I had done some checking on them and was looking at a website at that time, and told her the name was on RipoffReport.com and that there was 290 complaints filed on this company and that I knew that it was a scam, and that I wanted to talk to a supervisor now. 
After a couple of minutes a man who said his name was Tyler came on the phone. He again tried to tell me that I had done this and would have to paid the bill. I said No I Did Not do this and I am not going to pay for this. That they had better take these charges off of my bill. He kept trying to tell that I was going to have to pay it. Then when I told him about the complaints on RipoffReport.com and that there was 290 of them, and that I knew that this was a scam he told me that he could credit me back 50%, but I told him no you will credit me with 100% of these charges. he tried again to get me to only take 50% but I refused and said the only thing I was going to accept was 100%. So this is what he gave me. He told me that they had traces the calls back to my phone line. When I started to question him about them tracing the calls. He told me that they use the 911 database to get their information. So when they ask for your address they already have all this information on people. I told him that I was going to contact the Better Business Bureau, the FCC. Also told him that I was going to call the President, the Governor, the Mayor, and Big Moe. I wonder how much money I have paid you on your Rip Off Scam already.
So now I will see if they really did take these charges off or not.

										I don't frequently check every single transaction on my check card statement to make sure they are all legit, but I noticed a charge of $6.95 from ""WPI*IFriends"" in Florida this month. I went onto my internet banking site and went back as far as I could (October) and found that the charge has been re-occuring, always in the ammount of $6.95.
Getting information off of ripoffreport.com, I found the company's customer service number and called it. The gentleman that I talked to was actually very helpful and confirmed a bunch of information with me, much of which was obviously inconsistant with my own real information. And for some reason, the only information he could give me for when the charges started was ""last year""...
The gentleman told me that he would refund my money for as far back as he could, but that apparently only encompasses 4 months for some reason! From my bank statement, I could see that it started at LEAST 7 months ago. I want ALL of my money back, not just 4 months worth!!
Can anybody help me here?
Todd
Cincinnati, OhioU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										Don't believe this company they promise to design you web sites based on the package you purchase.  I purchased the $149.00 one but they reduced the price to $99.00 because I told them I couldn't afford to pay that.  It sounded like an excellent deal but they never mentioned that you have to advertise your sites and it is not free.  
They quarantee that if you do not make money within 90 days they will refund the $99.00 but that is not true they only quarantee that they will direct traffic to your sites that doesnt mean you will make any money doing it like they promise.  I have been a member for 2 months and haven't received a penny.  Lost $99.00 on this investment.  stay away from this company it is to good to be true.

										RipOffReport,
For many months the management along with administration of the Friendfinder.com network attempted to refuse federally vested authorized witness orders to indepthly investigate a group of scamming members... It is true that these participants are nuisances witnessed out of sorts as logged in online often.
You need to know that James D an abuse team personnel that has been shown while being arrested on national news in pastimes has given in to this attempted scam. There is accomplices within the management or administration of different departments of the corporation... The orders were given to investigate down to the click and profile of each who attempted to hinder others while wanting to dominate at forum club boards throughout the entire winter again without acceptance needed by others.
In return without effectiveness mandatory by law/regulations instated James D attempted to block then delete the 14th Most Popular Male account. There has been three attempts to this day that began less than a month ago... Each time those employees were witnessed mis-using the United States Congres Approved internet safeguarding systems. Today, there has been an intense investigation newly underway into the aims or intentions of formerly arrested James D and partners!
The internet system functioned flawlessly the entire time while having the illegal mentor man turned in! The letterheads are surely to be sent all over as the incident was effectively scored a National Security Breach by an individual qualified to do so... In the future of all things unwanted federally vested witnesses rated decades like myself may have to travel going to those corporate offices in California! The round trip airfare quite expensive along with air miles of 988 in distance will take a bit of study time. Once there additional expenses unwanted would predicictably be high for motel accomodations along with rental car... Compared to high dollar traveling costs the Friendfinder.com memberships offered are nominal at full annual rate no matter what options exist.
These suspects officially named as Prime Suspects appropriately named during the more swift progressive investigation should be punished. The two in significant trouble have recent as yesterday been sending bogus e-mail to a protected student e-mailbox as creeps... The criminal charges as the two still attempt to illegally block or delete protected student works they will never get away with is piling quick. Government costs to thoroughly investigate the scam before giving online viewable probation could be high... It could be astonishing how the qualified agency/media investigation will total now looking into the professionals inadequate conduct! What about microsoft?
This story immediately qualifies to be included in national level televised news reports at all times throughout the next days. Of all things James D is looking at is the most severe punishment for attempting to mess with that protected longtime rated student account as this World's Record Witness is to be officially awarded full reward plus like aired in approved agency released series media reports because this student avidly goes to the Dallas Central Library... There was utmost illegal attempts to entice/ slander/ taunt/ threaten all over the Friendfinder.com left by many out of controll attempting to hide their scheme attempted anything! These outcomes...

""Iron Clad, No Questions Asked, 100% Risk-Free Money Back Guarantee for 90 Days! If at any time ""Creating Abundance"" fails to live up to your expectationslet me know and we'll promptly issue you a full refund. No questions. No hassles.

Anyway, based on this guarantee, I bought the software and tried it but it didn't work for me so I emailed Mr. Bauer requesting for a refund according to his guarantee above.  He did not honor the guarantee. I emailed him a few times but did not get a response back. I reported him/his company to the Better Business Bureau and they did not get a response from him/his company either. So that's the end of the story.
If Mr. Bauer does not want to issue refunds, then why offer a guarantee in the first place.

I told them I did not authorize this charge and they told me to call my credit card company to do a dispute.

I had my sister call back and they said they don't issue refunds.
Right now I have a conditional dispute with my credit card company. If they can't help me I am going to the Better Business Bureau.
Because of this I am no longer going to visit Classmates.com. I think they do this on purpose to rip people off, because when I called it sounded like it was rehearsed and they have been through it many times before.

Going to Who is database, both have an address listed as 620 Park Ave. #378 Rochester, NY 14607.  
In their Legal Notice section, they list Roc Telecommunications and more research into registered NY businesses & corporations, Roc Telecommunications lists an address of 460 State St. Ste. 302 Rochester, NY 14608-1743.  Unfortunately no phone number was listed.  Ironically enough, the original filing date of Roc Telecommunications is April 1, 2003. 
It's too bad that I didn't know about Rip off Report before this ordeal; I could have saved myself $30 bucks and some dignity.  I doubt that I (or anyone who has lost money on this) will get a refund, but maybe someone who lives in the Rochester area can track them and give them the shakedown they deserve!

										On my latest phone bill from SBC there was a charge from Integretel in the amount of $45.21 for a call supposedly made on 4-30 at 4:33 PM (I wasn't even home at that time on that day)! Under place called, InfoServic ZZ was listed, phone number 900 444-0308. This 11 minute call totaled $43.89 plus $1.32 tax for a total of $45.21!!  Bogus crap!
I did a web search for Integretel InfoServic ZZ and was found this site and the 300+ complaints against Integretel. Obviously Integretel has been at this for a long time! I called their 1-800 number (1 800 736-7500) to dispute the charges. The person I talked to admitted right off that it was a dialing program that had done this! I told them that I wasn't even home at the time that call was ""supposedly"" made, that my computer had been hijacked by a spyware program and it must have been the cause. Told them that I was the only person who used my computer.
They offered to block the number from my phone line so that no more charges could be incurred. I had to say HEY WAIT A MINUTE -WHAT ABOUT THE CURRENT CHARGE - DO YOU EXPECT ME TO PAY THIS FRADULENT CHARGE?! (Be sure to question that ASAP, before they hang up!!) After which they offered to take 50% off. I proceeded to say that I'd read numerous complaints about the fraudulent billing going on -- and that was enough for them to agree to take 100% of the charge off of my bill. They said it could take 1 to 2 billing cycles for this charge to be removed. I guess we will see! When you call them just don't back down and remain calm but confident, and they will more than likely agree to remove the entire charge!
Thanks to everyone who has shared their experiences with Integretel - it helped me out to know what to say/do - something needs to happen to make this stop! I wonder how many people get ripped off without even questioning such a charge.

Everything looked ok, they had an website, with address and contact nos. (which I didnt verify) and sent me an agreement to sign. The only thing is all correspondence was through email.
I was asked to open a bank account for this specific job. Which I did. Money was wire to my account a couple of days. I let the money stay in my account for 4 days. After which I went personally to the bank to withdraw the money in cash and wire the appropriate amount to Western Union. I sent the notice to the contact person that I have done the transaction. 
I got an email for another wire in my account again. I checked my account online to verify this and I waited for the amount to clear. 
That afternoon I tried to check my account online and I was surprised that I didnt have any access. I called the bank customer service. Which they informed me that the previous wire has been fraud and they are reversing it. Now I am being ask by the bank to pay the 1st withdrawed amount. 
I tried to contact the company through email and now they are not returning my email. I tried calling the numbers in the website and to my dismay its not a valid number.
The bank says I have to pay the withdrawn amount. How can that be, shouldnt the bank check all bank wires, it was credited to my account and I had no problem getting the money in cash from the bank office. Anybody would assume that the wire is clear and verified by the bank to be ok.

Laura
Santa Barbara, CaliforniaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										Alright to start off I (being a newbie at the time ) signed up on mp3playersfree and I think Notebooks4free it has been so long ago I cant really remember. Well I got Dqed because when I moved I thought that I had to sign up again. Yes I was stupid and didn't read the TOS. 
Anyway I get DQed and I find out why. I understand that I have violated the TOS and am disappointed but I understand the consequences of my actions. So over on macminis4free I have completed a offer and have a couple of referrals. 
After being DQed I read the TOS and find that I will be DQed on all of their sites. I send the support team a email asking if it would be fine to pursue macminis4free. They email me back and I quote.
---------------------
Hello,
This account is in violation of our terms. You may signup for another site but this account has been disqualified.
Best Regards,
OfferCentric Member Services
------------------------------
So of course I am like cool - I have violated the terms but they understand that I am stupid and are a cool company and have modified them for me. They are showing me some grace. Sweet.
Well time passes and I am finally in the verification stages. Well I get a email saying that I am Dqed for multiple accounts. I then begin a series of emails with them describing what happened and how they said that it was ok for me to pursue macminis4free. 
Turns out that they accused my mothers account of being the multiple account. Well I have my mother do another offer to prove to them that she is a unique user. They reinstate my account but they DQ my moms account as a referral for me.
At this point I am pissed but at least we have made an agreement. So I have another person do another referral and they go green. Again I am back in the verification stages. My account is approved and I place an order. Well my mother gets a suspicious email from The OC and she forwards it to me. Basically it says that she should pursue finishing the site when we both know that they already have DQed on my account and will DQ her when she gets to the verification stages.
I, thinking that I am ok with the OC now that they approve me and I have placed a order, send an email to their support team simply asking what the email to my mother was about. I clearly stated that she forwarded it to me. Then the sh** hits the fan again!!!
I get a quick response saying that my account has been DQed again for multiple accounts with my mother's account being the one that they consider a multiple. So I am totally shocked because that is what they said before I proved that she was a unique user - also they didn't allow her referral to count on my account. So how in the world can they say it's a multiple account.
I have tried to contact them but their support staff is really rude and doesn't really care what you say they simply reply with automated responses.
I have contacted the BBB and called the Secretary of States office in California. I hope that I can resolve this because I am totally legit - from the beginning though they have lied to me and made it as hard as possible to receive a minimac. I have documents all emails I have with them and have the date and times of when everything happened.
OC if you read this - please consider all the facts. I have proved to you that I am legit and that my mother is also. I have done offers on multiple OC sites. Seems to me like you are in it for the money and not for giving people gifts.
This is just a fair warning - I encourage everyone to consider this situation before they think about pursuing an offercentric site.

Noblesville, IndianaU.S.A.STOP! ..before you think about using the Better Business Bureau (BBB)... CLICK HERE to see how other consumers were victimized by the BBB's false or misleading information. Don't be fooled! It has been reported, when there are thousands of complaints and other investigations underway by authorities, the BBB has no choice but to finally give an UNsatisfactory rating to a BBB member business that is paying the BBB big membership fees every year. When a business is reported that is NOT a BBB member, BBB files WILL more likely show an UNsatisfactory rating, then reportedly shake down that company to become a member of the BBB. One positive thing about the BBB is, either way, if a business has an unsatisfactory rating with the BBB, you can be sure, the business is bad. But what about all those BBB member businesses that had complaints filed against them? Consumers never get to hear about them. What about the BBB advertising to the public? Is this a false and misleading perception they are giving about consumer confidence when dealing with a business?

San Jose, California U.S.A. ",,800-736-7500,"Information Service 900 number scam, unathorized modem dialers, Web AccessZZ San Jose California","
										On 30 May 05, a malicious web site dropped a dialer program on my computer which hung up my current dial-in session, and dialed 19004440307 (Integratel).
This occured without authorization, consent, intent, or agreeing to any terms or conditions. It simply happened. Because it is normal for dial-in connections to drop from time to time, and the computer to redial, I didn't think too much of it, until I saw the number in the modem monitor.
I immediately switched off the modem (my modem is switched, and external) and found the offending application. A small executable named something like ""Q34xxx.exe"" where the x's are additional numbers. This was dropped at the root of the C: drive.
After about 10 minutes, I had ensured this application, and any other possible trojans, viruses, etc. did not exist on my system.
Because this happened at night, I was unable to contact my phone company. However, I contacted them the next day, informed them I would not pay any 900 charges, and put a 900 block on my line.
The phone company indicated that when my bill arrived, I'd be able to dispute the bill. It arrived Monday, 11 July 05 with the charges of $59.85 for Information Service, to Web AccessZZ.
I called the number for this scam outfit (800) 736-7500, and began the process to dispute the bill. I was told I could pay 50% because the bill was in dispute, to which I said, ""NO!  I will not pay this bill. It was unauthorized and initiated by you without my consent.""
I was told that there were two levels of consent, each of which I had to agree to in order for this dialer to have been placed on my computer, and that ensures the serices is agreed to. I informed the person helping me that this was not the case, and no consent was sought or given. Again, they tried for 50% of the bill, and again I said no. They asked what I wanted, and I stated, ""I will not pay this bill, I want this bill removed completely.Period.""
I was told I could get a one time courtesy adjustment of 100%.
Because of the rude behavior of the ""customer service"" rep, I asked for their address, email, etc... anything I could get, in order to file with the better business bureau, and report this abuse where I could.
In addition, I told my phone company that I would not pay the bill and to remove it.
To make matters worse, I've discovered another way this application gets delivered... Today, I dialed in, opened Yahoo Messenger, and had this application dropped on my computer. No consent, no authorization, nothing... My current connection was dropped, and the program began using my modem to dial 19004440307 again.
If you do not have a 900 block on your phone line, get it. Also, if you are ever offered a 50% reduction because the bill is in dispute, DO NOT PAY IT! Remember, 50% of the bill is not in dispute... 100% of the bill is in dispute, and if you pay 50%, they'll stop bugging you, and you'll never ever see the 50% you paid them refunded.
This is a complete and total scam.

How would they have gotten my credit card information?  I'm really confused.  I haven't had a chance to call them yet, as I'd have to wait until I get home tonight to do that.

Internet U.S.A. ",,888-3023724,"ESBI, MMI WORLD COMMUNICATION INTERNET SCAM, ENHANCED BILLING 900 SERVICE, HIJACKS MODEM AND MAKES CALLS FROM YOUR HOME PHONE. Internet","
										This letter is to inform you about an internet scam that I encountered which used spyware to infest my computer and hijack my modem to call 900 numbers.
I first noticed something strange about my computer when a small icon appeared on my desktop with a womans face that said instant access under it.  When I clicked it, a window appeared with a banner at the top that said modem users click here and the window was titled access control.  I didn't know what it was, but I clicked the X button to close the window.  When I went to my control panel, I saw there was a new program installed, and after going through the regular process of uninstalling it I thought my problem was solved.  
However, this instant access kept reinstalling itself on my computer, and when I called gateway tech support they said it was probably spyware imbedded in the memory of the computer and I would need to send the computer in to have it removed.
When I got my phone bill the next month, I was shocked to see $150 charge from a company called INTEGRETEL.  When I called them about the charges they insisted that I knowingly downloaded software onto my computer for gaming or sports entertainment via the internet.  They stated that the software I installed would have given me numerous prompts advising me of what I was downloading and that before I could become connected to their services I would have to agree to connect.  This is an absolute lie, as there was no warning or disclaimer for anything!?!
I don't connect to the internet through dial-up, I have broadband. However, I do have my phone line connected to send and receive faxes.  It was using my computer modem that these phone calls were taking place, yet I never heard anything dialing or never saw an actual connection. Furthermore, I never saw anything that was a service (porn, games, sports, or otherwise) for which I would be billed for.
After doing further research, I am furious that this company is still in business.  I saw they have had several lawsuits against them by the FTC in which several were granted settlements.  Integretel did agree to reverse the charges, saying they would issue a block against my number and advised I get a 900 block on my phone.
I contacted my local phone company, Quest Communications, and they said there is really nothing they can do.  I was even more furious when I got my phone bill for July in which I received another set of charges in the amount of $653.69 for alleged calls placed from my home on May 17th, 2005.  This company calls itself ESBI, and again has these strange calls to 900 numbers that I never placed!  I am the only one who lives in my home, and I know exactly who I am calling and who I am not.  I had no guests, and there is no mistaking that this company is trying to RIP ME OFF.
The more I investigate these companies the scarier the story gets.  I have now read about people who say they continue to get bills 5 months after these services are supposedly placed and the companies threaten to destroy credit histories if you don't pay up.  These companies both insist that they are actually the 3rd party billing agents, and the actual charges don't go through them. They say they act as collections, which could just be the same company under another name.  I can not be sure, but I do know this creates a further loophole to keep their scam afloat. I refuse to pay a single penny to these people, or any other charges like this.    
I would like to see these companies go out of business, but I know as long as there is money to be made there will be criminals out there to steal it.  If these companies are indeed 3rd party billers, they are just as much to blame, as they assist in this scam and become a partner to the crime.
The fact is, this is no different than if someone broke into my home and used my telephone to call 900 numbers.  It is absolutely criminal to use a person's computer without their consent, via the internet, and in this case rack up absorbent charges to slam them with.  I believe the formal term for this is called cramming, so I want to formally charge Integretel and ESBI of cramming.
These companies rely on the fact that people have lives, and don't want to spend all day on the phone or writing letters about their abuse.  They use manipulation tactics to try to get you to suspect other members of your household or friends. Do you have any children or a husband?   This is so totally wrong, and they need to be stopped somehow.
I will continue to keep an eye on my phone bill for other charges or suspicious activities.  I have actually had to unplug my phone line from the wall, because I am so freaked out about this now.  While I am pretty sure the software features will not function anymore, I still have no clue how I got it in the first place, and I will not wipe out my hard drive because I have too much invested in my system to start from scratch again.
I would definitely be interested in a lawsuit against both Integretel and ESBI, and see there are plenty of others who share the same frustrations I have.  It is an option I am willing to consider, regardless of whether or not they settle my bill.  This becomes more about the people who aren't aware of what's going on, and the fact this kind of operation continues to be underway. As I said before I feel very strongly this needs to stop. If you have any further suggestions about actions I can take, I am very interested.  In the meanwhile I plan to send complaints to the FTC, The Better Business Bueau, & the FCC.

										You know how we all get those e-mails saying that we can get a 150 dollar gift card to Apple Bees or something similiar. Beware! You have to complete these different offers in order to qualify for your ""gift"".
I applied for USA Credit thinking I would get a regular credit card such as a VISA or Mastercard issued by USA Credit. Instead I was issued a useless card that I could only use on USA Shopping's website.
USA Credit asked for my account information. I figured that it was to verify my worthiness of their credit. After giving my account information, I was informed that my bank account would be debited for 149.95.
When I saw the debit on my online banking account activity statement, I called the number listed beside my transaction amount. After 30 minutes of cajoling me to keep my account open, I was told I would receive a $150 voucher to pay my credit card bill in addition to a $75 check to deposit in my account.
The majority of the USA Shopping.com prices were in red with two asterisks in front of them meaning they needed to be paid for upfront with either an e-check or another credit card. Among the few items I saw that I could by with my USA Credit account were a $40 dollar pair of jumper cables. would I pay $40 for a pair of jumper cables plus shipping, when I can go to a hardware store and get them for around $10?
A couple of days later, I googled this credit card company and found numerous complains about USA Credit/USA Shopping Club.
I saw similiar complaints about this bogus credit card.  Do not ever apply for this credit card or you will be fighting for you $150 dollars.
Closing the account is a hassle because the ""Customer Service Specialist"" will keep trying to talk you into keeping your account open. They want you to be out the $150 and stuck with a card you cannot truly use. After two 30 minute phone calls and one 10 minute phone call I finally was able to close my account.
My advise is do not even apply for this card because you too will be charged $150 and you will have a hard time closing your account.

										In 2003 I signed up for SBC internet services. I was placed on SBC DSL service. From the first day, we experienced connection problems and we continue to have issues today and nothing has been done to correct the problem. I have called in literaly dozens and dozens of times since begining service. Each time I call in, a very nice person takes my call and puts me through the process they must follow in order to help. Unplug modem, power down, power up, reset config and our connection is restored. Temporarily. The next day , or in many cases after a few minutes, we lose it again or we get messages that the server cannot be found. Call after call we are told that something else will be tried. They have pointed the finger at the phone lines. The phone company came out and replaced everything all the way to the corner of my block to ensure that the were not the blame. Still bad connections. SBC has sent technicians out to my house. They test the signal coming into my house and say that they are surprised that I get any connection at all. I am a fair distance from the main hub that distributes the signal. In our neighborhood we are sent our signal from a remote relay which is close to my house.The techs have told me that the remote relay for my area is running at more than 100% the majority of the time. The techs told me that the relay was overloaded and that I would never be able to upgrade to quality plans (Express/Pro) because I barely get the starter package which they call 192 speed. The starter package is not supported by SBC any more because better technology has made it obsolete. So, I am here, paying $40 bucks a month to SBC for outdated and unreliable services.
I was contacted today by a SBC representative who told me that the Pro package I purchased and that they committed to, would not be offered afterall and if I was not happy with ""192 speed service"" then I should go find Comcast. Is that the way SBC does business? Is this the thanks I get for sticking with SBC while they ""attempted"" to cure their problems? Is this how SBC really feels abot it's customers? They are OK with me paying $40 bucks a month for the crummy service but when I call in again today to complain about service outage, I am basically told ""screw you"". The bottom line is this. SBC doe not give a damn about delivering on their promises. SBC does not know how to fix their tecnical problems but expects you and me to pay regardless of how poor the service is. SBC puts you through so much mousemaze and trouble to report problems, that most people hang up. I am sure that many problems are never reported because customers give up while on hold. Do not choose SBC for any services that you can secure elsewhere. SBC does not deserve your business.

										I opened my phone bill today to discover that I have joined the tens of thousands of people hit with an unauthorized and indeed fraudulent charge by Integretel.  I have a $40.00 plus tax charge for a two minute call (at $20.00 per minute) to 1-900-444-0222.  The place called is listed ""Web AcessZz"".  
I will be on the phone with both Integretel and my home phone carrier to dispute the charges bright and early Monday morning.  I have read some of the other Rip-off reports on this company (350 and growing by the minute) and am prepared to fully reject Integretel's ""gracious"" offer of waiving half the amount of this unauthorized charge.... 
This company has been in trouble with the FTC since 2000/2001 with many variations on the fraudulent phone billing scheme. (ISP charges, collect calls, 900 numbers etc)  I have already filed a complaint on the FTC website and will be filing a formal complaint with the NY Attorney General's Office as well.  The fact that this company has fraudulently charged unsuspecting consumers for years - and has yet to be legally challenged - boggles the mind.

I upgraded my classmates membership to a paid level some months back, but was absolutely certain that i had not enrolled in any additional programs or benefits.
Now in the this, the 21st Century, i use my bank and credit cards online all the time and have had little to no trouble doing so. I am very vigilant in signing up for things and unchecking the appropriate boxes to avoid excessive emails spam etc. But she insisted that i had enrolled w/ simple escape voluntarily when i signed up for classmates.
after interrogating her about the purpose and practices of her company i requested that she terminate my membership and I held firm on multiple attempts by her to change my mind.
As i said she was very courteous and helpful and assured me that i was removed from billing but that i could use the benefits of simple escapes (discounts on purchases made at retailers like target etc) for the rest of the month.
I won't do that i will be looking forward to next month's statement to see if indeed she followed thru w/ her promise to allow my escape from simple escape.

Tim Stevens offered an item for sale (a vintage RCA 77DX polydirectional ribbon microphone) on a free classified posting area on the internet (http://users.pandora.be/oldmicrophones/ ). After agreeing on the details via email (address macguytim@hotmail.com) and phone, I sent a check for $530 ($30 of which was for shipping via FedEx) to Tim Stevens in Kingston Ontario Canada. I sent the check on 07/11/2005. On 7/19/2005 I received an email from Tim confirming that he did indeed receive the check and would be sending the microphone shortly. The funds cleared my bank 7/20/2005. For the next three weeks, I did not receive any communication from Tim (despite a few emails from me). Finally, on 8/11/2005, I received an email from Tim stating that the microphone was badly damaged in shipping, was returned to him, and that I would get my money back at the end of the month.
Since then, I contacted the owner of the website on which Tim's ad appeared and he has confirmed that 4 other people have had a similar story. I have now personally spoken with three of them by phone and/or email and they have exactly the same story as me (sent money to Tim Stevens, several weeks later, Tim reports that the microphone was damaged in the mail so badly that it was returned to him and that he will pay the money back at the end of the month, etc.).  
As far as I know, the first check was sent to Tim on 06/14/2005--now it is 8/23/2005 and no one has received anything back yet.  I am hoping that pressure from forums such as this as well as law enforcement will encourage him to pay us back.

Even when I call them I just get a message saying leave a message and I do and it is never returned. E-mail is even less efective.

										Get this, I moved to a new house and tried to access my account at INSIGHT AMERICA a/k/a flatrateinfo.com and was locked out because I'm at a new IP address, I called them and explained that I moved, they wanted verification in the form of a phone bill, I explained that my office was still in the same place with a listed phone number and that my new home phone has not been installed yet and I would not be receiving a bill for about 1 month and that when it is installed it would be unlisted and the bill would go to my PO BOX, they could care less that I spend a lot of time working at home and refused to allow me to access my account from home even though it's a huge inconvenience to me since I now live 40 miles from the office. 
I told them since they didn't seem to care about their customers I would be taking my business elsewhere and that they should close my account and send me a refund, they advised that they don't give refunds. 
As far as I'm concerned most of the info they provided was old and / or wrong anyway, this combined with their poor customer service makes them in my opinion a terrible company to do business with.

										After paying in advance through Paypal for a 6 page web site package, I undertook to create a web site for this person. 
During the creation process, I spent in excess of 35 hours putting the web site together. This process included custom graphic design services, hosting, site planning, design and layout, proof reading of text, and several revisions to information sent by the client during the completion process.
After the site was near completion, online and functioning, the client put through a dispute through Paypal, claiming ""Merchandise Not Received"". I have been unsuccessful in counter-disputing this false claim, and as a result I have lost in excess of $550.00

										I listed an item on eBay with a reserve price for a first time because I spoke directly with a live support agent and was told specifically that I would not be charged a reserve price fee for my item unless it was sold. Once again, I was told I would pay the fee ONLY if my item sold. After having some serious technical difficulties with my listing -- such as my listing not even showing up!!! -- my item didn't sell. I then contacted the live support agents again and inquired about a credit for my listing because of these technical difficulties. I was told that the only way to get the credit was to relist my item (which I didn't want to do, but I wanted the credit because why the HELL would I pay for a listing that didn't even SHOW UP?!?!) and that my account would automatically be credited for the first listing after the second listing ended.
My item never sold the second time around, and despite the fact that I was told DIRECTLY by one of their support agents that I would NOT have to pay UNLESS the item sold, somehow I am still being charged HUNDREDS of dollars for my listing because of the reserve price fees. I attempted to contact the online help (through email) and after a few correspondences - with no resolution - I was told that any further correspondence I send will be read but not answered. I KNOW that they have my conversation with the agent who told me that I would not be charged unless my item sold, but they conveniently can't find it. 
This is a big company that is now taking BIG advantage of people using their services and they have to be stopped. They could be doing this to so many more consumers and getting away with it!!!!! Can ANYBODY help??? Something HAS to be done.

										This is to all other victims reporting here. After the USBI bill from USBI in Feb. 2005 for $112.23 to 3 calls in DiegoGarcXX and same amount to 3 calls in ""Guinea-Bisxx"" for which I was able to determine internet LD charges to sexexplorers.com on my own via yahoo, I wrote USBI and never heard a reply. Yes, 6 mo. later I received one bill for the 3 calls but no USBI appears on the bill but rather One Call Communications, Inc. t/d/b/a Navicom & Opticom. I called and a ""A Warren 24"" offered me a one time 50% allowable discount. Two weeks later I got another bill from the same entity for the other 3 calls, although no particulars were reflected on the bill--fortunately, I logged all activity to date and saved the original phone bill with the date, time and place allegedly called. I haven't called One Call back yet as I am furious that they would send me this bill under separate cover, as if I would forget! From one of the e-mails at this site, I wrote to Martha Contee, Exec. Consumer Commission, COnsumer & Gov't Affairs Bureau, Consumer Inquiries & Complaints Div., 445 12th St. SW, DC 20554 and enclosed copies of all these bills. I don't know if anything will transpire to resolve the problem. I don't want a tainted credit history but I also feel compelled to withhold payment for these bogus charges. USBI and its affiliates are yielding thousands of dollars from hundreds of victims, as disclosed at this site.
Like you, I wonder why my local carrier allowed these calls to even go through when I specifically requested a block a few years ago. I guess when Bell Atlantic became Verizon, I needed to pursue this block again. Still, how can this be allowed? Should we address this problem with our local carrier?
Firewall Protection through your internet subscriber can block further USBI charges. It's worth the few dollars monthly.
Interestingly, when I spoke with A Warren 24 at One Call for those 3 calls, he said, ""I see you have firewall protection now so you shouldn't be incurring anymore of these charges."" I felt a violation of my privacy.
Please do NOT pay the bill.  Pursue this with the FTC, FCC, CUB, BBB and your local police fraud unit. How can we rally together to convince Dateline or 60 Minutes pursue investigative reporting on this telecommunication scam to spare further fraud victims?
As the young lady from Massachusetts wrote, PERUSE YOUR PHONE BILL CAREFULLY! Check your bank statement too. As an aside-- I had similar online fraud charges on my bank account which the bank removed. I then changed my bank account and bank card. I also no longer make online purchases or surrender my card to an employee in a restaurant, gas station, etc. The bank officer told me this is where many fraud charges occur.
It is interesting to note that USBI's address is the same as One Call Communications, Navicom and Opticom, YET they have different phone numbers and appear to operate as separate billing entities. There must be some legal redress we can pursue to prevent further fraud.
Does anyone have any advice or further insights?
Thanks.

I called this company but all they would tell me is i need to look at my histoy on the internet to find out why i am being billed. This company could not tell me why or give me any information on why i was being billed. Before this happened I saw that i was being billed on my phone bill al so. That a call was being made from my home to Diego Garcia. This was accocited with Navicomm also. 
What is sad about this is that it has the time date and minutes i was supposley on this web site but i was not even at my house when this was done. Something needs to be done Because i will refuseto pay a bill that cant be explained to me. And dont do a very good job at explaining themselves. And also the man i talked to told me that i could contact the fcc if i would like if he didnt even really care....what a sorry company this is.
Well they did tell me also that i typed www. something and whatever that web site was that aol didnt pay for it and that is why they provided that number to connect and that is why i got billed for $16.02 on Aug. 30 2005 for the month of july 11th.

										Navicomm.  Oh how I love Navicomm!(Sarcasm).  They have billed me for multiple charges for no more than 6 minutes of time.  The total charges came too $80.69.  All of the times that were clocked were between 1:44-2:33 am ET.  Now tell me.  Who buys things, for six minutes, at that time in the morning?
Okay, so we ignored the bill for obvious reasons, beings so that there were no e-mail adresses, no www..com addresses, and the only person that we could get on the phone were robots.  So, we tried to guess that company website, and lo and behold, there is none.  Fishy?  So, we looked at the date that the charges are posted, and it says 07/05.  Then, we look at when the Bill was sent.  August 30th.  Coincidental?  So we recieved a call, and when we asked where we could find information, they said check your history logs.  Now, not being a computer geek myself, I asked my son where we could find these history logs, and he told me they have been long deleted.  This was almost a month after we recieved the bills, and over two months ago.  My son told me that the history logs would have deleted themselves after 20 days of viewing a site, so as to be able to keep the computer less filled with data.  So, instead of billing me right away where i could have visited these sites, they billed me nearly 3 weeks after the files were dumped. Fishy again?
So, here we are.  Almost 4 months after we visited the sites, its now, 7:00.  My young children are getting ready for bed when the phone rings.  Thinking its going to be a friend checking in or something of that sort, its this company trying to get money out of us.  We argued on the phone, and we had given them demands that they refused to meet.  These were, e-mail, Web address, and transfer to their supervisor, who apparently, has no e-mail, phone number, or mail adress.  Funny, sounds like he doesn't even exist.
So, we have been called nonstop since 7:00 pm. every five minutes.  This is bogus.  There is no way they can just stop for a single night and we can work this out in the morning? nope, apparently not.  They told us that their machines would dial us at 2:00 in the morning when i asked if it was possible for them to turn it off for a night.  They hesitated, and that is something that i do not expect from a legitimate company.
Okay, So here I have this bill.  I asked my son to reproduce it on Microsoft Office.  He did so perfectly using nothing but Microsoft Word and one other program.  The fact that they have no website, displaces all ability for it to be true.
BOGUS!  NAVICOMM IS FAKE!

At that point I was feeling rather secure. But I soon became less than impressed with their locating abilities.  Daryl Wilcox worked for several months to get me a total of four leads.  In August they finally led my to a contact that would ultimately agree on trying the system.  The day I faxed them my signed Location Agreement, everyone disappeared.   I was days from getting the system in place.  I assume if I would have gotten set up a little earlier I would at least have some income off this thing for a while.  Although the prior postings mention less than advertised profits.  As it stands now, I have what it takes to get started, there is just no one at the switch to turn me on.  Like someone mentioned in an earlier entry, I too was called, probably around May, and told that an order had been cancelled and they could sell me another machine at a deep discount.  Of course, having problems placing my first, I wasn't about to risk the extra expense.

Richard
Sun City, ArizonaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.

										Help!  We received a bill for services not used.  In trying to find contact information on the internet after getting nowhere with their billing inquiry number, I ran across this website.  I found a number, called it, and was referred to yet another number.  Held for the supervisor who was no help, except to give me an address to dispute these charges.  
I have no idea whatsoever how this came to be, except that we have been having problems with popups this month - what a coincidence!  Even though we close these down, or like the other day turn off the computer when there are dozens that we cannot excape, the supervisor says that their techs say there is no way for this to happen.  
Can any of you steer me in the right direction so that this does not appear on my dad's credit report?  I'm living in his house after moving here from California last year for a better life for my kids.  I don't want to pay this bill, but don't want it to affect his credit.  I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

										To Ripoffreport,
Expedia, Qantas airlines, Consumer Rights, MSN, Fair Go NZ,
Even though I am a novice computer user & inexperienced internet user & not having travelled for many years, my friends encouraged me to book my flight tickets online explaining how simple it is and that anyone can do it.  
Living some distance from the nearest town & travel agent I thought this sounded a good idea. 
A Technician having just fixed my computer after I had managed to crash it somehow? Set up my home page as MSN so that's what comes up when I connect to the Internet.  On this page  is ""TRAVEL"" Too easy. Clicking on this I am taken straight to ""Expedia"".  Cool. I think very easy.
I follow the steps entering my flight from Christchurch to Wellington & return the dates etc the price comes up as $534.48. Being a little cheaper than the price the travel agent had given me previously on the phone & being a Qantas flight (supposed to be the safest airline) & being NZ & Australian owned & not having to pay the $30 agent booking fee. 
I chose to go ahead & book the tickets ""Neat"" it really is easy! BUT a long process. So by the end of the booking 11.30pm was very wary. All cool tickets booked! Awesome! Being farmers it's very difficult to get a holiday so this is our first in 3 years!!
THEN comes the Mastercard statement & Expedia has taken $754.33 dollars? Of course I contacted the office straight away to let my bank know they had made a mistake. No! Not them it was Expedia. Emailed them & found I have been charged in US$ 
You can imagine my ""Shock"" & this is of course where the story begins! 
Don't you think someone would say "" HELLO"" we have some idiot in NZ here trying to book tickets with an American company! Better let her know who we are and tell her she should be booking with a NZ company or she will be paying in US$ 
Silly girl NUP! They decided to let me blindly carry on. I truely feel I have been ""Duped' I am embarrased & feel very silly for falling for this ""scam"" 
I want my money back not from the airline of course from Expedia! I'm not asking for a full refund! I need the ticket & understand it is not refundable just the $219.85 NZ difference I fully believed I was being charged in NZ dollars. This little amount is pittance to them in $US  
It has taken ""18"" emails (getting the hang of emailing now !!) to get what I requested which was exactly where in the booking process it states US $ Yes they have been full of apoligies & I should think so! My lawyer suggested I write my story & send to Expedia & Qantas & Consumer rights & MSN as I don't have the funds to employ him at this stage I am relying on help from all above.
A friend emailed Expedia to enquire about the same flight booking that I have. She made sure she stated very clearly she was a New Zealander through her supplied address to them and they even went on to encourage her to book sightseeing & accomodation, rental cars etc It took at least ""10"" emails!! 
And only after her pushing them by asking if she could pay cash at the airport did they inform her the charge would be in US$. After a result like that I am even more shocked. Another friend has done the same & has had exactly the same results I dont feel so dumb now just sickened by the whole thing.
It has been suggested I should send out my story to as many as possible & encourage them to do the same & let them decide if they would book or fly with these companys themselves. I understand that the emailing 
system is very powerful after reading an article about BP that was sent out via email last year informing people that this company was setting the price 
for inflated fuel costs 
The local BP garage in my town almost came to a stand still as people decided not to buy their fuel from them, this happened nation wide & within three weeks the fuel prices at BP garages had dropped. I look forward to your reply with some help as to how I can get my money back

Thomaston, ConnecticutU.S.A.Click here to read other Rip Off Reports on Simple EscapesEDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.

										I read the conditions and report examples on the website for getting data and backgroud infomation on someone. I even read the part about SSN information was more reliable. I chose the $49.95 report vs the $7.95 report because I had a SSN and wanted more than just the address list. 
I entered the SSN, name and state and gave my credit card information. 
The report that I received had the name I had entered, some former (very former) addresses of this person, and some addresses in another state where he never even lived. The out of state address had an instate phone number, so the phone was incorrect on it. No current addresses within the last five years or more were listed, even though this person has gotten married, bought a house, paid taxes, etc. in this state in current years.
The criminal report was a joke! Even though I furnished the SSN, all forty some reports were from a different state and not this person, with a different DOB.
The only info that I got was the same info on the $7.95 report and it wasn't current!
I called and they gave me criminal report from this state but they don't furnish court/realty/or other records.

I called my bank as soon as I found this debit and I asked who the check had been issued for. They replied ""EDebitPay"" and said there were 2 phone numbers to reach them if I had any questions. I called the first number and got an answering system telling me they didn't open until 9AM PST. A co-worker of mine suggested that I Google the number and try and found out about the company.
I Googled the number (www.google.com) and came up with rip-offreport.com. Aaaprently a person had been charged the exact same amount without their authorization which was my exact problem. I contacted my bank who in turn told me that the only way they can put money back into my account is if it was the bank's error or the company that took the money out sends a fax over telling them they took the fund out incorrectly. They did tell me to go to my bank about the problem, but I am going to try and fight to get this money back. Until then I can't pay any bills and am left with a negative number in my account.

										For sometime my wife and I have wanted to own an online business. When we saw the Tom Bosley ad regarding the SMC company and their website program we thought this was the answer.
Upon calling, I was told that before any of my website questions or any references would be provided I must become an SMC member. I agreed and paid my membership fee in full. I was told that the ecommerce division would contact me to set me up with the website. 
A day or two later the ecommerce salesperson (Will Mayer) called me. I wanted my wife present so he agreed to call later that day when she would be home. At that call I put Mr. Mayer on speaker so that both my wife and I could hear what was said.
During this call we specifically asked for a website that contained ""sight, sound, and movement"". We also requested a website that would be ""interactive and entertaining for my customers"". We explained that neither of us has a lot of computer experience and would not be able to do this if it required a lot of  computer knowledge. 
We were promised that this would be easy and that our website would contain all of these things and more. We were also told that we would be recieving some emails regarding the completion of my website and that we needed to fill these out and get them sent in right away so as not to delay the websites construction. We agreed to purchase the ""Platinum Package"", the best website program for almost $4000 only after being assured that I would have 30 days to cancel if I wasn't satisfied. I was also promised references from existing web customers.
In a short time we recieved the emails and completed the information and returned them as rapidly as we could so we would get the finished website as quickly as possible.
On October 20, 2005 approximately two weeks after the order we recieved an email congratulting us on the completion of our website.
We immediately did not like the quality of the site. It contained no movement, or sound, nor was it the entertaining site we had been promised. Furthermore the site was not even complete. It required a substantial amount of computer knowledge including HTML training to complete. We were hoping that this was a mistake and that it would be rectified quickly.
I called Tech Support to discuss this, and was told that I had to go to the internet and download and read a 98 page training manual, and then list all of my questions before calling back.
After realizing that this was not what we had agreed to purchase, my wife and I decided to cancel. We were still well within the 30 day period, so I called the cancellation number provided us by the salesperson. This number rings, but is never answered. I tried calling this number dozens of times over a 4-5 day period. Finally, I called the salesperson back and told him that we were not happy and wanted to cancel. He assured us that everything would be taken care of and the site would be brought up to our expectations and that Tech Support would be contacting me very soon to take care of this.
Later that evening my wife answered a call from Tech Support and, (taking a message for me) again we were told that we needed to go to the internet and read the manual, then call back to get our questions answered. When my wife shared this message with me I was livid, and decided to definately cancel at this point. (Still well within the 30 day requirement)
The next day I again tried the cancellation number...no answer! Once again I contacted Mr. Mayer and told him in no uncertain terms of my desire to cancel. He then informed me that he was too busy to talk and needed to call me back after 4:30 his time to discuss this. I explained that that was not necessary and that I wanted to cancel, period. 
He then told me that a supervisor would be calling me to take care of this cancellation. Concerned about running out of the 30 day clause I asked when this supervisor would be calling. Mr. Mayer answered within 24 hours. No supervisor or for that matter anyone from this company has ever called me regarding cancelling this order.
When we did not hear from a supervisor we became fearful that perhaps we were the victims of fraud and decided to call our credit card company and see if they could help. After explaining our problem to them they agreed to dispute this matter and credit my account accordingly. 
I am not sure if this money can be charged back to me or not? I am worried about it as I have recieved 2 emails from this company denying my request for refund. They are denying my request on the basis of some tricky lanquage on the bottom of one of the emailed pages I returned and was required to build the site. 
I was never provided a copy of this but according to them it seems to say that if I return the page I cannot get a refund. In my hurry to get these forms back to them I did not see this before, and certainly would not agree to commit almost $4000 dollars to a website without even getting a chance to see the finished product. I still don't believe it. What happened to the 30 day right to cancel? 
In any case within the 30 days, I have written them a cancellation request, called the salesperson to request cancellation, sent several emails to tech support requesting cancellation, and contacted my credit card company to dispute these charges.
I don't know what is going to happen regarding my refund request, but this company is definately doing business using deceptive practices and outright lies.

I have NO idea who these companys are and I had not used my Atm/visa card in a week, so I knew I did not do these charges. So i researched online and found out it is a big scam!!!! And they have many names for this company. I have never been to thier site or signed up with them I just found them when i saw the charges and needed the info for this report. I read that they are getting there info from Vista Print, I have bought business cards from that company but never signed up for anything with any one else they are associated with. I have bought many times from Vista Print and never had any problems till now. Now they have sold or given my info including CC number to this Ap9* company, who is ovouisly ripping many people off and making alot by doing it to many people and only doing $12.95, $11.95 and $9.99 at a time. I will be taking any actions to get my money back as they HAVE NO RIGHT TO IT!!! I tried to call the 1-888 numbers provided through my bank for the company but was on hold for 30 mins on each one and never did get to talk to any one.

Carson City, NevadaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										What a RIP-OFF!!
I guy calls me up because of an inquiry I made to surplusalert.com for a possible dropshipping venture.
He says he'll send me out a package for about $4 bucks and that I can look at the package and decide if I want to join with their company. Now I'm not an idiot. I was very adament about asking the all important question... Is this the only cost? There won't be any payments of any kind in the future for this package?  The guy says NO. This is a one time payment for s&h of the package. BOY was I lied to!
Two weeks later I noticed on my bank statement that a fee for $29.00 was taken from my account from surplusalert. Not only did the guy say anything about a two week trial period, but nothing is stated in the packet as well. When I tried to call surplusalert I was transfered to 5 different reps. Being connected back to two of the same reps twice. One incompetant rep hangs up on me. Two other reps don't even know who their CEO is. And one rep stammered so much I dont even think SHE knew what she was talking about. IF YOU WANT TO BE RIPPED OFF, THEN THIS IS THE PLACE!!!

										I created a Website for the Independence Fire Department in Clarkston on behalf of Luc Poirer from Slick and Bubba's. The website contract was awarded to this company because of the design draft I created and submitted as part of their proposal.
All of the work on this site was provided by me and due to a desire to create a positive relationship. I was willing to be flexible in receiving payment on an invoice of $5,000. Luc's Mother had apparently passed away and in a moment of empathy I agreed to be flexible with my collection efforts.
Luc has since made three commitments toward making payments that were not fulfilled. When I  indicated that I would need at least 50% of the  invoice covered in order to feel this was a good faith relationship, I was locked out of my ftp account.
I had hoped that my copy protection system would have provided enough incentive to receive payment when the trial period had expired but have just discovered that it has been broken.
Luc is not only responsible for non-payment of my work, he has also managed to steal from me... and worse, has placed the Independence Fire Department in direct violation of copyright law.

										Mike Adams of Webseed.com (AKA SearchEngineVisibility.com) claims that for $695.00 he will improve your search engine ranking, guaranteeing his customers top-10 positions in the sixteen most popular search engines for any keywords you choose.  This is an outright lie!  Mr. Adams has no way of guaranteeing this and all he is going to do is take your money and run!  Rest assured that no one can guarantee this and anyone who says that they can is a ""Big Fat Liar"" and needs to be exposed for the ""Con Artist"" that they really are.  
Mr. Adams also sells some Spam software or mass email software as he calls it for $495.00 or $985.00 for the deluxe ""Phishing"" version at arialsoftware.com  This software is the ""Tools of the Trade"" for any internet / email ""Scam Artist"".
After doing a little more research on this chap I uncovered that Mike Adams claims to be the primary content contributor of the largest health content network on the Internet (Truth Publishing AKA NewTarget.com) Mr. Adams claims to have been chronically diseased where at the age of 30, he claims that he was ""nearly"" obese, diabetic, depressed and headed towards certain misery as another casualty of organized medicine and prescription drugs.  However Mr. Adams post no medical proof that can backup any of his story.  Mr. Adams claims that in trying to learn how to improve his health, he stumbled across a world of ""little-known information"" about disease prevention that put him on a whole new journey towards perfect human health (and another way for this scamartist to make a fast buck over the internet).  
Mr. Adams calls his Health advise the Health Intelligence Files and he offers these E-Files for $995.00 or as he say's the cost for one day stay in the hospital.  Mr. Adams says his Health Intelligence Files are worth thousands of dollars but the E-files are not actually printed books and according to Mr. Adams ""aren't quite finished yet"" so he's letting people have them now for only $299.00 
Even though Mike Adams is not a Medical Doctor he operates a string of fake health advice websites which include  NewsTarget.com, HoodiaFactor.com, EmergingFuture.com, SpamAnatomy.com, VitaminFactor.org, CounterThink.com, HealthFactor.info, JunkScience.info, BrainHealthNews.com, LowCholesterolDiets.DietsLink.com, PublicHealthNews.org, PharmaWatch.info, HomeToxins.com, PoisonPantry.org, DepressionFactor.org & ConsumerWellness.org just to name a few.
Are you starting to get the picture of how dangerous this man is?  If you have had any contact or you have been burned by this con man you need to contact the FTC or your local authorities so that they can put this man behind bars and stop him from ripping any more people off with his scams over the internet.

Wise, VirginiaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.

Well, there was no free trial, and my bank account was charged 21.95. When I called them by getting the phone number after calling 3 different places, they could not provide me with any information on the services I was supposed to be receiving, no website, no refunds, no anything. These people from what I understand are part of a larger scamming operation which operates under the company name ""Canda INC"" which is in quebec Canada. Pointe-Claire.

Well, apparently this guy got all pissy about it not being sent out immediately on Monday morning first thing - I work full time and my work hours are the same as the post office so I didnt have time or inclination to use my lunch time to go to the PO and stand in line.  So, on Monday morning - maybe a whole 8 hours after the auction ended and the guy paid me on Paypal, he sent in a complaint to Paypal for NON DELIVERY of merchandsie - uh, hello !  First off - he didnt even give me 8 hours, let alone til the following Saturday to send the items.  At that point, I had already sent out the weeks auctions prior to that, I suddenly started getting chargebacks from Paypal and negative balances !!! I had sent tons of items out prior to this one ass**** jumping the gun and Paypal was refusing to release the funds to me until I sent them paperwork - I sent them the paperwork asked for and then they wanted more and then more and then finally I got so fed up with Paypal that I asked them if they wanted my firstborn child also ?  Bottom line, Paypal KEPT the money in THEIR account, I sent out tons of items - most of which I was able to retreive from the USPS because I was not about to send out items to people when Paypal had my money.  The people understandably got pissed but I told them I couldnt refund what I didnt have.  Paypal had the money - I didnt receive a dime.  They paid Paypal, not me - not until Paypal releases the funds does a seller get paid.  And I NEVER got paid.  
So months later, here comes NCO Financials with a letter to my work address - that is th address that is on my credit card - which has a limit of ONE dollar on it - it is one of those preload ones - NEVER will I allow Paypal to rip me off again like they did with a real credit card that they allowed some hackster to use and rack up about 6,000.00 worth of charges on it and when I complained all I got was a Gee, thats TOO bad - sorry about that, but nothing we can do about it.  
I just called NCO and gleefully gave them my bankruptcy case number and my attorneys name - screw them and screw Paypal too.  Paypal HAD 1300 of mine - they never gave me any money so why should I have to pay for any of it ?

										On 20th November 2005 I ordered from this company, online, 2 x PSP consoles for my kids for Christmas.  Although I received confirmation of my order it did not state an estimated delivery date.
In the meantime, on the 23rd November 2005 payment was taken via my card details.  This payment was however GBP10.60 more than the order had stated.  I assumed from this that the goods had now been despatched.
When they had not arrived after a few more days I began calling the Customers Services line and over the next few days was given a litany of excuses as to why my order had not been despatched.  
It was now becoming clear that something was not right so on the 6th of December 2005 I cancelled the order and was informed that a refund would be issued in 7-10 working days which I was not satisfied with because it didn't take them that long to remove it from my account in the first place!
After that, each time I called to chase the refund they told me that the order was still 'active' and despite my protests kept assuring me that my goods would be delivered before Christmas.
Needless to say, they weren't and I am still awaiting a refund but frankly, I am not very hopeful as they just lie through their teeth every time I speak to them.
Please, please, for the sake of others who are about to unknowingly enter into dealings with this company, do all you can to investigate them.

CALUMET PARK, IllinoisU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

I wanted the music so badly,that conceded to .99 a mo.
They DIDNOT make it clear, that they were going to charge me the whole 2yr fee at once.(not until after I paid)Did not have funds in bank to cover!
Immediately, I clicked onto,CONTACT,TECH SUPPORT, and a few other tabs.In order to cancel out. (as,the site stated,you can cancel at anytime.To NO avail, the same page kept coming up.Only allowing you, to click onto other downloads.
I called my bank, in order to try and avoid an OVERDRAFT.
The phone number my bank was able to find for site was DISCONNECTED! I gave the bank, www.limewire.com they found www.mydownloading.com!
At this point, I STILL wanted x-mas music.(I did manage to avoid an overdraft)So, I downloaded the site.
Much to my disbelief,the site was now called 360SHARE!(share your files)Still no x-mas music!
That was it, I was fit to be tied! I removed EVERYTHING from my programs,and was now going to try and get my money back,SOMEHOW!
However,upon removal of this site, I get an error message from windows, saying:they found bugs in the program, send message, debug,etc.......So, I now ALSO, HAVE A ""fatal error""of some sort, that comes up on my PC, anytime I restart.

Vonage,"  Vonage   
Edison, New Jersey U.S.A. ",,866-243-4357,"Vonage Deceptive Sales Practices, Poor Customer Service, Care Needed ripoff Edison New Jersey","
										As many before me have posted, I wish I had come here to view the reports prior to getting involved with this company.  I would say to anyone interested in Vonage (they certainly are spending enough on advertising), beware.  Here is my story to date.
January 1st I saw ads for Vonage on TV.  I receive my internet via Direcway so I was concerned about whether Vonage would work since it requires high speed internet, they said, DSL or Cable modem.  I called knowing that upload speeds via satl. are much lower than high speed.  Sales person I spoke to said, yes, Vonage worked on satl. and yes it worked with Direcway.  She also said I would be issued a full credit if I wasn't satisfied within 30 days.  I took the deal, waited about a week for the equipement to arrive and set it up with much anticipation.  
Well, it doesn't work with Direcway, or I should say, doesn't work well with Direcway.  I could hear very clearly who I was speaking with, but my conversations back were completely garbled.  This was something I was afraid might happen.
I located a voip testing site and ran their tests.  The tests came back totally unacceptable on the voice out side.  They had a very comprehensive set of tests and the results which they let me email to my service provider, Vonage.  I attached a note and asked them to contact me via email or phone.  I received no response to my email.
January 16th I called to cancel my subscription.  I was told nobody was there to handle cancellations.  They issued a cancellation notice and told me I would be contacted.  I wasn't
January 23rd I finally decided to call again.  My account was still active.  The customer service person did see that I had called the previous week and cancelled my subscription and verified that I would be issued a full refund.  I got an Email a bit later showing that I had cancelled AND CHARGED ANOTHER $41.19 AS A CANCELLATION CHARGE.  Now I'm out almost $84.  I called back and the customer service person passed me on to another person (Credit or Supervisor, I'm not sure).
This second person asked if I had returned the equipment yet.  I told him no, I had just received instructions on where and how to mail it.  I asked him again about a full credit on my charges.  He said yes and agreed to send me an email stating that along with the need for me returning the equipment.  We agreed that I would send him the tracking number in a return Email.  I went to the post office, priority mailed the device and received a tracking number.  I waited all day for the email from him that never came.
January 24th I called again and got pushed up the support ladder.  I recounted the previous day's conversation and he agreed to send me the email that I would return the tracking number in, again verifying my credit.  That email never came.
January 25th again I called.  This time the lady I spoke with gave me her name, said I'd get a full credit when the equipment had arrived at the location, but couldn't send me an Email.  Why, I don't know.  She checked the tracking as I did on my end, and the package had not arrived.  She told me to call her or she would call me as soon as they received the equipment and she would immediately deliver a credit.
January 26th, I checked USPS tracking and found that they had tried to deliver the package the day before, but there was no one there to receive it.  It now had to be picked up at the post office or it would be returned to me.  I immediately called Vonage support and asked for the gal as I was told to, but the support person didn't know who she was.  I got someone else.
Got his first name, but not his last (for security reasons he said).  I told him the story, he said no credit can be issued until the equipment was returned, checked out and them informed that everything was okay.  This would take 5 to 7 days.  Not only that, but if the equipment was returned to me, I was responsible for mailing it out again.  It cost $9.00 the first time and I don't think it's my responsibility to make sure they accept their mail.  I asked to speak to his supervisor.  She was in a meeting.  I asked that she call me after the meeting.  I still have not received that call.
I just talked to the PO where it was dropped off.  Vonage did not pick up their deliveries yesterday (someone sick I was told) and that the package should be picked up today removing one of my fears.  Apparently they have truckloads of equipment coming back to them.  
I'll follow up on this post after the final resolution.  I believe I'll get my refund, but I should never have had to devote this much time to doing so.  I should never have ordered their service based on my environment.  That was the sales person's problem.
I should have received a response to my customer support question three weeks ago, which I never received.  A customer support problem.
I should have been cancelled nearly two weeks ago, another customer support problem.
Finally, I should not have had to call four straight days this week and gotten a different story each time I called and still not received a credit.  Again a customer support problem.
All in all Vonage needs to grow up pretty fast if they want to be a viable company.

										This company charged us $4200 to build a website that was supposed to be modern, state of the art and very techno oriented. They made us a prepackaged website from a template and used pictures that portrayed us as a 70's techonology company. When we asked them to give us what we asked for they took down our website and held it hostage until we paid them.
I would highly suggest not using this company as they are not creative and should be the last door you open for marketing.

Internet U.S.A. ",,800-308-4917,Musicmatch Jukebox (Yahoo) Free Trial False Advertising Claim Equals Rip-off San Diego Internet,"
										I would like consumers on the worldwide web to be aware of Yahoo Musicmatch.com and how they operate to get your money.  
On December 11, 2005 I decided to participate in a free trial offer granted by this company on the internet.  They said that I could sign up for a 7-day free trial offer, and if I cancelled within the 7 days, then I would not be billed.  Now I should have seen a red flag here, but to sign up for the ""free"" offer, I had to give them a credit card number.  I gave them the number for my debit visa which is connected to my checking account.
After ""getting in"" and seeing what they had to offer for music, I decided that the music they had did not meet my interests and decided to cancel.  I cancelled based on the instructions given on their website.  In fact, I even received a ""sorry to see you go"", email from them acknowledging my cancellation.
When I signed up, I paid a lifetime membership fee of almost $60.  7 days later, I noticed that my account had been debited.  I contacted one of their customer service representatives, and I was informed that they had not intended to debit my account, that my bank had made a mistake by sending them the money, and I would have to take the problem up with my bank.
I contacted my bank, and they said that the money had been legitimately scheduled to be drafted and that the bank could not retrieve it.  However, a representative from the bank offered to investigate the situation for me.  A couple of days later, I received a letter from my bank telling me that Yahoo Music Match had stated that me not being interested in their music was not a good enough reason for me to cancel.  The bank said they could find no evidence of wrong-doing on the part of Yahoo Music Match and that the money would not be refunded.
So what happened to the ""free trial"" offer?  Duh!  Consumers beware!

										I ordered a sample of LeanLife PM, cancelled 12 days later via their webform, yet they still charged me $99.90. I was trying to get a free gift card.
I disputed the charge with my credit card company and they removed the charge. I called LeanLife and they admitted I cancelled via the web and that they would credit me the $99.90.
Today in the mail, I received a notice from my credit card company that they had reinstated the charge. I was horrified and livid!
In LeanLife's correspondence, they say they'll refund me the $99.90 if I return their product. They never shipped me the product, only the 7-day sample supply.
I have typed quite a nice note back to the credit card company along with copies of emails from LeanLife stating they would credit me. Hopefully, the dispute will now go through.
Now that I'm so ticked off about this scam, I'm wondering if it's mail fraud or not, since they ship items through the US Mail. I'm wondering how I can report it officially to someone. This company has to be stopped!
Annette
Henderson, NevadaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

I received a second e-mail which stated to send them my full name, address, phone number, etc. I didn't.
Things to remember if you receive an email similar to this:
They change their contact web addresses all the time.
They also use different aliases and company names, and could state they are contacting you from any country.
How can you when win you didn't even buy a ticket.

										We ordered a Christmas gift from Sky Mall through their website.  The gift came on time and we were charged properly for it.  However, a month later we discovered a charge of $96.00 on our credit card statement from GalleriaUSA.  We did not know what the charge was for, so we searched online for GalleriaUSA and found alot of complaints about their dishonest practices.
We immediately contacted out financial institution which provided the phone number for GalleriaUSA.  The bank representative called for us and was given some explanation about how we signed up for a membership through Sky Mall.  I then got on the phone with Lisa #16503.  She tried to give me the same explanation but I immediately told her that I know her company scams people and that I wanted my money returned.  She promised the money would be replaced in my account within 2 days.  This incident occured today so I cannot speak about whether the money was replaced.
When I arrived home, I immediately called Sky Mall (1-800-Sky-Mall) to report that this fraudulent company was using their website as a way to scam their customers out of money.  Sky Mall was extremely uncooperative.
Sky Mall put all the responsibility on me for agreeing to the terms of this membership when I placed the order online.  They claimed that the invoice (which they emailed to me) listed ""Shopping Essentials Program"" as a second order.  
I responded that none of the correspondence from them reflected any second order, ""Shopping Essentials"" was never named on my invoice and neither was an additional $96.00 charge.  The Sky Mall operator said that she was looking at the invoice which listed all of these things.  I asked her to email that invoice to me, which she did immediately.  Again there was no listing for ""Shopping Essentials"" even thought the operator claimed she was looking at it.
I then asked to speak to her manager which she agreed to immediately.  However, after being put on hold for a few minutes I was disconnected without ever speaking to a manager.  
I tried calling back several more times and got the same sort of run-around which ended with my asking to speak to someone about a customer complaint.  I was told there was no one I could speak to about that but I could send an email through their website.
I blame Sky Mall as well as GalleriaUSA for allowing this practice to take place on their website and doing nothing to protect their customers.  We plan to file complaints with the Better Business Bureau concerning both of these companies.  My husband has also contacte Northwest Airlines, which took his complaint very seriously.

However, my child was so excited and Adamant about getting this Floam product that I just went ahead an ordered from online without looking into it.
It's advertised at 19.95 plus 7:95 shipping & handling.  During the ordering process they offer a few additional products as well.  I seen the Family size for 24.95 and thought ""why not"" you get an additional purple and white with this. So I selected it.  Now usually we're asked to verify what we're ordering. There was no verfication step. As soon as I hit submit a summary of my order and order number and total appeared on the screen. I had just purchased it without giving my final authorization.  19.95(tv add) + 24.95(family pack) + 15.90(s/h) = $60.80. Unbelieveable how someone get get away with this.
I called the only 800 number I could find which was for ordering only so they give me a Customer Service which is not tollfree(1-920-966-6600)and good luck getting anyone at that number, I waited for 15 minutes, hung up and immediately came to ripoff report.com, where Nicole from Sacromento, CA gave another number 1-920-966-6601, which I did get someone on the phone quick, but of course there was no such order in their system yet because I ordered it yesterday March 12,'06, the girl I spoke with, Amy, said they don't receive the order info until 24-48 hrs.  
From Amy I also learned that you can not order the Family Pack without ordering the TV offer.  So supposedly you get a double order plus the extra purple & white.  I have 2 kids so they will be pleased to not have to share anyway.  Amy also told me that I should receive the order in 4-6 weeks.  I'll see then, if I actually get what I ""BELIEVE"" I ordered.  
Needless to say, I am one who now documents everything I do, from whom I'm speaking with to the times waiting & reach a person, because it rarely seems that will deal with Honest Companies these days.  Local isn't always wonderful either, but it's nice to rectify situations or issues with someone face to face.

Provo, Utah U.S.A. ",,800-530-3813,E Proauction UNAUTHORIZED FRAUDULENT BILLING Provo Utah,"
										On February 17, 2006, I ordered software from e-proauction. To date I have not received it. I decided I did not want to participate in the program. On February 17, 2006, I called 866.377.6747 and spoke with someone in customer service. I told her I wanted to cancel out of the program and I did not want my bank account charged. She said she cancelled the account, and I received a confirmation email. No other instructions were given regarding cancellation of the account.
On March 3, 2006, your company tried to obtain an UNAUTHORIZED authorization to charge my account. Again I called your company at 866.377.6747. I spoke with ""Carol"", id number 0504735. She told me that my previous request to cancel the account was not processed. Again, I asked for the account to be cancelled and I asked that my bank account not be charged WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION. No other instructions were given regarding cancellation of the account.
On March 6, your company charged my account $49.95 WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION even after I made two calls to cancel and requested my account not be charged. In the morning of March 6, I called your company at 866.377.6747. I spoke with ""Jerome"". Jerome told me that, again, my cancellation was not processed. He said he would process the cancellation, and request a reversal of the charges. I asked to speak with a supervisor. He told me I could not speak with a supervisor, ""all the supervisors"" were in a meeting. I was not given a confirmation number or any other instructions regarding canceling the account or having the charge reversed.
On the evening of March 6, I called your company again at 866.377.6747 to verify the account was cancelled. It was cancelled, but I was told I needed to contact the ""refund hotline"" in order to have the $49.95 charge and related overdraft fees reversed and refunded. I called your company at 866.245.8577 and reached the ""refund department"". I spoke with someone in the ""refund department"". He told me I had to send an email to, support@e-proauction.com, in order for the charge  of $49.95 to be reversed and my refund of $120 in overdraft fees because of the unauthorized charge. Above you will see the overdraft charges and the $49.95 your company charged my account WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION. I hope this matter will be handled professionally and expeditiously.
I have reported this matter to the better business bureau.

Tampa, FloridaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										I ordered a sample of leanlife which should have only charged my account $1.99.  They did this and then charged my account $97.41 for a monthly subscription that I did not authorize.  I filed a report on this already and have since received a refund.  I then noticed another charge to my account that I didn't authorize.  I called the number and they told me that I had authorized a subscription to Efitness clubhouse when I ordered the sample of Leanlife and charged my account $28.97.  There were no welcome emails saying that I had 14 days to cancel before my account would be charged from neither Leanlife nor Efitness Clubhouse.  They just start charging your account and unless you research it you never know why these charges are coming out of your account.  I never ordered it nor authorized these charges to my account.  Now I again have to go to my bank and file a claim to get my money refunded because Efitness says they do not do refunds and that it was my own fault for not canceling before the trial date was up.  How can you cancel something you never authorized in the first place and didn't know existed?  You can't so they get away with stealing money out of your account until you notice and do something about it.

										Upon visiting this site you would try to click on an object to view a sample of whatever it is they are advertising.  After you do this you will be prompted to register with this site.  Like ebay they ask for your credit card number just in case you decide to buy something from the site later on.  Then before you finish signing up you are asked to read the user agreement contract.  Upon reading it the first time everything looks in order, then later you will be charged 37 or more dollars off your credit card without any reason why or even without purchasing anything from the site.  
Once you try to reach the company and asked them why, that is if you get through the automated machine the person on the other end will say that buy registering you agreed to a yearly membership and was charged for it.  If you check the user agreement by that time you can tell that it had been changed from what was previsiouly there.  They then tell you that if you wish to cancel that there is a $9.99 cancelation fee. 
Even though there was nothing stated about a yearly membership fee in the beginning they will charged you and then most of the time don't check any of their messages so that when you do call them all you get is the machine saying ""please leave a message, I'm sorry this mailbox is full""  and then the call automatically disconnects.  
This site is designed to rip people off and should be taken down.

										This company does not answer your questions. They sent me an order confirmation which did not agree with what they had charged me. When I asked about the descrepancy they took 4 or 5 replies before they would even attempt to respond.(it's almost as if they have standard answers they give regardless of what your question is). When they actually did addres my question they first denied that the order confirmation differed from what I was charged and then when I sent them a copy of it they said (emailed back) that they would have to refer the matter to billing. Four more emails followed from me to billing with not a single response and then I decided to cancel and get my money back.

										My husband agreed to a free trial that was to start once activated.  As with most free trials they want a credit card # so if you go over the trial they can charge you. 
My husband was given any information that there would be any charges until after the trial period was over. There was no indication that the trial peroid began when the info was requested.
He thought it would be fine we could get the info look it over and decide if we wanted to activate the free trial.  Some one began calling our home before we even recieved our packet.  He was not ready to start the trial because he didn't have any info. 
There is a button that says activate free trial. It stands to reason that it has to be activated to be charged.  Apparently not.
He didn't know he would be charged when he had not begun to access the account or any other info online regarding the account.  He had not used the password they provided in the packet which came after aproximately ten to fourteen days after the order for the free info. 
How can someone utilize a free trial that they have no info about for ten to fourteen days?  They charge you for something you have not gotten a chance to use becuase you didn't get the info until the trial peroid is over?  
Come on they charge you before you have a chance to decide if you want to use it or not. This is not standard operating procedure for a reptuable company.  We have dealt with other online sales companies that do not do business in this manner.
They sent no confirmation that we would be charged a certain amount which is standard whenever you order anything online.  They didn't inform us because they really didn't have our authorization that we wanted to continue in their program. 
Do not give your info to them ever!

										This company is supposed to be providing me with a reliable internet connection, but they keep having equipment problems.  I cannot use dial-up and there is no other service available in this area.
Since March 6, 2006, my service is interrupted at least 6 or more times every day for periods of anywhere from 1 minute to over an hour.  Each time this happens I get an error message stating the problem is with their equipment.  
I work for a large company and the internet is my connection to them.  Each time I lose my internet, I am also losing time from work.  I cannot begin to list all the problems this is causing both me and the company.
I have tried calling Hughes/Direcway many, many times.  I always end up on hold for literally hours.  Last week I held for 2 1/2 hours before giving up.  One time I reached a person who apologized, said it was their equipment, gave me a case number and said to call back if it happened again.  
I've tried contacting them through their website, but I lose my connection before I ever get to the help area.  
I pay a lot each month for this service and I am definitely not getting what I pay for.  I have resorted to writting and mailing a letter requesting credit for all the down time and improved service.  
As soon as there is other internet service in my area, I will change.  Though I don't know how I will cancel Hughes/Direcway as it appears to be impossible to contact them.

Charter Communications,"  Charter Communications  www.charter.net 
O'Fallon, Illinois U.S.A. ",,877-211 4450,Charter Communications Cable Internet and Telephone ripoff O'Fallon Illinois,"
										Charter Communications is like what AOL is to dial-up. I was so tired of having to deal with them. My service was always on the fritz. It was even down 6 days during superbowl weekend, and I had planned a party. I was pissed too because there had been no storms or anything; the weather was perfect. 
Anyway, whenever I called them up to report an outage, which was frequent, I would always get a sales pitch for their new telephone package which has unlimited calling in the US plus all the standard features for a whopping 35$ plus misc taxes and fees per month. 
So, between growing fed up with them on the phone, them never crediting my account for the time my service was out(and they know when it was cause they keep a detailed Station Log of when a customer calls, probably for quality assurance), them always promoting their stupid phone service, all of the outages, and the increase in my billing looming in the distance, I cancelled my digital cable package with them and chose a satellite system for my service. Which, by the way, has not experienced an outage to date. 
Well, with that done, I was still stuck with them for my cable internet, which was completely opposite of the digital cable, meaning that it was up and running 99% of the time. When I finally did experience problems with my internet connection, I once again called Charter's Customer Service, and they once again made me hate being on the phone with them. 
After going through the process of trying to get credited back money I paid to them during my outage, I found out they had still debited the full amount for one month of digital cable service from my bank account. As it turned out, they didn't cancel my service the day I called in to cancel, Oh NO. They waited 4 days later until after a new billing period began. So upon that news, I told them to cancel my cable internet service, because I was tired of having to pay for high charges for crappy service. 
Now, here's how to get yourself out of the Charter Trap. First, cancel everything. And don't let them transfer you to another department, or try to act nice and knock off charges or do something nice to compensate you. These customer service reps. are explictly trained to deal with people and those that aren't will just transfer you to someone who is skilled at keeping you from cancelling (sound like AOL yet?). The only department you should call is the cancellation department the next time you call charter. If you don't you will continue to help them rip you, and everyone else who has them, OFF. 
Second, you'll need new service (or not if you don't want it).
I priced different plans in my area. Cause that is what it all depends on really. Some people are just stuck with charter, and that is sad. Lucky for me, I had other options. What you need to do is get DSL(if you can). I found a plan with SBC for the same speed as charter's cable internet service for $35 less than charter's standard $55/3Megabyte. 
The downside is that SBC will also have you at least purchase their basic phone service to get their DSL. If there are other DSL carriers in the area you can get with and not get stuck with paying for a phone line to your house, for the love of pete, DO IT! You should really read up on DSL too before you select the speed you will pay for. See, the closer to the DSL switch in your area you are, the faster the speed gets.
After you have got your Internet Connection up and running, you can have a low cost, Voice over IP phone service that will do everything charter's phone service does. But you get a little bonus! You can pick your area code! So, not only do you save money, but your family can too if you pick an area code they live in. Vonage and Packet 8 are pretty good, but Packet 8 is about 5 bucks cheaper than Vonage. Oh, and not only do you get a good deal, they also send you a router with multiple (3 usually) ethernet connections so that all of your computers in your house can get on the same internet connection for web browsing. 
Finally Satellite TV isn't a bad option to cable, but that has always been common knowledge. Direct TV and some other competitor comapanies are around the same price as charters TV cable service. You will have to decide what suits your lifestlye more as well, because I don't think you can get VOD which is big with Charter, but both of them have the DVR. Being that they only slighty different in prices and services I would say they cancel each other out.
Ready for your monthy savings without Charter? Here are the numbers.
Charter                           My Plan
Phone 35/mo                       Packet 8 VOIP 20/mo

CHARTER RIP OFF FEE: $50 per month
                     $600 per year
Just so you know, Charter would never tell you ""Your losing money if you don't go with us,"" because if they did they would be lying. Have a Great Weekend!

Northbridge, California U.S.A. ",,800-4419678,Operator Assistance Network (OAN) ripoff - fraudulent bills on our phone bill. Northbridge California,"
										We received our montly phone bill from At&T/SBC and it had a charge on it from a company called OAN Services Inc.  With the number 1-800-441-9678 for the amount of $16.30.  
I was immediately biffed and called the number.  It was a regular guys' voicemail Saying ""Hi, you've reached Rick at 1-802-442-9678 leave me a message.""  Nothing about a business, nothing about any OAN services.  
SO I called the phone company, they said they have not dealt with this company before, but that they have to let charges go through unless we dispute them.  I disputed them.  I still did not know what the services were billed for!  The phone company said it was for some messaging investigation, but our phone bill said it was for an anti-virus email through INET Email.  And that the name of the company is Operator Assistance Network.  So I then called the state of Michigan Public Service phone number in Lansing.  
I left a complaint with them, and the guy down there said he has had a lot of these calls lately!  AT&T and SBC are able to block outside charges to your phone bill.  I had it blocked, but seriously if they can just bill your phone company what else can they do?  The jerk from OAN never did call back.  
I want so badly to do something to get these companies in some major trouble so we innocent ppl don't have to sit and worry every darn month and look over every single bill so carefully!  This is ridiculous.

										Be warned!  This company has found a legal ""gray"" area regarding internet commerce and they are using it to their advantage.  You agree to a S&H charge of $3.95, but, by law, they do not have to show the terms & conditions on the same page where you click ""I Agree"".  So, once you have clicked, they have got you by the short hairs.
You are apparently agreeing to an ""Auto-Ship"" program that the only way out of is to close your credit card or account that you gave them the number to. There is no way around getting hit with at least one charge of $106.90.  
And as I understand it, it is the basic policy of VISA, Mastercard, Wells Fargo (the bank I USED) not to reimburse these charges when disputed because they can't recover their funds legally from WhiteOvernite.  
I know that many people have filed reports with the BBB, FTC, FBI, etc.  Please keep contacting these agencies!  The only way we can put a stop to this is the get the law changed and to do that we have to get someone's attention.
I have yet to find an agency that will actually take responsibility for internet commerce security.  I'd say our best bet is the FTC.  If we flood them with enough letters and complaints, they will have no choice but to respond.
I am still pursuing this through the media also.  If I can get media coverage, maybe I can get someone's attention who will change the way this works.  
Large financial institutions are very aware of this scam, but apparently the law prevents them from not allowing it to happen.
My advice, only use paypal, or stay away from paying for things online.  The risk isn't worth the reward.

A few weeks past, and a clone of the girl came (but in a diffrent charcter), and she said to another girl ""Will you be my kid?"" and the same happened, she scammed 10 people (as the kid thing could happen boy to boy and girl to girl), and, everyone on her network and people joining in the furture wouldn't be able to join or log-in to vmk.

										Magic Numbers Estimating Inc. has a website that makes many claims. After being riped off by the president/owner by not paying me after work was completed, and after taking $18,000 up front for a construction project and doing anyhing I began an investigation. (See previous report)
The website in this case is mnemagic.com and is one of several that Magic Numbers Estimating/Bernard Woodard (aka Bernie) has up and running.
On this site he claims that he has both ""patented the process"" and that he has a ""provisional patent."" 
When checking with the U.S. Patent Office they tell me that not only is there no such thing as a ""provisional patenet"", but that the patent process is open for application.
On this site Mr. Woodard also claims that Magic Numbers Estimating has people (CCE'S)in each local area throughout the United States ""for each trade"" to assist contractors in procuring contracts.
As a former employee I can tell you this is simply not true. Mr. Woodard also claims and lists ""stratigic alliances"" on this site. Be advised, most of the ""alliances"" listed are either controlled by Mr. Woodard, a convicted felon, or do not exist at all.
Please note that it is a matter of public record at the Lane County Courthouse in Oregon that Mr. Woodard has numerous theft felonies and disiplinary orders, and sanctions from Oregon State angencies.
This is disturbing due to the fact that Magic Numbers Estimating/Mr. Woodard also offers payroll services, invoice financing and supplemental insurance whereby he would have your money in his controll.
Mr. Woodard also offers to do collections and accounts receiveables for companies. I have not been able to verify a license for such operations in the state of Oregon.
Mr. Woodard also claims that the jobs are ""specifically selected"" for each contractor. I can not go into details at this time however, I can tell you that is not what really happens.
If you would like to verify the dealings and records of Magic Numbers Estimating/Bernard J Woodard please call the following. The Oregon Construction Contractor's Board at 503-378-4621.
The Oregon Department of Justice at 503-378-4400. The U.S Patent Office at 1-800-786-9199. The Fair Contracting Foundation at 1-877-323-3247. The Small Business Administration at 1-800-659-2955 or 503-326-2682.
You may also verify that Mr. Woodard has also been on The Ineligable Contractor's List to receive public contracts due to not paying prevailing wages as required by law with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries. 503-731-4200.
It is also a matter of public record that Mr. Woodard has been fined many times by the Oregon Contractor's Board and The Bureau of Labor and Industries.
However fines by state angencies do not help the consumer after being ripped off.
Please note that this report covers only one website and business run by Magic Numbers Estimating/Mr. Woodard. There are several other websites that make other claims. Watch for additional reports on this magnificent ripoffreport website.

WOODLAND HILLS, California U.S.A. ",,888-811-5866,NET ZERO INTERNET SERVICE ripoff NETZERO STOLED MONEY  FROM  MY BANK ACCOUNT!!! WOODLAND HILLS California,"
										NetZero internet service is a RipOff! From the time I started with netzero there have been problems. From the beginning i had problems connecting to the internet with netzero. I called them letting them know of the problem,I was told to close my account and to pick a new name. Again, even with the new name i had trouble staying connected, I kept getting a pop up window saying that my net zero is corrupted and that i needed to delete it and reload the disk again, the same thing kept happening and still does. I had to delete netzero and reload the disk several times a day if i wanted to get online. Everytime I call I get people that are not helpful and usually rude and contradict each other and usually people from india that do not speak the language and are never helpful. To make a long story short, I was suppose to start out with free service for a few months, also a few more for not being able to get online without problems. Starting a few months ago netzero started billing me even though the service was still 'free'. I was not only billed once but 2 to 3 times per month until I had overdrafts and realized what was happening. I was billed for free service on 11/14/05 two times for 14.95 for high speed and 9.95 for regular service. I called and was told that there is no problem from a woman in india that could hardly speak english. I told her that I had the bank statement in front of me,she still denied any problem. I was billed again on 12/05/05 for 37.14 this time. Then on 1/5/06 I was billed again twice for 9.95! I tried to get help from the fraud department at my bank, They claimed to have contacted netzero but then told me that they do not get involved, that it was between me and netzero. I have called netzero and asked if I could send them my bank statements, I was told 'no',we don't work like that, another person there told me to get proof from my bank and get a routing #. Finally after about 30 phone calls in the last few months,I spoke with someone that did go over the account with me but as usual trying to deny any wrong doing or taking money out of my account, even though I had the proof in front of me, He then spoke with his superviser and said the best we can do is give you 2 months free and 30.00 back, I said that is not good enough,that you owe me aprox 70.00... He said ok, 45.00 is all i can do for you. I finally said ok, but i had to close down my bank card and wanted to have the money sent by mail,he said yes i promise, That was a few weeks ago. Today was the last straw, I called again, as usual I was put on hold for over half an hour, spoke with a someone that could not speak english then transfered to someone else once again. This time I was told that they were not going to send me even a portion of what they had owed me, that they only had taken out 37.14 on dec 5th (The first time they even admitted to that) and that they returned it to my account. They denied even owing me for stealing money from my bank account all of the other times. Even if netzero gets away with their lies and having the freedom of taking any amount of money from my account... I hope that I can save one person from this stressful and degradeing experience.

										I was fraudulently billed for a trackpass subscription at Nascar.com this year.  The money was taken directly out of my bank account this February without my knowledge or permission.  I cancelled the subscription back in March of 2005 when the account was handled by Real Networks.  
I contacted Nascar.com customer service and was told that I needed a copy of the cancellation email from Real Networks.  I called Real Networks, and they said that they no longer have a copy of the email, but they did give me a cancellation confirmation number indicating that I did in fact cancel the account last year.  I sent this info to Nascar.  They said, no, we need a copy of the actual email.  I have been going back and forth between these two companies for 2 months now, trying to get my money back.  Nascar told me they would contact Real Networks for me, and get the proof they needed directly from them.  They keep telling me to wait a few weeks, and I do.  Each time I call back to find out what's going on, they say they haven't heard from Real Networks yet.  One nascar agent actually told me that the refund request was already sent to their billing department to process the refund, and that I needed to wait 30 days for it to be processed.  I waited, but that turned out to be untrue.  They must think that they can keep stringing me along until I finally give up on my money.
If anyone knows of any other agencies or rip-off websites I can report this to, please let me know, as I intend to contact everyone I possibly can on this RIP-OFF!  Of course, if Nascar decides to refund my money, I will report it here as well, to be fair.

										Computer Games Magazine advertised on their website that they were offering access to the Vanguard Saga of Hero's beta test:
http://cgonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=523&Itemid=1
Although the advertisement does state that you will be put into a que, it uses phrases like 'you skip right to the front of the line' that lead you to believe you will be getting in right away or that the que of people you will be waiting with will be those that are 'skipping to the front of the line'.
Additionally the actual advertisement in the magazine leads one to believe that you should be able to download the game and start playing right away.
Unfortunately after reading Vanguard's forums it is quite clear that you won't be 'skipping' anywhere, but instead will likely be waiting several months while other testers go first.
I don't understand how you 'skip to the head of the line' if you are in a separate pool altogether.  What's worse is that Vanguard themselves seems to suggest that Computer Games Magazine is being intentionally deceptive to boost sales.

I have heard that when you are receiving customer ""no service"" you should write to the president/CEO of the company.  His name is Bill Gollan.  I sent a certified letter to him on April 9 and have received no response.  
I am now in the process of filing a complaint with Consumer Protection Agency.  I will file complaints and make my voice heard with any other agency I can.  I am angry and do not like to be ripped off.

Sunnyvale, California U.S.A. ",,408-349-5070,Yahoo - SBC - ATT Customer Care Doesn't Care About Customers Sunnyvale California,"
										I have had a yahoo e-mail account for about ten years. That is, I had one until about a month ago. 
Now, I have one that I can't access! I have been locked out for about a month. I've tried everything I can think of to regain access to my account. First, I went to Yahoo's ID and password help pages. They're totally useless for my purpose. I just keep going around in circles never getting my queston answered. I have looked in vain for a tech support e-mail address. Can't find one! I've found several e-mail addresses and have written to each one hoping someone at Yahoo will care enough to forward my messages to the right person to help me get into my account. Apparently, nobody cares!
If I can't get into that account, I will have a real problem. I have ten years worth of information stored there that I won't be able to use. The inability to access that information will end up costing me thousands of dollars. For example, I recently (09/05) moved to Mombasa, Kenya. There was about 2-3000 dollars worth of damage to my household goods shipment. Guess where the address of the insurance company is stored. That's right: www.mail.yahoo.com.
Does anybody have an e-mail address for Yahoo Tech Support? (Does Yahoo even have tech support!?) I have their mail address but I can't send a letter because Kenya Posta loses or steals half the mail sent through it so there's no guarentee a letter would get through and I would have no way of knowing whether the letter even got there unless Yahoo sent an answer back. And, I already know they can't be bothered with such mundane things as customer service!
Here's a CAVEAT EMPTOR for you: If you have a lot of information stored in your Yahoo e-mail account files, to include the Yahoo address book, WATCH OUT. I understand I'm not the only person who has been arbitrarily locked out of his account. So, take a few minutes and copy everything in your Yahoo account to another place on your hard drive. That way, you'll have the information you need when (notice I don't say ""if"") they decide to lock your account and then blow you off when you try to get help.

										I purchased several items from Sacred Pathways, which apparently has many sister companies. I paid quickly, they replied my items would be shipped immediatley. That was 4 months ago.
Whenever I emailed them, Brain Dowsdy of Customer Service, and Leo Wells is the Owner; they said my order was still processing.  One item was backorder, and could I pick a similar item that was not on backorder. So I did.
Still nothing. I emailed Leo and Brian (actually any email address I could find connected with them) I told them to please send the items they had now, on good faith and Karma. Then when the last item came in off backorder, they could send it later.
Put a Problem with Ebay Store Resolution Center with Paypal. They did their investigation and said that the company(ies) are not going to send me my purchased items and they had closed their account so they (Paypal) could not refund my money. They had opened a new account, but Paypal could not use that.
So they are still going on doing business and scamming many, many people. Telling them their order is still coming so the buyer will not report them. And they have to keep moving accounts, which should not be allowed. Total Rip-Off!

										First of all I received 2 different emails with the subject headings ""Make A Regular Income On Ebay"" and the other onw was ""Work Online With Ebay"". The emails were labelled ""From"": Ebay Certified Developers, Auction Success Team from Auction Success Review Newsletter. 
Both emails were solicitations for a $US 1.99 CD that would tell me how to become an Ebay powerseller. I thought it looked fairly professional so I gave my credit card info to sign-up for a measily $1.99. ""How could a guy go wrong for $1.99"" At least this is what i thought.
To make a long story short, I didn't ever recieve a Ebay CD in the mail or any other correspondsance by mail fromn this Company. Instead I recieved a debt on my credit card for US$1.99 to start, the first month. Then I recieved 2 subsequent debits on my credit card for US$49.95 (second month) and another debit from I Pro Auction for US$49.95. 
I called the company in Cda from 1 (801) 785 5069. Then I found out that Epro Auction was being run online by a Company called Electronic Marketing Services Inc. Anmyway, I told the people there that I didn't recieve my CD from them in over 8 weeks. They told me it should be coming shortly. However, it never came in over 6 months to date. Anyway, I asked them about the unathorized debits on my credit as well. They apologized and said they would credit my account for the charges. In the end they never credited me anything to date (9 months later).
The motto to this story is first of all not to answer to any emails with the subject headings as mentioned above. Secondly, make sure you have use a credit card company that will re-imburse your account should any unauthorized purchases or debits occur on your account. I was forthunate as my credit card company covered the unathroized debits on my account. I sincerely hope you have the same coverage on your credit account. If you don't get it ASAP without delay. And keep in mind this company will change its name on your credit to
I Pro Auction to ward off detection.
Above all else, I'm confident that you've read this note for a deeper more meaningful purpose this day. It is vital if not paramount that you know where your going for an eternity. Your life here on earth is but a speck of dusk on a whole beach of what lies ahead for you. Are you headed for heaven or hell?  Romans 10:10 in the bible will tell you how to can freely receive eternal salvation without regret or religiousity. And finally you will have the peace of mind you've been looking for for years. Today is your day!!! Jesus truly is the answer to any and all problems you may have. The bible states that ""Jesus is the Way, the Truth and the Life."" I'm the only Christian in my entire family and I am so blessed I could puke. You deserve to be as happy and if not happier than I am. All you can do is give it a shot. And in the end you will be more than glad you did.

Kamloops, British ColumbiaCanadaEDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										In August of 2005 I made the decision to purchase DirecWay for our home business. Since no DSL was available I was left with DirecWay as the only option for high speed internet. Being a DirecTV customer I had seen the ads on a daily basis claiming ""superfast connections"", ""always on"", and the best of all ""life changing"" due to the amazing speeds and surfing abilities. 
I placed a call directly to DirecWay and was put in touch with an installer in Akron/Canton Ohio. The installer backed up everything that DirecWay claimed and scheduled an appointment to install the dish. 
On the day of the installation I was told that the installer would arrive between 8am and 10am because I was the first appointment. He showed up 7 hours late and offered no excuse as to why. He then said that he had to mount the dish on a metal pole costing an extra $100. 
After it was hooked up, the speed seemed extremely slow. I was told it is always slow for a day or two. After a week things had not improved and I made my first call to customer service. I spoke to a man in India that didn't speak English very well. No problems were solved and I continued to call until I was finally transferred to ""advanced support"" in the states. This individual also spoke very limited English. The result was the same. 
After nine months of fighting them for better service I finally spoke to an American. He told me that upload speeds were not guaranteed and that 21kb was ""normal"". Normal! That is much slower than my dial-up connection. Web pages take minutes to load and often time-out. I understand that during a storm satellite connections are poor but that doesn't explain the slow connection on a sunny day at 2pm. 
I then tried to get help from the billing department. I suggested that the contract was not upheld and I wanted to cancel my service. He said for $640 I could be released from my contract. I explained to him that their advertising included an ""implied warranty"" if I remember my business law 101. You can't make claims like they do and not deliver on your promise. He said that I had no leg to stand on and would either have to pay or contiunue service. 
Now that my wife has quit her accounting business due almost entirely to the slow internet, I have no use for this dish. It was being used to connect to her office server. She was working from home part-time so that she could watch our children. Now I am stuck with a $106 bill for six more months. 
This company is the worst that I have ever dealt with. I would be very interested in seeing them taken to court over their ""business practices"". Good luck to anybody that tries to get out of their contract.

I have in the past reported this to Verizon that the previous moth I was getting calls and when answered by the answering machine it would only beep until my machine filled up.
I asked Verizon about it they said I needed to get on the do not call list for CANADA as they heard there is some FAX problems like mine going on. I did get on the list and those calls stopped. I now get UNKNOWN NAME, UNKNOWN NUMBER that leaves automatted calls saying I won things like trips or money.
In may I did answer one of the calls and pressed one as the automatted system asked, it was for a travel company in Miami, Fla. They wanted me to come down and stay free for 3 days and two nights but needed to sit thru some CONDO sales pitch. I asked for my name to be removed from their list. Now I get this scam.

Yahoo! Inc.,"  Yahoo! Inc.  701 First Avenue 
Sunnyvale, Delaware U.S.A. ",,408-349-3300,Yahoo! Inc. disabled paid for 5 year domain service after 3 months without warning and refuses to refund or enable. Customer Service Nightmare Sunnyvale California,"
										Yahoo has some wonderful free services, but I would like to give you one bit of advice when it comes to Yahoo:  Don't PURCHASE anything from them.
I purchased a domain from them.  Because it was so cheap, I bought 5 years of it.  I saw the warning during purchase that they do not give refunds, but I didn't think anything of it.  I have domains with many other companies and I have had them for many years.  I have never had a problem with them, so I was sure that I would not have a problem with Yahoo.  I was wrong.
Three months into the five year period, Yahoo shut my domain down and also shut down my Yahoo ID.  I had received a couple of emails from Yahoo but they looked so much like spam emails, that that is what I thought they were.  I read them but didn't dare use the links in them for fear of a scam.  Instead I went to my Yahoo account to see if it listed any problems and it didn't.  Then one day the domain and Yahoo account quit working.
When this happened I learned firsthand about Yahoo's Service.  What a nightmare!  Yahoo does not give out their phone numbers or email addresses.  They have a Help section on their website and that is it.  The only thing I could do is leave a message.  I found out that when the Help section said that someone would contact me in 24 hours, it took 48 hours.  And if it said 48 hours, it took 4 days.
When they did send me an email, it was a form email that did not answer my question.  We sent emails back and forth for two weeks (even when they said they would get right back with me, it took at least 24 hours for them to respond).  Some of my emails they lost, some they forgot and asked for the same information again.  Finally, after two weeks, I was told that they could not help me and I was given a telephone number.
I was excited when I called the number and someone answered.  No waiting.  But that person could not help me, so I had to be transferred to someone else, and then someone else.  After two days of talking on the phone, I found out that my account could not be reactivated and I was out 4 and a half years of domain service.  The last person did file a complaint with the higher ups at Yahoo for me.  That was a few month ago.  I have not heard anything from them since then.
I think that my domain was reported as sending out spam.  I think this because some malicious people had reported to my other domains that I had sent out spam and I was able to explain and prove the situation to them, but Yahoo never allowed me to answer the accusation.
What I ended up finding out was that they could not enable the domain service without connecting it to the original Yahoo ID which had been deactivated by Yahoo.  They would not change it to another Yahoo ID.  So I had to talk to another department about activating the Yahoo ID.  That department insisted that they have no way of activating a Yahoo ID after it has been deactivated even though I was never allowed to give my side of the story.
They do not give refunds but they would enable my domain if only the other department would activate the old ID.  What a mess!
One of the problems with Yahoo is that no one really knows anything.  If you ask them a question that is not in the list of questions that they can answer, they will put you on hold and later come back with an answer that does not answer your question.  When that does not work, they transfer you to someone else.
I have never dealt with a more incompetent support staff (and I have dealt with many).
Yahoo does well with their support of their free services, but many of their pay services are rather new and they have not developed good support strategies for them.  They don't seem to realize that some of their services are not free and that you should receive better service for those paid services.  Maybe this is because they know that they don't give refunds and there is nothing you can do if they decide they don't want to give you the service anymore.  They also put it all under a very general Terms of Service agreement which is so general that anyone could be accused of breaking them.
I know that Yahoo does not intend to rip off people, but for me (and I assume, for many others) it has turned out to be a rip off that took my hard earned money.  If you plan to purchase something from Yahoo, BEWARE!

Darnell Marquis
San Diego, CaliforniaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

I called to explain what happened and the supervisor, Katie, asked that I fax proof to her and then we could ""discuss"" the possibility of my getting a refund. I told her I would do no such thing; no way was I going to fax sensitive personal information about me to a CALL CENTER of all places! Please! So ""Katie"" offers me a partial refund but then states that I cannot continue to escalate my complaint and dissatisfaction if I accepted her offer. I told her that I was well within my rights as a consumer to voice my dissatisfaction regardless of what she offered me because I don't want to see anyone else get ripped off! Some nerve, huh?!? I have already filed a complaint with the Better Business Department as I feel that this is a classic example of a ""bait and switch"" tactic!!!

After waiting another 2weeks they were still having problems, meanwhile I was still paying hotel fee and other expense.
After about 8weeks of back and forth and thinking it was a problem on our end, they finally admitted that they cannot give me the service, they had some problem with the satellite provider.
I eventually was led to another dealership and after another 2months, the same thing there.
Eventually after spending 6mths in Guyana and 15,000U$, I left to come back to USA,where recently I found out that  they equipment that they sold me were beta testing equipment.

SwindonUnited KingdomEDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

When I expressed my feelings and confusion they banned me from the site because they can. I cannot express how unappreciated I was made to feel after 10 years of the business i gave them. 
This is strictly why I am reporting this incident. I do not support any business that holds such little regard for their paying customers. I suppose I may have understood being suspended if I had done something such as use profanity or harrass other members. But a vague thread title.

Austin, Texas U.S.A. ",,512-4984000,NCSoft ripoff their customers using fraudulant business practices Austin Texas Internet,"
										I've played Lineage 2 for 2 years and more now, and can say these farmers (people who ""play"" the game to earn ingame currency, adena, and sell them online. Usually using 3rd party programs that automate their actions), we know they exist in other games in the same category (MMORPG - Massive Online Role Playing Game), but in this game the farmers perform their illegal actions openly, and at times openly admitting it.
I have seen friends get banned for doing things that he did not know was punishable by a pernament ban, by running away from monsters and into a town it is considered an exploit by NCSoft (note: 70% of the town is populated by farmers with stores setup, and the monsters have a chance of killing people in town and dropping items)
Then I have seen totally illegitimate players openly admit that they use 3rd party programs to get the max level of the game and sell adena online.
Then there is the ""army"" of bots (3rd party program automated characters), which I can estimate to about 60% of the server's population.
Reporting these bots, not only result in an automated response by a Game Master (GM), but a rather lengthy explaination that they need to process these complaints accordingly. I have reported bots that have never been banned and it's been 6 months, they usually do eventually get banned, but only after the farmers have earned ALOT more real money than they spend on buying accounts.
On the contrary, many frustrated players in the game who decide to cheat the same way as these farmers do, get banned in days. (note: I did not get banned even once, the information I gave is there for comparison purposes only)
I am here to accuse NCSoft of ignoring the massive number of farmers for their own revenue gains, they goad their players into believing their lies but behind the scenes are actually going against the players. WE paid a monthly subscription for service, not to be patronised by the GMs and stabbed in the back at the same time. NCSoft is obviously ignoring the wrong-doings of people who give them more revenue (1 person can own up to 45 accounts and manage all of them using 3rd party programs)

PayPal,"  PayPal  2211 North First Street 
San Jose, California U.S.A. ",,402-9352017,PayPal ripoff withholding funds they are not entitled to. San Jose California,"
										Paypal links the accounts of users with the same address and telephone number (as well as users that send money to and from each other). I have the unfortunate situation where I have the same address as another Paypal user, (we live in the same building) and yes I have sent funds to this user from my Paypal account.  
The other user had an incident that put their Paypal balance into a negative balance, apparently over $1000.00.  Paypal took the liberty of freezing all accounts associated with this user.  
What this means is, until this person resolves their negative balance Paypal has hijacked my account and the money in it.  
The rules - I can receive money into the account, but I can't send money and my debit card has been deactivated. (Convenient for them right?)
When I spoke to the intelligent folks at Paypal I was told that I should: 
A)  Pay off the other persons balance for them in order to get my money.  (WHAT?!!?)
B)  Go to this person and plead my case i.e. ""please, please pay off your balance so I can get my money"" 
(AND HOW IS THIS MY RESPONSIBILITY?!!?)
C)  Wait 180 days until Paypal would release the funds (if they decided I was not a risk)(IS THIS EVEN LEGAL?!!?)
When I advised these people that this policy made no sense I got a whole bunch of ""yeah, uh huh...sorry to hear that"".  
The coup de grace is that the money in the account that they refuse to release to me is not acquiring interest. I was told, ""We (as in Paypal) are not a bank"".
So, not a Bank hmm... just online extortionist.
Does anyone else think this is crazy?

Dubuque, Iowa U.S.A. ",,563-519-2151,DropshippingWholesalers - Nick Destefano Ripoff Turnkey Ecommerce Online Store setup to fail Plagiarised my work and gave to other clients! Dubuque Iowa,"
										DropShippingWholesalers.com make the following claims on their sales site which, in my experience, have proven to be false:
NO PROGRAMMING NEEDED!
Easily Change almost anything on the site!
Add new pages and info with Ease!-(If you can type you can run this website. It is that easy!)
Easily add banners to the site
The online store that I purchased from them in February 2006 came with only basic admin functions with some not working properly from day one! The Ecommerce Admin Panel manual provided by Dropshippingwholesalers was very short on detail and left me with more questions than answers. The Cpanel instructions whilst being comprehensive was overwhelming for someone who had no HTML or programming experience. I made several stuffups because of it!  I placed many questions on the Dropshippingwholesalers members' forum and sent numerous emails requesting clarification and assistance.
Many of the responses I received were either patronizing or simply avoided answering the question directly. This has been incredibly frustrating and stressful.  I got the feeling that I was being setup to fail. 
Eventually, Dropshippingwholesalers sent me an email on 20 April 2006 with the following content:
We are going to release an upgrade to the admin area that will allow for a lot more customization and that will be available in the next couple of weeks. I am confident this will solve all your problems and questions.
In early May the upgrades were completed but it soon became obvious that many of the new functions did not work. It was around this time that I discovered my site had been used by Dropshippingwholesalers as their beta site without my knowledge or permission.  I then discovered that my site was also being used as their template for further sales to some of their clients! This resulted in all of my work at that stage (text and color scheme) being copied and provided to their new clients! 
The ensuing emails to Nick Destefano of Dropshippingwholesalers and posts to their members' forum, resulted in a very guarded apology that attributed his actions to a miscommunication error. 
How anyone could interpret from my communications with Nick Destefano that I was aware of or agreed to him using my site as a beta site and then as a template for his new clients, defies belief!  Logic and commonsense would suggest that no one in their right mind would knowingly agree to their hard work (i.e. text and color scheme, etc.) being copied and provided to other people without their knowledge or express consent. It's called plagiarism! Nick Destefano ought to have known what the ramifications would be by using someone else's site as his template. The fact that he had his own example website to use for testing purposes gave him no excuse to even contemplate using one of his client's website. 
Despite my request to both Droshippingwholesalers and the host (I think they are owned and run by the same person/s) to address my concerns, there are still several clone sites with my color scheme and text, which they have not removed or altered to my satisfaction.
Further, I have found that my site's color scheme has been altered by persons unknown almost every week for the past 3 months. I keep changing it back but within a few days it is changed to something ghastly.
In summary, despite my best efforts to have the matter satisfactorily resolved, I'm now left with a site that is not functional and several clones existing with my text and color scheme and having to pay for the hosting to keep my site live! An offer from Nick Destefano of a free ebook to appease me, is an absolute insult. I've been left with no other alternative but to bring this matter into the public arena in an attempt to get justice and to warn others.

And exactly 2 months later they had already charged my credit card $99.90 for another four month membership despite the email requesting my resignation!  When I complained that I didn't want their service, I was told I would get 2 months free,  which NEVER happened.  
Now, they are refusing to refund of the UNAUTHORIZED 99.90 charge. They have a very small database of members! (surprising?) I have tried calling but only get voicemail and no return calls. I have been able to get through by email only to be told they will NOT refund my money.
THEY HAVE SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICES AND ARE VERY DISHONEST!

Waltham, MassachusettsU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

Boone, North Carolina U.S.A. ",,888-4382427,"Charter Communications Claim to have High Speed Internet, ISP Slow & Inconsistent, Customer Service Deny any Technical Problems ripoff Boone North Carolina","
										Two years ago, I contacted Charter communications regarding my interest in their internet service. A woman in sales talked me into the three Meg residential service. 
During the first six months, there was no problem with the service. After that point, my email would not work and page requests were very slow and non-responsive. 
I contacted customer service about the problem on numerous occasions; customer service reported, Your anti-virus software or spam filter is causing the problem. I also contacted the software company and reported this information to them; the complaint had no foundation and was released as a hoax. 
Charter's own technician came out on two separate occasions, and there was no improvement in the service after a repair visit. The second technician reported we are doing some upgrades in the town of Boone, your service may get slow during the evening hours. This was six months ago, I cannot stand the lousy service I am getting from Charter Communications.
I am a college student; this makes a high-speed internet connection a requirement. I am also disabled and to pay Charter Communications eighty dollars each month is a considerable portion of my monthly benefits, which is not very much anyway. 
Now let's look at the television service. The volume goes up and down like a yo-yo. Sometimes I can count the pixels in the picture while it freezes like a bad DVD. The volume stops intermittently and even beeps on occasion. 
Charter has also hired a firm located in Canada to do their telemarketing to avoid the requirements of the Do Not Call Registry. This telemarketer unduly harassed me and would not take no for an answer; the last thing I wish to do is to pay Charter Communications more money for their sorry service. 
It seems the integration of telephones into the cable TV system seems to be the only priority of Charter Communication. This is just another form of capitalization within the public utilities. This means more equipment for consumers to buy or lease to connect the telephone to the cable wire. I look at the modem connected to my computer, the LEDs flash like some (chasing) Christmas lights most of the time; the only time it works good is while the LEDs are constant, about ten percent of the time. 
During the summer, I registered for an internet class; the connection was so bad I was unable to connect to the database to conduct the required research. Due to technical problems I experiencing, I was unable to complete this course. My college class resumes on 8/16/2006. 
Unless Charter Communication is able to provide a reasonable level of service, I will have no alternative but to discontinue service and connect to another Internet Service Provider. At this point and time I believe dial up service is actually better than the broadband offered by Charter Communications, Time Warner, Verizon and all of the other subsidiary companies using the cable network in this area.

I'm representing a lot of people with this complaint. Since we received our emails telling us moh was finished we complained to them and sought legal help on this matter. After ea found out that a few of us had involed lawyers they have since backtracked and given us 90 days reqired notice.
But that is just not good enough for a company of this caliber. We all kept our emails stating that 1st of august was close down date even though I was the 1st one to receive this email. It arrived on august 3rd and on august 15th they gave us our 90day notice which if you ask me was totaly wrong and illegal.
We have saved the emails if you would like me to put them on here then just say the word as I've posted the link to this website on the ea forums now so more people can have their say.
Ea is now saying it's a tech problem is why they're offline on moh rs but like I said we have the emails wich clearly state diffrent. I would be more than happy if someone could help us with this matter as I don't think ea should be treating customers with such contempt.

I have to get up early enough to unplug everything, let it set and plug it back in. I have documented most of the problems, and trying to port out my phone #'s to another company. This is a nightmare. This is the most incompetent company I have ever dealt with. Vonage gives a whole new meaning to idiot! 
They have been contacted 4 times by a new provider, just today I found out they say they sent a rejection notice which the new provider never received. I have been E-mailing them trying to find out what is going on and they have said nothing about the rejection until today. I have been waiting over a week. Now they have 7-15 days again to jerk me around.I get to continue to pay for the service. 
Sometimes I have a dial tone, sometimes not. I can't hear people calling me, they can't hear me. FAX-I get to call everyone,sometimes it goes thru, sometimes it doesn't even if the NEW fax machine says it does. Where did that echo come from-it only took them 1 hr. to get me to the right dept so I could spend another hr with someone that speaks my language to make the adjustments. 
One of the poor employees I spoke with on my many calls in for adjustment had an echo that just appeared. It took 3 times asking him if he was on a vonage phone before he actually admitted it. He made adjustments on his phone while I was waiting for adjustments on my side. I asked him why they lie to people about the quality, that vonage knows about the problems, because his phone was screwed up. I guess they train people to ignore questions, he just pretended he didn't here me. I asked him if the volume was turned down on my phone and of course he said no. I asked him if he was sure because I was sure I had just asked him a question. 
Somebody PLEASE do something to stop these people. I watched their infomercial on TV and it is the biggest bunch of hooey I've heard in a long time. I wonder where these people buy pants. It must be the Vonage store, specially made to fit the buldge in the back because there heads are so far up their butts. Mabe thats where the echo comes from. It's time to sue these hiney holes.

Seattle, Washington U.S.A. ",,206-674-2700,"Real Networks - NFL Field Pass ripoff credit card charges, dishonest billing practices Seattle Washington","
										I now live in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but I grew up in the DFW area in Texas. I am a Dallas Cowboys fan.
Last October (2005) I wanted to listen to a particular Cowboys game on the radio while working on a re-model to my house. Unfortunately, no Tulsa radio stations carried that broadcast, so I went online to see if I could listen on my laptop.
After a little searching, I found the NFL Field Pass from Real Networks. It would allow me to hear the game online. I didn't want the entire season, just a couple of games, so I signed up for a month for $9.95. I figured that was a reasonable price for a month of access. Everything worked great.
Here's the problem. They do not make it clear when you sign up that you are not signing up for a month of access, but in fact, a monthly subscription that is billed each month until you cancel that account.
A year later I found out that I have been paying $9.95 per month for a service that I wasn't using, or even aware that I was being charged for, because no billing notification is sent out. They just quietly keep charging your card until you notice.
I called customer service to try to get a refund of the $100 charged to my account over the last year, but was told that it was against 'company policy' to grant such refunds.
When I asked why I was not notified about the billing each month (as every other online subscription of mine does, such as iTunes) they said that the notification is made in the form of a line item on my credit card statement.
Granted, I should be more attentive to my statement, but Real has shown that is willing to employ 'below-the-radar' business tactics to get a little more money. First they do not make it clear that you are signing up for a subscription, and second they do not notify you of the monthly charges. Their business model requires people to be inattentive to the credit card charges to succeed. They are a dishonest company, and I would suggest that people steer clear of them. 
Their 'Black-Hat' tactics tells me that the will never be a major online content competitor. iTunes doesn't charge me $1.99 without telling me via email that I've been charged. Everything is on the table. I trust them. I don't trust Real Networks.
I did a search and found that others have had similar problems with them. They make it difficult to cancel the 'Rhapsody' music service, and keep charging people until they jump through extensive hoops to get them to stop. You can sign up online, but to cancel you must call an 800 number, wait for 20 minutes, speak with someone who barely has command of the english language (likely in India), and then argue your way out of being charged again.
Real Networks is a rip-off, and they are dishonest. Do not trust them.

										On my first day of work I asked the secratery how the payment schedule worked. Her answer ""Jim pays you if he feels like it."" I looked at her and asked her to reiterate. She told me that I would have to ask Jim. I asked him, and he stated that the pay schedule would be every 2 weeks. *I should have followed my intuition and quit then*
This is a web design company, but on the computer that I worked on, there were not any proper design programs to be found. The computer was filled with viruses. I spent time there trying to fix and dealt with fustrations of the computer being un-workable. I was told to do some research and various other things. I also started designing from home, since my computer was set up and running perfect.
I noticed that sales people came and went and also that I was the only designer to be found in the building. I asked if the company was a franchise or if he was the owner and my questions were always left with a ""we will talk about that later, I have a meeting to attend.""
I worked there for 2 weeks and a total of 40 hours. On one Friday I told him that I didn't want to be an ""in-house"" designer anymore. I would work from home and when I finished projects I would move to the next. I asked him before if friday was payday and he had told me it was, though no paycheck was handed over. He told me his accountant would get it to me.
My friend had an interview with him on that Friday and when she came to the building the whole office was GONE! She talked to someone who owned the building and they said that Web Presence was evicted from the building and that they had a 90 day eviction notice.
I called Jim's phone and left messages. On Monday he finally called me and stated that the Owner was a liar and that he wasn't evicted...he just decided to move. (but didn't tell anyone?)
He asked me to call another client of his, but I told him that 1. I wasn't doing anything until I got a paycheck and 2.That I had to work my other job. A few days later I got an email stating that he might loose the client 'cause I promised I would call and didn't. I reiterated what I told him and he got angry. He emailed me and told me to send him all the materials I had for freelance immediatly.
I eventually sent the materials back to the companies that they belonged to, and found out that he has been ripping off many people. I have the names of 8 businesses that have paid him anywhere from 400.00 - 2,000 and have yet to see a website completed by him. I also have now names of 6 designers including myself that have never recieved payment from any of the sites they finished.
I have found that he threatened several of the designers, and he threatened myself as well. I went to the police and made a report including the ""threat"" email I had received. When I made the report I found that he had a photo on the page ""mugshot"" he must have been booked for something.
I have connections with some people in the law enforcement and one of my friends pulled up his record. He has many counts of Harrassment and Intimidation, one of Disorderly Conduct and also has a Do NOT Contact order.
I have still never been paid and I do not expect to. After doing further research I found this indiviudal does not own a car, and does not own his own home. This man is 27 years of age and claims to have experience in many fields, I checked the background and it does not substansiate the claims. This person is in the business of trying to run a legit business but missing. Some of his clients may get work done, but the majority do not for he does not pay his designers. Once they realize they are not getting paid, they drop the projects and he must find a new eager designer to work on them.

										Do not waste your money buying these stores! The rankings  on the search engines will not advance.  I  am writing this so others will not waste their money.  Technical support is bad.  The only person that I could say something good about is Bradley Ervin.  To do the internet Ad Words you have to spend a lot of money.  With $50 a month I got 2 clicks (23 cents).  I advertised on free sites and with Exactseek.  Ispeedway gave me 3 weeks of free advertising at the end.  I got traffic but no sales for a whole year.  I worked hard at keepiing my store stocked and organized.

										When I ordered my skydive, I did not realized that 1-800-skydive is acutally a middle man company.  They schedule you with a different company.  They scheduled my skydive on the day the they were told that the place would be closed.  
The day that I was supposed to skydive, I called to let them know that no-one called me with directions.  They gave me the number of the place and told me to call there.  I did and did not recieve an answer.
I had to call 1-800-skydive multiple times to get a hold of the help desk.  I left a message with the person who answered the phone.  I told him to tell the help desk to cancel my skydive and to call me when they get out of their meeting.  No one ever did.
I called 5 minutes before it was scheduled to try to talk to the manager about it.  He got on the phone and said, ""yes, you are all set to dive.""  I told him that would have been great if someone had called me with directions and that I have already asked to cancel.  He said that I would have to email customer service to get my money back.  
The owner of the actual site called me two days later and appologized for the inconvience.  He told me that 1-800-skydive the scheduling service he uses and that he had told them to not schedule skydives for that day and the day before because he would be out of town.  That shows that 1-800-skydive had lied to me.  
I called the customer service to inform them of my newfound information, and he just continued to tell me that they do not give refunds.  I told him that it was not my fault that they had scheduled me on a day that the place was closed and that I should get my money back.  He still would not agree.  I told him that I was going to report them to the better business bureau and he told me to do what I had to do.
I did report them and I contacted my credit card company.  Two months later, I finally recieved a credit on my card, but it was fifty dollars short.  I informed my credit company that I had a letter from the owner of the actual site where I was supposed to skydive and that it stated they were closed that day.  I mailed it to the credit card company and a week later I had the full amount back... no thanks to 1-800-skydive.
During this time, I found out that 1-800-skydive pops up on many skydive sites besides their own.  They book skydives for many different states and skydiving companies.  So be careful when you want to sky dive in a different state.  If the website or the person on the phone states that are no refunds, be wary.  Book your skydive directly through an actual company.

										I placed my order over 6 weeks ago. The first call I made was 2 weeks after when I got no confirmation of delivery. They stated that they were waiting for one costume then they would send both of them. The second time I called was 4 weeks after and they told me that they were still waiting for one of my costumes to come in and they couldnt send the one they had because then I wouldnt qualify for the free shipping. I told them I needed it before the 12th and they said it should get to me by then & to check my email. The third time I called they said that it was the same as they told me before but they could send the other costume out if I wanted. 
When I questionned them how come they told me that they couldnt send it out last time, he got very defensive and said I was wrong & that I talked to the wrong company because he would never say that. After that he said that this is what I'm going to do for you miss, I'm going to cancel your order and credut me back because he didnt like my attitude and they didnt want to deal with customers who harrass them.
 I told him it was my right to know when I would get my merchandise because they charged my credit card over 5 weeks ago. Since then they havent credited my account & I'm reporting them to the better business bureau.

										Back in May 2006 I ordered a weight loss product called 2 day slim down for the price of shipping only (4.97). I had to return by two weeks in order not to be charged the 58.95. I did return by the deadline and was still charged. The next month I was shipped the product after cancelling and charged again the 58.95. The following month I was sent yet another and charged again after calling and emailing that I no longer wanted their product. 
After talking to a customer rep, the following day they charged me again, but I did not even get the product. My banking account has gone negative twice because of this and now I have to cancel my account and open a new one at a different bank. They owe me 4 refunds in the amount of 58.95 and they have yet to reimburse me. 
I have found a website with other customers that have been duped. I never authorized an autoship of this product yet they will not remove me from this list. Please help me and others stop this scam before others lose everything they have worked so hard for. I have been charged 650.00 in fees because of this and I need it to stop. I hope you can help. Thank you.

										On August 31st 2006 I opened an account with IIC Internet Services for an online storge server. I then tryed it for 29 days and decided to cancel the account because I didn't like their service and was looking for a better solution. The main page of their website states that they have a 30 money back guarantee, no questions asked. On September 28th 2006 I called the company and also emailed them requesting cancellation of the account. I received no response via email but was told by phone that my account would indeed be canceled. 
I figured I was all set and the account was canceled. I never received the refund for the 30 day money back guarantee but I figured ""no big deal"" as long as the account was canceled. On September 29th I called them again to confirm my account was canceled and they said it would be. I then promptly forgot about this because I assumed I was all done with them. Well this was not to be, on 11/6/06 I received another charge on my credit card from them. I filed a dispute with my bank and called this company again wondering why I was still being charged, they said that I would be refunded for the latest charge which would appear on my statement in the next day or so. 1 day goes by, still no refund and the original account is still active! I called again and was told that the account wasn't canceled because someone emailed them saying that the storage site (my account) wasn't working and they wanted to know why? 
Here's the thing.... I never sent any such email! But again I was told by phone that the account would be canceled and I would receive the refund, another day goes by... no refund and account still active. I call yet again and also send an email requesting cancellation a refund and threatening to possibly take legal action. No response via email but by phone the same story as before, refund was issued, account was canceled. It is now 11/11/2006 still no refund and account is still active! So.... no 30 day refund, account not canceled and I still keep getting charged. My next stop... the better business bureau, after that an attorney.

										There's a sucker born every minute
and I'm afraid I've been one of them.
allcoolmusic.com's mp3 rocket 
Do not, I repeat, do not be a putz like me and download this shit.
So here I am thinking enough of the illegal downloads' (well, that after having caught some viri using Bearshare). So I download a product that claims to offer
unlimited free music and movie downloads
But wait - if it's too good to be true, it usually isn't true, right?
But here's the reasoning:
The software is free. You are paying for unlimited technical support and so we can run the website. If unsatisfied, for any reason, you can cancel your membership within 30 days for a full refund.
Okay, fair enough - I just want to legally download music without fear of catching a virus or some police cracking down on my harddrive.
I check out the FAQ on the website.
If you ever become unhappy with your membership, you can cancel anytime with no further obligation. There's nothing to return, and canceling is simple. In fact, we are so sure that you will like your membership that we offer a thirty (30) day, money back guarantee.
Okay, that doesn't sound too risky. Although, any person with half a brain would've found the Legal Info a tad fishy. But that half of my brain must not have been working that day
So I pay for the software.
And install it.
And everytime I try to run it, I receive the following error: could not find Java 2 runtime environment.
Now this happens about 20 minutes after I've signed up and paid for it.
So I check out the FAQ again.
If I have a question, is there a real person that can help me?
Yes! We have a friendly technical staff that is willing and able to help answer any software or downloading question you might have. All support staff hired have to enjoy helping our customers find and download free music and movies.
All I get is a form to fill out, on their website - did that twice, that was about 4 weeks ago - still no reply. You don't think I ever found a TELEPHONE NUMBER to speak to one of those friendly technical staff, do you.
So I fill out the form and simply state that I am not happy with the software I downloaded in the past hour and please do not bill my credit card.
No reply. Not that day. Not 3 weeks later. Not after I have sent them the same message 3 times.
Perhaps I should have checked out who registered www.allcoolmusic.com before I bought mp3 rocket (allcoolmusic.com's downloading software):

										On 10-25-06 I got a notice from Pay Pal saying this. This email confirms that you sent $36.00 USD to Reunion.com as a subscription payment.
Only a year ago when I got a one year subscription I went thru the process of cancelling any more renewals. So I have been just waiting for it to expire. I went to reunion.com and I even checked the renewal page and it showed that my subscription would not be renewed automatically that I turned that off. 
So I wrote Pay pal and told then there was an unauthorized charge on my account. I disputed it. After I also wrote reunion.com a few letters demanding them to credit my account back my money and you never hear a word from them. There is not even an email address that shows up anywhere where you can just write them. The only thing you can do is go to a page and then another page comes up to click on a complaint. So you write them and click send and it takes you to a blank page and it does not say anything. You don't even know if it went thru or not. 
Now today I was smart enough to copy and print that page to have some kind of proof I have been emailing them. SO I like sent 3 to make sure maybe one may have got thru to them. I sent a consumer complaint . So anyways Pay pal cancelled the dispute saying it was not an unauthorized transaction and they went a head and pd. Them. 
So just now I tried calling the reunion.com telephone number and told them I had been writing them since 10-25-06 and I have never had and email back. NOW I am using Mozilla FireFox and maybe that is why. But the bottom line is if I shut off my renewal thru reunion.com then that should be that. Maybe this complaint should be about PayPAl. I don't know. 
But As of this phone call I am going to get a credit back to my account thank goodness. Always check the pay pal subscription renewal thing I never even knew was on the site I guess.

Winona, TexasU.S.A.Click here to read other Rip Off Reports on PAYCOM.NETEDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.   
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

										On October 2, 2006, I heard an advertisment on the radio for a ""FREE LAPTOP; just visit www.notebooks4free.com"". I visited the website to see what it was all about and discovered that it was just an advertisement ring-around site. They ask you to sign up for an offer (only credit card offers don't cost money to sign up for) and to refer 18 friends to the website. 
Onlingo was one of the offers to sign up for; I had wanted to learn French and they said they'd only charge me $6.95 for the shipping & handling cost, no mention of any further commitment or recurring fees. The only hang-up was that I had to call the company, cancel my ""subscription"" (which I didn't know I had even signed up for at a cost of $76.90/month), get a return number and return the third disc within 10 days from when THEY SENT IT. If they don't recieve it within 10 days, it's an automatic charge of $69.95, however if it's returned within 30 days of original shipment, the company will refund $40.00 (there's a $29.95 re-stocking fee). I only learned all of this after my boyfriend called the company and requested information on their practices. He waited 15 minutes to finally be able to speak to someone, who then put him on hold for an additional 5 minutes to go speak with his supervisor. 
I was charged $69.95, 16 days after I recieved my Onlingo discs. Less than a month later, I had an additional charge of $76.90 on my account. Onlingo has already charged me a total of $153.80. After speaking with customer service for an extended amount of time, I had all but $43.85 refunded. This is a bit expensive for a ""free"" language CD offer. It's even expensive for one disc, which they originally stated I would only be charged for if I didn't return the third disc of the set. Only after I threatened to call the Better Business Bureau and the United States Military Inspector General's office over unfair business practices, did I recieve any sort of understanding or attempt at fixing the charges.
I'm know I'm not the only one that has been fooled by this company by not reading their fine print on their main company site (the fine print is half the size of the print on the site, is in light grey, and is at the very bottom of the webpage). Make sure you read all the fine print, I know I will.

The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.  
And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.  
Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth. 
If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form. CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD 
If the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.   
Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. 
 And good luck Let us know how you do!

Suisun City, California U.S.A. ",,800-949-6880,Onlingo ripoff Signed up for trial then charged me $75.90 month without my consent! Suisun City California,"
										I was one of those people who went for the www.notebooks4free.com. And I picked Onlingo and another vendor who offers instrucitonal CDs because they only charge me $6.95 for CD plus shipping and handling. Nothing else was mentioned when I signed up for the offer.
Then I went out of town for business for several months. And after I got back in October, I noticed that my credit card got charged continously by Onlingo more than $250! Without my consent! 
Then I picked up the phone to speak to their customer representive, and they only agree to refund me the latest CD $60.00 (they even try to eat up $9.95 stocking fee!). I said it was not acceptable and would report them as scam and bad business, and they said, ""Go ahead"". 
I already reported to my Credit Card company to dispute these charges. But not only did I feel it is a rip-off and scam, but their attitude would make you mad. 
By the way, the other vendor did the same thing, but I was able to get them to re-fund to me right away, so that's why I am not reporting them. And to me the whole www.notebooks4free.com thing is a scam as well.

										In November 2005 I got AT&T's Dish Network and Yahoo DSL. I was given 3 months free movie package, even though I did not take the package when signing up.  They charged me for the movie package after the 3 months. They said they would refund the charges but never did, and even coninued to bill me.  I disconnected service with the Dish Network in July, and soon after, the DSL. In August, I sent a certified letter stating I was discontinuing telephone service.  I spoke to customer service many times and told them why I was disconnecting- fraudulant charges.  They continued to bill me, and I even received a bill for November 2006! They have turned me over to a collection agency for over $300!! And, still charging me! 
I unplugged my phones from the outlets in August immediately after I sent the letter telling them to disconnect my service. I feel they are retaliating for my disconnetions. I have paid everything I actually owed.  These charges are absolute fraud!! Whom do I complain to? FTC, PUC, Attorney General?? I need to know what to do.  If Sears decided to put items on my credit card and then turn me over to collections for not paying, they would be facing criminal charges.  
How can AT&T get away with fraud??

I found out by looking at my bank statement!
Then they charged it again for another months of services 2 days later! They never answer their phone and refer me back to their web site where they smugly respond to my inquiries saying it's all on the site. They can charge me if I sign up for 4 days.

TAMPA, FloridaU.S.A.EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back!  HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO:  
Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.  
According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days. 
If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges. 
Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!   DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!  
Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face.

										Yeah, I have to admit that I got suckered into this mess!  I signed to a deal that i should have known was too good to be true.  They told me that 'they' were in talks to allow dish network to operate in canada and the deal was going to go over very soon; so i bought in.  
The big shock was when I got a phone call quite a few weeks later asking if I wanted to buy advertising for the low price of $1800.  I could purchase advertising that went all the way up to $6000.  Well I told the guy that I don't exactly have that kind of money floating around.
I phoned USAOL to get a refund and discovered that it is a little to late for that.  So I'm stuck with this dead web site for satellite dishes while I'm paying $22.00 a month for a year for them. It looks like I definitely won't be getting any money back!  
I told him that they are scammers and they didn't seem to appreciate that to much. Well the truth hurts I guess.
It's been about six months and I haven't seen any commercials in Canada saying Dish Network and Dish Pronto are operating in Canada.
A hard lesson learned.  There is no such thing as easy money.  The only way you are going to make any money is if you do it the old fashioned way; trudging to work for you full 8 hours!!

At some point in our back-and-forthing I asked her how she could sleep at night, and she told me that all her customers are quite happy -- ha!

She instructed me that someone else would have to remove it because I lived a distance away and to have it removed on that following monday. She performed all surgeries on Thursdays (when her office was located in Detroit city). I'm not sure if it was properly healed but it left a scar and the size of the scar is 10 time bigger or more than my mole.
