 Eisen Research ,"  Eisen Research   Internet USA ",www.eisenresearch.com, 617-848-4211,""," I was contacted by Eisen Research on 9/18/14 to participate in a market research focus group to take place on 9/23/14. It was an email invitation. They called me on the phone and I was approved for the study, the same day, 9/18/14. On 9/19/14 I received this message by email: Thank you for agreeing to participate in our upcoming market research discussion. Your presence is extremely important to us, as we had to restrict the project to an exact number of participants. Please contact us immediately at (617) 848-4211 if your schedule prohibits you from attending. I replied and told them that I would be able to attend. Then on 9/22/14, at 11:30 AM, I received this email: ******************************************************************************** From: info@eisenresearch.com Date: Mon, 22 Sep 2014 11:39:46 -0500Subject: REMINDER CALL - PLEASE CONFIRM Hi, This is your reminder call about your appointment for tomorrow, October 23rd, @ 6:00PM, at Focus Pointe Chicago, 645 N. Michigan Ave. Please e-mail me back or call to confirm that you are planning on attending.If you have any questions please call us at 617-848-4211. DON’T FORGET TO GET THERE 10 - 15 MINUTES EARLY TO AVOID BEING LATE. Thank you, Martha Eisen ************************************************************************************ I replied to this email also on 9/22/14 at 12:10 PM. I said, ""Thanks for the reminder, I will be there tomorrow evening."" That was another email confirmation. However, at 2 PM, just 2 hours later, I received a phone call, telling me that I was OUT of the study, because they had overbooked. I told them that I didn't feel it was acceptable to kick me out after so much time, and 2 confirmation emails. They didn't apologize at that time, they just said that there was nothing that they could do. I felt very bad, because I had totally rearranged my schedule to keep the 9/23/14 date open, and they kicked me out the day before the focus group. I have always known market research groups to overbook focus groups, it is quite common. But they always pay you the full fee. Because they don't want to make you angry, and they want to be able to use you again in the future. Eisen research wanted to give me nothing, even though they had put me through a confirmation and a reminder, both by emails, and asked me for a reply each time. I think that this is very bad behavior. And I was very upset by this. I know that basically the whole thing was because they had overbooked the study, but it took them 4 days to realize this. I really think that they should owe me the compensation for the study, which is $100. I think that this whole practice, the way it played out, is a form of fraud. Or at least deceptive and misleading behavior. And I don't believe that they should be able to get away with this. They should have had better control over the number of people that they were booking for the study. And they should have notified me right away, instead of waiting until the day before the study was going to take place. I believe now that, since they didn't know exactly how many people they needed, they wanted to keep me on long enough to keep themselves safely covered, but they wanted to let me go when they thought that they wouldn't have to pay me. For sure, if they had kept me one more day, they would have owed me the $100. I think this was a very sneaky way to waste my time, knowing that they were never going to pay me anything.

When I went in to interview the police we there and I turned around and left I wanted no part of that. After some digging I found out that Consumer Education Outreach owned by Jeff Randol is a front for scams he perpetrates. Jeff Randol has been operating as an independent business owner since 2001. He has run through a string of illegal and bankrupt businesses such as Great Leads and Consumer Education Outreach. His main focus is low-grade outbound call campaigns targeting senior citizens, the elderly and at-risk adults, even tens of thousands of consumers on the National Do Not Call registry. His business is a front for his illegal TCPA Robo-calling campaigns, which use pre-recorded voice messages for consumer theft. Currently, he is being funded by ePath Media a company owned by Bill Baskin & Jeremy Buttke based in California to run press 5 business to consumer automated call campaigns for Reverse Mortgage and Solar. Some of the unregistered business names Jeff Randol uses as fronts include Green Energy Association and American Mortgage Quotes. Sometimes he has his call center staff claim to be from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or from an energy company like Pacific Gas and electric to steal people’s information.  He even fakes the caller-id’s to trick the unsuspecting consumers into believing the calls they are receiving are from the government or a public utility. Jeff Randol’s personal life is just as screwed and corrupt as his business; he is under investigation for fraud and violations of the TCPA laws, a sexual harassment suit, and several wrongful termination lawsuits. He has been convicted of providing alcohol to minors and using false identity credentials (Colorado Case, Weld County, 2000M913), Felony Theft of $15,000 (Colorado Case, Boulder County, 2004CR3709), he even filed for personal bankruptcy in August of 2013 (US Bankruptcy Court case 1317811ABC). Theres talk online and on Facebook that he has been physically abusing his beautiful wife Debi and then told her to claim she fell off a horse. While he's having an affair with one of his employees. That is why the police were at his call center to investigate the allegations of fraud and domestic violence. Jeff Randol continues to operate his boiler room business in Windsor Colorado. Jeff Randol has no business phone lines for a reason, so that no one can call his fake business. You have to reach only him on his cell phone at 970.518.7228.

The first business ""You Get Paid Fast"", took only $28 payable by Certified Checks and Personal Money orders, so then came the ""International"" business model called ""My New Internet Business"" which was $100. Money for advertising is taken from you and then when you get leads into your new ""The Marketing Platform"", you never actually get paid. Why? Because the platform keeps expanding, morphing, and changing so that you must join ""UNDER HIM"" in the next best program such as ILN, MOBE or DPS in order to gain access into the membership area and supposedly receive commissions from the MAIN Entry Portal Business called ""The Marketing Platform"" or TMP. The problem is that you can never return back to see your stats, see who is in your downlines or check on your pay because it is all bogus. I had eight sign ups after joining the first two platforms and then spending a couple of hundred dollars to advertise in one of his Co Op's. I went through support to ask where my commissions were and they said after three inquires that they handed it over to Paul. I got NO REPLY from him. I then took matters into my own hands and emailed the sign ups I was supposed to have on my team to again get no reply from any of them. I was just about to join the DPS system which is a high ticket business through HIS TMP for $840 (which would qualify me as a Gold level member). I didn't like the method of payment and so I contacted Paul about it who of course would be more than happy to accomodate me by adding a special ""PaymentButton"" on the order page just for me so he could get paid. Then he went ahead and marked me as being paid and I was given full access to the DPS. However I never went through, I backed out, didn't join and didn't pay, yet Paul conviently added me on the Blog to share with everyone as yet another Gold member joining the DPS! If you check on the blog at ILN or softrwareresellers.internetlifestylenetwork.com/  or  facebook.com/groups/PaulDarbyTeamILN/  you will notice that every entry on FB will only show new members being added and welcomed aboard, BUT NONE OF WHICH SHARE ANY REGULAR COMMISSIONS OR EARNINGS! Is this just a  coincidence that there are these missing details? I think not. My advice: Have nothing to do with this guy or his marketing platforms. The other programs he is promoting are all great and very legitimate and profitable, but when you go in through Pauyl Darby's TMP, he will skim off your money, take your sign ups and keep you joining new programs that HE overrides all your efforts from of course. Can I prove this? No. I cannot prove it because HE controls all who enter, and what you are allowed to post. Just try to get money or talk to your sign ups in your down linre or even look at them and you may find out the hard way like I did, that this my be more difficult than you were expecting. The training he offers is old, outdated and the videos show how he doesn't want to fix the junk he puts out there. The man was a bit quirky to me at first and I was slightly amused and entertained, but I am not laughing anymore since being scammed out of all my time and money. I suppose what hurts me the most is that I trusted this man and believed he was honest and caring. Don't let this facade fool you as it has the other 80,000 on his marketing list!

He stated that they were not and that they were a Google Partner.  I asked him about the campaign if it was PPC as they state on their website. He said that it is but there will not go over the amount that someone pays them. He said that when someone is interested the outbound callers collect their information and his level of representative then call the customers. I explained to him that they should better train their outbound callers to provide the right information. He said that I was costing him money and he hung up. Be truthful on the phone. All PPC Ad campaigns can be Budget Based. If someone is giving you $300 per month to run their program you would never go over the $300 or you would lose money. The customer's ad will stop getting displayed if the budget isn't correct.

While their advertising suggests these are 100% organic, what I saw first hand is the opposite.

Grant took me to a motel and took me into it, the place was roach infested, and smelled of lost dreams and sex trafficking. He caressed me and kissed my neck, before forcing me to take my pants off. He felated me, and bent me over to sodomize me. I was too drunk to protest, as I lay there lifeless, being violated by this sick s.o.b. Grant proceeded to beat me, the next day I came to the office and was told I'd been terminated. I took to exposing grant, but he showed up at my home with a hand gun, and threatened to kill my family if I spoke.

After contacting my account executive with concerns that the leads were not coming quickly enough he gave me options to expand my territory. I did not agree but several days later I received 2 leads that were outside the selected counties; in defiance of my express wishes he expanded my lead area. I spent more time on the phone and drafting emails than contacting my prospect. I asked for a refund of my remaining leads as I lost trust and faith that I would be delivered what I paid for. I was informed by VP of Sales Robert Gregory that I would not receive a refund, that my options were to expand my territory, expand my age range or get semi-exclusive leads. He also stated that when buying exclusive life leads many of iLeads clients have a territory of an entire state, which I certainly was not told adn would have have altered my approach. He regretted that I was not told. This experience does not reflect the quality of the leads, as a veteran life lead purchaser I know it can be difficult to get quality leads, rather this serves as an educational tool for others to make informed decisions.

I used to be employed of this company. I want to apologies to any of the customers I have signed up, thinking I was going to help them to have better internet presence for their business. When I first started there. Ryan was the owner & Krista Koka was his accountant& King Wells was the CFO. They helped Ryan out in the back office. Within a week or two. Krista & King Started taking Ryan to Hooter's (this is next door to Click Media at the time). To get him Drunk. Krista & King would tell all the employee's that Ryan was spending all the money from the new accounts & that they had no money to pay the employee's. Krista & King would make them self’s appearing as the hero's at the time. Once Krista & King, where able to steal the company away from Ryan & buy all the accounts that Click Media had. Krista was now the new owner & changed the name to Grand Placements Services G{P}A. She then had me go into the back office to try to get Click Media account to sign a new agreement for Grand Placements. That way when their billing would be due they would have to pay Grand Placements any money that would be due. If the customer would not sign, than they would not do any business for them. They would say they could not help them since she was not a part of Click Media. All though the only change that was made was Ryan leaving and the change of the name. ending my time their everything stayed the same instead of Ryan spending the money we watched Krista and king shop, purchase a new car, move into a new house and yet on pay day they never had pay roll for their employees claiming Ryan was hacking the accounts and calling all of our customers and getting them to cancel. Needless to say I and 3 other employees with family couldn’t continue to work without pay had to resign. When we had returned for our last paycheck they did they not pay any of us, and now claim that they are suing each and every one of us for our old accounts who have cancelled. The reason for this message… I don’t want to see them steal anymore money from both hard working business owners and employees trying to make a living to support themselves and their families. If you are looking to do business with grand placements services or be employed by them take a few minutes and do a little Research on them to make a sound decision, hopefully I have helped you………….   ",  Computer Marketing Companies

Seven months later we have not recieved one phone call, or one email from either site.  Keep in mind after seven months and several requests the contact function on the sight never worked.  Donovan Media AKA The Web Leader was paid in full for both sites as soon as they where completed in August.  Then the monthly fees started, several months we were billed improperly and one month we where charged $5,000.00 on our credit card.  If i did not dispute it and say something, I would have been over billed.  Their response was that it was the secretary's error. They also, without written consent, started billing my other company's credit card due to a issue with the first card.  Every few weeks, I would call the office to see why there was no response to the sites.  Noone in the company was familiar with our sites and in seven months they went through three SEO techs that I know of.  Seven months later and loosing a lot of money, I requested that my site info go to another provider.  Their response was ""NO, I cannot have the passwords and info to take my sites"", that I paid in full for.  I also had my two sites evaluated by a third party that had no benefit in providing me with this information.  Their conclusion - that over the past seven months they have done no SEO work on the sites, so i have been paying alot of money for nothing.  I tried approaching them a civilized manner regarding a  solution to this matter.  Tom's response to me was that they can't figure out how Googles new coding works and that the results I wanted, I needed to pay him $2000.00 a month to get. That was not what our contract stated. I am fully aware that SEO takes 2-3 months to start working, but seven months later with no calls and no emails -  something is wrong.  This company was recommended to me by someone. I should have never given them my business.  It took the owner seven months to call me and the only reason was because I disputed his fees on my credit card.  Now, with thousands of dollars lost, he took my two sites down off the web without my permission and he refuses to give me the passwords. Again I paid in full for both sites, so why wont he give me the Info. He had links off of our site of all of his clients. Some of those clients were are competitors and one was an adult novelty store. This is not the way I wish to present myself to my clients. In addition, he took the websites down and put up a message to call Donovan media due to billing issues. So now, this is what is displayed if anyone should view the websites.

Enroue Communications know nothing about Search Engine Optimization thats why their website has a page rank of zero, and they rank number four in Google SERPs for the search term ""Enroute Communications"". Unfortunately we did not know this before we hired them and only learnt the hard way that they can best be described as a bunch of fumbling amateurs when it comes to SEO and a complete liability when it comes to PR. The Enroute Communications scam is based on the fact that they advertise services that they cannot fulfil and end up doing more harm than good. Enroute Communications posted a rebuttal against a group who have been seriously damaging our brand image. Except they made critical errors with the first paragraph and were completely shot down within hours, which led to Enroute Communications panicing and withdrawing the rebuttal, which only damaged our credability further as they were representing us. For any company in need of SEO or PR please avoid the Enroute Communications scam, they will only rip you off and leave you in far worse position than before. Like all unable seamen Enroute Communications are utterly lost in the turbid waters of internet marketing and will drag your company down to the depths with them, abandom ship before it is too late.

They offer an incredible free web application for online marketing. I used it fine for about a month. Then as my company email marketing list grew I naturally had no issue paying for their premium service that supports larger email lists.  As of the day I paid them - not a single email campaign has gone out - mind you, it was the same exact campaign I had used under the free account. This is the genius part, they bait you with the free service then switch it up when you pay them.    I received a vague email stating some nonsense about an ""omnivore"" program that was verifying my email addresses. I had 2500 emails on my list, 2000 of those emails had gone out when I used the free account, and then only after paying their ""verification software"" flagged those same emails as requiring additional verification. Does that in any way make sense?  So I emailed asking what happens next, what exactly they were talking about, and got no response whatsoever.  By the time the second day came around I was infuriated, as my business is bleeding from lack of marketing materials going out.  They are a good free service for small novelty products, if you have a real business that needs to operate smoothly then they definitely are not the company to use.  They have no working phone numbers, I left countless mesages on their voicemail system, no calls back. I tracked down their parent company - Rocket Science Group and the same thing, they are off the grid with no working numbers and ofcourse they ignore your emails.    This is a incubated, start up type firm, their business model is to build their customer list so they can flip it around and sell the company, investors buy when subsciptions are high. So they are not concerned with customer relations or operational legitimacy. Just some techy types that execute an idea then leave you high and dry when you need actual results. Also, their analystics for open rates, etc. are horrible.    Then, I sent an email letting them know that I would be charging the fees I paid back through my bank, FYI - a chargeback is bad for the other end, the company that originally received the funds (meaning Mailchimp) not for the person who the funds originated from. So I reminded them that a chargeback would be bad for their accounting purporses and they would have to pay bank fees and it wouldn't faze me in the least bit.    Lo & behold - within hours I received the first and only repsonse from them - I would be refunded.    LMAO, these people are jokers. Big disconnect between executing a company and actually operating a company. MAILCHIMP IS A ONLY WORTH THE FREE SERVICE THEY PROVIDE!!!   I went with constant contact, which is anywhere from $5-$15 more, but it is worth double - seriously, Constant Contact has phone support, I spoke with them 30 mins the day I signed up, they got started on verifying my email list right away, they asked me my schedule for getting the campaign out and they had everything up and running for me right on time. I can't praise them enough, they truly understand what they do and their work ethic speaks for itself.    CONSTANT CONTACT fan!!!!!   ",  Computer Marketing Companies

The calls keep coming.  I am now to take a online course on Corporate Credit for a business that really doesn't exist except in name only.  E M Business Connections has lead down a path a financial ruin with no real means of making any money.  I have a federal EIN number as a Merchant Agent but no contacts, no equipment to sale, etc.  I would like to sue E M Business  Connections but have no way contacting them.

 Yodle ,"  Yodle  50 W 23rd St, Suite 401 New Yourk, New York USA ",www.yodle.com, 877-276-5104,""," Practices used by this company can be downright damaging to your company's web presence in the long run. They rent the URL to you (yes, you pay for it, but they own it) so all the advertising money you spend to promote the URL is lost when you leave them. (Unless you know this and insist they use a URL that you buy and refuse to transfer to them). When you leave them, they rent ""your"" URL to your competitor. Now your competitor begins immediately receiving the trailing benefit of all your advertising spent with Yodle. Yodle looks good to new client, because they are re-routing all residual leads that come in after you stop paying them to their new client. They take over your Google Places page. If you let them ""manage"" your Google places page they will remove your ID and password and take full control. You are cut out of access to Google places. When you leave they threaten to close your Google Places page. If you let them setup your Google Places page, they claim they will close it down. If you let them ""Manage"" your existing Google Places page, you will have to fight and argue to get them to give you back the ID and password access you once had. They will sell you a website, then re-sell it to everyone around you. In my case, same colors, same people photos, etc... This makes you look like a cookie cutter commodity. The phone number they promote is not your phone number. Again, like the URL, they can and will re-direct the phone calls to your competitor when you leave. When I worked with them they were not able to produce enough leads to cover the cost of their service plus the direct costs to service the client. When we asked to cancel service they refused. Then after the contract was over, our position in Google for our favorite three key words (we were ranking #1 on two of them and varied between #1,#2, and #3rd position on the third one) was severely damaged. We stayed on first page for one keyword, however, much lower, and for the other two key words we stopped appearing on the first page all together. Our Google Reviews disappeared and we can’t seem to get them back. Over a year later, we still have not fully recovered our Google Places position. We have had to hire someone to get this fixed.

They even forgot several services including a social media optimizing! I had to call them 3 months after to ask them about it, and they stated that they forgot to include that, however, they DID NOT forget to charge me for it! Their reporting is on an email format similar to this: photo booth ....8 down -2 photo booth rentals....13 up +1.... EVERY month I had to call and remind them to send me a report! They forget to send them! REALLY?!!!! The company I am with now sends me bi-monthly reports and they are an 11 page attachment with graphs, stats, rankings..... I'm a little concerned for Chris, the owner, because she forgets a lot! My mother had alzheimer's and I can sense a little of that. When I switched to ABT from another SEO company that optimizes Websites, my site was ranking number 3 for the key words, ""photo booth rental(s)"" when I left ABT last month, my company is not even showing up on the 4th page for ""photo booth rentals"" and I have fallen to number 9 for ""photo booth rental."" I really think Chris ""forgot"" to optimize my website every day. Now she is claiming that I owe her for a month of service (8-1 to 9-1) when my month has ALWAYS started on the 17th. I have records to show this. She ""forgot"" again and said that my month started on the 1st and therefore owe a month of service that was never provided! I have also caught her in another lie from an email I retrieved from my cousin who also uses her services (not for much longer though). In it she states on Aug. 10th ""FOR THE RECORD, we did not do ANY website work for him."" But now she wants payment for ""services"" from 8-1-8-3!  Please do not ever use this comapny for SEO services. You will not get the results you are looking for!

No dice.  I then questioned Exact Data's rate of $100 append fee per 1000 records to the competitors average fee of $12 to $20 append fee per 1000 records.  2nd red flag.         He pretty much said it that's the way it is, take it or leave.  Limited skillset, lack of professionalism and poor attitude puts not just the rep but the reps company in a less than desirable light.  And to be specifically told to go to the competitor, I told him I would take his advice.  3rd red flag.

As an OPT student struggling to grasp a jump start with my career, I fell in the dead end at this surge of stench. First let me warn you that Systems Logic is really know as iVision Solutions, Inc. The same company that is posted online with an establishment of a staffing agency to promote placments with high end clients/vendors. The issue stands as such, there altered format of resume enhancement after ""Training"" is forged and falsely promoted experience that is dishonest and untrue. I was marketed after arriving in 16 weeks. The training was for a period supposbility 8 Weeks. The catch in this is that there recruiter lures you to their office after finding your profile online or at their weak job boothes at local or state regitheystered job fairs at colleges preferrbly targeting the Chinese community beause of their OPT status. I am a victim of this. I came to their offices and found that the offices suggested on the website were going to be upheld as professional enviroment, not some vacant run down office. I walked in and none of the lights in the hallway were on or even working. I noticed sleep employees or students or someone the first day I came taling about how tired they were of the internet never working. Right then and there I should of walked off, but I had no choice at this point, I already bought my flight ticket and spent the remaining amount of money I had on taxi because they were too cheap to pick me up. Once I arrived, I was greated by the office mananger Bilal Shabbir, he listed all the rules and etc and told me once I signed the ""Agreement"" I would be binded by their contractual rules. I only sought this far because of H1B sponosorship promised from their or my recruiter, who by the way lied to me about being in the united states, he was in India!!! I waited for like 6 hours in the office until finally Bilal came back to take me to ""Guest House"" which was not in the apartments like I was told I would stay, but at a townhouse. When I walked in it was like a punch to my face. Dirty, smelled like trash, no A/C, trash everywhere. I was like am I really staying in this dump?! Eventually after weeks of complaining, they sent someone to come fix the issues, but wow. We had to be clearly begging becaues just after a week there, I had bites all over my body. I went to a local doctor and had to pay out of pocket to be notified that I had been bitten by Bed Bugs!!!! I went to the training for the period mentioned, the traininer was never there or always calling off, his name is Ravi. We would be told to be there at 9 am by the staff and traininer and noone would show up or we would get notified by the office manager that he would be running late. By then our training went from 6-8 weeks to 12-14 weeks. Once we were started to be prepted for marketing, I noticed that they had their India office assinged to marketing people. Who I could barely understand. What makes this even worst is that they lied about my resume and promoted me to interviews with falses experiences and I felt so ashamed by then. Fianlly after months of being at this dump, I got a job. The funny thing is that once I arrived at the clients location, I decided to just quit. I took the offer from the client. I never got paid unitl like 4 weeks being at the job site. I never got my promised incentives or part of my deal or offer. I honestly only had one good experience when I was there, but it seems that person is not even working there anymore. If you get approached either online or by phone by these scam professionals, hang up, ignore!!! I was told I would be sued or sent to collections. I was threatned like a million times since I've left, but it felt good to leave. There never get a penny out of me. ",  Computer Marketing Companies

 Lava Leads & Transfer Guru ,"  Lava Leads & Transfer Guru  Miramar, Florida Miramar, Florida USA ",www.lavaleads.com, 866-663-6369,""," how can Tim Tate and Cary Gottlieb still be in business with this LavaLeads scam after all of the complaints you see under this pargraph of customers losing money? This is unethical and it seems like Tim Tate closes down one company and opens another in the same industry. Is to avoid prosecution? i cannot understand why the Miramar police are not investigating this company. also, whoever allows them to take credit card numbers from customers should be investigated too. They are probably all in it together. Tim Tate, we are on to you and the walls are closing in. watch Your back buddy!  http://www.ripoffreport.com/r/TransferStar-Transfer-Guru-Dean-Austin-Tim-Tate/Fort-Lauderdale-Florida-33304/TransferStar-Transfer-Guru-Dean-Austin-Tim-Tate-You-cant-get-a-refund-you-can-ge-471749 http://www.ripoffreport.com/r/TransferStar-Transfer-Guru-Dean-Austin-Tim-Tate/Fort-Lauderdale-Florida-33304/TransferStar-Transfer-Guru-Dean-Austin-Tim-Tate-You-cant-get-a-refund-you-can-ge-471749 http://www.ripoffreport.com/r/Lava-Leads/Miramar-Florida-33027/Lava-Leads-I-Will-Never-Use-This-Company-Again-Miramar-Florida-1068180 http://www.ripoffreport.com/r/Lava-Leads-/internet/Lava-Leads-Finally-someone-posted-about-this-low-life-company-Internet-1060771 ",  Computer Marketing Companies 
 NuDigital Marketing ,"  NuDigital Marketing  970 reserve drive #121   Roseville, California USA ",nudigitalmarketing.com, (916)560-1051,""," NuDigital Marketing was hired to take over all of the digital marketing for my dental office.  They were contracted to fabricate branding, Facebook management, a website with management as well as any other social media services.  After paying them the monthly fees for over 4 months all that was completed was a few posts on Facebook, no website, and an approval for a logo and color schemes.   In my opinion, the website should have been up and running by the end of the first week.  The Facebook page should have had daily posts completed with pictures at least tri-weekly.  This however was not even initiated until the fourth month of our contract.  I was required to coach my representative weekly on items that I was paying the company to manage so that I would not have to worry about them.  Isn't that they whole point of hiring a social media company?  This was not the case with this company.  They spent months slowly trying to fabricate a logo that I was satisfied with but in the meantime, they did not create a website nor develop my Facebook (which should be the first items to get up and running as they draw in new patients).  Once I finally agreed on the logo, they personally decided that it wasn't ""right for branding"" and self-decided to remove it from my website and all other forms of social media.  They also changed my decided upon color palates to ""make the branding right"", even though it was not what I wanted or even represented myself.  At this point I was becoming frustrated and gave up with caring because I just wanted something up and running.  I spent a great deal of time writing content for both the website, brochures, and facebook as their representative was incompetent in doing so himself.  Overall, I wasted over $8,000 on this company with nothing to show for the months of waiting, and now they want to charge me and file a lawsuit against me for $21,000 to pay for all the future work that they claim they would have done for me.   This company has clearly shown me that they are a misrepresentation of what a social media company should provide for any business.  As soon as I decided to leave them, I had a new website up within 24 hours and was receiving phone calls from new patients in less than 48 hours.  My facebook now has daily posts that are clever and did not require me coaching or writing content.  I have business cards and a logo that is representative of me and my company.  I would never recommend NuDigital to anyone in the future.  $8,000 wasted that I'll never get back!

 Lava Leads ,"  Lava Leads  3350 SW. 148th Ave.  Miramar, Florida USA ",LavaLeads.com, 866-663-6369,"",  Using Lava Leads has been just a awful experience. Like other people reported it is so hard to speak to someone. You can call and leave messages or e-mail and no one will get back to me. I had several service issues where the system stopped working and I would call and leave a message about the problem and no one gets back to me. I did get ahold one time of Cary Gottlieb and he told me they would have it working the next morning. Well it was not working the next morning so I could not get any calls. Today my system is frozen and I called several times about the issue and the message was no one was available leave a call back number which I did and on one called me. What I did was call back and hit the sales option line and guess what Tim picked up the phone and I told him my system was not working and he told me he have it up in 2 hours. So if you want to get thru try the sales line that's seems to work if you have to speak to someone. Cause they are looking for your credit card Also I like to mention when the system works I get a lot of transfers where they want to be on the DNC list. I wonder if this company really scrubs these calls. I spoke to the Better Business Bureau and I can file a complaint even though they don't belong. Yes we have to warn people about this company. ,  Computer Marketing Companies 
 Excell internet Service ,"  Excell internet Service   Internet USA ",excel.net, 866-905-6768,"","  I called 855-200-9172 to sign up for Hughesnet which would have cost nothing to install, I spoke to a young man named Joe. The first time I called I was not able to activate my credi t card so I told him I would have to call back. The next day I called back to give him my debit card and was told they would not charge the 40.00 just needed to make sure card was valid. Then Joe stated hugesnet would not allow it unless I purchased the equipment. I told him I had already gone through this before and there was no problem, it was just supposed to be a 40.00 hold, he sttd they also had Exede which was far faster and all arouhd better than Hugesnet but it had a set up fee of 49.99. I told him okay and was happy to get the faster of the two. He asked for my debit number and I gave it to him, then I asked when I would have to pay again. He tried not to answer but that made me feel uncomfortable. I continued to push it until he stated it would be about 3 days after installation and it would be 60.00.  I told him I would not get paid again by then and he offered to delay installation, I told him I was working online and needed it. He stated nothing he could do.  I asked him not to charge my card and cancel the order. I asked him if they would charge it, he stated ""I don't think so, but if they do they will refund it in 7 to 14 days."" I told him I did not want to wait 14 days. I hung up with him and called my debit card, it had already been charged while we were speaking.  I called the number back and asked for a supervisor, the man stated his name was Ernie and he was the Supervisor.  I asked abut Joe and he said he worked in a different Office which I thought was strange because I had already spoken to him there twice. The call was sent to Exede and the person I spoke to was in billing, she was very good at escalated calls and calmed me down, I told her a customer has a right to recind an order and not be charged, if that is the way it is set up they by law have to let the consumer know. She said she would escalate call to her supervisor, while waiting te fcall was disconnected. Icalled back and talked to another young lady who just continued to tell me the money would be returned in 7 to 14 days, I asked her why I had to wait and she said because it takes that long. I finally requested to speak to her supervisor who would not even come t the phone. I refused to discuss it with her anymore and told her  had the right to speak to someone who migh t be able to handle i t.   she finally got a Supervisor and he was very rude, I told him as a consumer I had the right to resolve this he stated it would be 1 to 2 weeks for refund, I old him a chargeback cou7ld be done in ten minutes, he stated they did not do charge backs, they refund back on the card wi thin 7 to 10 days.   Ever heard of a chargeback???? It means you put the money back on the card, the ony reson it would take that long is if they plan to fight it, they better not I did not recieve any services and I was straight out lied to about everything from the beginning. There was no problem wi th Hugesnet Joe just got more money for signing exede customers.   I am very angry at the rude and nonchalant way I was treated and they are trying to break into the business? Not like that. If I was starting a new Company, I would want a marketing Company that was up front withs my consumers, no tone that is going to misrepresent to get people to sign up. Exede didn't seem to have a problem with this so what would they be like if I had kept them as a provider? There was no customer Service to it, I was treated like a sucker and while I had been blaming the Marketing Company I wonder if Exededid not know what was going on all along. For a new up and coming provider this will not  help you grow. I have been in Customer Service and related fields for 25 years and I have never seen a new Company come out of the door by being rude specially when their reputatoin is involved.   ","  Internet Marketing Companies, Computer Marketing Companies "
