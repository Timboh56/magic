This doctor appears on TV so I believed in highest standards and excellence. Never had anything done before, so after an initial consultation I decided on a dermal filler to smoothe a wrinkle in the middle of my cheek .  This was three years ago, and I never uunderstood how a simple procedure meant to improve my appearance can literally ruin my entire left cheek. Why I did not sue?  I do not like to sue people so I waited patiently because a dermal filler is supposed to dissolve after maximum two years.  But mine never dissolved .  This ugly scar appears on all my pictures and it is a source of my constant misery.   Here is the chronology: I had dermal filler Radiesse injected in my left cheek by Dr Ordon's assistant Mr Rob Lucas, on April 11, 2011. MY preference was Juvederm but I was injected with Radiesse without Dr Ordon's supervision.  He was not there.  I came to the office again on June 6th to report negative results and ask for my money back. I paid $750.00 for this disaster.  I am a senior on limited income, so I expected some good will and an apology.  Again, I asked for Dr Ordon, but he did not want to come and see me.  Total arrogance and avoiding responsibility.  He did not want to rembourse my money, either.  So I wrote certified letters begging for help and appealing to Dr Ordon's conscience.  As I found out his assistant Mr Lucas performed this procedure incorrectly. The Radiesse was injected too close to my skin surface.  Still, I was waiting for it to dissolve.  Eventually I made an appointment on Spetember 9, 2014, with the assurance that Dr Ordon will see me.  Again, I was fooled.  I was told that Dr Ordon is away on vacation.  Imagine my disappointment. The request for reimbursement was denied by the office manager.   I want to stress total unprofessionailsm and arrogance of everybody I was talking to. The assistant Rob Lucas was in total denial.  Never apologized. The office manager told me not to come any more, because """"Dr Ordon will not do anything"" and she shrugged.  She told me I was a ""persona nongrata.""  She did not even want to acknowledge my letter addressed to Dr Ordon that I brought with me.  Dr Ordon once again succeeded in avoiding me.  No apology, and no reimbursement.  Instead, extremely shabby treatment. It is not OK. A plastic surgeon appearing on a TV show should be held to the highest standards.   ",Doctors

Eau Claire , Wisconsin USA ",,715-832-1953,," I went to Dr Peck located in Optima Health Center in Eau Claire and was told by her that I had Lymes Disease. I was given large amounts of antibiotics to get rid of Lymes that I had. What had caused three trips to emergency rooms and weeks of suffering wasn't Lymes disease but my sleep apnea machine. I was being hydro carbon poisoned because the filter was plugged which caused the unit to emit toxic fumes into my body while sleeping.  In any event, I later developed thrush because of all the antibiotics Dr Peck has prescribed to me. Thrush is a common side effect that's brought on by taking too many antibiotics. In any event I kindly asked Dr Peck if I could get some nystatin for the thrush I had. I did this via email. I never got a reply so I emailed her again and let her know that I didn't care for getting no reply. After all, I was suffering a side effect because of her misdiagnosis so I figured the least she could do is call me in some Nystatin...it's pretty much equivelent to cough syrup.  Then I recieved a phone call from a very rude police officer. His name was Art Nelson. He told me to not call Optima Health Center or Dr Peck again or I would be cited some citation. The owner of the Optima Health called me after the police officer told me not to call them. I mentioned this to Art Nelson but he said it's ok for them to call you but you can't call them. I'm thinking to myself ""what kind of fried rice has this person ate lately.""  Bill Bauer appologised several times for what had happened and said he would look into the matter and get back to me. He agreed that the Nystatin should have been prescribed by Dr Peck and agreed that the doctor was being diffucult. I explained to Bill Bauer that I felt it was a form of racketeering to require me to come and pay for an office call when a prescription should be called in. He basically agreed to that too.  On the way home from his vacation I recieved a text from Bill Bauer, the owner of Optima Health saying pretty much the same thing again that he had said when he called me about a week earlier. How sorry he was etc. Mind you, this was long after I had recieved the call from Eau Claire's finest Art Nelson threatening me. Yes threatening me that I would be cited or arrested if I called Optimal Health or Dr Susan Peck.    In any event, I would say that Dr Peck is a first class quack that I wouldn't take my dog to after what I experienced. She prescribed $40.00 vitamin cocktails via intervenious needle. If she wasn't coming in the next week ya didn't get one. She a quack...period. In addition to her negligence she stood my wife up once by cancelling an appointment ( my wife had gone all the way to the clinic only to find out Dr Peck was not coming in ) and she cancelled two appointments with me. What kind of doctor does that? Furthermore she fed me alot of antibiotics which I got the thrush from and where did I get my much needed Nystatin? From my dentist of 30 years. Yes I called my dentist and he knew right away it was from all the antibiotics Dr Peck had prescribed. He issued a prescription over the phone right away.    The above said, do you think Dr Peck could give a damn that I was poisoned and report or help report my sleep apnea machine poisoning to the proper authorities? The answer to that question is no. Once she found out the doctoring would be coming to an end I was nothing to her. My advise is this. STEER CLEAR of Dr Susan Peck, located in the Optima Health Center, she could care less about you.    I should have sued Dr Peck. I still think about doing that sometimes even to this day. It's amazing how the woman could have the b**** she had to do what she did and then top it off with a call to the police department. The reason I don't sue is because Bill Bauer was a long time aquantance and I believe if I would have sued Dr Peck, the attorney's would have wanted to add Optima Health to the list since the appointments are made through Optima Health... for Dr Peck. Bill Bauer never did get back to me as promised.     Don't do it! Don't call the police on RipOffReport.com now.    ",Doctors

During that time, my Father’s doctor told him that he needed to have an emergency visit for Colon Cancer.

I felt horrible about having to reschedule the appointment, but I had no choice, but to re-schedule.    There was no way I could have gone in for surgery that day, so I apologetically called asap, to give as much notice as I possibly could under the circumstance I called on Thursday and my appointment was the following Tuesday. Truly, I did not want to disrupt his business and was as mindful to him as I could have been and I was sure that there was at least one person on that two page list who wanted a liposuction surgery sooner rather than later.    When I spoke to the front desk manager, and she was understanding. But, he had her call back and tell me, in a very uncomfortable tone,  that he would refund only half my money if I did not show up for surgery the day that was originally scheduled unless he deemed my reason for not being about to make it a worthy enough concern!    He wanted me to explain to him, in detail why I had to reschedule! I was taken aback by his request, (it’s not like I demanded my money back at the last minute.) I was super stressed out with my family because we were all worried about what could happen to my Father, especially my mother. She was preparing for the worst.    Really, I did not want or need to put my family’s concerns under a microscope for Dr. Tenenbaum to judge and then decide whether or not to have a heart or some sort of emotional consideration for my family’s concerns or values.    I was nothing but apologetic and asked him to respect my privacy in a fax I sent him the following day; and by doing so he forced me to relinquish half the cost of the procedure, because he refused to reschedule the surgery. Then, he and his staff lied to me, telling me that my file (which I never bought up or asked for) and partial refund would be sent “promptly.”  The file never came (despite the fact I actually called back to check where it was, and was told it would be sent out that week…) and of course, the check did not arrive in any kind of “prompt” manner.      ",Doctors

In a prior checkup with Dr.Karan Lam it was decided to go for GA for the dental procedure.After 2 hours of procedures, we came to know that along with the fillings, she has removed the front 2 teeth !!! This removal thing was never discussed & agreed upon.Reason given was they were lose and there was inflammation in the back.Though we were uncomfortable with the idea that she removed front 2 teeth, we were more focused on taking care of kid.We were not satisfied with the reason and again called Lam next day. This time, reason took a pivotal shift and Lam said there was infection which has already reached the root and impacting nerves.So basically in a single day, the infection had developed and  gone from near the root to nerve.Our concerns- How did doctor decide to extract 2 front tooth without discussing with parents?- Before coming to that conclusion, were all options thoroughly evaluated?- Not sure if doctor evaluated the impacts on child's speech by removing tooth for a 4 year kid . It was not thought how child will deal till next set of teeth come- There was no honesty in statements. - X rays were not shown and discussed.It has been a very hard & terrible experience. ",Doctors

[continued below]....
									
										..... I walk with a cane, without it i would lose my balance and fall.  With that said my medical and safety concern is that I am suffering from concussion syndrome 4 and half months after my injury. There something wrong with my head, I have lost short term memory. I have to use dry erase boards all over the house to remind me of things I need to do and appointments. Constant dizziness, debilitating headaches (think of the worst migraine you ever had times 18 hrs a day), constant pain in my right foot, ankle and leg, hand injury resolved, shoulder injury aches often (I am out of pain medication, I know inmates never go 1 day without their pain meds, thinking of committing a crime so I can get proper medical care) and to top it all off I am embarrassed to say that I have become incontinent, I am no Doctor but I would think that might be a neurological issue. It is sad that at almost 49 years old I have to use adult diapers because I don't know when I will have an urinary discharge. What bothers me is that how can you discharge somebody to full duty without doing a neurological test done by a real specialist that was requested by the workers comp insurance (AIG).  It is noted that if I get behind the wheel of a semi-truck totaling 80,000 pounds or less, how safe is the public when I am dizzy the majority of the time. Would you like to be in front of my truck while I am having a bad dizzy spell. I think not. My attorney has mentioned that US Health Works has a reputation of sending injured workers back to work while the injury hasn't been resolved. The reason I got an attorney was that US Health Works only concern was my foot injury, while nothing was being done about the head injury.  I reported to my employer as suggested by my attorney and Dr. Diana Johns, M.D. California License # 41091, by the way in all her paperwork her license number appears as 40191 instead of 41091, don't know if that is a typo, but i think she hides her real license number for her own protection.  My new supervisor saw my injuries and he said that he will contact HR to see what they can do for me.  I sent a complaint to the California Medical Board to stop this quackery and to put this Doctor in check because it is not safe for me to go to work and drive a semi and possible kill somebody in the process.

His name is Herbert Segnitz  M.D.  He ordered x-rays, and left the room. About 20 minutes later, a lady came in to WALK me down to x-ray. After we started down the hall, she noticed me limping and offered to go get a wheelchair. I told her no, let's just get this over with.   After the x-rays, in which I laid on a cold, hard  metal table (I also have arthritis of the spine and curvature of the spine), I walked back to the room.  My husband and I actually heard this doctor on a personal call, about refereeing a ballgame in Kentucky..  He was on the phone for almost 25 minutes!! He came in and said it was a sprain and possibly a fracture!! Then he gave me a prescription for a boot! He said we could go to Genesis Medical Supply, in Waverly, or Henderson's Pharmacy in Chillicothe, which probably would have a bigger selection.   We went to Genesis, and they said they would have to get authorization.

I am also writing a letter to the board of medical standards of physicians in the state of maryland.  This type of incompentence and malpractice should not be tolerated. Dr. McGibbons should have her license revoke if she is licensed at all.  A primary care doctor examine and record symptoms from patients and if there is any situation that would need specialization, they have the medical duty to refer you to a practitioner who specialize in that area.  Karen does not follow that protocol.  She gives dumb and ignorant diagnosis out of her own embarassment of lack of knowledge and laziness.  The practice here also, is to give substandard health care while collecting medicaid money.  No one forced this business to participate in the medicaid program.  They are also frauding the Maryland Medical Assistance Program with the very poor and substandard medical practices that they do to the recipients.

Lyndhurst Municipal Court,"  Lyndhurst Municipal Court  5301 Mayfield Road 
Lyndhurst, Ohio USA ",www.lyndhurstmunicipalcourt.org,(440)442-1910,," Judge Bozza would for sure go after someone who gave her weeks of infection/rashes for an unneeded dental procedure because of incompetence, faking cavities, ie boys being boys. Judge Bozza would journal entry ceaselessly in Lyndhurst. And, for sure Judge Bozza doesn't get (having spent too much time at Ursuline College, instead of on CWRU Medical School rotations) that the 'boys' joke about the patients they 'trick' into procedures and give complications to - you should 'see what I did to that guy/woman patient.' How they pulled a medical/dental farce over on some unsuspecting patient or woman - women are a class below the average guy/black patient. Judge Bozza never did morning Rounds on CWRU Medical School clerkships - where we were all informed who 'scored' last night - in more ways than sexual. Ethical monster analogies are nothing compared to the complications of guy arrogance and stupidity - that's where the criminal is - the complications - the bad care. It's a game at CWRU Faculty Dental Practice; how many negative teeth you can drill, and place composite in based on 'fuzzy' x-rays that come out of the poorly maintained (supported like the last Microsoft browser) antiquated x-ray machines, using the old film that hasn't been improved in 2 decades. The resolution is like the old digital cameras that you give to Goodwill or Planet-whatever for Africa. The messy viewbox Kodak stuff, that only the dental hygienist has to touch coming out of the machines at CWRU Faculty Practice. Digital dental x-rays can't be so easily fudged, touched, over/under exposed, and can be repeated every 6 months instead of yearly - money that pays for itself if you have a few business neurons. Nobody wants to email Dr. Hussein Assaf at CWRU Dental School saying he's a jerk, cruel, and inhuman in an American cultural sense - compare him to the medical ethics monsters. But he doesn't get you asking him 'Why is he doing this?' Limited English-speaking fluency - he only gets when you get really mad, and 'threaten' his job by exposing his nonsense. He's a big guy physically, and knows how to throw around the 'cavity' insults - you don't 'brush and floss.' You are unclean, and he is bigger than you, and has a Faculty/Staff position because he agreed to go along with the Dental School saving money by using the old x-ray technology. Doesn't Judge Bozza see the obvious - there are no American Dental grads, English first-language speaking, Dental Faculty Practice hirees - or graduates of Case Dental School - not that they don't apply at CWRU Dental School. There are Farci-speaking, French-speaking, Yiddish-speaking, and Armenian-speaking diversified Faculty. Almost all private practice Cleveland area dental offices have the digital dental x-rays, because they can't get malpractice insurance if they don't convert to the new technology. So the question is how does Case Dental School get insured even? It's mostly men in the Dental Faculty Practice, so no one worries about anyone getting pregnant - which is a bad thing in this situation - radiation is ok. Dr. Assaf only gets it if you call him the 'Osama of teeth' - meaning that he x-rays to radiate, tries to drill on negative films x2, and doesn't handle complications of dental composite that never needed to be placed - he's Muslim, male, and even more sexist and demeaning than the average male - calls women 'cavities,' 'root canals' - and the x-ray is negative. Assaf brings in his buddy residents, and they all insult you - those >3-year old x-rays where someone thinks that they see the 'start' of a cavity. No one asks about the last 2 years of x-rays which were totally negative - even with the fuzzy pictures. It's all a farce of dental care - those 'shadows' that many times just need to be watched are not all cavities. Foreign physicians/dentists to a large extent think - that they can pull anything over on Americans - we market 'naive.' If the American patient questions anything, just pull the race card -the Muslim prejudice which none of us are born with, but develop when screwed and hurt over and over. Abuse of women medical students, and MDs, is still widespread without abuse in the dental chair when you come to get your 'teeth cleaned.' It's a cultural male thing in foreign countries that women are to be lied to - and most women MDs dealing with Muslim professional colleagues have a hard time at least initially - culture shock until you learn to not get upset with the misinformation - misinformation which leads to mistakes in a medical/dental situation Not all mistakes can be easily fixed in medicine/dentistry. The Koran allows that male Muslims lie to women - which makes it difficult for professional women - you are going against their religion asking for some truth, some decency, and some fairplay. Judge Bozza sides with the guys - not seeing the big picture or having read the Koran. Someone give her a copy please. The games they play at Case/CWRU/University Hospitals of Cleveland, Judge Bozza never experienced first-hand. Judge Bozza thinks that every MALE Case Staff Member deserves to be there; is a saint like the nuns taught us. The Ursulines paint the guy illusion exceedingly well to women/girl students - the prince fairy tale storyline. Well the Deans in the Medical School used to spend 24/7 trying to keep the women medical students from being abused, harassed, or sexually exploited for a recommendation by those choir boy CWRU Staff men. In both the Dental & Medical Schools this is a problem at CWRU - Cleveland Ohio. This still goes on in 2014. Princes don't exist when the bottomline is someone trying to 'get a procedure.' Drilling on someone's normal teeth is a day-to-day thing at Case Dental Faculty Practice - a Faddoul move. Brings in the money - like what the Nazis did to the Jews during WWII. Those Case Ethics classes at least tell you how to do deal with the Case male Staff Associate Professor violating all those Geneva convention rules - call the bluff. This is not a criminal offense, it's simply defense - the wording depends on how the insults went. Dr. Assaf calls women 'vulgar.' Dr. Assaf infects patients because his loupes are dirty, he wears the same lab coat all day long without changing in-between procedures, the floors & equipment are dirty, and the residents he brings in without introductions have no scrubs, lab coats, or masks - they spit with their jokes on the patient in the dental chair - and it's dirty stuff. They are all foreign green-card carrying dental residents at CWRU Dental School, and this is a tragedy. Can't CWRU Dental School get the best of the US grads as residents, or as Faculty Staff in the Faculty Dental Practice? Seems not at CWRU; they only hire those with English as a second-language. And that leads to confusion in the he-said, she-said, linguistics department. But call back with an infection, the office manager says that everything is clean - just that she doesn't check in-between patients, or make Dr. Assaf clean his loupes, change his coat, wash his hands, or change his mask - the same one hangs on his head or around his neck for several patients (loupes & mask). Which is gross. But Judge Bozza doesn't get the picture for some reason, and the prosecutor thinks guys are always 'right' - doesn't care about the sterile or clean part. The CWRU Faculty Dental Practice is a private practice, but they don't call back patients with allergic reactions or complications - they just have a good laugh and file in Lyndhurst Municipal Court. The don't even use digital 3-D dental x-rays - which is a total disgrace given that they set the standard in the Cleveland area. So the drilling is 2-D - which is not even good for a movie anymore. The traditional x-rays give off 90% more radiation to dental patients, are not accurate in a 3-D sense, and have poorer resolution (those pixals) than the digital x-rays which can't be adjusted to drill on an artifact. What does Dr. Faddoul & Dr. Assaf care as they don't process the x-rays, or even get their teeth x-rayed at Case? They wouldn't be caught near an x-ray machine like those that they use in the Dental Faculty Practice. They just try to drill on the poor quality films, another sucker. Lyndhurst Municipal Court Judge Bozza does not allow emails that Case Dental Faculty Practice uses traditional x-rays with 90% more radiation, tries to schedule dental drillings on >3 yr old films with negative repeats, brings foreign green-card residents in the room to joke without proper attire/masks causing rashes & infections without criminal charging of the woman patient. Criminals are only women. So how will things improve at CWRU Dental School? Even the Case Clinic patients deserve the digital x-rays, and if the dental students don't learn digital, how can they graduate and practice in 2014? Case Faculty Practice should be a model for a dental practice in Cleveland, not an embarrassment. 'Criminal' is not trying to improve horrible medical/dental situations where things have gotten sloppy, high-radiation, high-infection, and high complication. Judge Bozza needs to see that women MDs are still not treated with respect, addressed by 'Dr' or even their names, or even treated with care, consideration, and reasonable competence at CWRU. The question is, when if ever, will she get the picture? Spend an hour in a Case dental chair? How many women will get abused, by having their normal teeth gone at by the Muslim brigade at CWRU Faculty Practice, before Judge Bozza stops criminalizing that the women complain to the Dental Board, and the CWRU Dental Quality Assurance guy - Dr. Schechter. If Dr. Assaf is innocent, this is not a threat. But he isn't. Dr. Schechter is who Dr. Assaf is supposed to call if an allergic reaction, or unanticipated problem, occurs - and he doesn't. Judge Bozza needs to let Dr. Schechter do his 'quality assurance' CWRU Dental thing to try to improve the behaviors, the x-ray technology, the care and the complication rates of the Faculty Practice. Better quality 'faculty,' x-rays, behaviors, and care is needed. Trying to charge the messenger with criminal 'telecommunications harassment' is hardly appropriate given the issues, and the very real problems which need addressing. The woman should not even have to BE THE MESSENGER, if real QUALITY ASSURANCE was going on at Case Dental School. Dr. Schechter needs to review all situations with Dr. Assaf - before Assaf/Security charges harassment with regards to any patient, because Dr. Assaf didn't call Dr. Schechter about the problems. Dr. Assaf does not follow his own internal procedural guidelines & rules - because he has Judge Bozza who will criminalize a woman trying to stand-up for herself badly, and too late. Which is what women do, because of how things still are, despite women Judges. ",Doctors

He has an office in Lewisville and Dallas Texas and did not comply with what he said he does on either website.  He plays mind games and makes you worse off rather than helps you like he says he does on his website.

I was out 442.00 and a lot of unneeded stress from this company and to be treated like this is extremely uncalled for. If they were professionals they could have apologized and just refunded the money or sent the product. At this point though I just want my money back but I dont know where to go with this.

Mayo Clinic,"  Mayo Clinic  200 First Street SW 
Rochester, Minnesota USA ",www.mayoclinic.org/,507-284-2511,," There is a problem at the Mayo Clinics with women classmates of male Mayo Clinic Staff Members - where the woman MDs are given procedures, after anesthesia that was not consented to, which the Mayo Clinic male surgeons admit the woman MD never consented to.  These unconsented for procedures are not discussed with the woman MD (who wouldn't consent).  These procedures not advised for the symptoms in even the Mayo Clinic Proceedings.   These are scheduled procedures not stopped by the OR staff supposed to stop procedures where there is no consent - because the patient is a woman MD - and the Mayo Clinic can get away with this - they tell you this - that the surgeons don't have to have consent to do procedures on women MDs at Mayo Clinic.   But the woman MD, without consent, is also billed for this procedure that she did not consent to in any way - informed consent is not required if you know Warner Andrew Oldenburg, MD at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville - you are just allowed to be procedurized and billed - you didn't do something for him when you were his medical school classmate apparently or he thinks it a good joke because you scored higher than him on a test once - and he now controls the disposal of your body parts without your consent. Residents & students are brought into the room when the woman MD requested that they not be - for confidentiality purposes a woman MD should be the first to know any diagnosis or lab reports on herself - not the ancillary, resident & student staff at one of the Mayo Clinics - so that they can twitter or post on Facebook about what they did today.  This insensitive treatment would not be done to a guy MD however - a guy MDs body parts are sacred at Mayo Clinic.   It's like the Mayo Clinic can decide what is done to any woman MD who comes there for a consult - and they don't have to discuss, get consent, or handle the complications of the procedure - they just try to collect money.  Jill Beed Smith goes along with this policy in the Rochester Legal Department. Women MD classmates of Mayo MD Staff should not be surgerized without appropriate signed informed consent - consent which also includes a verbal discussion of all nonsurgical options, and complications of a procedure.  This consent means that Mayo Clinic is responsible, not just for billing, but for handling complications.   Procedures not consented to need to be undone asap by Mayo Staff Surgeons.  Classmates of Warner Olddenburg from CWRU Medical School need to stay away from any Mayo Clinic consutations until a policy is made that women MD classmates of his will not be subjected to unwanted procedures for sport - which he goes along with.     ",Doctors

University Suburban Medical Center Wright Surgery Center,"  University Suburban Medical Center Wright Surgery Center  1611 S Green Rd Suite 107 
Cleveland, Ohio USA ",,(216) 382-7146 (Office),," Dr. Thomas Stellato runs Wright Surgery Center for University Hospitals of Cleveland at Suburban Medical Center. He and other surgical staff do numerous abdominal procedures there, all of these procedures can cause abdominal superficial nerve inflammations - which are extremely painful. Rough, or even normal, tissue handling does this - even vigorous exercise using abdominal muscles can cause this problem called ACNES (abdominal cutaneous nerve inflammation syndrome). Athletes get this, Armed Forces people get this, weekend exercisers get this syndrome - and it is painul and doesn't go away with 2 Advil = what Dr. Stellato says to do. However the problem at Wright Surgery, and with Dr. Stellato, is the handling of this complication or occurrence. Dr. Stellato will deny the complication, and not do the proper abdominal maneuver to confirm the problem - Carnett's Test. It's not the responsibility of the Internist on the case to handle his surgical complications - if this occurred after a procedure. Ditto the plastic surgeons who cause the problem. Dr. Stellato will try to schedule another procedure, and when you want to discuss or do the conservative management route - he accuses that you 'stood him up' - even when you called several times to reschedule or scedule a discussion with Dr. Stellato and a family member. Then Dr. Stellato will call the South Euclid police saying that you are blaming him, and he's not responsible for this complication - and he was the last surgeon of record. Suburban Medical Center Management goes along with this atrocious behavior. All this for a commonly described clinical problem that any surgeon, or medical physician, should be able to diagnose correctly in 20 minutes, and arrange treatment of without any additional surgery. Refer to Anesthesia if nothing else. Patients consulting for any abdominal procedure at Wright Surgery Center in Cleveland, should check with the surgeon about his/her handling of this problem - given Dr. Stellato's non-handling of this problem with any professionalism, competence, or compassion. Children can get it with the sports at schools, women with lipoplasty procedures can get it. The issue for University Green Road is the calling of the police for something where the patient is not threatening Dr. Stellato, but telling him to solve the problem that he caused. That's it's not Dr. Ponsky's problem or a police matter. The issue for Wright Surgery Center is to set up a Quality Assurance protocol to correctly diagnose and treat with a nerve anesthesia injection or nerve block. Dr. Stellato, former Chief of General Surgery at University Hospitals of Cleveland, should be able to do a nerve injection without complications or the So Euclid police - or set up a treatment protocol. The Administration should give him support in improving the care policies about handling ACNES. It's a common procedure at Kaiser - so University can't do it, charge for it, or diagnose correctly? It's a bread-and-butter diagnosis at Kaiser in Cleveland - so the guy who writes questions for the Boards of General Surgery can't handle the problem? Improvements are needed in the diagnosis & management of this common surgical complication at Wright Surgery Center - and an education of the Management that just because Dr. Stellato has an ego-fit - that you don't punish the patient with another procedure or say that the woman patient 'stood him up.' No one is dating when they come for a consultation on abdominal wall pain. Police need to refuse to handle ACNES in South Euclid. ",Doctors
" Craig Boswell, MD ","  Craig Boswell, MD  969.N. Mason 
St. Louis, Missouri USA ",1625 LITTLETON COURT,314-628-8200,," Dr. Craig Boswell performed an Erbium Laser Resurfacing Peel. I was quite surprised when he told me I would not need to be sedated for it. He said he would charge me $1500 to go over my face entirely TWICE (2 passes) with the laser. Well, he began the procedure and it was so immediatly painful I broke out in a drenching sweat and began to shake. I could literally feel and smell the flesh on my face burning. I thought I would vomit the burning was so intense on my face. I have never in my life experienced white hot pain like that.  I remember I started to feel palpitations in my chest like my heart was beating erratically or skipping beats. I became panicked at was happening to me. I knew I would never endure 2 passes. My mind was racing in disbelief a that an ethical Dr. would do this to another human being without sedation. It was nothing short of inhuman and I begged him to just stop. Ridiculously he tries to hand me an ibuprofen afterward but I was shaking so uncontrollable I could not even hold it or a cup of water in my hand. When I was finally able to walk to check out, the receptionist said I looked white as a sheert and whispered to me that the staff could ""not believe I had wanted to do that procedure without sedation"".  My mouth dropped open. I told her he had told me it was not needed. The receptionist told me she had procedure but was heavily sedated with valium from the Dr. and had someone drive her home afterward.  She then called him to the desk and asked if she was to charge me  for ""one pass or two?"" and unbelievably he turns his back to me and says in a low voice ""two"". I was so outraged.! He had not even done ONE complete pass before I had begged him to stop! He KNEW he had not done two passes! To add insult to injury? I did not get the results he promised which was for my face to peel after a couple of days ""revealing beautiful skin underneath."" My result? My face broke out in huge red whelts. It looked horrible.  No peeling occurred whatsover. When I called to complain, he told me he didnt give me sedation because ""the building his office was located in  was not  equipped for IV Sedation"".  I was furious that he had not revealed the true reason prior to the procedure. It is a lot different to represent you are not offering sedation because ""its not needed nor warranted"" versus you ""are not equipped to provide it."" And that certainly doesn't excuse him for not offering me ORAL sedation that he provided to his receptionist. So he knew the procedure was painful. Trying to endure such a painful procedure without sedation resulted in an incomplete procedure and poor results.  He also unnecessarily put me through the most traumatic experience of my life.  And he overcharged me, point blank lying to his receptionist that he did TWO passes.   Dr. Craig Boswell. in my opinion, should have his license revoked.

Lakeland, Florida USA ",www.clark-daughtrey.com,(863) 284-6800,," Apparently Dr. Singh no longer wants to see me (I got a certified letter in the mail. I couldn’t even get a call from the person who wrote it whom I spoke to days prior and someone called me Friday which is the day the letter was mailed) all because her staff or someone I spoke to last week wants to lie and say I did not call about a script that Dr. Henson’s office asked me to call about and then Dr. Singh's nurse got very rude with me and without coming right out and saying it, calling me a liar. She began naming every worker in the area around her saying no one spoke to me. And it was not nice at all. I was very sick at the time and I was trying my very best to be nice. So instead of telling her what I wanted to tell her I hung up on her. I have always been told either be nice or say nothing at all. I have no way to prove myself other than the fact that when you call it says ""This call is being recorded for training purposes"". Yet I do not hear anyone trying to listen to it. Makes me wonder if that is a fake recording. I know for a fact I called. Yes it is my fault I did not get a name of the person I asked for. I on the other hand asked for Dr. Singh’s nurse and I was told I could speak to her. So I did. I was sick and did not want to argue. I was supposed to ask them if they had received my message via the portal (a way you can email your Dr’s) to send in a medication. Dr. Henson’s office wanted to know this otherwise they were going to do it themselves. The person I spoke to assured me that Dr. Singh had already seen it and would be sending it over “shortly”. I said Ok that is good I will pick it up with my other prescriptions since Dr. Henson’s office has already called it in. I will get a text message telling me it is ready. I told the lady thank you and hung up. My husband took me later that afternoon to pick it up and I only had the one that Dr. Henson’s office called in. I asked the pharmacy to look to see if maybe they called it in somewhere else. And they said No! I called Dr. Henson’s office the very next day since they said if Dr. Singh’s office did not call it in they would since they wanted me on the medication. The receptionist said she would call over there. Since I was still sick I asked her to just call back and if I do not answer it was because I was sick and to leave a message. So she did. I woke up later and listened to it. I figured by then I should have heard something. So I called her back. She said that Dr. Singhs office said they would call me back. I told her they still had not done so. So I gave it a little while longer and called her back. I told her they still had not called me. She suggested I call them. So I did. This is where the lies began!!! Dr. Singh’s nurse answers and was BEYOND rude with me saying no one called that office. She named off everyone in that office saying no one spoke to any of them. I told her if I did not speak to one of them then I spoke to someone. And she said, “NO YOU DID NOT MRS. HARRISON!” That is what set me off. I hung up on her before I could say what I truly wanted to say. I was sick and I was not going to deal with it any longer. I called Dr. Hensons office back and told them and crying telling them I swear I did call. I asked to speak Judy about this since I seem to have to tell her about all the other messes that had been happening. So she sent me over to her. She too was sick. So I told her. Now mind you this was Tuesday and I asked for the med to be called in on Monday like Dr. Hensons office asked me to do. I receive a certified letter today dated for Thursday! ****Other problems I have had with either Dr. Singhs staff or someone working there since no one wants to cough up to doing it***** I had a referral I asked of a month in advance. It never got put in. It was not approved until hours before the procedure. Not good practice. The Dr’s office whmo did this procedure can vouch for this. I called 2 weeks ago to see Dr. Singh on a Thursday. I forgot I had to pick up my son so I asked to move it. If they couldn’t (And I told the lady this) I can see if someone else can and I would just come one but it would be hard to do. The lady told me there was no problem that she could make it for 5:30pm and that it was her late day. Ok cool. So I go to the appointment to find out I was not on the schedule and Dr. Singh was not even there. Her late day was the day before, and I was already labeled a “No Show”. WHAT? Yeah! I had to fight for that it was ridiculous. The ARNP I seen that day since I could not see Singh was rude and did not want to listen to why I was there. Probably because she was in some sort of an emergency setting and I was trying to see my Dr. She was more worried about telling me to get off my meds and to diet. She told me not to take my meds to sleep. I could go without sleep. She said she knows of patients going 2 weeks without sleep (my son and husband were there to see and hear this). I could not believe this lady. Really? I am on the meds for a reason. I cannot sleep at all without them. And they really are not sleeping meds. It is something else that makes me drowsy. I have SEVERE INSOMNIA!!!   I want someone to listen to the phone calls that are supposed to be recorded. If my PCP is going to side with her and boot me…… then I want the phone calls to be searched and listened to. I am NOT lying by no means. This is ridiculous!!!! Bad Dr’s office! I am sure there is more I am forgetting but I am also in the middle of trying to see why my Sed Rate is so high and they want to pull this bull........ ",Doctors

Hi Jenna, Per our conversation on Monday, the bottom line is you're selling vouchers for a practice that is providing sub-par care/services and I would like a refund. It's not that I HAVE to see Kathy, I want a refund because everyone left at that practice is providing sub-standard services. The only person who seems to have had any expertise, Kathy... is no longer there.   Your account credit is one of the most ridiculous offers I've ever received. THAT WOULD REQUIRE PURCHASING ANOTHER VOUCHER FROM YOUR COMPANY FOR WHAT WILL PROBABLY BE ANOTHER SUB-STANDARD SERVICE PROVIDER. WHY ON EARTH WOULD I EVER WANT TO CONDUCT BUSINESS WITH YOUR COMPANY AGAIN?   I've been in the sales/customer service/marketing industry throughout my career and anyone with a basic understanding of this, knows that customers aren't expecting companies to operate without problems... what they want is companies that excel at resolving them. THAT is the definition of GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE, and THAT is what brings a company success. You should take a look at how a company providing similar services is operating... LivingSocial is hugely successful. If I had experienced this problem with a voucher I purchase from them, they would have offered the refund and probably even apologized for the terrible experience I'd had.   The only recourse I have at this point is to share my experience on social networking sites and hope someone will read it and avoid wasting their money on your vouchers. My posts will be up before the day is done on Yelp and Facebook. It's too bad really... I think your company is founded on a great idea, but your execution of the idea is lousy.   Sincerely, Maria   And here's the email to the doctor's office (no response)...Dr. Rosenblatt: I am the client that arrived for my scheduled appointment last Saturday with Kathy, to find that she had been let go by you and I had NOT been notified of the change. I had previously come in for one appointment with Kathy and one appointment with a young Asian girl. My experience with Kathy was so wonderful that when I had to reschedule my second appointment and came in to find that another practitioner would be performing the services, I felt completely comfortable because I assumed the level of service and expertise Kathy provided was the level expected by your medical practice. Clearly, I was mistaken. The young Asian girl did shoddy work, and the whole experience was sub-par. After that, I decided to ONLY make appointments with Kathy. After my second appointment with Kathy (and third overall), I was so pleased with her and the success I was experiencing in the lack of hair regrowth, that I purchased an additional six sessions.  Last Friday I received a voicemail confirming my Saturday appointment. At no point in the message was I informed that my appointment would be handled by another practitioner. I drove all the way up from Long Beach on what was a very tight schedule to find, upon arrival, that Kathy had been let go. I expressed my dissatisfaction to your reception personnel and asked them for Kathy's last name. They refused to give me her last name because it was ""personal information."" When I informed them that this reason was nonsense and more specifically a lie, they said that they had been instructed to say that.  While I appreciate the refund of the additional six sessions, your office staff said they would ""unredeem"" my voucher and that I could get a refund of the initial six sessions if I called Lifebooker. This was also not true. I've contacted Lifebooker and they've told me they are unwilling to refund the money I paid or any portion of it. At this point, I'm contacting you with two requests: I would like Kathy's last name and I would like a refund of the money originally paid for the six sessions, minus the three I've already used (50% of the price of the voucher). Please respond at your earliest opportunity.Thank you,Maria ",Doctors

Ms. M***** went to DPSG in late 2004 or early 2005 for skin care services, including microdermabrasion 8. In November 2005, Ms. M***** made an appointment with Dr. CABRET-CARLOTTI to discuss possible surgery involving her neck area. At this consultation, Dr. CABRET-CARLOTTI RECOMMENDED that the Ms. M***** undergo an ENDOSCOPIC BROWLIFT, an UPPER LID BLEPHAROPLASTY, FACE and NECK LIFT, TCA PEEL and CHEEK IMPLANTS for a total of $16,672.50 9. Ms. M***** considered procedures and decided not to have them done 10. About a year later, Ms. M***** again consulted with Dr. CABRET-CARLOTTI, who RECOMMENDED that, in ADDITION to the above services, to also undergo a PERIORBITAL LASER and LIPOSCULPTURE of her BACK, FLANKS and ABDOMEN, for a total price of $24,300 11. Ms. M***** discussed the RECOMMENDED surgical procedures with her husband and he becameCONCERNED about the EXTENT of the PROCEDURES and the CARLOTTIS EXPERIENCE and TRANING   12. In December 2006 both Ms. M***** and Mr. M***** went to Desert Palm Surgical Group ((Now called Carlotti Cosmetic Surgery Center)) for an appointment with DEFENDANT CABRET-CARLOTTI   13. At this visit, Mr. M*****, who wasCONCERNED about DEFENDANT CABRET-CARLOTTIS QUALIFICATIONS and EXPERIENCE, asked Dr. CABRET-CARLOTTI about her PLASTIC SURGERY EXPERIENCE and her EXPERTISE IN THESE TYPES OF PROCEDURES   14. DEFENDANT CABRET-CARLOTTIRESPONDED THAT SHE HAD BEEN A SURGEON FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS AND THAT SHE DOES THESE TYPES OF PROCEDURES""ALL THE TIME""   15. Mr. M***** also told DEFENDANT CABRET-CARLOTTI that he had heard there were TWO TYPES of PLASTIC SURGEONS, ones with SURGICAL TRAINING that COULD PERFORM SURGERIES in a HOSPTIAL and OTHERS WITH LIMITED TRANING that could PERFORM PLASTIC SURGERY in an office setting, and he wanted to make sure that she was not the latter   16. DEFENDANT CABRET-CARLOTTIANSWERED THESE QUESTIONS and MADE OTHER STATEMENTS, all of which lead the M******s to BELIEVE THAT DEFENDANT CABRET-CARLOTTI WAS ""CERTIFIED"" TO PERFORM PLASTIC/COSMETIC SURGERY, THAT SHE HAD THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF TRAINING POSSIBLE, and THAT SHE HAD MORE THAN 20 YEARS EXPERIENCE WITH THESE TYPES OF PROCEDURES   17. The M******s justifiably relied on the representations by DEFENDANT CABRET-CARLOTTI in agreeing that Ms. M***** would go forward with the surgery. Patient, who already paid some deposits, then paid the balance of $23,000-plus on or about December 12, 2006   18. Pursuant to DPSGs written Financial Agreement, patients undergoing cosmetic surgery were required to prepay the entire price three weeks prior to the surgery. The Financial Agreement stated, ""This payment is also non-refundable, but it is transferable to a later date for up to six months if your surgery is cancelled due to documented personal medical emergency only.

Upon information and belief, the principle surgeon was to be ALBERT CARLOTTI, III, M.D., whom the M******s had never met   21. Ms. M***** then learned from discussions with others that the DEFENDANTS CARLOTTIS were NOT BOARD CERTFIFIED PLASTIC SURGEONS, that CABRET-CARLOTTI did NOT have 20 years experience (and had not even graduated from medical school until 1999), that BOTH DOCTORS were PRIMARILY DENTAL and MAXILLOFACIAL SURGEONS, and that MOST BOARD-CERTIFIED PLASTIC SURGEONS WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO PERFOM ALL OF THE PROCEDURES RECOMMENDED BY DEFENDANT CABRET-CARLOTTI IN ONE SURGICAL SESSION   22.

Alternately, she made FALSE REPRESENTATIONS RECKELSSLY and WITHOUT REGARD FOR THEIR TRUTH OR FALSITY   32. CABRET-CARLOTTI intended that the M******s RELY ON HER FALSE REPRESENTATIONS, and they did so, in the manner contemplated or intended by Cabret-Carlotti, by paying the $23,000-plus balance remaining for the RECOMMENDED SURGERY   33.

Salt Lake City, Utah USA ",http://slcsmiles.com/,(801) 305-3615,," I paid Dr. Rodney Gleave $21,500 for 16 porcelain crowns in the summer of 2013. I came to him with two cracked bottom veneers and I wanted all 8 of my bottom teeth turned to crowns. He talked me into replacing my top 8 veneers as well, saying ""I can make you better ones that will last a lifetime""....he also claimed he could fix my bite with minimal adjustments if any to the teeth after they were cemented on the bottom. The opposite happened. He aske me infront of the ceramist, Juan, if they could change my teeth and I said NO. I even wrote it down because I had just been drilled on and could barely talk. He was nice until I paid and then he turned nasty. He would not let me keep the whitest shade of hollywood whites I came in with and changed my teeth shape even though I said I did not want him to. There was nothing wrong with my top veneers and I miss them so much. The teeth he made me were longer, thicker, not as white, and had 6 vampire points I never had before! He bullied me into signing off on them, insisting they were going to make my bite perfect. I signed and after they were cemented on I could barely fit my teeth together and they looked crooked! The front ones on the top made me feel like a donkey! He had to drill them down to literally less than half their size to fit my bite and I had to come in for so many adjustments over the course of half a year after that due to throbbing and pain. My teeth would hit together when I talked and still sometimes do, a year later! Two of the teeth on the bottom turned gray in the first week and he had to replace them. He could not fit my bite so he had to replace all the ones on the bottom again! They are super sore because of this and need root canals. I had to beg him to re make my two front teeth that were crooked and had the backs drilled to death to try to fit my bottom teeth and as if to spite me he made sure to remake them the whitest shade I wanted for all my teeth and they do not match my other medium shade teeth. He lied to me and said they would match after they were cemented on. A year later they still do not match and I have had three other dentists and one other ceramist confirm that they were deffinately made in a different shade! He said that my teeth would still last forever even though they have all beed drilled on so much that they feel scratchy, soft, and have discolored. He bragged that he once had a patient not like the color she picked so he replaced all her teeth, yet would not replace mine to match his mistake. He admitted to his malpractice attourney, Mr. Engar, that he made a batch mistake but told me it was in my head. When my bottom teeth came back from the lab the second time I could tell they were still too big and did not want to sign off on them. He lost his temper and threw a pen at my teeth, hitting them as they sat fragile on the wax up and causing them to fall on the floor! He said ""Im done"" and left the room. I had to beg him to glue them on my mouth and then he admitted I was right and had to drill those down to half their size also. I filed a claim with the dental association and his malpractice insurance gave me $2,500 in refund so I could replace my two front teeth (the only ones in my mouth that are the shade I picked and that do not look like deformed chicklets) but I had to sign away his liability for the damage, as well as my rights to sue or negatively review him! I did it thinking I would just cut my losses and replace my two front teeth. I cannot find a dentist who will replace only two front teeth and none of them want to work on my teeth because of all the damage he caused. I feel like an idiot rat who took a poisoned piece of cheese. I would have sued him but do not have the money. My Mom paid for this out of her reitrement to try to fix my tetracycline stained, worn away teeth. I am working on an Associates degree and plan to be a poor pre school teacher. I will never be able to even fix the mess he vendictivly made in my mouth. Maybe he did this to me because I am not a mormon. Maybe he did this to me because he thought I was a brat for having my parents pay for my teeth to be re done for the fourth time. He said my money was nothing and that his over head is 500 and hour, whatever that means, and that I was only supposed to come in twice for these teeth. He was unethical, unprofessional, rude, and made it evident that he only wanted my money and had no interest in fixing my bite or my appearance.  ",Doctors

Beverly Hills, California USA ",www.jasonbdiamond.com,(310) 859-9816,," Dr. Jason B. Diamond is an electryfying, charasmatic human being. His credentials are impecable. After researching numerous doctors around the country, I decided on him. Over several months of correspondence, photos of me before sent via email,  many many many emails back and forth to an exhausting extent, the date was set. The procedures booked. This was mistake number one. I should have flown out to California and stayed for a few days interviewing at least 3 surgeons before hiring anyone. Upon arriving in Beverly Hills at his office, with everything signed, sealed, deliverd and the entire surgery paid for upfront about $83,000. I was told if I wanted that lipoed, Oh that would be $5000.00 more. So out I pulled my credit card and paid. Feeling somewhat humiliated and gropped in some wierd way. The entire experience was so absolutely, rediculously unprofessional from the beginning, I should had gone with my gut. The office staff consists of 2 young ladies that are barely 20 years old. The one, Tammy, plays photographer, sudo nurse, assistant, cashier, amongst other titles of who knows what. Timely replies to email questions, conderns, scheduling, travel and other considerations were like pulling teeth to get them to respond. It was as if they had no calendar or schedule, very odd. Everyone is nice, but in a great hurry, darting about, in and out, here and there, never with you for more than a few moments. Then you are left for a very long time in the room by yourself, when I finally came out they said, Oh you are still here??? REALLY?? And it is true what the other person on this site said Dr. Diamond has great difficulties working his computer, he is constantly calling this one and that one to come into his office and figure it out for him, red flag number 32!!! They refered me to stay at Pearl Recovery Center, a separate floor of the SLS Hotel on La Cienega Blvd. At $1000.00 a day just to stay, not including meds etc, with the same menu every meal every day at about 17 days ( you can kinda do the math) It was a serious let down. Total cost for this procedure $100,000 PLUS. Basicaly a facelift, and some fat injections into my buttocks. Ok, as far as my experience with Dr. Diamond concerning services rendered and results acheived in a score of 1 to 10, 10 being the best, I would give it a 1. I could have probably gotten the same results laying on the beach somewhere for a week. Results less than barely visible. Since this surgery I have spent thousands of dollars in facial fillers, to try to get the expected results. I was really looking for a spectacular make over for that amount of money. I have expressed my disappointment to him for almost a year now, and his reply is he did what he could do. I asked about a refund so I could have someone else perhaps Dr. Fisher or whoever give me a more dramatic makeover, he said no refunds, sorry. BUYER BEWARE. I feel some doctors will stretch your face from Japan to Hawaii, that is not good either. But to me he really seems so very fearful of doing anything, so he opts to do really nothing, that way he can't mess up. Just my thoughts. One thing I came to understand about researching your doctor, is of course check out there credentials, standing in the medical community, get other clients in put, but also very important is to understand a doctors style. Some doctors like Garth Fisher of ""Exteme Makeover"", who I wish I had at least interviewed for the job, if not had hired, have a different style. So make sure the doctor you are thinking about hiring, is in tune with the results you are looking to achieve. If you want Kim K butt, or Wendy Williams boobs, will they go there?? Not that I was looking for such extremes in my outcome, but it something very noteworthy to consider when making the final decision on your hired doctor. Dr. Diamond has a style that is so conservative and he is so completely set in stone as to doing it his way and not about delivering the clients desired results. If you have an exorbident amount of money to spend, weeks, months and even a year plus to recover, and want to see little to difference in your appearance from before, this is the doctor for you. This is my personal experience with this doctor, in the short form. I hope it helps you with your future choices on a plastic surgeon. ",Doctors

On May 6, 2014, J.B., while accompanied by her son and caregiver G.L., sought treatment as a new patient from Midlands Pulmonary, Critical Care & Sleep Medicine in Columbia, SC, where she was assigned to Pulmonologist, Doctor C. Gregory Cauthen. During her visit, a lung function test was performed on J.B., which disclosed that J.B's. lung function was only 30%. Nonetheless, Doctor Cauthen informed J.B. and G.L. that J.B. did not require oxygen therapy while at rest. Additionally, Doctor Cauthen advised J.B. to discontinue using the Advair inhaler, which was to be replaced by his prescribed nebulizer. After the visit with Dr. Cauthen, J.B. discontinued using oxygen as directed. Within 45 minutes, J.B. suffered from severe shortness of breath, which almost resulted in her loss of consciousness. J.B. resumed using oxygen, which brought relief almost immediately. The event was video recorded. So much for Dr. Cauthen's ""expert"" medical advice. On May 20, 2014, G.L. called and left a message with Dr. Cauthen's nurse to inquire about the status of J.B's. nebulizer. To date, Dr. Cauthen's nurse has failed to respond and the nebulizer has not been prescribed. Needless to say, J.B. will seek treatment elsewhere.

He charged me $900 and told me to return to him for free treatment in one year if his laser treatment did not work for him to do more laser for free as he “guarantees” his work. After one year, I returned to him and his secretary asked me to pay for the office visit. I explained to her that the previous year during my office visit, both Dr. Babak Kosari and his office staff told me I could return after one year if the fungus did not go away.  She denied having known of any such policy and stated that if I wanted to see Dr. Kosari I would need to pay for the office visit in cash and give them my medicare card so they can also charge my medicare. I asked why she needed my medicare card since this was supposed to be a free treatment. She said why do you care if we charge medicare since you won’t be paying for it yourself. I told her I despised doctors who tried to fake bill insurance companies and would not give her my medicare card. As I was saying this another person in his office told me that they would not even seen him even though they made him pay them in cash and asked for his insurance card.  I demanded that the doctor see me per the guarantee he made to me and the front desk said they would not and that I had the choice to pay or she would call the police to escort me out. You could tell by the way she handled the situation that this was not her first time on the rodeo. She has apparently dealt with other angry patients shoes money doctor Babak Kosari took for a laser treatment that did not work. So here is his business model: Dr. Babak Kosari charges big money to his patients and also charges their insurance company a ton of money for a laser treatment he guarantees will work.  When the laser does not work and you return to his office he has you deal with this woman who tells you to pay again for the “office visit” or else leave the office or she will call the police. I didn’t leave the office so he ended up calling the police. When the police got there they told me that they had been there before and that my best bet was to take Dr. Babak Kosari to small claims court—which I will be doing.  ",Doctors

Rochester , Minnesota USA ",http://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic/governance/trustees,507-284-2511,," Tom Brokaw has never been a conscious father, or he wouldn't be going along with this - date rape under anesthesia at Mayo Clinic - where procedures not discussed are done to give medical students (black especially), interns (women especially), or residents practice - because they don't object if an attending tells them to remove a normal nerve. They 'don't know any better' supposedly. These arrogant Mayo creatures are never around when a patient is in the Clinic - so you send the boys & girls on a clerkship high, who never met the patient, into disembody the patient in scrubs and masks. It's just a twitter thing - that I got to do this procedure, guess how I spent my summer. . .and Mayo Clinic Jill Smith (Legal Department) admits on the phone that the procedure did not have consent or discussion, but it's over & resolved. How? The patient consultants, ditto the same the line. When did wrong become so 'right?' Women medical students, or interns, will do this to a woman patient, without a minute's worth of ethical thought that they wouldn't want this done to them. It's part of the hazing, part of the getting to be a guy. Consent is part of surgery on any woman patient - informed consent in a room without the anesthesiologist or surgeon forcing things that you are going to comply with the 'Mayo way.' 'Not how we do things at Mayo' is how Dr. Sarr puts it in conversational threats. He's going to get his, one way or another ie under anesthesia - and his wife is an RN. For sure the sex wasn't consensual in that marriage. The nursing staff goes along, which is sick. If someone is drugged without consent, you don't leave them until they are awake - says the date-rape website - until they are able to do informed consent with a family member present. Informed consent is NOT consent in the OR corridor after pre-medications - like the guy anesthesia residents do at Mayo Rochester - date rape if they were at a 'party.' Which Mayo Clinic surgery is for the jocks in the delineating scrubs = just one big party drinks on the house. The 'ruffies' are just Versed - the woman patient has to read the operative report to find out the drug of choice that day - the airway that she didn't consent to that gagged her. It's not duct-tape but it's still not consensual. Even if the Anesthesia Service then forgoes a formal bill, they have to participate in the undoing of this, and the re-education that this is NOT ok. When did training Mayo surgeons become rape? This is done especially for abdominal wall pain misdiagnosed - so you take someone to surgery - who didn't need the surgery if a workup was done (Mayo Clinic Proceedings), and remove abdominal wall nerves because you couldn't do a Carnett's test, or didn't know what it was - like Dr. Michael Sarr. Do you know what a Carnett's test is Tom Brokaw - did that Honorary MD give you Wizard of Oz infused knowledge? Tom Brokaw has allowed this to continue for the last year at least, begging his multiple myleloma, but really just cashing in for his Honorary MD degree. What a newscaster won't do for an Honorary MD? Judith Resnik would rise from the grave if she could. No student should take any of his advice, in any Commencement Speech - he doesn't do what his image presents. Remember him castigating NASA about Ohio-born Judith Resnik and the Challenger disaster - that NASA didn't have consent for that one either. Now Tom Brokaw is allowing little better at Mayo Clinic - where if the attending can't get consent while the patient is awake, he does it under anesthesia with 'forget' properties - so you have to get the operative report to find out what happened to you that you didn't consent to. Like Veronica Mars, you have to play sleuth and try to catch the guys in the lies. The Surgical Attendings like Dr. Michael Sarr, tell your parent that they could do this because they 'are Mayo Clinic' - the Dr. Sarr one-liner that the residents copy to a tee. How would a parent of a graduating Mayo medical student like to hear that one - what their idolized child did to another woman to graduate? Andy Oldenburg MD goes along with this being done to his classmates from Medical School - anything for a staff position at Mayo Clinic. Purchasing this way is even a bit below Andy, who wants to be called 'Warren.' All procedures done to women patients, without discussion or consent, where the Mayo Clinic has admitted that the procedure did not have discussion, consent, or anesthesia consent, need to be undone at Mayo expense - asap. Before another graduation class at Mayo Clinic Medical School thinks that this is part of the Mayo prerogative - the divine rights of Mayo graduates. Damages should be paid for normal abdominal wall nerves, and consultation about the emotional effects presented to the Board of Trustees. Starting today there should not be one more woman patient who has to donate her abdominal wall nerves, or any other part of her anatomy, to Mayo Pathology Department, or just get naked for a medical students to touch and grope (this leaves a smell of cologne that is unmistakably male, and horrible to imagine what happened when you smell). The Mayo Rohypnol smells of black male cologne. The webpage on Rohypnol, the date-rape drug-of-choice of frat boys (the type accepted to Mayo Medical School), has been posted since 1996, and it reads: First, we want to make it absolutely clear that we absolutely oppose the use of any type of coercive chemicals on any person whatsoever, for any reason whatsoever. We also want to make absolutely clear that if you are considering using coercive chemicals on someone for purposes of sex, you are a sick individual, and you are contemplating nothing less than rape. Don't do it! This is what should be posted in the guy's surgical locker-room at Mayo Clinic, and tatooed on Dr. Michael Sarr - that gawk sex is just as bad - seeing someone naked and making fun while you do a procedure that the patient did not consent to awake - while their parents are being lied to on the phone - is also sick. This is the reality of Mayo Graduate School for Medicine. The polo shirts, loafers, the preppy sweaters, and the Polo cologne - that then gives you nausea. The Board of Trustees of Mayo Clinic needs to step-up and stop the abuses. ",Doctors

I got the right one done first and I had the check up for it 2 weeks later when I got the left on checked a week after it was done. (so they were both checked at the same time, and Dr. Charisse Dunn said they were both fine, yet the right toe was red and inflamed a bit ( I assumed it was just still healing)) I continued with this red inflamed toe for 2 months and finally the skin fell away from the nail and I could see that the cut she made down the nail WAS NOT STRAIGHT, and a piece was sticking on into the skin causing it to still look and feel like an ingrown toe nail. I called her office and the receptionist Janine answered, I explained the situation nd asked if I could have the doctor look at it, she said yes and I asked if I was going to be charged for it (expecting not to have to pay because I already paid out of pocket for 2 procedures and one was not completed correctly) so I thought Dr. Dunn would honor her work and care about her patients, but instead she has her receptionist beat around the bush and keep trying to get me to pay another $80 just for the doctor to see that the nail was not cut straight then tell me what needs to be done (instead of taking 2 minutes and cutting the nail correctly) Dr. Dunn didn't even say hi to me when I went in to see her, she looked at me and quickly put her head down and kept walking. I asked Janine (the receptionist) politely multiple times if I could please talk to Dr. Dunn and she finally said to me to wait one minute (so I thought she was going to go get her for me) and she came back to me and told me that She just asked Dr. Dunn herself and she agreed that it was going to have to be another charge as an office visit, yet while she was gone, the whole time I heard Dr. Dunn talking with another patient and she never actually asked her if she could talk to me for a minute when she was done. This is just a small glimps of the experience I had with her, I found the customer service incredibly terrible. They were both so rude indirectly and I felt nothing but Dr. Dunn's indecency to care about one of her patients. I will NEVER go back to her or recommend her to any one. If anything goes wrong with what she does for you she will not take responsibility or care to even talk to you to see what your concern is.

New York, New York USA ",www.footnewyork.com,12127690066,,"  I went to see a podiatrist, Dr. Stuart Mogul in New York at the beginning of 2013. I had 1 toe that was giving me pain (right foot, 4th toe). Dr. Stuart told me that he would need to perform surgery on 3 toes to relieve my pain (1st, 4th and 5th toe on right foot). The 1st toe would need to have extensive bunyon corrections that would be more invasive that the typical bunyon surgery. He said I would need to walk on crutches for 5 weeks. I thought this was extreme since the 1st toe wasn't giving me problems, but I trusted that he knew best. He said that he could use a very fancy stitching technique so that the scar would be less noticeable. On surgery day, Dr. Stuart was 2 hours late, however he performed the surgery that day. I was in terrible pain for weeks after surgery which is probably normal since this was a very invasive procedure. However, I developed an infection that put me in the emergency room for a day It seems that Dr. [continued below]....
									
										..... Stuart did not do a very good job on the fancy stitches that he gave me and this is the reason for the extremely painful infection that I had. I had to make visits to the wound clinic for debris removal and no one can imagine how painful it is to let someone clean an infected wound. Over the next several months, I have continued to suffer with pain. It has now been 8 months and I have continued pain in the toes that he worked on. In fact, the toes that hurt most are the ones that he talked me into doing surgery on, not the original toe that sent me to the podiatrist. I wish I had got a second opinion about Dr.Stuart’s plan to operate on toes that did not even hurt. He made alot of money on me and all I have left is a struggle to feel normal again. I am female and I cannot wear heels or nice shoes. I cannot run. I do not walk properly even after physical therapy. There is not a day that I do not have pain and the pain is way worse than it was prior to surgery. I will always see Dr. Stuart in my nightmares and remember how he stole a part of me that I may never have back. I have recently visited an Orthopedic Surgeon in town and he will be performing a revision surgery to try and help me regain what Dr. Stuarttook from me.

When i went into the office the doctor was about an hour late so I was already setting in the room waition on the doctor to arive. He went thru several questions and then had me pull off my socks and shoes for the exam. With the back injury I have trouble getting bending over so I was setting on a chair to remove my shoes and socks. I have to use my pants leg to pull my feet up to be able to get them off. I also have trouble pulling my socks off. I have to work at it for about a minute on each sock to get off.  Along with the grunting from the pain in the movements. I was directed upon the table where I had to usse the stool to clime up on and get on the table. while he was pushing and pulling on different parts listening to me grunt and moan at the pain he made a comment about how strong I was. that was about all he said durring the eval. He told me to lay on my back which is hard to do without any support or something to grab on to. Raising my feet and legs and then asked me to roll over on my side. Again no support or anything to hold on to it took me awhile to turn over. After mashing on my back and neck He told me that I could get up and get dressed. No help or nything else. I had to force myself up into a setting possition. and then get down and set to get my socks and shoes back on. After the I finaly got dressed I was told that I would recieve a copy of the exam in the mail. When I recieved the report I was shocked to see that Dr Bole had put on the report that I came in on my own unassited and had no trouble walking with increased pain. and that I had authritis and was given a impairment rating of o% and that none of the injuries reported was from the fall that I had at work. He also stated that I had no trouble pulling off my socks and shoes and putting them back on. He was over an hour late for the appointment and did not see me walk into the office, and out of all the pushing and pulling on me and as much as I was grunting and moaning from the pain. He put in hes report that I showed no signs of increased pain. My Dr that I am seeing has me on a sit down only duty status. I drive a truck for a living.

My initial visit was spent listening to the owner blubber about how he could've either become a window salesman or a Vocational Counselor (very reassuring of course!) and how his wife (the shifty looking Life Coach with the 1975 hair style) was running for State Rep. Several weeks of disservice by this alleged professional was met with my complaints and calls for him to step down, which would have allowed me to have another counselor assigned. Here's the chronology of non-service. Week One--First meeting, he requested we meet at his office again, and he never shows up. Week Three--Again, he never shows up for our SCHEDULED meeting (later found out from one of his embarassed college interns that he was attending a Tea Party event!). Week Five--I have some lingering urianry and back issues from my injury, and the counselor spoke to me about this while other clients were in the same room. He made no attempt to keep private matters private. Week Seven--He prepared my resume and added two degrees to my education section. Even though he was well aware that I had no advanced education beyond high school. I complained several times to the insurance company that hired this clown. Finally, after filing a legal action against the insurance carrier, they finally fired Stokes from my case. If all that wasn't enough, the amount this quack charged me was criminal!

In comparison, wiki vandalism is often performed by immature individuals. On Wikipedia, it is not uncommon for IP addresses belonging to school districts to be blocked long term due to vandalism from students. Of course, I suppose one would expect that from students, but would one expect that behavior from a licensed medical doctor? Furthermore, would one expect a licensed medical doctor openly affiliate himself with such conduct, as if he is proud of it? Of course, I mean not to infer anything, I'm just here to present the facts. You must decide for yourself. So this may mean nothing to you. Or maybe it makes you question Doctor Lipson's professionalism. Can one trust a Doctor who engages in such behavior online to be professional in his practice? Is his online behavior irrelivant to his practice. I've never met the man, so I've no idea what he's like offline. Maybe he's the best doctor in the world and just has an unusual hobby. I just personally find it unusual for a doctor to publicly engage in such behavior and affiliate his professional image with it.

By this time he wanted to rip off his skin the itching was so bad, I started him on natural products recommended by the internet which helped a little.  After 14 days the test result came back negative which I read happens very often when they do not scape the exact spot of the mite or egg.

You can get scabies through prolonged skin to skin contact, or infected bedding, clothes. They ordered a blood test and wrote a prescription for a anti-biotic, which may have helped a little but did nothing for the rash or itching and did not address the real problem.

Now, I've been to lots of doctors, and I've never had to pay $900+ for an office visit.  I'd like to know how PCMG justifies charging this exorbitant amount.  If I had known that PCMG wasn't in my insurance network prior to taking my daughter there, I surely wouldn't have gone there, I would have gone to the urgent care 2 miles from my house and paid $100 for an office visit.   I do not plan to pay this bill and I will be securing an attorney to discuss this matter.  I also plan to contact the media and let them know how PCMG is cheating consumers and insurance companies.

After several attempts to alert Dr. Saal that he wasn't taking the situation seriously enough, and that friends were becomming more concerned about the saftey of the teen as well as the teen's family and friends, (because of statements made by the teen that he was having thoughts of killing them and a suicide attempt a week prior) Dr. Saal got angry.  He didn't like his methods being questioned.  Instead of helping the situation, he called the teen and told him the names of the friends that had called out of concern for his saftey.  He twisted words and told the teen that these (life long) friends had told him that the teen threatened their lives and they wanted him put in an insane asylumn.  He did this as a vindictive move out of his anger, arrogence and entitlment.  Being that the teen is already under his care for schizophrenia with paranoia tendencies, the teen started to contact the family who reached out to the doctor and was very upset.   Dr. Michael Saal put this family at risk, intentionally, without remorse and continues to do so anytime anyone in this circle attempts to contact him regarding the situation.  He just picks up the phone and calls the poor sick kid to complain about whoever is questioning him.  He's a dangerous and unethical doctor and he should lose his license to practice medicine.

Callender the child mother the MAD Doctor Ali called in another prescription.  There are many good doctors in the Flint area, this is NOT one of them.  She has terrible manners and willing Nilly calls in presriptions, she is not a good choice for your child.  Since my daughter has been treated by another doctor she has been in very good health and just recently her mother has decided to go back to Dr. Ali and again I fear the worse.  This Doctor is not a good choice for your child.     ",Doctors

Governor John Kasich,"  Governor John Kasich  77 South High Street, Riffe Center 30th Floor 
Columbus, Ohio USA ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614)466-3555,," Governor Kasich is selectively abusing his authority at the State Medical Board, allowing certain male physicians to be 'protected' and other women MDs to 'take the fall' and lose their jobs & employment for objecting to wrong patient care. It's not about patient care, it's about who can donate the most to the Republican Party come election time - got to keep the guy working even if he is a jerk with no common sense. Women MDs are blamed that they distracted the male MDs with no possibility of that being the truth. Male MDs should be able to keep their focus when the patient has fractures and could not possibly be 'seductive.' Governor Kasich should be able to keep his focus that this is a 'rotter' excuse for bad medical care, ie boys being boys care should not be going on in Ohio. And this is how Anita Steinbergh DO explains away this stuff. At the State Medical Board of Ohio, it's a blame game with no real insight about what causes wrong care for women patients especially in Ohio. Men make mistakes, women make mistakes - but the mistake issue won't be solved by taking the licenses of women MDs with no patient complaints who try to say that mistakes happen and have to be referred, consulted and the care corrected. Women patients can't refer themselves after a mistake - there has to be a no-fault policy that the physician accepting the care after an unanticipated result will not be blamed. As in other states. And that not just a male MD can call to get the care referred. Male MDs in Ohio don't answer the cell phone for women MDs - that's just a 'girl.' Medical care has many mistakes in every state. Governor Kasich knows this but blames the women MDs - when all they did was try to correct, stop, and undo the wrong care. MD licenses in Ohio are taken daily, for what the Ohio Medical Board calls 'making too much of wrong care.' This is quoting Anita Steinbergh DO. Then the Medical Board sells this to the National Data Bank that objecting to wrong care on yourself is an 'unknown mental disorder' - one that every patient has. No one should sit there while bad medical care is done to them, no one should not be able to question their own medical or dental care. This is 2014. If 'care' nearly kills, maims, or disables someone - then this wrong care needs to be improved. If a mistake doesn't make any difference, then the mistake is 'silent' - but most mistakes in medical care make a serious difference. And it's not 'making too much' to say that you need a cast on a fracture, the right x-ray, or blood work. Women who complain to get records, or get the care to be referred - when the physician is a Medical Board 'friend' - get their licenses suspended. Not for their patient care, but for not handling the 'mistakes' the right way - which is???? But 'making too much of wrong care' - ie reporting it so that it gets consultation, referral - is not against state law. However Governor Kasich is allowing gross injustice, loss of jobs of good women MDs, and not allowing them 'care to function.' The care that is going on in Ohio for women's fractures, thyroid problems, and just generally for women - unless you are Mrs. Governor Kasich - the care is bad. Governor Kasich needs to improve the situation at the State Medical Board and has done nothing about this in 3-plus years; he just hangs up. Not a priority to help women MDs keep a job. Jobs are only important for men. ",Doctors
Governor John Kasich,"  Governor John Kasich  77 South High Street, Riffe Center 30th Floor 
Columbus, Ohio USA ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614)466-3555,," Governor Kasich expects that the Medical Board of Ohio will self-correct all the hundreds of false cases of discipline and suspension of innocent physicians. Cases that every Ohio legislator admits - cases without patient complaints. These cases can't be fixed until the 'confidential' file is open to the accused physician and she is allowed to defend herself. The Constitution doesn't apply to the State Medical Board of Ohio or Governor Kasich. Governor Kasich, and the Medical Board Members, admit this - you are guilty and can't ever prove innocence. You aren't allowed. Nothing can be fixed at the State Medical Board of Ohio without hundreds of cases being unconfidentialed, and other problematic procedural policies straightened out. The Ohio Medical Board has been without any reforms for over 20 years - so that the boys can be boys. When the legislator finds out about the mess at the Medical Board, they just run for Congress like Matt Lynch - cover the ass. Lynch, and others, are out of the State Legislature faster than speeding bullets with their Superman shirts on. There are statutes of limitations for legislators that facilitate this, but no statutes limit the terms of Medical Board Members in Ohio - they can serve until they get senile and can't get to the meeting - two are currently in their 70s and both are totally incompetent as to anything medical. When no one can review an Ohio Medical Board decision and get the files, there is no way that anything will ever straighten out. Governor Kasich refuses to admit the problem, goes to Nevada, and expects Dr. Miriam Adelson to give him campaign contributions. You can't make deals with a bunch of liars, because the NEXT DAY the LIARS have another AGREEMENT, another CONDITION. The Ohio Medical Board is a bunch of liars, cheats, physicians who can't practice medicine, and physicians who, if they weren't on the Medical Board of Ohio, would be suspended by a better Board - for falsify patient information if for no other reason. There's no complaint that can't be edited, or roundfiled. Many physician complaints in Ohio are by colleagues - but no one checks or asks how that signer knew the physician. If the Medical Board knows the physician, the complaint is thrown out - otherwise the woman MD is out of a job and can't prove anything. The Medical Board puts her into the Data Bank as an 'unknown disorder' until they get her to admit something - which is misuse of psychiatry. The Data Bank doesn't 'get' the hoax. Ohio Medical Board Members get their 'friends' off, release 'confidential' complaints to their friends against state law, and no one does anything about them breaking the law. Governor Kasich looks the other way - there's no ethics, or external review, at the State Medical Board. Members hear cases from their own hospitals or practice groups - they never have conflicts of interest. Women MDs are held to a different standard, and licenses taken for 'offenses' that aren't offenses. 'Confidential' complaints are filed by physicians that never worked with the physician, didn't know the physician, but got paid to sign the complaint - several cases, or maybe hundreds, started this way in Ohio. The woman MD can't object, and cases go years this way until someone realizes that she never knew the signers after mentioning a few names. Some signers, Dr. Robert Botti, have their wives call the woman MD's family to brag that they got her license taken and that she 'didn't deserve' to be a MD. At least not in Ohio. Some confidential complaints are about the boys wanting the whorehouse privileges - free sex, free understanding and understanding, free treatements for sexual diseases, free range of sample cupboard, free office space (one male wanted the woman to agree to have the wall torn down between the offices - the woman was going to have to pay for it - she lost her medical license - the Medical Board wanted that wall torn down). The law about what the State Medical Board can do gets re-written every day - while they throw out complaints on friend physicians. No one knows what is going on as all complaints, and the reasons for an investigation, are 'confidential.' This would be ok if Governor Kasich had good people making those decisions, but he doesn't. Governor Kasich has changed the Medical Board very little, and the faulty procedures that take the licenses of innocent physicians who just have to disagree with a more powerful incompetent physician. You can't agree with everyone all the time - it's not reality. The Ohio Court of Appeals can't get the files from the State Medical Board - and they change them anyways. It's legal in Ohio for the Medical Board to take a license on provisional, and then find the provisional was a fraud, and then change the file and accusation. To find a case after the fact, women MDs are sent to >5 psychiatric evaluations and forced to detail their sex lives or be branded 'paranoid' that they won't 'dish' on who they dated - which is extreme sexist, chauvinistic, and misogynistic behavior. The Medical Board gets obsessed then with findling another and another case - to the point where one case has gone on over 20 years, over 3 years of Governor Kasich hanging up and looking the other way expecting the Adelsons to pay. This case was not about the woman MDs patient care, but that the confidential complainers wanted free office space (don't we all), free sex, free patient referrals, and various pieces of medical equipment thrown in when they needed it. The 'go-to' woman MD finally said 'NO,' and her license was taken for not handling the situation the 'right' way. Domestic abuse gets the guy in jail, workplace abuse gets the woman MD beaten up and no one cares - least of all Governor Kasich the ultimate jerk. The farce is that he's concerned about unemployment - well if you get your medical license taken without patient complaints, without the Board having a case, you can't get a job until the employer has that file and understands what happened. So the abuser male MDs, and the abusive Governor, get home-free. If Governor Kasich was an MD, he would be a bully, an abuser, and a self-righteous jerk who made women admit his 'rightness' while killing patients. Because that's what his Medical Board does. Governor Kasich has no common sense, no appreciation for a woman MD's education, and he just talks to women MDs like Dr. Miriam Adelson for the money. If Governor Kasich is concerned about unemployment, then women MDs need to keep their licenses until there is a patient complaint, or the Board has a case. Finding cases for 20 years is cheating, illegal in Nevada, and unethical. But Governor Kasich is just one of the boys. ",Doctors

All you get after initial visit are adjustments from his assistant. In my case I felt we were using the wrong approach, as my neck and shoulders were in far worse pain, before we started.  When I finally became rude to the staff enough to get an appointment with the Dr., I had to wait a month to see him, and when I did see him, he kept me waiting over an hour, and then barged in aggressively because he didn't want to invest more time on a redo. He was threatening, sitting about 2 feet from me, staring at me aggressively while he fired off many questions to try to prevent me from changing the direction he was going with the brace, frankly the thought crossed my mind to call my husband and have him talk to him, he was extremely intimidating. [continued below]....
									
										.....  Having had TMJ for over 25 years, I know a little about my problem and have used many types of braces. He started to refer me to an orthodontist, then agreed to keep it overnight and work on it a bit. He already had $2,400 paid up front, and basically wanted me to go away. During our exchange, he basically called me a liar, that I never brought my old brace in to see him, because he didn't put it in his notes. Be assured, I brought in the two different braces I had used in the past. One of them I had great success with, and he failed to even note it in his records. He also had a typographical error in his report, ""right"" versus ""left"" side of jaw.... I came in the second day to pick up brace, again he kept me waiting 1.5 hours. When he came into the office, he was still extremely stern and angry, while we discussed the brace.  I was expecting a 2 part brace, and he only provided one piece, stating that he did not ""do"" the kind of brace that helps me the most, 2 parts. As we talked and talked, he continued to become more angry and argumentative with me, and shockingly aggressive in my face, then he finally stood up and said ""sit here I will get you a refund"" and marched off like a kid in a temper tantrum. He told his assistant and wife to refund me only on the brace, and I threw a bit of a fit when I saw the check, they were going to charge me $505 for visits and adjustments to a brace that made my pain worse, did not allow me to see the doctor early in the process, it was an outrage. Finally his assistant fully refunded all my funds. At least we have that, but the wasted time, and extra pain I could have done without.  Bottom line is this, this doctor is unprofessional, needs anger management, he needs to retire. No wonder the staff doesn't want him to interact with patients.  Do youself a favor and do not go to this doctor. There are others in the DFW area that can do this work. Advise you to get in writing what services will be performed for the dollars, and make sure they will fix or adjust the brace according to your pain. ",Doctors

I had back surgery in 1996, I had brought my release from the doctor who did the surgery back in 1996, the doctor looked at it and told me he wanted the medical reports from that surgery, I agreed to bring them to him as soon as I got them. I was checked out by the doctor and then told to stop at the front desk so the nurse could let me know what he needed. When I reached the front desk the nurse told me that the doctor wanted medical reports for my back surgery and she asked when did I have that done, I told her back in 1996 she looked at me and said she didn't know why the doctor was asking for that because it's been to long since I had that surgery done and he should have known better than that to ask for reports that were 17 years old because there was no way that I could get them but she said if the doctor who did the surgery didn't have the reports anymore to bring a letter from them stating that they no longer had them. I went over to the doctor's office who did the surgery and asked for my medical records and was told that medical records are only kept for a period of 5 years, he also told me that the doctor were I had gone for the physical should have known that, he wrote me the letter stating that my records had been purged. I then brought the letter to the Bourgeois Medical Clinic gave it to the nurse , she sais she was going to give it to the doctor and when he had gone over it he was going to call me.      Well about a month went by and no call , so I decided to cal and find out what was going on I was told that the doctor had not reviewed it yet. I called back in about a week and still no answer, another week went by and I called again, it was then that I was told that the doctor had looked the letter over and decided that he needed more evidence than that before he could clear me. I then called the company that sent me there and asked them about it  and I was told the same thing, that they wouldn't hire me until I got the medical records the doctor wanted.

I arrived at the visit and was told I had no copayment because this was an annual physical visit. I was given a questionnaire to fill out that is given only to those patients receiving a physical. I filled out the questionnaire and saw the doctor. He checked my ears, nose, throat, heart, lungs, and flexibility as expected. Then sent me for a complete blood work up, as usual for this kind of visit.  I had asked for an EKG because that is an included test with an annual physical and he refused to order one. While talking during the visit he asked about my overall health.i had told him I was seeing a few specialist for headaches and he said he would prescribe me Naproxen (Aleve) an over the counter drug to see if that helped. The visit was over. I left the office and called my OBGYN who explained that. Naproxen is not safe to take during pregnancy as it can cause birth defects, so this should never have been prescribed. I then received a bill for a $25 copayment because the doctor changed the visit in the computer from annual physical to regular office visit, triggering a $25 copayment to be applied. His explanation was because I had told him I had headaches this was a regular office visit. There is nothing on the new holland family medicine website or policy that states in writing that you may not mention any pain you have been having during your annual physical.

I received a bill in November 2012 (Included with fax).  On 12/6/12 I called your billing dept. and asked if there were any discount for non-insured.  The lady in billing told me the new total would be $221.75. On December 7, the payment was made through Regency banks billpay system.  On 12/13/12 a check for $221. [continued below]....
									
										.....75 was deposited by Comprehensive Medical Solutions. (copy included with fax). On February 22, 2013 I started receiving letters and phone calls from Revenue Recovery Corporation claiming I did not pay and that it had been turned over to them for collections. I immediately called your billing office and was told no one would talk to me or discuss this issue since it had already gone to collections.  I contacted RRC through phone calls and they told me I would need to fax documents for proof.  I did this not only once but 4 times before a gentleman named Todd told me they had received them.  They stopped contacting me for a year.  Today 2/5/14 I received yet another notice and claim that I owe money and have not been available by phone.  Yet no one has left me any messages regarding this issue and my phone number is not the same as it was one year ago. I am now going directly to you.  I am faxing you the documents required to stop this harrassment now. Included are: original invoice, copy of payment check from regions bank, and past and present letters from RRC with original fax cover sent in Feb 2013. Please take care of this issue immediately.  I will wait one week ( 2/13/14) and if there are any negative items on my credit report pulled that day I will be contacting an attorney on this matter. What could have been taken care of in my call to your billing dept. 3 months after the services, is now 2 years of harrasment. one month later 3/6/14 I am still receiving threats from collection agency.

I phoned Tarzana Medical Center to ask about these bills.

I replied, ""I didn't request or authorize you to send my medical records to any other doctors, and it would be pointless to do so."" If, in fact you did have other doctors evaluate my test results, you can pay them yourself."" I also reminded her that my invoice for my visit was stamped ""Paid in Full.""

Phoenix, Arizona USA ",,(602) 254-5777,,"  Having moved to Phoenix over a year ago, my lovely wife made her medication (insulin and others) last as long as she could. She was hoping to either find a job offering health insurance, or apply for the Affordable Care health insurance. Finally, due to an infected tooth she broke, and down to her last dose of insulin, she ended up in the hospital two days after her insurance finally became active.   The health provider referred her to Dr. Fernando. She spent several days calling to try to get someone to answer the phone, finally she sat outside his office until they came in and she got an appointment. On the day of the appointment, she arrived promptly and was greeted immediately by the incompetent and vicious staff with, ""You don't have any appointment here!""   To cover their failure to properly schedule, they refused service. My wife went to the car to call HealthNet. She was asked to obtain a refusal of service notice, which would allow them to refer her to another physician. Steeling her nerves, she went back in to obtain the required form. She was belittled, told she was ""stupid"" for not having insurance for a year, accused of only coming there to ""get drugs"" and as they continued to heap insults on her, they told her there would be no form for Refusal of Service, because ""We don't play that. You won't get that from us.""   At this point Dr. Fernando came out of an exam room, screaming across the office and saying, ""I'm not going to see people like you! I don't want to have patients like you in here. I'm not the kind of doctor you can just show up to see and get drugs."" Mind you, my wife was hoping to get insulin to SURVIVE. It's not like she was asking for anything illicit.   This doctor has no business seeing patients until he deals with his anger management issues, stops being cruel to people, gets a decent office staff, retakes the Hyopcratic Oath... and perhaps gets some therapy for his egotistical narcissism. Sobbing, my wife called me from the car, explained in detail what happened and that HealthNet themselves said, ""We will not being sending business to him any more!""   Whether or not they do send him more referrals is anyone's guess. However, if they do, I hope for those people sake they don't ever have a medical need.  ",Doctors

According to the plastic surgeon who treated me a week later, Dr Barron had irresponsibly stuffed my penis with way too much girth enhancing material which caused a serious vascular issue. I thought it was alloderm, as Dr Barron stated it would be, but the surgeon who debrided my wound said it appeared bovine in origin. It was so bad that a quarter of my penis became black, necrotic and fell off. I have photos documenting this. It was horrible. A second plastic surgeon I saw said ""you are lucky you didnt lose your penis"". Ive had perhaps a dozen reconstructive surgeries since and my penis is somewhat back to normal, albeit with many ugly external scars, internal scar tissue that causes a bend and a significant loss of sensation. There is even still some of the materiall left in my penis that could not be removed due to the surgeons fear of even  more damage being done via an extraction procedure. In retrospect i should haven taken Dr Barron to court for negligence but was too busy trying to save my penis at the time. I later found out that there is a one year statute of limitations involved in lawsuits in California.  Believe me, if I could do it now, I would be filing court papers. ",Doctors

Governor John Kasich,"  Governor John Kasich  77 South High Street, 30th Floor Riffe Center 
Columbus, Ohio USA ",ww.governor.ohio.gov,(614)466-3555,," Governor Kasich doesn't think that women MDs have families too - that they want a life. When things go wrong for certain 'friend' male MDs, certain Republican donor MDs, women MDs with no complaints have their medical licenses suspended for 'making too much of the wrong care' that needs to be fixed. Reporting bad care is so that the situation gets fixed, notso the woman MD has her license taken and is subjected to repeated psychiatric 'goes' until she recants. Most women MDs only say something when the bad care impacts them or a family member - when it becomes personal. Otherwise, they put up and shut up. It's not about whistleblowing, or 'rotting' on a colleague, it's about that certain orthopedics should only be doing care that they specialized in the Cleveland area, and when there is a question they should refer. No woman MD-patient in Ohio should be getting 'experimental' care, because the University Hospitals physician thinks he can do it on her because she can't complain. And no University Hospitals physician should be doing procedures without appropriate blood work, consultations, and workup on women MDs - they can't do this for themselves, no guy would be asked to, but the training in Cleveland has always been male-centered - for the male, of the male, and to promote the male. The Medical Board should not be allowing that male MDs in Ohio do experimental care on women MDs - with threats that they either 'put up with this' or 'no care.' No male MD/dentist should be trying to file harassment charges, if the woman MD has to object over-and-over until the guy gets the message. Unanticipated results need to be referred, not lied about. There needs to be a medical mistakes procedure at the Medical Board, not 10 ways to harass a student driver just trying to get himself/herself to school or a part-time job at Heinens. There are medical mistakes all over Ohio - physicians cutting off baby parts instead of cords at delivery have their licenses, when a woman MD saying something about it has hers taken - that was a DO and Anita Steinbergh makes sure the Ohio DOs have licenses to torture. Most of the medical mistakes are not about pain medication in Ohio, just mistakes of someone thinking that they can do horrible things to patients and the Medical Board will allow. Anita Steinbergh DO has ordered - tortured - one woman MD to 6 psychiatric evaluations because the initial case didn't pan out - after 20 years the Board tells callers that they 'think that they have a case' against this woman MD - even her family members. Her state representatives, who can't get the file, tell her to 'sue the State' - with what? And who will pay for the 6th, 7th, or 8th evaluation that is for sure going to be ordered? The Board has lost it's moral compass, and ditto Governor Kasich. Governor Kasich re-appointed Dr. Steinbergh to the Medical Board in 2013. So the DOs can get out of bad care - it's not about patient complaints a the Medical Board. Anita Steinbergh makes sure that certain male physicians get their complaints so that they can counter-complain about women MDs or nurses who would say anything about their bad care - instead of fixing the bad care by making the physician get more training in a field of orthopedics that he hasn't done in awhile. The confidential complaint system is over-rided by a Medical Board Member 'friend' all the time. But the Medical Board friend collects - which Governor Kasich doesn't see? Senator Patton won't make a re-certification pathway for women who have been out of practice, but he will allow that the males 'practice' procedures & care that they haven't done in 10 years without skill rechecking or consultation. What's the difference? The women MDs admit not being active,and ask for a State-approved pathway to re-licensure - the men just 'do it.' Senator Patton just wants the education of women MDs thrown out - but he would author legislation after legislation about student drivers just getting themselves to Community College classes & sports practice - not all student drivers are irresponsible immature, and lumping into generalities is the problem in Ohio. When things don't pan out, there are no rules or 'help' for the physician who was innocent, or the student driver who is MENSA and getting a Community College degree with her/his high school diploma. If a woman has been signaled out wrongly at the Medical Board - then Governor Kasich needs to do something to review the case instead of hanging up - he campaigned on the platform to reform the Medical Board - and then did nothing about it. If there are 'good' student drivers, then a way to recognize them needs to be put into student driving legislation.

He told me he wanted to pull my skin horitzonally  to make my eyes more youthful.   What?  He never told me about that before surgery.  If he did, I will not consent to have surgery with him.   The after photo already had one scar revision surgery done by a very skilled plastic surgeon in Miami, Florida.    I will need another one to make it less harsh looking, but neverless there will always be a scar on my face.   My scar revision plastic surgeon described it as a several inches long gouge.   I am not a United States citizen and when I consulted a lawyer he told me most of these kind of cases never made it to court because I do not have a serious injury and only disfigurement.  Some serious comestic surgery malpactice cases  just don't make it to court due to the max. awarded money from these kinds of cases are less than the time and work that the lawyers and their helpers put into it.

Boca Raton, Florida USA ",www.dermatologyofboca.com,(561) 362-8000,," I saw Dr. Fromowitz for a scar on my leg based on the glowing reviews I saw online.  The doctor saw my scar and recommended two skin creams to help heal the scar.  The first one he ""conveniently"" sold right in his office.  He said it was $100 for the cream.  The other one he said I would have to pick up from my pharmacy, but according to the doctor, my insurance should pick it up and my cost would be minimal.  So upon checking out they sold me the cream they stocked at the front desk.  Now, however, the cream was $120 according to the office manager, a fellow named Steve, who I believe is the doctor's brother, or a relative.  How could the doctor not know the price of the things he is selling.  According to Steve the doctor doesn't know the prices of the goods he sells; although, he is more than happy to quote them.  I said it is the doctor's office how could he not know the prices of his own goods, yet tell people the wrong amount.  Nonetheless, I paid the ridiculous $120 for this skin ""bleaching"" cream, and then I went to my pharmacy to pickup the script.  It turns out the doctor prescribed me a very new, very expensive skin cream which cost $240--and that was with my insurance.  I declined to get the script.  Certainly the doctor could have prescribed a much less expensive generic cream but I suppose he would not have received any ""referral"" fees for that.  I read the package insert on the skin cream, which said that it was a skin lightening agent but after one stops using it the skin will return to its original color.  In addition, it said it was found to be carcinogenic, or cancer causing in studies.  It contains hydroquinone, which is banned in most countries outside of the US and it also increases skin sensitivity.  I called the company Neocutis, which sells overpriced skin creams, which one could normally buy over the counter in a regular pharmacy, and they confirmed all of this.  Not only that, but hydroquinone is easily available on Amazon, Drugstore.com, Walgreens, etc. with no script needed at all, and this Neocutis brand was four times as expensive as buying this dangerous skin cream at a drugstore.  I promptly called the doctor the next day to ask him to return this dangerous, and exorbitantly overpriced skin cream, and to discuss getting an alternative prescription which was not $240.  Of course he was unavailable, so I ended up talking with Steve, the office manager, who told me he would talk to the doctor and get back to me.  Steve also told me that the doctor had a $35 coupon for the $240 script he conveniently forgot to give me.  But if I wanted to drive all the way back to the office and get it, I could.Wouldn't you know I never received a callback from Steve the office manager, so I called him and he told me the office could not take back this ridiculously, overpriced skin lightener because it was opened one time and since it was a ""pharmaceutical"" product state law did not allow for it.  What a pile of nonsense!  As I had mentioned this is an over-the-counter skin lightener and someone can easily purchase similar products in many drugstores with no prescription needed.  If this is a prescription product than any doctor could stock aspirin in his office and claim it is a prescription product.  Also, the doctor has no pharmacy in his office, nor any pharmacists which would be required to call your facility a pharmacy.  All he has are some billing clerks who sell over the counter products in fancier packaging at prices that borderline on usury.  The skin lightener cream he sold me is nothing but glorified makeup--at ten times the cost--since one's skin will return to its original darkened appearance when a person stops using the cream.  What an arrogant fool the doctor is.  Had he actually had the decency to call me up and say I'll take back the product, I probably would have gone back to him and he would have easily made up the money by the next office visit.  Instead Doctor Fromowitz showed his true colors, that he is only looking after his own financial health and could care less about his patients' health.  Simply put, he is the embodiment of all that is wrong with doctors today: a money-grubbing, self-serving guy who preys on his customers and tries to milk them for all he can!

Psychiatric diagnoses do not cause fractures - you don't break your wrist or shoulder with no stress because you have an 'unknown mental disorder. [continued below]....

Dr. Steinbergh allows that Board experts cheat on testing, diagnoses - the Medical Board can cheat, it's just about winning a case - the notches on her chair.  She diagnoses a woman MD by her objection to wrong care - you are supposed to 'accept' bad care in Ohio, and not mention mistakes so that they get done on more patients.     One woman MD just objected to admittedly 'bad care' - care that the Medical Board & Dr. Steinbergh described as 'boys being boys.'  Dr. Steinbergh took the woman MD's license, not the orthopedic's, and told her to refer to the orthopedic that did the admittedly 'bad care' - for some sick reason of putting a victim back with a tormentor.  She likes salacious gossip, sexual innuendo, and to know the lewd details - because the one woman MD did not have problems with patients, just colleagues who were in the words of the hospital psychologist 'pathologic' and 'neurotic' - colleagues who were married and talking about their sexual needs during patient office visits for fractures.  Sexual joking on the hospital wards or in the locker rooms - or in medical student/residency training - is one thing.  Being sick in an office where they are talking about explicit 'sex' is nauseating, humiliating, and wrong.  There is a time for a sex joke, and a time for compassion - she doesn't know the difference but has Governor Kasich on speed-dial.             Dr. Steinbergh gives out the 'confidential' physician complaints to her friends, and withholds the 'confidential' complaints against women MDs - so the guys can straighten out their problems at the Medical Board but the women can't.  You can't resolve anything when you don't know what the physician complaint is/was - but she doesn't get this fact.  One woman MD has not been able to get the 'confidential' complaint against her in 20 years, her complaint was given to the orthopedic so that he could write this 'confidential' complaint - the case was encouraged, promoted, and the 'boys' given all the information to write a 'confidential' complaint that Anita Steinbergh would make sure would never see daylight - the case is totally unjust, without discovery after 20 years.    There are different rules for women vs men with Dr. Steinbergh - the guys get their complaint - confidential or not.  When asked about one of these cases where the male physician got the 'confidential' complaint that the woman MD had filed to get her medical records (not a real case at the Board, just a nuisance problem), Dr. Steinbergh just said 'so what' - not her problem.  State law doesn't matter - and she's never questioned about this abuse, or the special favors.     Unknown mental disorder isn't a diagnosis - but it will destroy any sane woman MD's life, career, family or health, and possibly lead to suicide - she ruined at least one potential marriage for a woman MD this way - a woman MD who practiced better than average Internal Medicine for Ohio, a woman who had paid her dues except sexually.   Dr. Steinbergh won't wait for the Cleveland Clinic, or Mayo Clinic (she makes fun of Mayo Clinic), to consult - she knows better.  As a Family Practitioner, Cleveland Clinic would mandate that for a complicated thyroid problem, she would have to consult one of the endocrinologists - but she sits on the Medical Board & makes her own rules.  She diagnoses what she wants, and she likes to hear about women MD's sex lives - why they don't like certain men - hours and hours of it.  Dr. Steinbergh can't tell you what Hashimoto's is (that it is a thyroiditis), how to diagnose gyn-ovarian problems, or how to handle screwy male MD colleagues - she doesn't get the harassment that the younger women MDs experience.   Dr. Steinbergh can't mentor a younger woman physician, she just takes their medical license if they have 'problems with men.'  She takes the licenses of women MDs with no patient complaints - like another woman Medical Board President was doing in Texas.  She's neighbors with Governor Kasich - so she got re-appointed for a 6th 5-year term on the Medical Board this year (2014).  Until she is 75, we will be putting up with Anita Steinbergh on the Medical Board.  Governor Kasich, if no other male, is fascinated with her modus opperandi - with her way of destroying everything 'good' in a woman MD's life and career. If you try to discuss anything 'substantive' with Dr. Steinbergh, she gets a call on her cell phone, or tells you that it's not her problem, or to lie to get your license back.  She's not responsible if male MD colleagues threaten, or tell you to 'understand' them because their wives don't.  She's completely superficial, a talking-head, and if anyone thought her 'thorough' they need an IQ or personality test - she makes an art of misdiagnosis.   If Dr. Steinbergh would do this to a woman MD, she will do it to you.  If a woman MD can't talk to her about anything but 'New York Times Bestsellers' - a normal patient won't get much thoroughness.  She's a 2.5/4.0 who sits on the Medical Board, and takes the licenses of women MDs who can't get their medical records, who won't sleep with her male 'friends,' and who won't practice as sloppily as she does - without criteria.  Unknown mental disorder is diagnosed without criteria by her - she likes the power.   Dr. Steinbergh doesn't understand women MD training, that records should say more than 'ripening a fracture to excrescence,' or that 'experimental' treatments should not be done on any patient without consent.  Dr. Steinbergh doesn't 'get' that a woman patient with 3 fractures in 10 months needs a workup - or that the woman MD has a cousin with the same problem in another state whose bone condition was treated at Mayo Clinic - a decade ago.  Family history - throw it out with the trash.   Dr. Timothy Nice is not a good orthopedic practitioner - she knows this - and he is not a wrist fracture orthopedic, so she says that women MDs should 'like' his care for wrist fractures - he does hip-and-knee orthopedics.   The Cleveland area probably has at least 50 orthopedics who do wrist fractures as general orthopedics who don't want to do joint replacements).  Dr. Steinbergh doesn't understand that Medical Boards have to regulate that once you specialize, you don't try to suddenly go back to care that you haven't done regularly for the last 10 years - for the money.   Dr. Steinbergh doesn't get that a woman MD with two horribly swollen wrist fractures could not possibly be seductive.  Finally, Dr. Steinbergh doesn't get that the rumor in Cleveland is that the one woman MD is being punished for her father - for the jealousies in the community - not for anything that she did to patients - she had no patient complaints.      Dr. Steinbergh doesn't understand about male harassments or domestic abuse; she lets male MDs beat up women MDs if they won't agree with them - you are supposed to have 'aequanimitas' for ridiculous male ideas.  Yet stupidity wasn't one of the things that Osler was about, and he didn't abuse women physically.   There are no standards of medical care, orthopedics, gyn-care, or endocrine for her.  Women MDs have their medical licenses taken without being allowed 'care-to-function' - so she won't allow 'care' to any other woman patient.  She doesn't know what care is.  She sits on a Medical Board where they can't dismiss a false case, can't admit a mistake, or can't admit that the thyroid lab sheets in Ohio were off from 1990-2003; because she wouldn't do anything about the sheets having the wrong ranges for TSH. If you tell a male MD in Ohio that you are 'not his wife,' and that he has a wife & children, and should keep his attention there - this will be quoted in public records.  Women MDs in 1990-2000, had little ability to stop any harassments - you tried with notes, through mutual friends, etc.  You can't directly speak to someone wanting physical needs serviced.  You had to write personal letters asking the male MDs to 'stop,' try to talk with the clueless wife, try to find a woman mentor, try the Medical Board of Ohio, or the hospital psychologist - and if you tried the Medical Board, Anita Steinbergh would tell you to 'feel sorry' for the male MDs with the 'wandering eyes' and their wives who were making your life 'hell.'  If you tried the psychologist, you were unstable.   Personal letters were quoted by the Medical Board as a sign of instability that you couldn't take the sexual harassment - she allows this sexual harassment to go on to present day.  Women MDs have no way in Ohio to tell a male colleague to 'stop,' and get some help regarding handling the problem without losing their medical licenses.  No one wants to write Dr. Nice to tell him that he 'has a wife.'  But if you write a male colleague, the Medical Board will get these letters and she will waste money having them analyzed.  A woman MD telling a male MD to get lost is not a 'professional' thing, or a strike against medical licensure, it's a personal life matter - not a reason to take a medical license.  It's what men do, and women have to say 'No' to.   Could someone get this woman a brain, some compassion, some common sense, and a moral compass?  A mutliple fracture syndrome is not an 'unknown mental disorder,' and you don't put that in the Physician Data Bank to be 'cute.'  You don't diagnose anything 'psychiatric' until you find the cause of the fractures, or the bone pain won't stop.  A psychiatric diagnosis is after the medical workup, not before.  When a national psychiatric expert tells the Medical Board to allow a workup at Columbia-Presbyterian in NYC, you need to allow the workup - but she doesn't, as she wants only new right Ohio experts.   She's an unattractive woman, with an ugly temperament, who ruins lives for sport - she should not be in Medicine, on the Medical Board, or allowed to ruin women MD lives & careers - she should not be telling woman MDs how to practice, what they have as a diagnosis, ordering them to procedures for their licensure, or telling them who to refer to for the price of a medical license.  Psychiatric evaluations are procedures, and doing >5 on a normal woman MD causes emotional damage that even the best psychiatrists can't fix.   Dr. Steinbergh should have instituted medical mistake & 'apology' provisions for practitioners and the Board, she should be able to read a lab print-out of thyroid labs, she should not be making up diagnoses that don't exist, and she should have done something about the sexual harassment problem in Ohio.  If you look at her picture, you see why she doesn't have the problem - but that's no excuse.                 ",Doctors
Governor John Kasich,"  Governor John Kasich  77 South High Street, 30th Floor Riffe Center 
Columbus, Ohio USA ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614) 466-3555,," The Ohio Medical Board does not have any MD/DO practitioners who would have known of the thyroid lab sheet problem - then or even in 2014.  Anita Steinbergh DO, and Lance Talmadge MD, do not know how to read thyroid labs - none of the Medical Board Members had Endocrine Boards in Ohio - in the last 20 years.   Ob-gyns & Family Practitioners at the Cleveland Clinic are told not to misorder, misassess, or mistreat thyroid - they have to consult & work with an endocrinologist - but this is not the case at the Medical Board - where no one understands much in depth except how to order a psych evaluation for the 50th time of a completely normal woman MD who just wouldn't sleep with Dr. Nice.  Everything is about sex at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Governor Kasich won't allow certified consultants.   If the Cleveland Clinic requires Family Practitioners, and Ob-Gyns, to consult on possible thyroid problems - why does this rule not apply at the Medical Board of Ohio?  And Dr. Resnick knows nothing about thyroid - except to order a consult.  Blind leading the blind.  Consulting Dr. Resnick for a thyroid misdiagnosis will only lead to more errors - which Kimberly Anderson hasn't a clue about.  And if a law firm hires that woman JD with no sense, they will have all their Partners ordered to psychiatric evaluations and their sex/dating/family lives in public print.  Mr. Whitehouse can't get a job, and Governor Kasich isn't going to get a job to do this when he leaves office.   So until after 2002, and this is still being corrected, the lab sheets in Ohio said 'normal' when the TSH values were not normal, and the Medical Board was too stupid to allow the records of one wrong case to go the consultants - who would have told them the problem for sure by 10 years ago at least - but the Medical Board hangs up or issues ridiculous Orders that no one can comply with, Governor Kasich hangs up, and Constituent Affairs is to stupid to understand the problem.   The concept of a medical lab error, because the lab sheets had the wrong ranges for 'normal,' is above the understanding of Medical Board Member lawyers, real estate magnates, or housewifes that help run Republican PR-spin businesses.  Thyroid can be 'spun' into mental disorder in Ohio - because the Medical Board Members only know how to diagnose what they have.     The women MD complained that she could not get her records to the consultants, Cleveland Clinic & Mayo Clinic - that was her complaint - which is a personality disorder in Ohio - to ask for your records or the confidential complaint.  If you ask for your Medical Records as a woman MD in Ohio - you get your medical license suspended for the rest of your life.  The Medical Board took her license and said that she didn't need Mayo Clinic where the lab sheets might have been different, or the attending more experienced that there was trouble all over the US with thyroid misdiagnosis.   Many of the women misdiagnosed went to testify before Congress in 2000 - but Governor Kasich had no such Hearings in Ohio - medical errors are only pain management problems in Ohio.  He doesn't understand what 'thyroid' is.  Next time someone ask that question in a Gubernatorial debate.  Governor Kasich made a campaign promise to 'fix' the State Medical Board.  And nothing is fixed, same Members, except that the Website now has the two words 'medical error.'  Stacks of false cases are continued without review, costing daily charges to store the false records and continue cases that have nothing to do with psychiatry or 'unknown mental disorders.'  This one case was a lab error, which the woman MD was not responsible for, but something was wrong when she could not get the numbers.  And something is wrong that the Medical Board is still 'trying to find a case.' When the Medical Board doesn't know what is wrong, and won't allow the care to finish because a Board Member goofed on the diagnosis, then the Board takes licenses telling the Physician Data Bank 'unknown mental disorder.'  The one case, which Governor Kasich refuses to discuss, involved a Board Member's mistake.  This Board Member pretended to know the woman MD, when she barely said two words to her when they were at Case Medical School together.  The Board Member (Carla O'Day MD) skipped so many classes in Medical School that she should not have graduated.  That's the type that the Governor's appoint - the absent ones.  When the Medical Board has documentation that a mistake was made, that lab sheets were wrong all over the US until 2002-3, the Board needs to dismiss false cases and stop saying 'psych evaluation for thyroid problem.  What is in the complaint in these cases has to be opened, and the Board can require a non-suit agreement, but the case has to be opened and the errors in diagnosis & management corrected.  Governor Kasich can't even order a non-suit agreement.   The Ohio physician needs to be able to get back to work, even without damages - and the Medical Board can say that they will open the case, but require a statement that the physician will forgo damages.   The Medical Board of Ohio needs reforms, and Governor Kasich needs an epiphany.  How would Governor Kasich like it if his wife got misdiagnosed about a thyroid problem, or his daughters, and the labs had the wrong ranges on the lab sheets in Ohio?  Would he like a Governor that took his wife's job, and MD license, because no one had the time to listen?  What goes around comes around - maybe some family practitioner like Dr. Steinbergh will misdiagnose Mrs. Kasich - Anita Steinbergh certainly has the ability to do so.        ",Doctors

May not always tell you of all treatment options. Stated that 'if you don't do what I say, I'll write it in your notes, so that other doctors will see it & wonder why'.

Mid Michigan Surgeons,"  Mid Michigan Surgeons  1675 Watertower Place, Suite 100  
East Lansing, Michigan USA ",http://www.midmichigansurgeons.com/,(517)332-0200,," Dr Felpausch and Dr McKenna gave me some minor surgery. I had just gotten out of the Army, so I was still covered by the military insurance (Tricare) and the insurance was supposed to cover the entire bill. However, they sent me a bill in the mail for $275.00. I called them and explained that I was using Tricare and I just got out of the Army. They are supposed to pay the entire bill with no co-pay from me. I am also 30% disabled from Military injuries. So I went through the VA, but they couldn't do the surgery at any VA hospital in the area, so they had to send me out to this place. The VA said Tricare would cover the whole bill. When I got the bill, I called the company and complained. But they insisted I had to pay a little bit of the bill. To make the rest of a long story short: I reluctantly sent them a check. Then I moved to Florida. So I couldn't go into the office and talk to them. I had to close my bank account in Michigan before I moved, so I thought that might be the reason why they didn't get my money. However, they should have received my payment in the mail at least a week before I closed the account. They got my check, if they chose not to cash it, that's their problem, not mine! I called the bank and they said they didn't have records of having paid that check. The Doctor said he never got the check. So after doing some more research, I sent them another check from a different bank. This time, I sent the check Certified Mail, so they couldn't deny that they got my payment. I got the receipt from certified mail back, SIGNED BY THE DOCTOR'S SECRETARY! But, they still sent me a letter saying I didn't pay the bill! I contacted my bank and they said the check had been cashed by the Doctor's office! I called the office and tried to be nice and not lose my temper. But they still said they didn't get my payment! I reported this place to the Attorney General's office and I won! If you need to have surgery, do yourself a favor and find a better, more ethical Doctor!

Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker,"  Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker  500 Market St. 
Pokomoke, Maryland USA ",www.survivingmold.com,410-957-1550,," I should have submitted this report sooner and would have if I hadn't been so traumatized and demoralized by my visit to Dr. Shoemaker. There's nothing worse than feeling desperate and then being further victimized by the doctor who promised to help. Many thanks to the previous poster for having the courage to tell your story on 10-28-13. More of us need to come forward to expose this fraud. My family doctor referred me to Shoemaker as a last resort, not realizing what was really going on. He was also charmed by the myth that Shoemaker was the ""God of Mold Recovery."" (It shows how anyone can write a book and create their own legend!) When I returned from Maryland and related my story, my doctor was so outraged that he phoned several colleagues and warned them to stay away. Like the previous victim, I read all the books and believed I was finally going to get a treatment that would release me from hell. I spoke with Shoemaker's office several times and was assured that my specific symptoms would be addressed. I had lots of reservations - given that the long trip including expenses, tests and office fees would cost over $5,000 - but I was out of options at the moment. The first thing that seemed odd was that the office in Pokomoke was poorly marked, very small, and very tacky. After all the hoopla I expected a more professional-looking setup for a so-called world class expert. The entrances were confusing and I sat in a dark, scary reception room for several minutes until someone noticed I was in the wrong place. I had lots of anxiety, given that you have to sign a form that your appointment will be cancelled if you are even one minute late. Imagine that: you drive in from out-of-state, seriously ill. at great personal effort & expense but they won't show you any courtesy. They can't be bothered. Something felt wrong from the first second I entered the premises. The second odd thing was that all the personnel who checked me in were obsessed with asking me if I had read the books. Five or six nurses and technicians handled me before I met the doctor. All they cared about was ""the books."" The focus was not on the patient. My two-hour interview with Shoemaker was an ordeal and something I would prefer to forget. He was snide, arrogant and intimidating. Nothing like the gentle persona promoted in his books. I almost walked out and, on looking back, wished I had. If I asked a question he threw a tantrum. When my eye test came back with a number he didn't like, he blamed me and slammed his file on the desk so hard that I jumped out of my chair. I was dumbfounded by the verbal abuse and the violent behavior. I eventually left the office in tears. Shoemaker spent the entire appointment trying to convince me that my doctor and lawyer were idiots, even though they were the only people who showed any genuine concern about my case and who did me the most good. Shoemaker thinks he's a legal expert and, instead of discussing my symptoms and giving me the medical consult I paid for, wasted the time putting together a hairbrained legal defense. (None of his suggestions were viable and my lawyer won a judgment without using any of Shoemaker's input.) The issue I would like to stress the most is that Shoemaker is doing a bait and switch. His primary concern is amassing data for his research - not tailoring a remedy for your problem - but they don't tell you that. You're a guinea pig and it doesn't matter what you need. I was hoping for a global approach to my sickness but got the usual old Cholystyramine (which made me worse) and one other medication that did no good. The consult was a total waste of time and money and set me back months on finding real help. Plus, I had to endure his rotten personality and find my balance again after such a shocking experience. As a start, I finally self-treated with the Nutramedix Samento which got me back on my feet and then located an Integrative MD who saved my life. For those still searching for relief, try infusions of Phosphatidyl Choline  which will bind the toxins and flush it out of your system.

Mayo Clinic Board of Trustees,"  Mayo Clinic Board of Trustees  200 First Street SW  
Rochester, Minnesota USA ",http://www.mayoclinic.org/,(507)284-2511,," Mayo Board of Trusteest is allowing surgeries without consent, without indication.  Patients come to Mayo Clinic for consultations, and the patients – especially the MD ones – read the Mayo Clinic Proceedings and expect care of that caliber – not a free-for-all to get cases for the Chief of Surgery flying in for the week and then flying out again (Dr. Michael Sarr on the weekly Rochester air shuttle).  Dr. ‘Warner’ Andrew Oldenburg (Vascular Surgery Jacksonville Mayo Clinic), and others, go along with this charade of the Chiefs, and no Department Chair – or Mayo appointment - is worth this kind of patient care.  Better is expected of him and others at Mayo.  The Chiefs might lose it, but the whole Staff of surgical attendings shouldn't. [continued below]....
									
										.....    Surgeons at Mayo should get the Department Chair by standing up for good patient care and what’s in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings – not for a farce of ‘normal’ nerves on the Pathology slab at Mayo Clinic for the money of it all.  The abdominal neurectomy procedure mess.     Dr. Sarr collected for these neurectomy cases, but the Mayo Clinic couldn’t – and he should not have either – no insurance should be paying for this procedure outdated by Carnett in 1926 - time that the Mayo surgeons caught up on the literature.  Today you just read the article on the web at: http://xnet.kp.org/permanentejournal/sum02/acnes.pdf.  But the Medical Students at Mayo are too buy texting and taking 'selfies.'    These neurectomy cases should have been ‘undone’ immediately as the patients requested, but haven’t been – the layers of fascia repaired.  If Mayo Clinic can’t do layered fascia repairs, they should get out of the Surgery business – every surgery has a fascia involved.  Mayo Clinic Board of Trustees needs to arrange for all patient ‘repairs’ from this farce of a surgery – a surgery rarely indicated, and only after trials of different medical therapies over months to years.  Some cases, the insurances might cover the surgical repair (although not after Obamacare gets up to full speed).  But the Mayo Clinic won’t find out until they see all of Dr. Sarr’s neurectomies in follow-up, see the bad results of common mass closure, and decide whether this should continue – it should be a no-brainer.  Dr. Sarr never does a follow-up, he’s on the last flight out for the weekend – there’s a T-shirt about that. The Mayo Clinic needs to evaluate this situation, and refuses to do so - maybe the procedures are paying for the Board of Trustees food sideboards.  Maybe the abdominal neurectomy procedure should be done on some of the surgical staff – that would stop the procedure in 5 minutes, or do it on a Member of the Board of Trustees.  It’s painful, and not pain relief. Unnecessary abdominal wall neurectomies should not make a surgical quota procedure number, this is a dangerous surgery with the potential for complications, deformity, chronic pain – and no benefit.  It’s not the treatment for abdominal wall nerve inflammations, and should never even be allowed on the surgical scheduled at Mayo – it’s a rare procedure after workup and anesthesia nerve block(s), not a ‘staple’ for residents to cut their first incision on.   If the Mayo resident wants a case, they should be in the examining room doing the Carnett’s test, not expecting Dr. Sarr to get them a case with patient threats.  Dr. Sarr takes patients alone in rooms and tells them to ‘pick a resident,’ and the patient doesn’t know or see a resident – which is duress and bullying.  The residents should have stopped this nonsense, the medical students even, but first the Anesthesia & Nursing Staff – and no one did.  Dr. Sarr should not be getting a surgery for any resident, the Mayo resident should be getting his/her own surgeries.  And certainly no professional patient is a resident case – that’s just butchery, and asking for trouble in future recommendations for the resident.  The MD patient will be mad, and no matter if the result is ok, he/she will say that the resident over-stepped.         Then the patients asking that these surgeries be undone are either (1) never seen/scheduled again at Mayo Clinic, (2) have their e-mail addresses cancelled from the Mayo system, (3) have to complain to the Medical Board of MN losing their medical confidentiality, or (4) are sued for defamation by Dr. Sarr who didn’t read the Mayo Proceedings case study on abdominal wall pain and ACNES diagnosis (about the Carnett’s test).  It’s not ‘defamation’ if the patient never consented to the surgery, and said ‘No’ to any muscle or nerve dissection/removal – and the professional patients said that specifically.  None of that should be necessary at Mayo Clinic – it’s Mayo Clinic not a Community Hospital.  About Honorary MD degrees and the wrong influencing/buyout of Board of Trustees Members: Norman Cousins spoke at a Case Western Reserve Medical School graduation years ago (1980), and did not require payment with a Honorary Medical Degree – and he was a political journalist, author and professor.  Good commencement speeches don’t require Honorary Degrees; they require honesty, integrity, and frankness.    As one Dean at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine used to put it, ‘tell me why you need the degree, and I’ll help you get it’ – that PhD didn’t get an Honorary MD degree either – he didn’t ‘need’ it to be a better Dean of Students (Ken Scott).  Tom Brokaw doesn’t need the payoff of a MD degree to speak at a Medical School Commencement - that trivializes the MD to a journalistic award, or a goffer ‘fixer’ reward.  Tom Brokaw needs medical ethics training, as does Dr. Noseworthy.

Columbus, Ohio USA ",www.governor.ohio.gov/,(614)466-3555,," Ohio is one of the last 3-5 states with no medical mistake, or 'apology laws,' so mistakes & medical errors eventually happen to physicians-as-patients - physicians who then want their medical records to 'fix' the problems.  Medical Consultants at tertiary centers are not paranormal mind readers, Tarot card experts, or gifted with telepathy like the 'Tomorrow People' on CW.  They are human beings who need the medical records; the real records.   Getting the medical records in missed diagnosis cases in Ohio: When everyone lies, you have to complain to the Ohio Medical Board to get your medical records - which is just 'normal' behavior.  But the Ohio Medical Board then takes the licenses of these physicians who complain about another physician's care - even when that care is negligent.  Even when the uninvolved consultants have requested the records, not the physician harmed, the Medical Board acts to stop the statute of limitations for 'friend' physicians.  They don't care if a physician dies or is disabled, they go for the friend 'factor' - the Medical Board Members are corrupt and paid back the ol' boy way, ie under the table with contracts & academic appointments that they don't deserve or have the qualifications for.  There isn't a voice of conscience, or moral rectitude, even among the non-medical current Ohio Medical Board Members.  No one on the State Medical Board of Ohio has a moral compass.  The physician with no patient complaints then gets his/her license taken for a fabricated 'personality disorder' - complaining about the care, or non-care, of another physician Board 'friend' or Board Member.  And all they said was that the care was bad, but could they please get the records?  An undisputable statement of FACT.    False Suspensions: This is an action based on a 'confidential' complaint from the physician's colleagues who did the bad care - who go at the physician for 'ratting' on them or perceived ratting (asking for medical records makes no judgment).  It's another physician-physician complaint, but allowed.   So certain physican-physician complaints are allowed and rewarded in Ohio (confidential complaints about good physicians who just didn't go along with the boys and need re-programming), and other's punished, depending on who that physician knows.  These physician-physician disagreements are handled by a non-punitive 'third' pathway in many states, but not Ohio.   The Governor in Ohio has decreed that the Medical Board handle their mistakes - and they don't as they have no provisions to dismiss a false case, and get the physician back to work - so they don't answer their phones.  They hide their mistakes like everyone else - what planet is Governor Kasich from?   In other states these non-punitive disagreements end in improved medical care, but not in Ohio where the same-old from 20 years ago is allowed to continue for the 'boys.'  $500,000 x10 is $5,000,000 - which the State of Ohio needs.  Yet Governor Kasich then tries to get the money by cancelling the small jobs of the retirees who staff the Interstate Highway Welcome Centers - the total of that employment bill is less than $500,000/year, ie less than what ONE false case at the State Medical Board of Ohio costs.  But Governor Kasich can't do the MATH.  Did he ever take College Algebra, Fitzgerald please ask him this question and did you ever take it?  How far in math do our elected politicians ever go in Ohio?  High School Trigonometry - or maybe they flunked that?  What is the derivative of Sin(x)Governor Kasich? What is the integral of cos(x)?  And it's not secant, or tangent.  Anyone wanting to rebut me has to answer those questions.  Derivatives of trig functions. There have been no reforms through the Ohio State Legislature for the State Medical Board for the last 20 years - except reforms that allow the State to cheat on cases, continue cases for 20 years against 'innocent' physicians, and allow that the State Medical Board can't dismiss a false case and get the physician back to work.  Everyone has a 'right to work' in Ohio except physicians falsely accused by the State Medical Board - which Senator Tom Patton admits. Instead the Board spends >$500,000/case to say that they are 'right' - when even the Court of Appeals in Columbus tells them that they are 'wrong' and solve the physician-dispute another way, ie improve the standards for all physicians including 'Board friends.'  Make everyone do better care, not just everyone except Medical Board Member physicians, and their 'friends.'  Make uniform standards of care - something that Governor Kasich can't pronounce.  But he can say 'pill mill' - 2 words.   Physicians are trained that they will have to argue against another point of view, like in debate class, and prove their point - especially women MDs (maybe not women DOs who just go along with the boys like Anita Steinbergh DO).  This is not an unknown mental disorder, or personality disorder; it is holding one's own professionally - it is self-confidence and ethical self-respect.  It's doing the job without the money factor - with logic.   However, the cost of Medical Board lies is the false physician discipline case rate, where the Medical Board spends >$500,000/false case and never proves that the physician did anything wrong except try to save themselves from the bad care allowed in Ohio.  And there is an ever-increasing STACK of these false cases at the Medical Board - because Ohio is the only State not to limit the 'confidential' physician complaint system (the catch-22 that Governor Kasich can't see).  This 'confidential' system gave Hitler his power over physicians to the point where he could get them to experiment and kill for the State - is that where Governor Kasich is headed?  He's read Mein Kampf for sure, but not the American College of Physicians Ethical Manual.     You can't resolve a legal case where the accusation is 'confidential' - Governor Kasich doesn't get this obvious legal point.  How can you defend yourself if you don't know what you are accused of except obvious lies?  You can spend money until you have none - but who is that helping - it's not even contributed to Governor Kasich's re-election fund then.       And contrary to what Governor Kasich thinks, medical mistakes are not just the mistakes that 'pill mill' physicians make in overprescribing meds to complicated pain patients - they are everyday occurences of wrong x-rays, wrong labs, wrong orders, and wrong surgeries - wrong casts, wrong diagnoses, and care provided by the wrong physician.  But none of this is considered a medical error by Governor Kasich.   Governor Kasich needs to appoint someone to review the stack of false physician cases that have gone on over 2-5 years, cost the State >$500,000/case, and where the State Court of Appeals has tried to throw the case out and tell the State Medical Board to 'stop' to no avail.  What is the point of having a Court of Appeals if the State Medical Board, and the Governor, don't have to listen?  It's just another waste of taxpayer monies and legal minds.   If you call Governor Kasich's office about this, he hangs up.  That is not going to solve the $500,000/false case problem Governor Kasich.  But $500,000 saved per a stack of $500,000 cases is a solution to the budget deficit of Ohio - fix the mess at the State Medical Board of Ohio - and no more excuses.       ",Doctors

I don't really look at what I have at the moment, but I ask back in 3 months and he says do you want to come back sooner? I grin and say no 3 months is good.  He walks to the appointment window and I get a card from the lady for an appointment in 3 months. Or so I thought.  Later I realize the appt is in 2 months.  Ok, no big deal.  Well it was a big deal, when I came down with the flu and forgot my appointment. I called the day after the missed appointment and apologize to a message machine that told me to leave my name and number and someone would call me back.  3 days later I make a call to the office and say no-one called me back.  I need to re-schedule.  No problem but I can't see him for another 2+ weeks. I say ok but I will be out of medication on xx date, I will need refills before my appointment date.  She says ok and someone will call you back.  8 days later and no one has called me back although I have made a half dozen phone calls to the office.  I finally get Emily who understands how exasperated I am at this point and says she will call me back after the Dr reviews the message.

Columbus, Ohio USA ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614)466-3555,," Governor Kasich promised in 2010 that he would reform the State Medical Board of Ohio - an empty promise.  Up until present-day 2014, he has reappointed the same Members & appointed laypersons/lawyers who won't say a word about what is going on, e.g. Anita Steinbergh DO has been reappointed 5 times (5-year terms), and allowed the continuing of the 'confidential' physician complaint system - a totally fraudulent system of getting physician complaints as the American Association of Physician & Surgeons has exposed (AAPS).  Governor Kasich is a jerk in translation. Governor Kasich has repeatedly refused to order an 'external review' of Medical Board cases where the Ohio Court of Appeals threw the case out decades ago - and he can appoint someone already on the State's payroll for this, ie an Ohio Court of Appeals Judge.  A two-fer, but he can't see to economize this way.  Economics 101 - which Ohio high schoolers now take Senior year at Ohio Community Colleges.   The cost of one physician's taxes, if the physician could get back to work, would alone cover the additional cost of any external review for hundreds of physicians wronged by the current system - it's all the same issues - the same problem of abuse of Administrative authority by physicians/lawyers/laypersons with no common sense or medical aptitude.  You can't discuss women's health issues with Anita Steinbergh DO - just New York Times bestsellers like Divergent.  Anita Steinbergh DO knows about labeling competitive women physicians 'divergent.'  Governor Kasich is a 'bag of hot air' where the Ohio Medical Board problems are involved, a talking-head.  Governor Kasich thinks that anyone else's career besides his is a joke - he doesn't care. Governor Kasich's office hangs up when you mention the Ohio Medical Board.  The damage to the physician's career doesn't get corrected or compensated, and the case doesn't get resolved as there is no way to dismiss a false case at the State Medical Board of Ohio - the physician has to admit the case.  Everything is a false case at the Ohio State Medical Board - because every case is a 'right' case - that's not correct statistically.  But then when did Governor Kasich ever consider statistics?   There's no 'mistake' provision for the Ohio State Medical Board - they are always 'right' - moreso than the Pope in Rome.  Knowing what to admit is not possible with piles of 'confidential' complaints where there are fabrications of cases with no patient care problems - the physician hasn't a clue what will end the case - the case is not known.   No one knows what hundreds of cases are really about at the State Medical Boad of Ohio - no one except the Medical Board & the Governor who is briefed on this.  Governor Kasich pretends ignorance, but is really in the loop - like Governor Chris Christie.  The 'confidential complaint' is changed daily in cases with no resolution - it's an enigma what would end these cases - you need a Bletchley park of mathematicians to decipher the code.    The suspended physician doesn't even know what to admit or lie about - there are no patients wronged or missed diagnoses in many of these cases.  Misdiagnosis is what the Medical Board MD/DOs do (most are 'correct' only 75% of the time with patient care diagnoses, and that number does not improve with Medical Board tenure & physician diagnoses).   Physicians lying, even for a medical license & job, is not a good thing.  In 49 states the Medical Board is about patient care, in Ohio the Medical Board is about 'notches on the belt.'  Ohio is the State with the most disciplined physicians per population.  Ohio doesn't produce the worst physicians in the nation - the Medical Board just lies better.      The Medical Board of Ohio invents diagnoses of physicians that don't exist, falsifies testing results of anything (from drug to MMPI tests), and there isn't anything that the Medical Board can't get away with lying about - and they tell you this in meetings.  Meeting with the Medical Board, or an individual Member, is a transcendent experience.     The Medical Board of Ohio brags about this - that truth doesn't matter.  Because everything can be 'confidential' - the case, the evidence, the names of the complainers.  No other state falls for this stupidity.  Nothing is about patient care in Ohio, and the money that the State supplies is endless for the farce.  Governor Kasich can fire every retired 'Welcome Center' employee along I-77, but not anyone at the State Medical Board - they have diplomatic immunity beyond that of any NYC Indian diplomat.   Now Governor Kasich wants another 4 years of the same policy, with hundreds of false physician suspensions unresolved, wasting physician lives and careers.  Does he have a clue about anyone else but himself?  The answer is NO.      ",Doctors

Las Vegas, Nevada USA ",,702 -7328558,," On August 31, 2013 I had an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon to whom I was refered to for an ongoing spinal issue. I was referred to Dr Michelle Lynne Sawyer MR, located at 2073 East Sahara #5 Las Vegas, NV 89104 Phn# 702 7328558 Upon visiting Dr. Sawyer's office I checked in at the receptionist desk and was given several forms to fill out. One form demanded my social security number, as well as a major credit card, this is in addition to insurance forms. By law when seeking medical treatment  you are not required and advised against giving ANY medical provider your Social Security  number  or a credit card number.  I refused to do this and was instructed by the receptionist that Dr. Sawyer would not see me unless I provided this information. Very reluctantly I did provode the information and did see Dr. Sawyer.  Upon entering the examination room where I waited, I was greeted by a middle age woman who was dressed in what appeared to be dirty black sweat pants and top and at first thought she was another patient who mistakely entered the wrong room.  Then I learned that this was the doctor. When she addressed me she was extremely curt, rude and insulting. After a few minutes before even getting into the issue which brought me to her office, I decided to leave as I was less than impressed with the very low degree of professionalism  or overall lack thereof.   Upon terminating  the visit I was told by the receptionist that they needed to be paid for the ""consultation"". I told the receptionist there was no consultation and the visit was terminated. At this point I left te office. The following day I received a phone call from Dr. Sawyers office and it was Dr Sawyer demanding I pay for the office visit. I refused and hung up. These calls continued for several days.  Then in mid September I received my credit card statement with charges for $1,500 for my visit to Dr. Sawyers office on August 31,2013.  I immediately called the credit card company and explained that there were no charges and what had happened.  After several months the charges were initially reversed, but not before I also learned the doctor also billed my insurance company TWICE and recieved payment twice. I notified my insurance company that Dr Sawyer was unprofessional, unethical and a thief. They began an investigation and demanded to be reimbursed. In the meantime Dr. Sawyer reported me to the credit bureau for non payment of services of over $3,000. At that time I contacted law enforcement, which informed me that Dr. Sawyer had contacted them claiming I was harrassing her  over my outstanding debt. Claiming that I was calling her and threatening her as many as 6 times a day. She also claimed I damaged her car, a $100,000 Porsche Cheyenne (NV License MYRX4U). I was later summoned to Clark County Nevada Justice Court and ordered to pay $1,500 as a settlement or go to jail for up to 6 months.  Yet I did nothing to warrant  this treatment Ms Sawyer  showed up at the court hearing  and lied to the prosecutor telling her that I damaged here car as the result of an argument and I owed her money for medical services she provided  and which I never paid. As a result I had to pay over $2,500 in payment to ms. Sawyer and the court in ""restitution and fines of go to jail. If you are ever refered to Dr. Michelle Lynne Mackey-Sawyer MD in Las Vegas ...........DO NOT ACCEPT THE REFFERAL!  This woman is a scam artist and further is in colusion with the Clark County, Nevada Prosecutor.     ",Doctors

Columbus, Ohio USA ",governor.ohio.gov,(614)466-555,," Governor Kasich is facing a tough re-election campaign, and yet hangs up when someone calls to try to discuss the problems at the State Medical Board of Ohio - trying to get herself back to work for the 350th time.  Governor Kasich, firing all the WELCOME WORKERS in the Ohio Highway Welcome Centers, is not the answer to Ohio unemployment or state commerce problems either - those retirees gave road advice, travel advice, hotel & gas station advice up and down Ohio roadways - they were minimum-wage ambassadors for Ohio commerce in every sense of those words.  And they've been out of a job now for over a year, and their counterparts in other states are mad at you for this - so road travelers from Ohio (Kasich has a chauffeur) get the speal and get yelled at for your shortsightedness.  You got rid of high-speed rail, can't keep up with th road signs or Willoughby Mayor's Court, and out go the Welcome Center workers - for politics.  Is there a plan?   These highway workers kept each Welcome Center safe, clean, and would call colleagues in West Virginia to check on actual road conditions, closures, accidents, and repairs all in one call with a 'y'all.'  There's not an Ohio highway Welcome Center person that will vote for Kasich - not after a year out-of-work for stupidity and penny-wise economics.  Check out the Exhibits and the Welcome Center workers in West Virginia as you cross the border on I-77.  They say 'hello,' tell you about the glass factory, the Blennerhassett Hotel and others, the balloon races, the Revolutionary War history that took place around Parkersburg West Virginia (Burr and Blennerhasset Island), and they hand you a map and say bad things about your Governor within earshot of people from every other state.  These are places that your daughters would love to visit - for the history - picnic on Blennerhasset Island after a boat ride, stay at the hotel.  But the WV-paid campaign workers are going to cost you your job Governor Kasich.  So one woman is blamed for the Medical Board, and the highway Welcome Center mess in one sentence - up and down I-77 this holiday season.  This woman is to blame for your poor appointments to the State Medical Board, and everything else wrong in Colubus, because you are not 'man' enough to accept responsibility for your ramblingness, lack of focus, and expectation that Ohioians have to 'understand' you.  Your first wife didn't and she had a few degrees.  You didn't take her license - you just divorced her.  Blame her for the Medical Board, and see the reaction that you get. These are problems that Governor Kasich inherited, but hasn't resvolved in an aboveboard way.  He hangs up and blames a certain woman MD who didn't make the problems - and it's not her fault and she has a 'Doctor' appended to her name that you should respect - she had grades for that degree - you shout at her like a tramp without the Doctor - like in a house of ill-repute or escort service call (another Governor Spitzer).  Part of the license mess was that she was supposed to do 'personal things' for two orthopedics - the tramp factor is always trump in Ohio.  The hospitals involved didn't want to pay for the harassments, bullying, missed diagnosis (no medical care does well when played out as a 'seduction' scene), and lack of fracture care - so they turfed the problem because Kasich is such a good 'gomer' that he doesn't get the 'play.'  Gomer stands for . . . No one woman MD is responsible for the mess of hundreds of false cases at the State Medical Board of Ohio; she got caught in the mess as he did - so make her a campaign asset - she has a MENSA IQ that she can't use if you put her in the Data Bank as an 'unknown mental disorder.'  You can't hold your own in a discussion with her, so you call her names - like a spoiled child who can't have his cake and boy toys too.  In Ohio MENSA is an unknown mental disorder, because it's a corn-husker no-brain state (what grows all around Columbus gets into the brain). It's not any ONE physician's problem that the State Medical Board has a backlog of hundreds of unresolved FALSE cases - where at times the Board Members admit the 'innocence' of the physician involved (catch-22), but won't close things because of liability damages.  No money.  But lying isn't the answer to 'no money.'  Mistakes were made, so admit the mistakes as it costs less than the lies - get on with things.  She can't sue you, and neither can hundreds of other wronged physicians - Mr. Whitehouse made sure of that.  As the Ohio Court of Appeals put it, 'What's the problem in ending this? It was obviously a gang-up.' These are cases where the 'confidential' complaint did not pan out - you were 'sold' - but the Medical Board has no policy/procedure to open & throw out these false complaints, dismiss these false cases, and get the physician back to work.  Confidential physician complaints are for sure an invitation to abuse - people will say anything if they are not responsible for what they say, and they have a stupid State that will pay carte blanche to investigate such nonsense.  Why can't Governor Kasich get this salient point?  It should not take 20-30 reports on Ripoff - that's a no-brainer.  This is just stupid.  Put these physicians on your side by getting them back to work, little money has to change hands to effect that.  There are always ways to offer a Residency, Fellowship, contract job with retirement benefits, etc to pay the physician back for the damages, but you have to try.  That means opening files, seeing the mistakes, correcting the mistakes, and being politically savy instead of a jerk.  Hanging up on someone is being ADOLESCENT.  Blaming the hundreds of wronged physicians is not the answer, firing Welcome Center employees is not going to affect the State Budget one decimal place.  And if Governor Kasich appointed better physicians, lawyers, and lay persons to the State Medical Board, they would give him that advice.  Kimberly Anderson does not have enough legal, or life experience, to be Executive Director of the State Medial Board of Ohio or anything else - she would be an Associate in a law firm if she could get a job in a law firm.  Her answer is to file that a physician disagreeing with the Medical Board, because of falsified evidence and testimony that the Board has admitted is falsified, has an 'unknown mental disorder.'  Could he define that term?  That's not an answer that will get Ms. Anderson (let's call her Kimmy-girl, like the Governor calls the woman MD) a job in any law firm - because 'unknown mental disorder' is not a diagnosis or an answer to a medical treatment standard disagreement.  There is always some truth to two ways of treating a fracture, or a thyroid problem, but one is usually better.  The one woman physician had to disagree that 'ripening fractures to excrescence' is not a treatment that the Ohio Board should be allowing Dr. Nice to practice as a standard.  Experimental casts rarely work either - kudos to Dr. Keith for selling that to the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Everyone knowns these facts, but Governor Kasich has no capacity, or competency, to get the obvious - that he is losing the eletion for himself expecting that physicians will 'understand' him and screwball economics.  Highway workers get the point, and they will go to the polls in November.        ",Doctors

John Puente   Better Off Dead: My Daddy's Final Fourteen Months On August 7, 2006, my father was scheduled for a lumbar laminectomy at L2 thru L5. It was a hot August morning when we arrived at Houston's Renaissance Hospital. At 7:00 a.m., I said goodbye as he headed for the operating room. Hoping for the best, I could never have imagined the worst, but that's exactly what transpired in the eight hours to come. At the end of those eight long hours, the physician reported that the surgery had gone well, but in reality the operation had gone haywire. [continued below]....
									
										..... The surgery had been prolonged, causing volume depletion with significant blood loss. He suffered respiratory failure and altered mental status. His blood pressure dropped as his heart rate increased. He required reintubation and two pressors for support. Meanwhile, he developed renal insufficiency, and that combined with paraplegia proved the most devastating consequence for Daddy. After a consultation, Dr. Lipsen ordered Heparin to treat what he believed to be a massive pulmonary embolism and the resulting hypotension and shock. Still unstable and intubated, Daddy developed an infection. Thirty-nine blood transfusions and one month later, he lost over sixty pounds. The Heparin required the testing of his blood levels every four hours. I reviewed his results myself and noticed a lab warning to the hospital that my father's PTT levels very high time after time, but the Heparin treatment continued until August 19. Daddy was suffering terrible pain, but his blood pressure restricted medication for pain relief. With good reason, he became depressed and feared for his life. The physician’s orders and nurses’ notes indicate that a CT scanwas performed on August 14. Dr. Moorehead reviewed the results. He stated that Daddy had developed a hematoma, but there therewas no evidence of a blood clot for which the Heparin had been ordered. However, Dr. Moorehead failed to notify Daddy or my mother of his conclusions. Expert witnesses unilaterally agree that prescribing Heparin to a patient immediately after major spine surgery was a deviation from normal standards of care and had created tremendous risks for my father. And so my family watched as Daddy bled from his wound, blood products floating in his Foley bag. Blood pooled under his skin. His stomach swelled as if he were pregnant. At one point, he was misdiagnosed with cancer. It was sickening to watch, the entire ordeal so exhausting and unbelievable that I couldn’t imagine how my father must have felt. In essence, Daddy died. We learned to love the sick and fragile ghost who took his place. His wound open, I saw his spine rotting, the smell horrifying as I helplessly watched the man I loved wasting away. He endured four hospitals and countless complications before finally being released to go home during the first week of December 2006. Again and again, I heard my father’s cries. My heart broke as he shared his fears, worries and overwhelming desire to end his life and with it his unbearable emotional and physical pain. On October 11, 2007, John Puente’s wish came true, but for me, fear became reality. Not only was my Daddy gone, but his death was altogether avoidable. His life meant nothing to the doctors whose actions caused the slow and agonizing death of the man I would otherwise today still call Daddy to a smiling face full of life. But that life had been stolen. And it wasn't fair. When I arrived at my parents' house, everyone was gathered around my father, weeping with remorse for a life lost to the failure of simple standard medical protocol. I held Daddy's lifeless body in my arms, still warm to the touch. He weighed a mere 118 pounds. When he funeral director wheeled Daddy out of the house, I followed. Daddy, covered with a thin white sheet, was dead, but my heart refused to accept it. I actually asked the funeral director to uncover Daddy's face because I imagined he couldn’t breathe. During the fourteen months preceding his dead, I had watched my protector slip away into a fragile and sick human being, so far removed from the loving and hardworking man I once knew. On Oct 11, 2007, lying in a fetal position on Daddy's hospital bed, I felt a profound loss of security and confidence in the world. Now I, too, was sick and wanted to die. Death seemed so much easier than the endless pain that had become my life. I wanted Daddy back, alive and well, just as he would have been had the doctors followed normal procedure. I felt helpless and confused. ""Why?Why my Daddy?"" Seven years later, I'm still searching for answers. How could this happen in America? How could the Medical Board fail to protect patients from unethical doctors? As I tried to answer those questions, I discovered shocking stories of malpractice from around the world. Not only my heart was breaking for a senseless and avoidable death. No, I wasn’t alone. John Puente was but one name amongst thousands and thousands who suffer at hands of inept doctors. The Internet allows me to reach out to all those who suffer as I do.  Together, we share the tragic facts of our loved ones' deaths. I monitor the doctors who ""treated"" my father and caused the complications that led to his death. I hope that one day the Medical Board will finally hold those doctors accountable. I pray they receive a punishment commensurate with their crimes, for my father's death was the result of criminal negligence. Those doctors killed my father with no more conscience than a psychopathic murderer, but at least the psychopathic murder pays for his crimeswith life in prison or worse. As it turns out, the crime began long before my father's surgery. ""A former Beaumont physician and office manager have been charged with health care fraud violations in the Eastern District of Texas, announced U.S. Attorney John M. Bales today,"" the newspaper reported. ""John Q. A. Webb, Jr., 74, of Houston, and KariMannino, 30, of Woodville, were indicted by a federal grand jury on Dec. 5, 2013, and charged in a 43-count indictment with health care fraud, conspiracy to commit health care fraud, distribution of controlled substances, and conspiracy to distribute controlled substances."" John Q.A. Webb referred my father to Webb's brother-in-law, none other than Dr. Moorehead. Webb also referred patients toMerrimon Baker, who has since lost his medical license. Yet Dr.Moorehead and my father's other treating physicians, Bryan Charles Lipsen, still walk free. They're alive and financially secure. Their families still greet them when they come home from work. In the morning, they're still alive. The sun still shines for them and the prison cell they deserve is nowhere on their minds.  Meanwhile, my heart still believes my Daddy will walk through the door, the sun shining as we greet the man we lost so long ago and, worst of all, who would do just that had his doctors merely followed standard protocol. Nothing can heal my heart or reverse the suffering my father endured. But to see justice served upon the doctors who killed my father would give me back a little trust in the world. I might once again believe that truth prevails over lies in America, and that John Puente's life meant as much as any man's and that the taking of it deserves no lesser punishment than the taking of any other life. I want to believe all of those things, but I'm still waiting, just as my heart still awaits the return of the father I've lost. “Slipped Away” by AVRIL LAVIGNE I miss you, miss you so badI don't forget you, oh it's so sadI hope you can hear meI remember it clearly The day you slipped awayWas the day I found it won't be the sameI didn't get around to kiss youGoodbye on the handI wish that I could see you againI know that I can'tI hope you can hear me cause I remember it clearlyThe day you slipped awayWas the day I found it won't be the same R.I.P. Our Hero until we meet again I will carry you in my Heart, cherishing the memories we have.

newport beach, California USA ",www.theskincareclinic.com,949-760-8065,," Part 1 ~ The Insurance Scam:  If I could give this con artist 0 stars I would.  I went into his office on a Groupon special as a new patient and his insurance fraud/scam that he pulled was completely unrelated to my Groupon visit but happened during that one and only visit to his office.  I waited 20 minutes in the private room before he slithered in, he talked to me for a couple of minutes and left for an additional 45 minutes before returning again to do a 3 minute procedure.  When I first arrived at the Skin Clinic, I heard him mention to a patient who was on her way out of the office that she should give her insurance card to the front desk and the receptionist would check to see if the woman's insurance would cover medical grade facials as he was quite certain they would.  Hmmm... I thought to myself... maybe I would ask him about this myself since I already knew we had phenomenal insurance, way better than most.  Well after that long wait I was extremely ticked off, but I did ask anyways... he spent less that 5 SECONDS saying ""oh yeah sure, give your insurance card to the receptionist and we will see what your benefits are for medical grade facials.""  He did not touch my face, examine any dermatological issues, did not look at my skin under a special light or magnifying glass, did not explain any options or procedures and showed me no products or machines that are in use there, like other dermatologists do.  HE DID NOTHING!  Well except for fraudulently charge Aetna Insurance company $250 for NOTHING!  It was a scam... I bet all the other people he has done this too can look at their EOB's and see that there is a charge that they were unaware of.  I would not have known this without checking since my flex and HRA kicked in to pay the balance that the insurance did not pick up.  Part 2 ~ The confrontation: I showed up in his Newport Beach office unannounced about 1 month later and let the receptionist know of the fraudulent charge.  She looked VERY scared!  She assured me that it was not her that did this.  They do not do anything with the insurance up front, apparently the ""DOCTOR"" handles all the insurance billing... REALLY??  Interesting!  Well she said he would be in shortly and since she say I was annoyed with the whole situation she tried to hurry me into a room.  Now mind you, I was not loud, my voice was low, I was not rude or obnoxious... just very matter of fact that what he just did was commit insurance fraud and he and I needed to talk to have it rectified before my husband who works for one of the nations top medical/pharmaceutical companies goes berserk on him!  She could not understand why the doctor did that.  I asked to see my chart and after some digging around she was able to locate it.  She pulled the paperwork out and showed me the type of visit he charged me for and the remarks he made regarding his evaluation THAT HE DID NOT MAKE!  Mind you we did not consult about my face or facials or anything he could do.  He had a fake paper all written up and I told her no consultation or evaluation ever happened!  She agreed and found it highly strange herself.  I told her I was fine out in the waiting room, that I was not going to be put in a room and secluded. She quickly texted him on the sly because he called right away and it was clear the conversation was hush hush and she mentioned that I was still and so were others in the waiting room.  She couldn't really speak since I was sitting there, but it was clear what was going on.  After she got off the phone she tried to offer me a room ""where I could talk privately with the doctor"" once he arrived!  I again declined and they quickly rushed every other person into rooms instead.  So everyone was sitting in a private room so they would not hear what the insurance scammer did.   What they did not expect was for a random man off the street to come in and inquire about services for himself--no appt.   She was very short with him and kept suggesting he schedule a private conversation with the doctor.  He said he would call and left, but then he came back in deciding to fill out paperwork in advance which clearly had the receptionist flustered as she was instructed to remove everyone from the waiting room. When the doctor arrived he flew thru the breezeway 90 miles an hour and into the back where she quickly went.  He came to speak with me after about 5 minutes.  First off, he motioned to come to the back to speak, I declined again.  He said well it would just be more private, I declined again and said I am more comfortable out here.  I then questioned him about the fraudulent charge and he tried to convince me that he had to put a procedure down to see in the insurance would cover it and the only way for him to know was to charge my insurance company for a random billing code for services he never preformed.  I let him now that I was very familiar with insurance billing and other billings as that was my job in a very large CHURCH!

Governor John Kasich Ohio,"  Governor John Kasich Ohio  77 South High Street, 30th Floor Riffe Center 
Columbus, Ohio USA ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614)466-3555,," Women physicians in Ohio - despite Mary Taylor beng the Lt. Governor - have medical licenses suspended in 2013 for disagreeing with male/women DO colleagues about their own medical care - about common problems totally mismanaged in Ohio.   Thyroid disease is the classic problem mismanaged in Ohio everyday, and women physicians are losing their licenses for having to disagree with male colleagues, and predatory insensate women DOs on the Medical Board about thyroid.  If you disagree you are paranoid - which is totally wrong.  Disagreeing about wrong care is what women MDs were trained to do - to improve the problems with medical care in women.  You can't talk with Anita Steinbergh re thyroid - she doesn't know enough to string one sentence together about this medical problem.     At least one MD physician had a thyroid illness, which was not allowed treatment because the physicians did not do a thyroid panel, did not know how to 'read' thyroid tests in Ohio, and the thyroid lab standard ranges were 'off' in Ohio until 2003.  And they didn't know how, or were too lazy, to check the box 'thryoid panel' on the lab sheet.  The orthopedics had office staff doing all their box checking - orthopedics can't write on a chart or lab sheet in Ohio.   So a 'confidential' complaint was filed on the women MD that she had a 'crazy' problem - the typical 'out' with thyroid illness because the symptoms are all-over-the-place.  The physicians who signed the confidential complaint didn't know anything about blood work in women patients. Olympic runner Gail Devers had Graves' disease misdiagnosed in the 1990s, and almost had her legs amputated by one totally out-of-it surgeon.  Her manifestations of thyroid caused an end to her marriage, her legs swelled to the point where they became almost necrotic and she couldn't walk - only her parents believed in her.  The woman MD who lost her medical license in Ohio had fractures, bone weakness, extreme tiredness, swelling of her thyroid - but no one saw or felt it - she was just 'paranoid.'   Physicians in Ohio only do one of the thyroid panel tests, if that, and never question the lab sheet - which was wrong in Ohio until maybe 2003 - when the Medical Board issued an Order for a 6th evaluation of the woman MD - because 5 evaluations didn't find a case.  The Medical Board doesn't warn physicians about faulty lab ranges, results, etc in Ohio.  Male MDs in Ohio rarely do good physical exams on women patients, and orthopedics rarely take medical histories.   One women MD has been ordered to 6 psychiatric evaluations because she wouldn't go along with this; she had Hashimoto's and the Medical Board can't dismiss the case or say that they made a mistake - because they don't know what they missed.   Untreated Hashimoto's has a range of symptoms from extreme tiredness, to bone weakness & bone pains, to tissue swelling and fractures. Prior to her license being suspended, the women MD had only hack/experimental care by 2 orthopedics with no certification in the type of fractures that the woman had, and no understanding of lab work in women.  The jock orthopedics had 'friends' on the Medical Board.   But even if these two jocks had gotten the right lab tests ordered, they would have found lab ranges that were 'off' - which the Medical Board doesn't take into account before voting on license drunk.  Countless patients were told from 1990-2003, that they were 'normal' when in fact they were seriously ill with thyroid problems. You can have symptoms of 'something' as a woman MD, symptoms which don't interfere with patient care, and still lose your license because the lab sheets are wrong - you are paranoid unless the lab sheet shows the answer.  Which it didn't in Ohio until over 10 year after the Medical Board made this mistake - nearly killing the woman MD. Huge numbers of women, and some men, were misdiagnosed as to their thyroid problems in the 1990s - because the lab ranges were wrong prior to 2000.  So the printout sheet, for this women read the wrong interpretation until 2003, and her license had already been taken for 'making too much.'  But she also didn't have a thyroid panel ordered, only one lab was ordered by the Mayo Clinic, no labs in Ohio - Ohio Medical Board does not believe that women need blood work - and they tell you this on the phone - the Executive Directors. Because the orthopedics didn't understand why she was fracturing, her orthopedic care was bad, she was bullied, and she was abused with horrible comments that she was fracturing to get attention.   Women MDs were put through Medical School to help correct the errors in medical management of women.  If women MDs can't save themselves, they can't help any other patients with the same problems. The same male/women DOs on the Medical Board that destroyed this women MD's career for their ignorance, can't assess thyroid function in pregnant patients.   So the number of patients that Anita Steinbergh DO Family Practitioner has misdiagnosed can only be guessed at - it includes the woman MD that she voted to have her license taken for disagreeing.  Anita Steinbergh never checked the labs on this woman, she relied on a report/testimony from orthopedics who didn't check the labs.  Governor Kasich recently reappointed Anita Steinbergh DO to make more mistakes on women MDs who have something metabolic, or thyroid, wrong with them.   President Bush can be President and get his thyroid problem treated, in Ohio women MDs with thyroid problems have their licenses suspended after objecting to the mismanagement of thyroid problems in Ohio.  Thyroid illness is not 'unknown mental disorder' - it is labeld that in Ohio because the Medical Board Members are so ignorant and stupid about thyroid.  Which is a disgrace, and reflects poorly on Governor Kasich and Mary Taylor who is only a 'showpiece' of a Lt. Governor.     The women MD has not been allowed monitoring of her labs, family members and physicians out-of-state are helping her because Ohio is so behind with thyroid diagnosis.  Lance Talmadge MD saw that she couldn't have a family or get pregnant - she has been listed in the Data Bank as 'unknown mental illness' when she had a known thyroid problem after labs done out-of-state.  Blood work which the Ohio Medical Board refuses to acknowledge even after the repeating of the results at the Cleveland Clinic - they can't dismiss a case for Medical Board error in Ohio.   The level of mediocrity that Governor Kasich, and Mary Taylor, tolerate at the Medical Board is unimaginabe.  Physicians on the Medical Board don't know what a thyroid panel is.   Paid-rebuttals are not welcome.  Find something better to do with your time.   ",Doctors

Palm Beach Gardens, Florida USA ",,561-776-7047,," Besides filing my report on this website, I also filed a complaint with the local Better Business Bureau. Then something interesting happened. On 12/17/2013 I received a voicemail message on my cell phone at 5:13 pm from attorney Wilbert Vancol of the firm McEwan Martinez & Dukes, P.A. in Orlando, Florida.  Mr. Vancol said he was calling on behalf of Dr. Dunn regarding our billing dispute, the complaint placed with the BBB and the postings on consumer websites. Ironically, I had just been to another podiatrist for a second opinion that same morning, whose opinion was the exact opposite of Dr. Dunn's on 11/4/2013. The original procedure she performed was on 10/21/2013. The second doctor told me my options: remove the nail and start fresh, or use a topical antifungal, or laser treatment. There was no infection, no pain, and my nail was re-adhering to the bed and skin under the nail. I chose the topical antifungal. The visit and meds cost $77, not $400. On 12/18/2013 I returned Mr. Vancol's call. He  had given me three phone numbers but recommended using his cell phone number. He claimed Ms. Dunn's accounting firm determined I was due a refund of $148, and could I remove the postings on the websites? I told him I could not, but could update them to to say we reached an agreement. I gave Mr. Vancol my email address and told him to send the agreement for my review, changes and signature. On 12/20/2013 I received an email from the BBB, saying Dr. Dunn had responded. I read the 5- paragraph response, which included the statements: ""As a final point, Ms. C is entitled to a refund from my office..."" ""Ms. C ...appears to be confused..."" ""Ms. C's refund is forthcoming..."" Response was dated 12/19/2013. As of 12/21/2013 I had received neither the settlement agreement from Mr. Vancol, nor the refund check from Dr. Dunn. So, I called Mr. Vancol on his cell phone, who responded that he was ""confused"". I left a voicemail message on the law firm's general voicemail, and also emailed the firm's administrator and two senior partners. I recounted the story, and noted that it was also interesting that Mr. Vancol's involvement was not mentioned in the BBB response. I asked for clarification from the firm, but have only received email read receipts from those three individuals. Needless to say, I replied to the BBB that Dr. Dunn's response, if indeed she was the author was not acceptable. I do not understand why Dr. Dunn could not simply communicate directly with me, and then also reneged on the refund. Good news: the toenail is continuing to heal.   ",Doctors

At that point the staff and doctor had showed their true colors. I knew down in my heart that these were not the right people for me to put my life in trust in. To tell that to someone limping in pain and for a doctor to take a oath to do no harm is sickening.

Columbus, Ohio USA ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(440)466-3555,," Governor Kasich is allowing the Medical Board to put out wrong unsubstantiated Internet diagnoses on women MDs who object to wrong care of themselves, or patients, as a way of handling medical errors and Medical Board mistakes.  This information is then given to the Physician Data Bank without one criteria for that diagnosis or allegation - which is fraud.   The Physician Data Bank should not be putting unknown mental disorder on an Internet site without some evidence of this - especially as the woman MD had no patient complaints, no suits and a MENSA IQ that has been wasted.  Because of the wrong information on the Medical Board website - where nothing should be put unless proven - certain MDs have been grossly mistreated in Ohio - abused for fun.   The one woman MD has offered to do anything within reason except go to psychiatrists who will lie for the Board, and not allow the confidential complaint to be opened so that she can defend herself.  The Ohio Medical Board only believes psychiatrists who will fix diagnoses for the Board - diagnose on demand.  Dr. Phillip Resnick is one of those.  He was begged to allow that the woman physician meet with him in 2003-2013 with the 'confidential' complaint so that she could straighten out the misinformation - he refused - he will diagnose on demand with partial information - which is a disgrace.  Any physician who will diagnose, or try to, on partial wrong information is unethical -that includes the Medical Board Members in Ohio. The Governor lets the mistreatment go on.  The one woman MD with 'unknown mental disorder' - three national psychiatry experts have told the Medical Board to stop this.  The Court of Appeals ruled in her favor, and told the Medical Board to solve their argument another way.  But the Medical Board Members in Ohio are neither good physicians or good people, and they don't take expert advice unless they can 'fix' it.      There are medical errors, and everyone pays for them in the end with insurance rates, but the Ohio Medical Board has to acknowledge them, improve the rates of them, and somehow with a point system or monetary fine deter hospitals and physicians from doing them for money.  But punishing the woman MD who had to experience them with another wrong diagnosis, after her bone condition was misdiagnosed is just cruelty beyond cruelty - and to continue this for 20 years, and 3 years of Governor Kasich hanging up, is just insane.   No one should have to endure a wrong mental diagnoses of them on Internet sites as politics as usual.  In the one case this interferred with treatment of a real bone problem - not a mental disorder.  Mental disorders don't cause fractures that don't heal, bone pains that don't go away, and extreme fatigue - fatigue that all the woman JDs at the Medical Board made fun of.  Well the woman MD was not allowed to get blood work. Yes the Ohio Board is liable for fraud, misinformation, loss of job and income - but the main problem is to stop the fraud, and end this case and others, so that the woman physician can get treated for what she really has and get back to work.   Unknown mental disorder is not a diagnosis, or a crime - it means that the physicians are so bad in Ohio that they misdiagnose women patients and accuse them of thing they don't have to get out of liability & damages.  It means that Governor Kasich is a liar, a creep and a jerk to let this go on.  But he's also breaking every medical records law - and if a physician has no mental disorder then he's committing fraud.  And if there is not mental disorder proveable for 20 years, that woman MD is just a difficult woman MD because that's the way that she was trained - by men.  The one woman MD, who this is being done to in December 2013, went to Case Medical School where everyone hated her father MD.  This is also being done to get back at her father; he didn't refer to the right people, play the games, etc.  It's not right to destroy the chances of the children of someone because you hate them - yet that's what goes on in the Cleveland Medical Community.   Hating her father - that's why her fractures were left uncasted, and her x-rays were all misread as 'satisfactory' when the fracture wasn't even casted.  That's why her blood work wasn't allowed, Mayo Clinic couldn't finish a workup, before her license was suspended for exaggerating bone pains that caused serious fractures - get back at her father.  Something was wrong - and it wasn't an unknown mental disorder causing fractures.  How does Anita Steinbergh justify this?   But the Medical Board should have found out before they took her medical license for 'unknown mental disorder' what caused fractures - how stupid is Governor Kasich.  An 'unknown mental disorder' is not the cause of an unknown metabolic bone disorder that causes fractures.  That's fraud.   That means that the physicians in Ohio are so bad that they have to lie, and suspend the license of a woman MD because they can't get to the real diagnosis.  Please take off all the Internet postings of 'unknown mental disorder' for women MDs in Ohio who have disagreements with the Medical Board for real problems that are not 'unknown mental disorders.'  Please stop diagnosing women MDs with problems that they don't have to cover for the problems, and mistakes, at the Medical Board. This wrong diagnosis needs to come off of Medical Board communications December 2013, and this wrong diagnosis to hurt someone needs to stop.  The Medical Board made a mistake, the physicians involved made huge errors, but the answer is not to wrongly accuse the woman MD of 'unknown mental disorder' to get out of damages.  Damages can be paid in putting her back to work, covering the retraining costs.  Hillcrest Hospital, University Hospitals are also guilty of the wrong diagnosis - but the diagnosis was not 'unknown mental disorder.  Governor Kasich how would you feel if some MD, because they couldn't figure out what was wrong with your wife, would post on the Internet that she had 'unknown mental disorder' before any workup, before the blood work came back, before the fractures finished physical therapy?  That's what you did to certain women MDs in Ohio.

The Mayo Clinic has admitted that this certain procedure was done without patient consent in some instances, for show, and without workup or discussion of options - someone needed to fill an OR slot for money (Dr. Sarr).  Dr. Sarr would go on speaking engagements, come back, and herd patients into the OR to fill his cancelled schedules - without their labs, scans, or consults being done - and he was allowed to do this.  Staff knew about it and went along, even though there was no consent on the chart signed by the patient for this procedure.  Dr. Sarr would say he had to operate tomorrow because he was on a plane out by the end of the week - the traveling Mayo Surgeons that don't do much but make a mess.     Jill Beed Smith, Dr. Michael Sarr know the names of the patients involved, and that they have requested that the procedures be undone.  There is no excuse that if a patient requests, and will pay for a surgery to be done by the attending, that the staff is involved at all - the students, residents walk in when they want to and don't know the patients, haven't seen/examined the patients that are involved in this situation or others, and have restricted hours when they come and go - not patient times.  The residents are on 'residency clock time.'  It was requested that medical students not be in the room - for good reasons.  Tom Brokaw wouldn't want them broadcasting about his anatomy particulars, the condition of his prostate, or his anything on Facebook, and that's what medical students do.  So he needs to do something about this.  Media is what medical students, interns, residents, and fellows do - they post naked pictures of their babies, spouses, vacations, and anything else that they do.  We are an over- Facebooked nation.   It was tried to notify the Medical Board of MN, but they claim that they can't regulate a Clinic - that the Board of Trustees has to oversee that patient care is safe, consented to, and that teaching goes on with the consent of the patient. The Board of Trustees has to guarantee that no one is in any patient room when requested to leave, or not involved in a procedure because of patient confidentiality.  The OR, and Mayo Clinic staff, have to allow that when a patient refuses the sea of interns, residents & fellows following the attending - that this is adhered to.    Students, residents, and fellows should not be in the room if requested to leave or not to be involved - you can't just then bring in the black medical student either, claiming that it's his 'right' when the white, gay, and whatever students have also been asked not to be involved either - it's a question of the patient's rights.  This is not something of prejudice, it's just that care with many unknowns involved gets complicated, and bad things happen. There are many reasons why trainees are not appropriate for a certain patient's care, and why they would not be appropriate for Tom Brokaw's care.  One of them is the texting, twittering, and facebook posting of what staff, interns, residents & fellows do without patient consent - that you find out who really did the surgery on Facebook.  ",Doctors

The physician’s orders and nurses’ notes state a MRI was done on 8/14 and Dr. Moorehead received the results, he stated Daddy developed a hematoma and there was no evidence of a blood clot, which was the reason for the Heparin, however he failed to notify Daddy or my mother at the time. Expert witness’ all agree the deviation from the standard of care was using heparin in a protocol in a patient immediately exposed to such a major spine surgery. The risk was great. Our family watched as Daddy bled from his wound, blood products were floating in his Foley bag, he had large collections of blood under his skin, his stomach swell like a pregnant women’s. He was even falsely diagnosed with cancer. It was sickening to watch. I was exhausted I couldn’t imagine how Daddy felt after all this was happening to him. The Daddy we grew up with died, we now learned to love a sick, fragile man, who we knew had a limited amount of time left with us. His wound was open, at one point you could see his spine rotting. The smell was horrifying. Watching helplessly as the man I loved for everything he was, slowly wasting away. After being in 4 hospitals, suffering many complications, finally he was released to go home the first week in December 2006. My heart broke, again and again. I heard my father’s cries; I listened as he shared his fears, worries, and his overwhelming desire to end his life because of the emotional and physical pain he was suffering. Oct 11, 2006 John Puente’s wish came true. My biggest fear was now a reality. Not only was my Dad gone, his death was preventable; his life meant nothing to the doctors whose actions caused his slow agonizing death. It wasn't fair. When I arrived at my parents everyone was gathered on him weeping. I held his lifeless body in my arms, still warm to touch, weighing only 118 pounds.  As the funeral director wheeled Daddy out I followed, Daddy laid there lifeless, covered with a thin white sheet. I knew he was dead but my heart refused to accept it, I asked that they uncover his face, he couldn’t breathe. For 14 months I watched my protector, a loving hard working man turn into a fragile, sick human being. On this day Oct 11, 2007 as I laid in the fetal position on his hospital bed I felt a profound loss of security and confidence in the world. I felt sick, I wanted to die, and dying was so much easier than feeling this pain. I not only wanted my Daddy back I wanted him to be well again. I felt so helpless. Why, why my Daddy. It’s been seven years and I still find myself searching for answers.  How could this happen in America, how could Medical Board’s fail to protect patient’s from unethical doctors? I searched for answers and what I found was shocking, the stories of malpractice across the world were heart breaking. I wasn’t along, I slowly learned my way around the internet. JOHN PUENTE wasn’t the only one who suffered at hands of these doctor’s at this hospital. I continue to reach out sharing the tragic death of my Dad, I follow the doctors that treated him causing his complications that lead to his death.

Columbus, Ohio USA ",http://www.governor.ohio.gov/Contact/ContacttheGovernor.aspx,(614) 466-3555,," Governor Kasich has spent almost 4 years defending horrible practices, and frauds, at the Ohio State Medical Board - where the Board will put into public records that a woman MD did not 'deserve' a cast on a fracture because she was too 'seductive.'  Governor Kasich doesn't bother to read the crap, he just defends it - which is even stupider.   The Ohio Medical Board will spend 3 days of testimony, at huge legal expense to taxpayers, discussing a woman MD's 'dates,' because her patient care is above reproach.  They have to 'find' a case because the Medical Board suspended her license for hypothetical provisional that didn't pan out - because there is no due process in Ohio at the Medical Board - it's all for the Governor's 'pleasure.'  The Board wasted the time of a national psychiatric expert on this - for 3 days to discuss the sexual experiences of a woman MD to a salacious bunch of government employees - who got paid to question about a woman MD's sexual experiences. This was pertinent to her patient care?  This expert from NYC that told the Medical Board to stop this rot in 1995 - that case continues because Governor Kasich can't set priorities and standards.  It's for his 'pleasure.'   Mr. Whitehouse is gone, but the abuses continue - same old, same old.  Women MDs are the stats of bad MDs for the Ohio Board, even when they practice better than average Internal Medicine for Ohio, and have no patient complaints.  Someone has to be disciplined, so it has to be the woman who refused Dr. Nice?  That's a Medical Board case because his wife's family has money?  That's a personal choice, not a state issue.  But Governor Kasich, along with Dr. Nice, doesn't understand the difference - a personal refusal is not a state reportable & disciplinable event.  Nor is it a national event for reporting to the Physician Data Bank.   'Seductive' when begging for a cast, when she couldn't even comb her hair at the time?  Orthopedics in Ohio, and Governors, must imagine sex where there is none.  The woman MD didn't deserve a license because she wouldn't refer to Dr. Nice, go along with hip-and-knee orthopedics doing wrist fractures, or 'experimental' casts with no evidence that they work?  Who would?  Just because an immature orthopedic at University Hospitals wanted to try it for a publication paper - for his CV - the woman MD was supposed to do this experiment for his career or lose her medical license?  Who would go along with this except a 'talking head,' a robot, or a woman who has completely lost her moral compass = what the Medical Board of Ohio wants & rewards.    Deans of Medical Schools did not put women MDs through 4 years of Medical School in Ohio to be glorified prostitutes doing anything that the boys want, imagine, or lust for because guys do this - male MDs are not saints.  Or to say 'Yes' to the Governor and have a license at his 'pleasure.'  The Deans did not mean that women MDs would be glorified 'yes' nurses, or male 'escorts' on Rounds.  Governor Kasich apparently thinks, without consultation on this, that a Medical Board that wants this free-for-all is ok - what Ohio wants for 4 more years?  And that means that he's lost his professionalism, his sense of service, and the thought that medicine is a service profession, not a sex provider service for its Members & 'friends.'     Regarding one of the former Medical Board Members who made a mess in the 1990s: The Deans at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine had trouble with Carla O'Day MD, who Governor Celeste put on the Medical Board to go after her classmates - get back.  The reason - she played the 'Celeste card' through Medical School - skipping classes, flirting with male students when she was married (with 5 kids no less), and then she went after any classmate she remembered as disagreeing with her antics - taking licenses from 1990-3 that still aren't returned.  But Governor Kasich goes along like Governor Celester did, and there's been no review of these cases.  Every case that Carla O'Day MD voted on is suspicious for her 'getting back.'  Where's the common sense in this - letting a woman use the Medical Board for her revengagenda?   The Deans of Ohio Medical Schools did not ever think that a woman MD would have to say 'Yes' to sex for a medical license in 2013, be able to be complained about 'anonymously' or 'confidentially' (that's asking for sex for licenses), or that they would be disciplined for saying 'No' in regards to issues & choices about their own medical care.  You just can't do what every guy wants, even Governors.  Yet Anita Steinbergh DO is of the make and model where women did this, except that she was too mean ugly to be asked to do the stuff that other women have tried to say 'No' to - she just votes to take their licenses for personal choices that have nothing to do with patient care.   The woman MD is a threat to patients because she would try to intervene for them and prevent wrong care?  That a woman MD would say 'No' to stupid ideas, surgeries that don't work, jerks that want their egos massaged every minute of every day - is the stuff that women MDs are trained for - to be another point of view.  That a 'No' would be a reason to take a license for 'unknown mental illness,' is from the days when men would put women away for so-termed 'mental illness' so that they could marry again, or to collect the money. It's Victorian literature, to 'unknown mental illness' a career for a woman MD trying to keep a male MD from collecting an insurance fee, or billing, for an unneeded surgery or diagnosis. This is like Roman Empire 'ridiculous,' from the days when the Roman Emperors would be gods.  Women MDs are licensed at Governor Kasich's pleasure?    The reason that women MDs got in to Medical Schools, in numbers starting in the 1970s, was that the Deans were tired of the boys being boys, but Governor Kasich isn't tired of it.  Women's rights had little to nothing to do with it - the men in power were tired of the abuses of colleague males and the stink of no showers, male hormones, and crude talk.  Governor Kasich wants people serving at this pleasure, like the male MDs want women colleagues 'at their pleasure' or no license.     The Governor has failed to put some order at the Medical Board (1)continuing to reappoint Members who have already been there too long - Anita Steinbergh DO, (2) not allowing external review of the hundreds of false cases from his predecessors, and (3) appointing a Board that is a joke as to being able to discipline for negligences, or even define standards of care.  Anything that a 'friend' of a Medical Board Member does is defended, complaints about 'friends' are never seen or investigated.   The Governor does not have a channel of external review of cases with no merit, no Executive Workforce that understands the problem, and he hangs up when women physicians call - he can't meet and discuss the problems with a woman MD for 5 minutes - but you can hear him laughing in the background.   Deans of Medical Schools did not expect that women MDs would have to have 'aequanimitas' for the trash talk, for the seductive suggestions, for the patient mistakes and errors that were just because the boys were being boys.  Dean of Students Ken Scott, at Case Medical School, told us to improve things in the late 70s and early 80s - that he couldn't change things alone without help from the women students.  Deans of Medical Schools put women students through in order to have another point of view, to say something about the horrors that go on in the name of 'medical care.'  It's time that Governor Kasich started to help out women MDs.  If Governor Kasich can talk to patrons at Bob Evans, he should be able to spar with a woman MD with a MENSA IQ.  Too high for him?   ",Doctors

Beverly Hills, California USA ",http://www.flyermd.com/,310-659-9950,," Sadly, Dr. Brian Flyer is scamming his patients.  He says he accepts inurance to get clients, but in reality he does not honor their benefits.  So he charges patients upfront, ignoring the fact that you are supposed to only have a co-pay and then only pays you back what your insurance pays you back.  That is not how the Dr- Insunrance company relationship works.  Physicians go into a contract with insurance companies and they agree upon a contract rate for each service.  So if Blue Cross tells Dr. Flyer they wll only pay $175 for your check up, that is supposed to be all they can charge. I was suposed to have a free yearly check up.  With a normal Dr. you wold pay your co pay (or nothing) and that would be it.  Not here.  They force you to pay upfront before leaving the office.  Then they bill the insurance whatever they want- say $600.  Of course they already know that your insurance is only going to pay them back the agreed upon amount.  So if the agreed upon amount is only $175, then that is what the insurance sends the Dr. for your visit.  So then Dr. Flyer's office only sends you that back and you are out the difference. They do not explain this to their clients.  They want it to go over your head.  Lynn, who works in the office never even sent the small amount to me either.  That's a whole other double dipping thing they have going on.   I had to file a complaint with my insurance company to get paid back.  Many people have come out against him to talk about what he is doing. Just a warning.  I hope the insurance companies drop him.  If he likes practicing medicine, he should practice ethics first and just stop accepting insurance.  Come on, play fair.   ",Doctors

If you want them to retrieve and copy your medical records no matter how long or short, whether the copy is electronic or not, regardless of your ability to pay and even if they are for another doctor they charge a $50 fee. They justify it by claiming it's legal and ""reasonable"".  They stated that $15 of the $50 charge was for retrieving the records which, I believe, is not legal under HIPAA.  They stated that California law allows them to charge up to 25 cents a page for a copy - but I believe that is paper copy only, and they charge that for even an electronic copy. I am an advocate and personal representative for a young person that has no income and cannot afford $50 for a copy of medical records. They were requested by another doctor and normally, I'd expect the records to be transferred to the other doctor as a professional courtesty.  But there is no courtesy here, professional or otherwise!

taking licenses from 1990-3 that still aren't returned.  But Governor Kasich goes along like Governor Celester did, and there's been no review of these cases.  Every case that Carla O'Day MD voted on is suspicious for her 'getting back.'  Where's the common sense in this - letting a woman use the Medical Board for her revengagenda?   The Deans of Ohio Medical Schools did not ever think that a woman MD would have to say 'Yes' to sex for a medical license in 2013, be able to be complained about 'anonymously' or 'confidentially' (that's asking for sex for licenses), or that they would be disciplined for saying 'No' in regards to issues & choices about their own medical care.  You just can't do what every guy wants, even Governors.  Yet Anita Steinbergh DO is of the make and model where women did this, except that she was too mean ugly to be asked to do the stuff that other women have tried to say 'No' to - she just votes to take their licenses for personal choices that have nothing to do with patient care.   The woman MD is a threat to patients because she would try to intervene for them and prevent wrong care?  That a woman MD would say 'No' to stupid ideas, surgeries that don't work, jerks that want their egos massaged every minute of every day - is the stuff that women MDs are trained for - to be another point of view.  That a 'No' would be a reason to take a license for 'unknown mental illness,' is from the days when men would put women away for so-termed 'mental illness' so that they could marry again, or to collect the money. It's Victorian literature, to 'unknown mental illness' a career for a woman MD trying to keep a male MD from collecting an insurance fee, or billing, for an unneeded surgery or diagnosis. This is like Roman Empire 'ridiculous,' from the days when the Roman Emperors would be gods.  Women MDs are licensed at Governor Kasich's pleasure?    The reason that women MDs got in to Medical Schools, in numbers starting in the 1970s, was that the Deans were tired of the boys being boys, but Governor Kasich isn't tired of it.  Women's rights had little to nothing to do with it - the men in power were tired of the abuses of colleague males and the stink of no showers, male hormones, and crude talk.  Governor Kasich wants people serving at this pleasure, like the male MDs want women colleagues 'at their pleasure' or no license.     The Governor has failed to put some order at the Medical Board (1)continuing to reappoint Members who have already been there too long - Anita Steinbergh DO, (2) not allowing external review of the hundreds of false cases from his predecessors, and (3) appointing a Board that is a joke as to being able to discipline for negligences, or even define standards of care.  Anything that a 'friend' of a Medical Board Member does is defended, complaints about 'friends' are never seen or investigated.   The Governor does not have a channel of external review of cases with no merit, no Executive Workforce that understands the problem, and he hangs up when women physicians call - he can't meet and discuss the problems with a woman MD for 5 minutes - but you can hear him laughing in the background.   Deans of Medical Schools did not expect that women MDs would have to have 'aequanimitas' for the trash talk, for the seductive suggestions, for the patient mistakes and errors that were just because the boys were being boys.  Dean of Students Ken Scott, at Case Medical School, told us to improve things in the late 70s and early 80s - that he couldn't change things alone without help from the women students.  Deans of Medical Schools put women students through in order to have another point of view, to say something about the horrors that go on in the name of 'medical care.'  It's time that Governor Kasich started to help out women MDs.  If Governor Kasich can talk to patrons at Bob Evans, he should be able to spar with a woman MD with a MENSA IQ.  Too high for him?   ",Doctors

But, all of that changed when I was advised to request Dr. Patrice Basanta. As if it were a wonderful accomplishment, I was told that Dr. Basanta, herself, had used her privilege and access to trap a guy by successfully getting pregnant with a baby he did not want. I did not find this to be a 'bonus'. And as my friend does not know my entire family history, I'll try not to hold it against her. My own mother had the same grand idea, and as a result, I grew up without my own father. As a result, she selfishly robbed me of a great deal of things. But, if nothing else, I've learned what NOT to do. I contacted AMFM to inquire about their policy on this type of behavior from their physicians. I was asked to hold but ironically the call ended without my ever having received an answer. IMAGINE THAT!! I did not call back. I've just decided to pass on the referral and Dr. Basanta. ",Doctors

Houston, Texas USA ",https://www.facebook.com/will.moorehead?ref=ts&fref=ts,(713) 728-9266,," Better Off A Dead Man................ The final 14 months of my Daddy’s life August 7, 2006 Scheduled for a Lumbar Laminectomy at L2 thru L5: On a hot August morning we arrived at Renaissance Hospital in Houston, Texas at 7:00 am. Daddy said goodbye. We never dreamed our world would be turned upside down in the next 8 hours. Surgery went great, so we were told. Surgery was prolonged causing volume depletion, with significant blood loss. Postoperatively he suffered with respiratory failure, altered mental status, and required reintubation. His blood pressure dropped, heart rate went up, requiring two pressors for support, he developed some renal insufficiency, Along with paraplegia, for Daddy that was the most devastating of all. Dr. Lipsen was called for a consultation. He ordered Heparin to treat what he thought was a massive pulmonary embolism causing the hypotension and shock. [continued below]....
									
										..... Unstable and intubated Daddy developed an infection, had over 39 blood transfusions. He lost over 60 pounds in less than a month. Every 4 hours his blood levels were checked because of the heparin. After reviewing his results for myself, seeing the lab was warning the hospital that the PTT levels very high time after time and they didn’t stop the heparin until 8/19. Daddy was suffering, he was in terrible pain, limiting his pain medication because of his blood pressure. He became depressed and basically feared for his life, with good reason. The physician’s orders and nurses’ notes state a MRI was done on 8/14 and Dr. Moorehead received the results, he stated Daddy developed a hematoma and there was no evidence of a blood clot, which was the reason for the Heparin, however he failed to notify Daddy or my mother at the time. Expert witness’ all agree the deviation from the standard of care was using heparin in a protocol in a patient immediately exposed to such a major spine surgery. The risk was great. Our family watched as Daddy bled from his wound, blood products were floating in his Foley bag, he had large collections of blood under his skin, his stomach swell like a pregnant women’s. He was even falsely diagnosed with cancer. It was sickening to watch. I was exhausted I couldn’t imagine how Daddy felt after all this was happening to him. The Daddy we grew up with died, we now learned to love a sick, fragile man, who we knew had a limited amount of time left with us. His wound was open, at one point you could see his spine rotting. The smell was horrifying. Watching helplessly as the man I loved for everything he was, slowly wasting away. After being in 4 hospitals, suffering many complications, finally he was released to go home the first week in December 2006. My heart broke, again and again. I heard my father’s cries; I listened as he shared his fears, worries, and his overwhelming desire to end his life because of the emotional and physical pain he was suffering. Oct 11, 2006 John Puente’s wish came true. My biggest fear was now a reality. Not only was my Dad gone, his death was preventable; his life meant nothing to the doctors whose actions caused his slow agonizing death. It wasn't fair. When I arrived at my parents everyone was gathered on him weeping. I held his lifeless body in my arms, still warm to touch, weighing only 118 pounds.  As the funeral director wheeled Daddy out I followed, Daddy laid there lifeless, covered with a thin white sheet. I knew he was dead but my heart refused to accept it, I asked that they uncover his face, he couldn’t breathe. For 14 months I watched my protector, a loving hard working man turn into a fragile, sick human being. On this day Oct 11, 2007 as I laid in the fetal position on his hospital bed I felt a profound loss of security and confidence in the world. I felt sick, I wanted to die, and dying was so much easier than feeling this pain. I not only wanted my Daddy back I wanted him to be well again. I felt so helpless. Why, why my Daddy. It’s been seven years and I still find myself searching for answers.  How could this happen in America, how could Medical Board’s fail to protect patient’s from unethical doctors? I searched for answers and what I found was shocking, the stories of malpractice across the world were heart breaking. I wasn’t along, I slowly learned my way around the internet. JOHN PUENTE wasn’t the only one who suffered at hands of these doctor’s at this hospital. I continue to reach out sharing the tragic death of my Dad, I follow the doctors that treated him causing his complications that lead to his death.

Columbus, Ohio USA ",http://www.governor.ohio.gov/Contact/ContacttheGovernor.aspx,(614) 466-3555,," Governor Kasich has spent almost 4 years defending horrible practices, and frauds, at the Ohio State Medical Board - where the Board will put into public records that a woman MD did not 'deserve' a cast on a fracture because she was too 'seductive.'  Governor Kasich doesn't bother to read the crap, he just defends it - which is even stupider.   The Ohio Medical Board will spend 3 days of testimony, at huge legal expense to taxpayers, discussing a woman MD's 'dates,' because her patient care is above reproach.  They have to 'find' a case because the Medical Board suspended her license for hypothetical provisional that didn't pan out - because there is no due process in Ohio at the Medical Board - it's all for the Governor's 'pleasure.'  The Board wasted the time of a national psychiatric expert on this - for 3 days to discuss the sexual experiences of a woman MD to a salacious bunch of government employees - who got paid to question about a woman MD's sexual experiences. This was pertinent to her patient care?  This expert from NYC that told the Medical Board to stop this rot in 1995 - that case continues because Governor Kasich can't set priorities and standards.  It's for his 'pleasure.'   Mr. Whitehouse is gone, but the abuses continue - same old, same old.  Women MDs are the stats of bad MDs for the Ohio Board, even when they practice better than average Internal Medicine for Ohio, and have no patient complaints.  Someone has to be disciplined, so it has to be the woman who refused Dr. Nice?  That's a Medical Board case because his wife's family has money?  That's a personal choice, not a state issue.  But Governor Kasich, along with Dr. Nice, doesn't understand the difference - a personal refusal is not a state reportable & disciplinable event.  Nor is it a national event for reporting to the Physician Data Bank.   'Seductive' when begging for a cast, when she couldn't even comb her hair at the time?  Orthopedics in Ohio, and Governors, must imagine sex where there is none.  The woman MD didn't deserve a license because she wouldn't refer to Dr. Nice, go along with hip-and-knee orthopedics doing wrist fractures, or 'experimental' casts with no evidence that they work?  Who would?  Just because an immature orthopedic at University Hospitals wanted to try it for a publication paper - for his CV - the woman MD was supposed to do this experiment for his career or lose her medical license?  Who would go along with this except a 'talking head,' a robot, or a woman who has completely lost her moral compass = what the Medical Board of Ohio wants & rewards.    Deans of Medical Schools did not put women MDs through 4 years of Medical School in Ohio to be glorified prostitutes doing anything that the boys want, imagine, or lust for because guys do this - male MDs are not saints.  Or to say 'Yes' to the Governor and have a license at his 'pleasure.'  The Deans did not mean that women MDs would be glorified 'yes' nurses, or male 'escorts' on Rounds.  Governor Kasich apparently thinks, without consultation on this, that a Medical Board that wants this free-for-all is ok - what Ohio wants for 4 more years?  And that means that he's lost his professionalism, his sense of service, and the thought that medicine is a service profession, not a sex provider service for its Members & 'friends.'     Regarding one of the former Medical Board Members who made a mess in the 1990s: The Deans at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine had trouble with Carla O'Day MD, who Governor Celeste put on the Medical Board to go after her classmates -

The final 14 months of my Daddy’s life August 7, 2006 Scheduled for a Lumbar Laminectomy at L2 thru L5: On a hot August morning we arrived at Renaissance Hospital in Houston, Texas at 7:00 am. Daddy said goodbye. We never dreamed our world would be turned upside down in the next 8 hours. Surgery went great, so we were told. Surgery was prolonged causing volume depletion, with significant blood loss. Postoperatively he suffered with respiratory failure, altered mental status, and required reintubation. His blood pressure dropped, heart rate went up, requiring two pressors for support, he developed some renal insufficiency, Along with paraplegia, for Daddy that was the most devastating of all. Dr. Lipsen was called for a consultation. He ordered Heparin to treat what he thought was a massive pulmonary embolism causing the hypotension and shock. [continued below]....
									
										..... Unstable and intubated Daddy developed an infection, had over 39 blood transfusions. He lost over 60 pounds in less than a month. Every 4 hours his blood levels were checked because of the heparin. After reviewing his results for myself, seeing the lab was warning the hospital that the PTT levels very high time after time and they didn’t stop the heparin until 8/19. Daddy was suffering, he was in terrible pain, limiting his pain medication because of his blood pressure. He became depressed and basically feared for his life, with good reason. The physician’s orders and nurses’ notes state a MRI was done on 8/14 and Dr. Moorehead received the results, he stated Daddy developed a hematoma and there was no evidence of a blood clot, which was the reason for the Heparin, however he failed to notify Daddy or my mother at the time. Expert witness’ all agree the deviation from the standard of care was using heparin in a protocol in a patient immediately exposed to such a major spine surgery. The risk was great. Our family watched as Daddy bled from his wound, blood products were floating in his Foley bag, he had large collections of blood under his skin, his stomach swell like a pregnant women’s. He was even falsely diagnosed with cancer. It was sickening to watch. I was exhausted I couldn’t imagine how Daddy felt after all this was happening to him. The Daddy we grew up with died, we now learned to love a sick, fragile man, who we knew had a limited amount of time left with us. His wound was open, at one point you could see his spine rotting. The smell was horrifying. Watching helplessly as the man I loved for everything he was, slowly wasting away. After being in 4 hospitals, suffering many complications, finally he was released to go home the first week in December 2006. My heart broke, again and again. I heard my father’s cries; I listened as he shared his fears, worries, and his overwhelming desire to end his life because of the emotional and physical pain he was suffering. Oct 11, 2006 John Puente’s wish came true. My biggest fear was now a reality. Not only was my Dad gone, his death was preventable; his life meant nothing to the doctors whose actions caused his slow agonizing death. It wasn't fair. When I arrived at my parents everyone was gathered on him weeping. I held his lifeless body in my arms, still warm to touch, weighing only 118 pounds.  As the funeral director wheeled Daddy out I followed, Daddy laid there lifeless, covered with a thin white sheet. I knew he was dead but my heart refused to accept it, I asked that they uncover his face, he couldn’t breathe. For 14 months I watched my protector, a loving hard working man turn into a fragile, sick human being. On this day Oct 11, 2007 as I laid in the fetal position on his hospital bed I felt a profound loss of security and confidence in the world. I felt sick, I wanted to die, and dying was so much easier than feeling this pain. I not only wanted my Daddy back I wanted him to be well again. I felt so helpless. Why, why my Daddy. It’s been seven years and I still find myself searching for answers.  How could this happen in America, how could Medical Board’s fail to protect patient’s from unethical doctors?

Columbus, Ohio USA ",http://www.governor.ohio.gov/Contact/ContacttheGovernor.aspx,(614) 466-3555,," Governor Kasich has spent almost 4 years defending horrible practices, and frauds, at the Ohio State Medical Board - where the Board will put into public records that a woman MD did not 'deserve' a cast on a fracture because she was too 'seductive.'  Governor Kasich doesn't bother to read the crap, he just defends it - which is even stupider.   The Ohio Medical Board will spend 3 days of testimony, at huge legal expense to taxpayers, discussing a woman MD's 'dates,' because her patient care is above reproach.  They have to 'find' a case because the Medical Board suspended her license for hypothetical provisional that didn't pan out - because there is no due process in Ohio at the Medical Board - it's all for the Governor's 'pleasure.'  The Board wasted the time of a national psychiatric expert on this - for 3 days to discuss the sexual experiences of a woman MD to a salacious bunch of government employees - who got paid to question about a woman MD's sexual experiences. This was pertinent to her patient care?  This expert from NYC that told the Medical Board to stop this rot in 1995 - that case continues because Governor Kasich can't set priorities and standards.  It's for his 'pleasure.'   Mr. Whitehouse is gone, but the abuses continue - same old, same old.  Women MDs are the stats of bad MDs for the Ohio Board, even when they practice better than average Internal Medicine for Ohio, and have no patient complaints.  Someone has to be disciplined, so it has to be the woman who refused Dr. Nice?  That's a Medical Board case because his wife's family has money?  That's a personal choice, not a state issue.  But Governor Kasich, along with Dr. Nice, doesn't understand the difference - a personal refusal is not a state reportable & disciplinable event.  Nor is it a national event for reporting to the Physician Data Bank.   'Seductive' when begging for a cast, when she couldn't even comb her hair at the time?  Orthopedics in Ohio, and Governors, must imagine sex where there is none.  The woman MD didn't deserve a license because she wouldn't refer to Dr. Nice, go along with hip-and-knee orthopedics doing wrist fractures, or 'experimental' casts with no evidence that they work?  Who would?  Just because an immature orthopedic at University Hospitals wanted to try it for a publication paper - for his CV - the woman MD was supposed to do this experiment for his career or lose her medical license?  Who would go along with this except a 'talking head,' a robot, or a woman who has completely lost her moral compass = what the Medical Board of Ohio wants & rewards.    Deans of Medical Schools did not put women MDs through 4 years of Medical School in Ohio to be glorified prostitutes doing anything that the boys want, imagine, or lust for because guys do this - male MDs are not saints.  Or to say 'Yes' to the Governor and have a license at his 'pleasure.'  The Deans did not mean that women MDs would be glorified 'yes' nurses, or male 'escorts' on Rounds.  Governor Kasich apparently thinks, without consultation on this, that a Medical Board that wants this free-for-all is ok - what Ohio wants for 4 more years?  And that means that he's lost his professionalism, his sense of service, and the thought that medicine is a service profession, not a sex provider service for its Members & 'friends.'     Regarding one of the former Medical Board Members who made a mess in the 1990s: The Deans at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine had trouble with Carla O'Day MD, who Governor Celeste put on the Medical Board to go after her classmates - get back.  The reason - she played the 'Celeste card' through Medical School - skipping classes, flirting with male students when she was married (with 5 kids no less), and then she went after any classmate she remembered as disagreeing with her antics - taking licenses from 1990-3 that still aren't returned.  But Governor Kasich goes along like Governor Celester did, and there's been no review of these cases.  Every case that Carla O'Day MD voted on is suspicious for her 'getting back.'  Where's the common sense in this - letting a woman use the Medical Board for her revengagenda?   The Deans of Ohio Medical Schools did not ever think that a woman MD would have to say 'Yes' to sex for a medical license in 2013, be able to be complained about 'anonymously' or 'confidentially' (that's asking for sex for licenses), or that they would be disciplined for saying 'No' in regards to issues & choices about their own medical care.  You just can't do what every guy wants, even Governors.  Yet Anita Steinbergh DO is of the make and model where women did this, except that she was too mean ugly to be asked to do the stuff that other women have tried to say 'No' to - she just votes to take their licenses for personal choices that have nothing to do with patient care.   The woman MD is a threat to patients because she would try to intervene for them and prevent wrong care?  That a woman MD would say 'No' to stupid ideas, surgeries that don't work, jerks that want their egos massaged every minute of every day - is the stuff that women MDs are trained for - to be another point of view.  That a 'No' would be a reason to take a license for 'unknown mental illness,' is from the days when men would put women away for so-termed 'mental illness' so that they could marry again, or to collect the money. It's Victorian literature, to 'unknown mental illness' a career for a woman MD trying to keep a male MD from collecting an insurance fee, or billing, for an unneeded surgery or diagnosis. This is like Roman Empire 'ridiculous,' from the days when the Roman Emperors would be gods.  Women MDs are licensed at Governor Kasich's pleasure?    The reason that women MDs got in to Medical Schools, in numbers starting in the 1970s, was that the Deans were tired of the boys being boys, but Governor Kasich isn't tired of it.  Women's rights had little to nothing to do with it - the men in power were tired of the abuses of colleague males and the stink of no showers, male hormones, and crude talk.  Governor Kasich wants people serving at this pleasure, like the male MDs want women colleagues 'at their pleasure' or no license.     The Governor has failed to put some order at the Medical Board (1)continuing to reappoint Members who have already been there too long - Anita Steinbergh DO, (2) not allowing external review of the hundreds of false cases from his predecessors, and (3) appointing a Board that is a joke as to being able to discipline for negligences, or even define standards of care.  Anything that a 'friend' of a Medical Board Member does is defended, complaints about 'friends' are never seen or investigated.   The Governor does not have a channel of external review of cases with no merit, no Executive Workforce that understands the problem, and he hangs up when women physicians call - he can't meet and discuss the problems with a woman MD for 5 minutes - but you can hear him laughing in the background.   Deans of Medical Schools did not expect that women MDs would have to have 'aequanimitas' for the trash talk, for the seductive suggestions, for the patient mistakes and errors that were just because the boys were being boys.  Dean of Students Ken Scott, at Case Medical School, told us to improve things in the late 70s and early 80s - that he couldn't change things alone without help from the women students.  Deans of Medical Schools put women students through in order to have another point of view, to say something about the horrors that go on in the name of 'medical care.'  It's time that Governor Kasich started to help out women MDs.  If Governor Kasich can talk to patrons at Bob Evans, he should be able to spar with a woman MD with a MENSA IQ.  Too high for him?   ",Doctors

Beverly Hills, California USA ",http://www.flyermd.com/,310-659-9950,," Sadly, Dr. Brian Flyer is scamming his patients.  He says he accepts inurance to get clients, but in reality he does not honor their benefits.  So he charges patients upfront, ignoring the fact that you are supposed to only have a co-pay and then only pays you back what your insurance pays you back.  That is not how the Dr- Insunrance company relationship works.  Physicians go into a contract with insurance companies and they agree upon a contract rate for each service.  So if Blue Cross tells Dr. Flyer they wll only pay $175 for your check up, that is supposed to be all they can charge. I was suposed to have a free yearly check up.  With a normal Dr. you wold pay your co pay (or nothing) and that would be it.  Not here.  They force you to pay upfront before leaving the office.  Then they bill the insurance whatever they want- say $600.  Of course they already know that your insurance is only going to pay them back the agreed upon amount.  So if the agreed upon amount is only $175, then that is what the insurance sends the Dr. for your visit.  So then Dr. Flyer's office only sends you that back and you are out the difference. They do not explain this to their clients.  They want it to go over your head.  Lynn, who works in the office never even sent the small amount to me either.  That's a whole other double dipping thing they have going on.   I had to file a complaint with my insurance company to get paid back.  Many people have come out against him to talk about what he is doing. Just a warning.  I hope the insurance companies drop him.  If he likes practicing medicine, he should practice ethics first and just stop accepting insurance.  Come on, play fair.   ",Doctors

If you want them to retrieve and copy your medical records no matter how long or short, whether the copy is electronic or not, regardless of your ability to pay and even if they are for another doctor they charge a $50 fee. They justify it by claiming it's legal and ""reasonable"".  They stated that $15 of the $50 charge was for retrieving the records which, I believe, is not legal under HIPAA.  They stated that California law allows them to charge up to 25 cents a page for a copy - but I believe that is paper copy only, and they charge that for even an electronic copy. I am an advocate and personal representative for a young person that has no income and cannot afford $50 for a copy of medical records. They were requested by another doctor and normally, I'd expect the records to be transferred to the other doctor as a professional courtesty.  But there is no courtesy here, professional or otherwise!

male MDs are not saints.  Or to say 'Yes' to the Governor and have a license at his 'pleasure.'  The Deans did not mean that women MDs would be glorified 'yes' nurses, or male 'escorts' on Rounds.  Governor Kasich apparently thinks, without consultation on this, that a Medical Board that wants this free-for-all is ok - what Ohio wants for 4 more years?  And that means that he's lost his professionalism, his sense of service, and the thought that medicine is a service profession, not a sex provider service for its Members & 'friends.'     Regarding one of the former Medical Board Members who made a mess in the 1990s: The Deans at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine had trouble with Carla O'Day MD, who Governor Celeste put on the Medical Board to go after her classmates - get back.  The reason - she played the 'Celeste card' through Medical School - skipping classes, flirting with male students when she was married (with 5 kids no less), and then she went after any classmate she remembered as disagreeing with her antics - taking licenses from 1990-3 that still aren't returned.  But Governor Kasich goes along like Governor Celester did, and there's been no review of these cases.  Every case that Carla O'Day MD voted on is suspicious for her 'getting back.'  Where's the common sense in this - letting a woman use the Medical Board for her revengagenda?   The Deans of Ohio Medical Schools did not ever think that a woman MD would have to say 'Yes' to sex for a medical license in 2013, be able to be complained about 'anonymously' or 'confidentially' (that's asking for sex for licenses), or that they would be disciplined for saying 'No' in regards to issues & choices about their own medical care.  You just can't do what every guy wants, even Governors.  Yet Anita Steinbergh DO is of the make and model where women did this, except that she was too mean ugly to be asked to do the stuff that other women have tried to say 'No' to - she just votes to take their licenses for personal choices that have nothing to do with patient care.   The woman MD is a threat to patients because she would try to intervene for them and prevent wrong care?  That a woman MD would say 'No' to stupid ideas, surgeries that don't work, jerks that want their egos massaged every minute of every day - is the stuff that women MDs are trained for - to be another point of view.  That a 'No' would be a reason to take a license for 'unknown mental illness,' is from the days when men would put women away for so-termed 'mental illness' so that they could marry again, or to collect the money. It's Victorian literature, to 'unknown mental illness' a career for a woman MD trying to keep a male MD from collecting an insurance fee, or billing, for an unneeded surgery or diagnosis. This is like Roman Empire 'ridiculous,' from the days when the Roman Emperors would be gods.  Women MDs are licensed at Governor Kasich's pleasure?    The reason that women MDs got in to Medical Schools, in numbers starting in the 1970s, was that the Deans were tired of the boys being boys, but Governor Kasich isn't tired of it.  Women's rights had little to nothing to do with it - the men in power were tired of the abuses of colleague males and the stink of no showers, male hormones, and crude talk.  Governor Kasich wants people serving at this pleasure, like the male MDs want women colleagues 'at their pleasure' or no license.     The Governor has failed to put some order at the Medical Board (1)continuing to reappoint Members who have already been there too long - Anita Steinbergh DO, (2) not allowing external review of the hundreds of false cases from his predecessors, and (3) appointing a Board that is a joke as to being able to discipline for negligences, or even define standards of care.  Anything that a 'friend' of a Medical Board Member does is defended, complaints about 'friends' are never seen or investigated.   The Governor does not have a channel of external review of cases with no merit, no Executive Workforce that understands the problem, and he hangs up when women physicians call - he can't meet and discuss the problems with a woman MD for 5 minutes - but you can hear him laughing in the background.   Deans of Medical Schools did not expect that women MDs would have to have 'aequanimitas' for the trash talk, for the seductive suggestions, for the patient mistakes and errors that were just because the boys were being boys.  Dean of Students Ken Scott, at Case Medical School, told us to improve things in the late 70s and early 80s - that he couldn't change things alone without help from the women students.  Deans of Medical Schools put women students through in order to have another point of view, to say something about the horrors that go on in the name of 'medical care.'  It's time that Governor Kasich started to help out women MDs.  If Governor Kasich can talk to patrons at Bob Evans, he should be able to spar with a woman MD with a MENSA IQ.  Too high for him?   ",Doctors

If you want them to retrieve and copy your medical records no matter how long or short, whether the copy is electronic or not, regardless of your ability to pay and even if they are for another doctor they charge a $50 fee. They justify it by claiming it's legal and ""reasonable"".  They stated that $15 of the $50 charge was for retrieving the records which, I believe, is not legal under HIPAA.  They stated that California law allows them to charge up to 25 cents a page for a copy - but I believe that is paper copy only, and they charge that for even an electronic copy. I am an advocate and personal representative for a young person that has no income and cannot afford $50 for a copy of medical records.

I'd known one other person who was extremely happy with the care/treatment she received from AMFM but am not sure which doctor she saw. So, I did not hesitate to accept the referral. But, all of that changed when I was advised to request Dr. Patrice Basanta. As if it were a wonderful accomplishment, I was told that Dr. Basanta, herself, had used her privilege and access to trap a guy by successfully getting pregnant with a baby he did not want. I did not find this to be a 'bonus'. And as my friend does not know my entire family history, I'll try not to hold it against her. My own mother had the same grand idea, and as a result, I grew up without my own father. As a result, she selfishly robbed me of a great deal of things. But, if nothing else, I've learned what NOT to do. I contacted AMFM to inquire about their policy on this type of behavior from their physicians. I was asked to hold but ironically the call ended without my ever having received an answer. IMAGINE THAT!! I did not call back. I've just decided to pass on the referral and Dr. Basanta. ",Doctors

Houston, Texas USA ",https://www.facebook.com/will.moorehead?ref=ts&fref=ts,(713) 728-9266,," Better Off A Dead Man................ The final 14 months of my Daddy’s life August 7, 2006 Scheduled for a Lumbar Laminectomy at L2 thru L5: On a hot August morning we arrived at Renaissance Hospital in Houston, Texas at 7:00 am. Daddy said goodbye. We never dreamed our world would be turned upside down in the next 8 hours. Surgery went great, so we were told. Surgery was prolonged causing volume depletion, with significant blood loss. Postoperatively he suffered with respiratory failure, altered mental status, and required reintubation. His blood pressure dropped, heart rate went up, requiring two pressors for support, he developed some renal insufficiency, Along with paraplegia, for Daddy that was the most devastating of all. Dr. Lipsen was called for a consultation. He ordered Heparin to treat what he thought was a massive pulmonary embolism causing the hypotension and shock. [continued below]....
									
										..... Unstable and intubated Daddy developed an infection, had over 39 blood transfusions. He lost over 60 pounds in less than a month. Every 4 hours his blood levels were checked because of the heparin. After reviewing his results for myself, seeing the lab was warning the hospital that the PTT levels very high time after time and they didn’t stop the heparin until 8/19. Daddy was suffering, he was in terrible pain, limiting his pain medication because of his blood pressure. He became depressed and basically feared for his life, with good reason. The physician’s orders and nurses’ notes state a MRI was done on 8/14 and Dr. Moorehead received the results, he stated Daddy developed a hematoma and there was no evidence of a blood clot, which was the reason for the Heparin, however he failed to notify Daddy or my mother at the time. Expert witness’ all agree the deviation from the standard of care was using heparin in a protocol in a patient immediately exposed to such a major spine surgery. The risk was great. Our family watched as Daddy bled from his wound, blood products were floating in his Foley bag, he had large collections of blood under his skin, his stomach swell like a pregnant women’s. He was even falsely diagnosed with cancer. It was sickening to watch. I was exhausted I couldn’t imagine how Daddy felt after all this was happening to him. The Daddy we grew up with died, we now learned to love a sick, fragile man, who we knew had a limited amount of time left with us. His wound was open, at one point you could see his spine rotting. The smell was horrifying. Watching helplessly as the man I loved for everything he was, slowly wasting away. After being in 4 hospitals, suffering many complications, finally he was released to go home the first week in December 2006. My heart broke, again and again. I heard my father’s cries; I listened as he shared his fears, worries, and his overwhelming desire to end his life because of the emotional and physical pain he was suffering. Oct 11, 2006 John Puente’s wish came true. My biggest fear was now a reality. Not only was my Dad gone, his death was preventable; his life meant nothing to the doctors whose actions caused his slow agonizing death. It wasn't fair. When I arrived at my parents everyone was gathered on him weeping. I held his lifeless body in my arms, still warm to touch, weighing only 118 pounds.  As the funeral director wheeled Daddy out I followed, Daddy laid there lifeless, covered with a thin white sheet. I knew he was dead but my heart refused to accept it, I asked that they uncover his face, he couldn’t breathe. For 14 months I watched my protector, a loving hard working man turn into a fragile, sick human being. On this day Oct 11, 2007 as I laid in the fetal position on his hospital bed I felt a profound loss of security and confidence in the world. I felt sick, I wanted to die, and dying was so much easier than feeling this pain. I not only wanted my Daddy back I wanted him to be well again. I felt so helpless. Why, why my Daddy. It’s been seven years and I still find myself searching for answers.  How could this happen in America, how could Medical Board’s fail to protect patient’s from unethical doctors? I searched for answers and what I found was shocking, the stories of malpractice across the world were heart breaking. I wasn’t along, I slowly learned my way around the internet. JOHN PUENTE wasn’t the only one who suffered at hands of these doctor’s at this hospital. I continue to reach out sharing the tragic death of my Dad, I follow the doctors that treated him causing his complications that lead to his death.

The final 14 months of my Daddy’s life August 7, 2006 Scheduled for a Lumbar Laminectomy at L2 thru L5: On a hot August morning we arrived at Renaissance Hospital in Houston, Texas at 7:00 am. Daddy said goodbye. We never dreamed our world would be turned upside down in the next 8 hours. Surgery went great, so we were told. Surgery was prolonged causing volume depletion, with significant blood loss. Postoperatively he suffered with respiratory failure, altered mental status, and required reintubation. His blood pressure dropped, heart rate went up, requiring two pressors for support, he developed some renal insufficiency, Along with paraplegia, for Daddy that was the most devastating of all. Dr. Lipsen was called for a consultation. He ordered Heparin to treat what he thought was a massive pulmonary embolism causing the hypotension and shock. [continued below]....
									
										..... Unstable and intubated Daddy developed an infection, had over 39 blood transfusions. He lost over 60 pounds in less than a month. Every 4 hours his blood levels were checked because of the heparin. After reviewing his results for myself, seeing the lab was warning the hospital that the PTT levels very high time after time and they didn’t stop the heparin until 8/19. Daddy was suffering, he was in terrible pain, limiting his pain medication because of his blood pressure. He became depressed and basically feared for his life, with good reason. The physician’s orders and nurses’ notes state a MRI was done on 8/14 and Dr. Moorehead received the results, he stated Daddy developed a hematoma and there was no evidence of a blood clot, which was the reason for the Heparin, however he failed to notify Daddy or my mother at the time. Expert witness’ all agree the deviation from the standard of care was using heparin in a protocol in a patient immediately exposed to such a major spine surgery. The risk was great. Our family watched as Daddy bled from his wound, blood products were floating in his Foley bag, he had large collections of blood under his skin, his stomach swell like a pregnant women’s. He was even falsely diagnosed with cancer. It was sickening to watch. I was exhausted I couldn’t imagine how Daddy felt after all this was happening to him. The Daddy we grew up with died, we now learned to love a sick, fragile man, who we knew had a limited amount of time left with us. His wound was open, at one point you could see his spine rotting. The smell was horrifying. Watching helplessly as the man I loved for everything he was, slowly wasting away. After being in 4 hospitals, suffering many complications, finally he was released to go home the first week in December 2006. My heart broke, again and again. I heard my father’s cries; I listened as he shared his fears, worries, and his overwhelming desire to end his life because of the emotional and physical pain he was suffering. Oct 11, 2006 John Puente’s wish came true. My biggest fear was now a reality. Not only was my Dad gone, his death was preventable; his life meant nothing to the doctors whose actions caused his slow agonizing death. It wasn't fair. When I arrived at my parents everyone was gathered on him weeping. I held his lifeless body in my arms, still warm to touch, weighing only 118 pounds.  As the funeral director wheeled Daddy out I followed, Daddy laid there lifeless, covered with a thin white sheet. I knew he was dead but my heart refused to accept it, I asked that they uncover his face, he couldn’t breathe. For 14 months I watched my protector, a loving hard working man turn into a fragile, sick human being.

Governor John Kasich Ohio,"  Governor John Kasich Ohio  77South High Street, Riffe Center 30th Floor  
Columbus, Ohio USA ",http://www.governor.ohio.gov/Contact/ContacttheGovernor.aspx,(614) 466-3555,," Governor Kasich has spent almost 4 years defending horrible practices, and frauds, at the Ohio State Medical Board - where the Board will put into public records that a woman MD did not 'deserve' a cast on a fracture because she was too 'seductive.'  Governor Kasich doesn't bother to read the crap, he just defends it - which is even stupider.   The Ohio Medical Board will spend 3 days of testimony, at huge legal expense to taxpayers, discussing a woman MD's 'dates,' because her patient care is above reproach.  They have to 'find' a case because the Medical Board suspended her license for hypothetical provisional that didn't pan out - because there is no due process in Ohio at the Medical Board - it's all for the Governor's 'pleasure.'  The Board wasted the time of a national psychiatric expert on this - for 3 days to discuss the sexual experiences of a woman MD to a salacious bunch of government employees - who got paid to question about a woman MD's sexual experiences. This was pertinent to her patient care?  This expert from NYC that told the Medical Board to stop this rot in 1995 - that case continues because Governor Kasich can't set priorities and standards.  It's for his 'pleasure.'   Mr. Whitehouse is gone, but the abuses continue - same old, same old.  Women MDs are the stats of bad MDs for the Ohio Board, even when they practice better than average Internal Medicine for Ohio, and have no patient complaints.  Someone has to be disciplined, so it has to be the woman who refused Dr. Nice?  That's a Medical Board case because his wife's family has money?  That's a personal choice, not a state issue.  But Governor Kasich, along with Dr. Nice, doesn't understand the difference - a personal refusal is not a state reportable & disciplinable event.  Nor is it a national event for reporting to the Physician Data Bank.   'Seductive' when begging for a cast, when she couldn't even comb her hair at the time?  Orthopedics in Ohio, and Governors, must imagine sex where there is none.  The woman MD didn't deserve a license because she wouldn't refer to Dr. Nice, go along with hip-and-knee orthopedics doing wrist fractures, or 'experimental' casts with no evidence that they work?  Who would?  Just because an immature orthopedic at University Hospitals wanted to try it for a publication paper - for his CV - the woman MD was supposed to do this experiment for his career or lose her medical license?  Who would go along with this except a 'talking head,' a robot, or a woman who has completely lost her moral compass = what the Medical Board of Ohio wants & rewards.    Deans of Medical Schools did not put women MDs through 4 years of Medical School in Ohio to be glorified prostitutes doing anything that the boys want, imagine, or lust for because guys do this - male MDs are not saints.  Or to say 'Yes' to the Governor and have a license at his 'pleasure.'  The Deans did not mean that women MDs would be glorified 'yes' nurses, or male 'escorts' on Rounds.  Governor Kasich apparently thinks, without consultation on this, that a Medical Board that wants this free-for-all is ok - what Ohio wants for 4 more years?  And that means that he's lost his professionalism, his sense of service, and the thought that medicine is a service profession, not a sex provider service for its Members & 'friends.'     Regarding one of the former Medical Board Members who made a mess in the 1990s: The Deans at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine had trouble with Carla O'Day MD, who Governor Celeste put on the Medical Board to go after her classmates - get back.  The reason - she played the 'Celeste card' through Medical School - skipping classes, flirting with male students when she was married (with 5 kids no less), and then she went after any classmate she remembered as disagreeing with her antics - taking licenses from 1990-3 that still aren't returned.  But Governor Kasich goes along like Governor Celester did, and there's been no review of these cases.  Every case that Carla O'Day MD voted on is suspicious for her 'getting back.'  Where's the common sense in this - letting a woman use the Medical Board for her revengagenda?   The Deans of Ohio Medical Schools did not ever think that a woman MD would have to say 'Yes' to sex for a medical license in 2013, be able to be complained about 'anonymously' or 'confidentially' (that's asking for sex for licenses), or that they would be disciplined for saying 'No' in regards to issues & choices about their own medical care.  You just can't do what every guy wants, even Governors.  Yet Anita Steinbergh DO is of the make and model where women did this, except that she was too mean ugly to be asked to do the stuff that other women have tried to say 'No' to - she just votes to take their licenses for personal choices that have nothing to do with patient care.   The woman MD is a threat to patients because she would try to intervene for them and prevent wrong care?  That a woman MD would say 'No' to stupid ideas, surgeries that don't work, jerks that want their egos massaged every minute of every day - is the stuff that women MDs are trained for - to be another point of view.  That a 'No' would be a reason to take a license for 'unknown mental illness,' is from the days when men would put women away for so-termed 'mental illness' so that they could marry again, or to collect the money. It's Victorian literature, to 'unknown mental illness' a career for a woman MD trying to keep a male MD from collecting an insurance fee, or billing, for an unneeded surgery or diagnosis. This is like Roman Empire 'ridiculous,' from the days when the Roman Emperors would be gods.  Women MDs are licensed at Governor Kasich's pleasure?    The reason that women MDs got in to Medical Schools, in numbers starting in the 1970s, was that the Deans were tired of the boys being boys, but Governor Kasich isn't tired of it.  Women's rights had little to nothing to do with it - the men in power were tired of the abuses of colleague males and the stink of no showers, male hormones, and crude talk.  Governor Kasich wants people serving at this pleasure, like the male MDs want women colleagues 'at their pleasure' or no license.     The Governor has failed to put some order at the Medical Board (1)continuing to reappoint Members who have already been there too long - Anita Steinbergh DO, (2) not allowing external review of the hundreds of false cases from his predecessors, and (3) appointing a Board that is a joke as to being able to discipline for negligences, or even define standards of care.  Anything that a 'friend' of a Medical Board Member does is defended, complaints about 'friends' are never seen or investigated.   The Governor does not have a channel of external review of cases with no merit, no Executive Workforce that understands the problem, and he hangs up when women physicians call - he can't meet and discuss the problems with a woman MD for 5 minutes - but you can hear him laughing in the background.   Deans of Medical Schools did not expect that women MDs would have to have 'aequanimitas' for the trash talk, for the seductive suggestions, for the patient mistakes and errors that were just because the boys were being boys.  Dean of Students Ken Scott, at Case Medical School, told us to improve things in the late 70s and early 80s - that he couldn't change things alone without help from the women students.  Deans of Medical Schools put women students through in order to have another point of view, to say something about the horrors that go on in the name of 'medical care.'  It's time that Governor Kasich started to help out women MDs.  If Governor Kasich can talk to patrons at Bob Evans, he should be able to spar with a woman MD with a MENSA IQ.  Too high for him?   ",Doctors

Beverly Hills, California USA ",http://www.flyermd.com/,310-659-9950,," Sadly, Dr. Brian Flyer is scamming his patients.  He says he accepts inurance to get clients, but in reality he does not honor their benefits.  So he charges patients upfront, ignoring the fact that you are supposed to only have a co-pay and then only pays you back what your insurance pays you back.  That is not how the Dr- Insunrance company relationship works.  Physicians go into a contract with insurance companies and they agree upon a contract rate for each service.  So if Blue Cross tells Dr. Flyer they wll only pay $175 for your check up, that is supposed to be all they can charge. I was suposed to have a free yearly check up.  With a normal Dr. you wold pay your co pay (or nothing) and that would be it.  Not here.  They force you to pay upfront before leaving the office.  Then they bill the insurance whatever they want- say $600.  Of course they already know that your insurance is only going to pay them back the agreed upon amount.  So if the agreed upon amount is only $175, then that is what the insurance sends the Dr. for your visit.  So then Dr. Flyer's office only sends you that back and you are out the difference. They do not explain this to their clients.  They want it to go over your head.  Lynn, who works in the office never even sent the small amount to me either.  That's a whole other double dipping thing they have going on.   I had to file a complaint with my insurance company to get paid back.  Many people have come out against him to talk about what he is doing. Just a warning.  I hope the insurance companies drop him.  If he likes practicing medicine, he should practice ethics first and just stop accepting insurance.  Come on, play fair.   ",Doctors

where the Board will put into public records that a woman MD did not 'deserve' a cast on a fracture because she was too 'seductive.'  Governor Kasich doesn't bother to read the crap, he just defends it - which is even stupider.   The Ohio Medical Board will spend 3 days of testimony, at huge legal expense to taxpayers, discussing a woman MD's 'dates,' because her patient care is above reproach.  They have to 'find' a case because the Medical Board suspended her license for hypothetical provisional that didn't pan out - because there is no due process in Ohio at the Medical Board - it's all for the Governor's 'pleasure.'  The Board wasted the time of a national psychiatric expert on this - for 3 days to discuss the sexual experiences of a woman MD to a salacious bunch of government employees - who got paid to question about a woman MD's sexual experiences. This was pertinent to her patient care?  This expert from NYC that told the Medical Board to stop this rot in 1995 - that case continues because Governor Kasich can't set priorities and standards.  It's for his 'pleasure.'   Mr. Whitehouse is gone, but the abuses continue - same old, same old.  Women MDs are the stats of bad MDs for the Ohio Board, even when they practice better than average Internal Medicine for Ohio, and have no patient complaints.  Someone has to be disciplined, so it has to be the woman who refused Dr. Nice?  That's a Medical Board case because his wife's family has money?  That's a personal choice, not a state issue.  But Governor Kasich, along with Dr. Nice, doesn't understand the difference - a personal refusal is not a state reportable & disciplinable event.  Nor is it a national event for reporting to the Physician Data Bank.   'Seductive' when begging for a cast, when she couldn't even comb her hair at the time?  Orthopedics in Ohio, and Governors, must imagine sex where there is none.  The woman MD didn't deserve a license because she wouldn't refer to Dr. Nice, go along with hip-and-knee orthopedics doing wrist fractures, or 'experimental' casts with no evidence that they work?  Who would?  Just because an immature orthopedic at University Hospitals wanted to try it for a publication paper - for his CV - the woman MD was supposed to do this experiment for his career or lose her medical license?  Who would go along with this except a 'talking head,' a robot, or a woman who has completely lost her moral compass = what the Medical Board of Ohio wants & rewards.    Deans of Medical Schools did not put women MDs through 4 years of Medical School in Ohio to be glorified prostitutes doing anything that the boys want, imagine, or lust for because guys do this - male MDs are not saints.  Or to say 'Yes' to the Governor and have a license at his 'pleasure.'  The Deans did not mean that women MDs would be glorified 'yes' nurses, or male 'escorts' on Rounds.  Governor Kasich apparently thinks, without consultation on this, that a Medical Board that wants this free-for-all is ok - what Ohio wants for 4 more years?  And that means that he's lost his professionalism, his sense of service, and the thought that medicine is a service profession, not a sex provider service for its Members & 'friends.'     Regarding one of the former Medical Board Members who made a mess in the 1990s: The Deans at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine had trouble with Carla O'Day MD, who Governor Celeste put on the Medical Board to go after her classmates - get back.  The reason - she played the 'Celeste card' through Medical School - skipping classes, flirting with male students when she was married (with 5 kids no less), and then she went after any classmate she remembered as disagreeing with her antics - taking licenses from 1990-3 that still aren't returned.  But Governor Kasich goes along like Governor Celester did, and there's been no review of these cases.  Every case that Carla O'Day MD voted on is suspicious for her 'getting back.'  Where's the common sense in this - letting a woman use the Medical Board for her revengagenda?   The Deans of Ohio Medical Schools did not ever think that a woman MD would have to say 'Yes' to sex for a medical license in 2013, be able to be complained about 'anonymously' or 'confidentially' (that's asking for sex for licenses), or that they would be disciplined for saying 'No' in regards to issues & choices about their own medical care.  You just can't do what every guy wants, even Governors.  Yet Anita Steinbergh DO is of the make and model where women did this, except that she was too mean ugly to be asked to do the stuff that other women have tried to say 'No' to - she just votes to take their licenses for personal choices that have nothing to do with patient care.   The woman MD is a threat to patients because she would try to intervene for them and prevent wrong care?  That a woman MD would say 'No' to stupid ideas, surgeries that don't work, jerks that want their egos massaged every minute of every day - is the stuff that women MDs are trained for - to be another point of view.  That a 'No' would be a reason to take a license for 'unknown mental illness,' is from the days when men would put women away for so-termed 'mental illness' so that they could marry again, or to collect the money. It's Victorian literature, to 'unknown mental illness' a career for a woman MD trying to keep a male MD from collecting an insurance fee, or billing, for an unneeded surgery or diagnosis. This is like Roman Empire 'ridiculous,' from the days when the Roman Emperors would be gods.  Women MDs are licensed at Governor Kasich's pleasure?    The reason that women MDs got in to Medical Schools, in numbers starting in the 1970s, was that the Deans were tired of the boys being boys, but Governor Kasich isn't tired of it.  Women's rights had little to nothing to do with it - the men in power were tired of the abuses of colleague males and the stink of no showers, male hormones, and crude talk.  Governor Kasich wants people serving at this pleasure, like the male MDs want women colleagues 'at their pleasure' or no license.     The Governor has failed to put some order at the Medical Board (1)continuing to reappoint Members who have already been there too long - Anita Steinbergh DO, (2) not allowing external review of the hundreds of false cases from his predecessors, and (3) appointing a Board that is a joke as to being able to discipline for negligences, or even define standards of care.  Anything that a 'friend' of a Medical Board Member does is defended, complaints about 'friends' are never seen or investigated.   The Governor does not have a channel of external review of cases with no merit, no Executive Workforce that understands the problem, and he hangs up when women physicians call - he can't meet and discuss the problems with a woman MD for 5 minutes - but you can hear him laughing in the background.   Deans of Medical Schools did not expect that women MDs would have to have 'aequanimitas' for the trash talk, for the seductive suggestions, for the patient mistakes and errors that were just because the boys were being boys.  Dean of Students Ken Scott, at Case Medical School, told us to improve things in the late 70s and early 80s - that he couldn't change things alone without help from the women students.  Deans of Medical Schools put women students through in order to have another point of view, to say something about the horrors that go on in the name of 'medical care.'  It's time that Governor Kasich started to help out women MDs.  If Governor Kasich can talk to patrons at Bob Evans, he should be able to spar with a woman MD with a MENSA IQ.  Too high for him?   ",Doctors

I was suposed to have a free yearly check up.  With a normal Dr. you wold pay your co pay (or nothing) and that would be it.  Not here.  They force you to pay upfront before leaving the office.  Then they bill the insurance whatever they want- say $600.  Of course they already know that your insurance is only going to pay them back the agreed upon amount.  So if the agreed upon amount is only $175, then that is what the insurance sends the Dr. for your visit.  So then Dr. Flyer's office only sends you that back and you are out the difference. They do not explain this to their clients.  They want it to go over your head.  Lynn, who works in the office never even sent the small amount to me either.  That's a whole other double dipping thing they have going on.   I had to file a complaint with my insurance company to get paid back.  Many people have come out against him to talk about what he is doing.

If you want them to retrieve and copy your medical records no matter how long or short, whether the copy is electronic or not, regardless of your ability to pay and even if they are for another doctor they charge a $50 fee. They justify it by claiming it's legal and ""reasonable"".  They stated that $15 of the $50 charge was for retrieving the records which, I believe, is not legal under HIPAA.  They stated that California law allows them to charge up to 25 cents a page for a copy - but I believe that is paper copy only, and they charge that for even an electronic copy. I am an advocate and personal representative for a young person that has no income and cannot afford $50 for a copy of medical records. They were requested by another doctor and normally, I'd expect the records to be transferred to the other doctor as a professional courtesty.  But there is no courtesy here, professional or otherwise! The nurse practitioner at this clinic is great but the office staff is among some of the most rude and discourteous that I've ever encountered. ",Doctors

But, all of that changed when I was advised to request Dr. Patrice Basanta. As if it were a wonderful accomplishment, I was told that Dr. Basanta, herself, had used her privilege and access to trap a guy by successfully getting pregnant with a baby he did not want. I did not find this to be a 'bonus'. And as my friend does not know my entire family history, I'll try not to hold it against her. My own mother had the same grand idea, and as a result, I grew up without my own father. As a result, she selfishly robbed me of a great deal of things. But, if nothing else, I've learned what NOT to do. I contacted AMFM to inquire about their policy on this type of behavior from their physicians. I was asked to hold but ironically the call ended without my ever having received an answer. IMAGINE THAT!! I did not call back. I've just decided to pass on the referral and Dr. Basanta. ",Doctors

The final 14 months of my Daddy’s life August 7, 2006 Scheduled for a Lumbar Laminectomy at L2 thru L5: On a hot August morning we arrived at Renaissance Hospital in Houston, Texas at 7:00 am. Daddy said goodbye. We never dreamed our world would be turned upside down in the next 8 hours. Surgery went great, so we were told. Surgery was prolonged causing volume depletion, with significant blood loss. Postoperatively he suffered with respiratory failure, altered mental status, and required reintubation. His blood pressure dropped, heart rate went up, requiring two pressors for support, he developed some renal insufficiency, Along with paraplegia, for Daddy that was the most devastating of all. Dr. Lipsen was called for a consultation. He ordered Heparin to treat what he thought was a massive pulmonary embolism causing the hypotension and shock. [continued below]....
									
										..... Unstable and intubated Daddy developed an infection, had over 39 blood transfusions. He lost over 60 pounds in less than a month. Every 4 hours his blood levels were checked because of the heparin. After reviewing his results for myself, seeing the lab was warning the hospital that the PTT levels very high time after time and they didn’t stop the heparin until 8/19. Daddy was suffering, he was in terrible pain, limiting his pain medication because of his blood pressure. He became depressed and basically feared for his life, with good reason. The physician’s orders and nurses’ notes state a MRI was done on 8/14 and Dr. Moorehead received the results, he stated Daddy developed a hematoma and there was no evidence of a blood clot, which was the reason for the Heparin, however he failed to notify Daddy or my mother at the time. Expert witness’ all agree the deviation from the standard of care was using heparin in a protocol in a patient immediately exposed to such a major spine surgery. The risk was great. Our family watched as Daddy bled from his wound, blood products were floating in his Foley bag, he had large collections of blood under his skin, his stomach swell like a pregnant women’s. He was even falsely diagnosed with cancer. It was sickening to watch. I was exhausted I couldn’t imagine how Daddy felt after all this was happening to him. The Daddy we grew up with died, we now learned to love a sick, fragile man, who we knew had a limited amount of time left with us. His wound was open, at one point you could see his spine rotting. The smell was horrifying. Watching helplessly as the man I loved for everything he was, slowly wasting away. After being in 4 hospitals, suffering many complications, finally he was released to go home the first week in December 2006. My heart broke, again and again. I heard my father’s cries; I listened as he shared his fears, worries, and his overwhelming desire to end his life because of the emotional and physical pain he was suffering. Oct 11, 2006 John Puente’s wish came true. My biggest fear was now a reality. Not only was my Dad gone, his death was preventable; his life meant nothing to the doctors whose actions caused his slow agonizing death. It wasn't fair. When I arrived at my parents everyone was gathered on him weeping. I held his lifeless body in my arms, still warm to touch, weighing only 118 pounds.  As the funeral director wheeled Daddy out I followed, Daddy laid there lifeless, covered with a thin white sheet. I knew he was dead but my heart refused to accept it, I asked that they uncover his face, he couldn’t breathe. For 14 months I watched my protector, a loving hard working man turn into a fragile, sick human being. On this day Oct 11, 2007 as I laid in the fetal position on his hospital bed I felt a profound loss of security and confidence in the world. I felt sick, I wanted to die, and dying was so much easier than feeling this pain. I not only wanted my Daddy back I wanted him to be well again. I felt so helpless. Why, why my Daddy. It’s been seven years and I still find myself searching for answers.  How could this happen in America, how could Medical Board’s fail to protect patient’s from unethical doctors? I searched for answers and what I found was shocking, the stories of malpractice across the world were heart breaking. I wasn’t along, I slowly learned my way around the internet. JOHN PUENTE wasn’t the only one who suffered at hands of these doctor’s at this hospital. I continue to reach out sharing the tragic death of my Dad, I follow the doctors that treated him causing his complications that lead to his death.

Daddy said goodbye. We never dreamed our world would be turned upside down in the next 8 hours. Surgery went great, so we were told. Surgery was prolonged causing volume depletion, with significant blood loss. Postoperatively he suffered with respiratory failure, altered mental status, and required reintubation. His blood pressure dropped, heart rate went up, requiring two pressors for support, he developed some renal insufficiency, Along with paraplegia, for Daddy that was the most devastating of all. Dr. Lipsen was called for a consultation. He ordered Heparin to treat what he thought was a massive pulmonary embolism causing the hypotension and shock. [continued below]....
									
										..... Unstable and intubated Daddy developed an infection, had over 39 blood transfusions. He lost over 60 pounds in less than a month. Every 4 hours his blood levels were checked because of the heparin. After reviewing his results for myself, seeing the lab was warning the hospital that the PTT levels very high time after time and they didn’t stop the heparin until 8/19. Daddy was suffering, he was in terrible pain, limiting his pain medication because of his blood pressure. He became depressed and basically feared for his life, with good reason. The physician’s orders and nurses’ notes state a MRI was done on 8/14 and Dr. Moorehead received the results, he stated Daddy developed a hematoma and there was no evidence of a blood clot, which was the reason for the Heparin, however he failed to notify Daddy or my mother at the time. Expert witness’ all agree the deviation from the standard of care was using heparin in a protocol in a patient immediately exposed to such a major spine surgery. The risk was great. Our family watched as Daddy bled from his wound, blood products were floating in his Foley bag, he had large collections of blood under his skin, his stomach swell like a pregnant women’s. He was even falsely diagnosed with cancer. It was sickening to watch. I was exhausted I couldn’t imagine how Daddy felt after all this was happening to him. The Daddy we grew up with died, we now learned to love a sick, fragile man, who we knew had a limited amount of time left with us. His wound was open, at one point you could see his spine rotting. The smell was horrifying. Watching helplessly as the man I loved for everything he was, slowly wasting away. After being in 4 hospitals, suffering many complications, finally he was released to go home the first week in December 2006. My heart broke, again and again. I heard my father’s cries; I listened as he shared his fears, worries, and his overwhelming desire to end his life because of the emotional and physical pain he was suffering. Oct 11, 2006 John Puente’s wish came true. My biggest fear was now a reality. Not only was my Dad gone, his death was preventable; his life meant nothing to the doctors whose actions caused his slow agonizing death. It wasn't fair. When I arrived at my parents everyone was gathered on him weeping. I held his lifeless body in my arms, still warm to touch, weighing only 118 pounds.  As the funeral director wheeled Daddy out I followed, Daddy laid there lifeless, covered with a thin white sheet. I knew he was dead but my heart refused to accept it, I asked that they uncover his face, he couldn’t breathe. For 14 months I watched my protector, a loving hard working man turn into a fragile, sick human being. On this day Oct 11, 2007 as I laid in the fetal position on his hospital bed I felt a profound loss of security and confidence in the world. I felt sick, I wanted to die, and dying was so much easier than feeling this pain. I not only wanted my Daddy back I wanted him to be well again. I felt so helpless. Why, why my Daddy. It’s been seven years and I still find myself searching for answers.  How could this happen in America, how could Medical Board’s fail to protect patient’s from unethical doctors? I searched for answers and what I found was shocking, the stories of malpractice across the world were heart breaking. I wasn’t along, I slowly learned my way around the internet. JOHN PUENTE wasn’t the only one who suffered at hands of these doctor’s at this hospital. I continue to reach out sharing the tragic death of my Dad, I follow the doctors that treated him causing his complications that lead to his death.

Columbus, Ohio USA ",http://www.governor.ohio.gov/Contact/ContacttheGovernor.aspx,(614) 466-3555,," Governor Kasich has spent almost 4 years defending horrible practices, and frauds, at the Ohio State Medical Board - where the Board will put into public records that a woman MD did not 'deserve' a cast on a fracture because she was too 'seductive.'  Governor Kasich doesn't bother to read the crap, he just defends it - which is even stupider.   The Ohio Medical Board will spend 3 days of testimony, at huge legal expense to taxpayers, discussing a woman MD's 'dates,' because her patient care is above reproach.  They have to 'find' a case because the Medical Board suspended her license for hypothetical provisional that didn't pan out - because there is no due process in Ohio at the Medical Board - it's all for the Governor's 'pleasure.'  The Board wasted the time of a national psychiatric expert on this - for 3 days to discuss the sexual experiences of a woman MD to a salacious bunch of government employees - who got paid to question about a woman MD's sexual experiences. This was pertinent to her patient care?  This expert from NYC that told the Medical Board to stop this rot in 1995 - that case continues because Governor Kasich can't set priorities and standards.  It's for his 'pleasure.'   Mr. Whitehouse is gone, but the abuses continue - same old, same old.  Women MDs are the stats of bad MDs for the Ohio Board, even when they practice better than average Internal Medicine for Ohio, and have no patient complaints.  Someone has to be disciplined, so it has to be the woman who refused Dr. Nice?  That's a Medical Board case because his wife's family has money?  That's a personal choice, not a state issue.  But Governor Kasich, along with Dr. Nice, doesn't understand the difference - a personal refusal is not a state reportable & disciplinable event.  Nor is it a national event for reporting to the Physician Data Bank.   'Seductive' when begging for a cast, when she couldn't even comb her hair at the time?  Orthopedics in Ohio, and Governors, must imagine sex where there is none.  The woman MD didn't deserve a license because she wouldn't refer to Dr. Nice, go along with hip-and-knee orthopedics doing wrist fractures, or 'experimental' casts with no evidence that they work?  Who would?  Just because an immature orthopedic at University Hospitals wanted to try it for a publication paper - for his CV - the woman MD was supposed to do this experiment for his career or lose her medical license?  Who would go along with this except a 'talking head,' a robot, or a woman who has completely lost her moral compass = what the Medical Board of Ohio wants & rewards.    Deans of Medical Schools did not put women MDs through 4 years of Medical School in Ohio to be glorified prostitutes doing anything that the boys want, imagine, or lust for because guys do this - male MDs are not saints.  Or to say 'Yes' to the Governor and have a license at his 'pleasure.'  The Deans did not mean that women MDs would be glorified 'yes' nurses, or male 'escorts' on Rounds.  Governor Kasich apparently thinks, without consultation on this, that a Medical Board that wants this free-for-all is ok - what Ohio wants for 4 more years?  And that means that he's lost his professionalism, his sense of service, and the thought that medicine is a service profession, not a sex provider service for its Members & 'friends.'     Regarding one of the former Medical Board Members who made a mess in the 1990s: The Deans at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine had trouble with Carla O'Day MD, who Governor Celeste put on the Medical Board to go after her classmates - get back.  The reason - she played the 'Celeste card' through Medical School - skipping classes, flirting with male students when she was married (with 5 kids no less), and then she went after any classmate she remembered as disagreeing with her antics - taking licenses from 1990-3 that still aren't returned.  But Governor Kasich goes along like Governor Celester did, and there's been no review of these cases.  Every case that Carla O'Day MD voted on is suspicious for her 'getting back.'  Where's the common sense in this - letting a woman use the Medical Board for her revengagenda?   The Deans of Ohio Medical Schools did not ever think that a woman MD would have to say 'Yes' to sex for a medical license in 2013, be able to be complained about 'anonymously' or 'confidentially' (that's asking for sex for licenses), or that they would be disciplined for saying 'No' in regards to issues & choices about their own medical care.  You just can't do what every guy wants, even Governors.  Yet Anita Steinbergh DO is of the make and model where women did this, except that she was too mean ugly to be asked to do the stuff that other women have tried to say 'No' to - she just votes to take their licenses for personal choices that have nothing to do with patient care.   The woman MD is a threat to patients because she would try to intervene for them and prevent wrong care?  That a woman MD would say 'No' to stupid ideas, surgeries that don't work, jerks that want their egos massaged every minute of every day - is the stuff that women MDs are trained for - to be another point of view.  That a 'No' would be a reason to take a license for 'unknown mental illness,' is from the days when men would put women away for so-termed 'mental illness' so that they could marry again, or to collect the money. It's Victorian literature, to 'unknown mental illness' a career for a woman MD trying to keep a male MD from collecting an insurance fee, or billing, for an unneeded surgery or diagnosis. This is like Roman Empire 'ridiculous,' from the days when the Roman Emperors would be gods.  Women MDs are licensed at Governor Kasich's pleasure?    The reason that women MDs got in to Medical Schools, in numbers starting in the 1970s, was that the Deans were tired of the boys being boys, but Governor Kasich isn't tired of it.  Women's rights had little to nothing to do with it - the men in power were tired of the abuses of colleague males and the stink of no showers, male hormones, and crude talk.  Governor Kasich wants people serving at this pleasure, like the male MDs want women colleagues 'at their pleasure' or no license.     The Governor has failed to put some order at the Medical Board (1)continuing to reappoint Members who have already been there too long - Anita Steinbergh DO, (2) not allowing external review of the hundreds of false cases from his predecessors, and (3) appointing a Board that is a joke as to being able to discipline for negligences, or even define standards of care.  Anything that a 'friend' of a Medical Board Member does is defended, complaints about 'friends' are never seen or investigated.   The Governor does not have a channel of external review of cases with no merit, no Executive Workforce that understands the problem, and he hangs up when women physicians call - he can't meet and discuss the problems with a woman MD for 5 minutes - but you can hear him laughing in the background.   Deans of Medical Schools did not expect that women MDs would have to have 'aequanimitas' for the trash talk, for the seductive suggestions, for the patient mistakes and errors that were just because the boys were being boys.  Dean of Students Ken Scott, at Case Medical School, told us to improve things in the late 70s and early 80s - that he couldn't change things alone without help from the women students.  Deans of Medical Schools put women students through in order to have another point of view, to say something about the horrors that go on in the name of 'medical care.'  It's time that Governor Kasich started to help out women MDs.  If Governor Kasich can talk to patrons at Bob Evans, he should be able to spar with a woman MD with a MENSA IQ.  Too high for him?   ",Doctors

For 14 months I watched my protector, a loving hard working man turn into a fragile, sick human being. On this day Oct 11, 2007 as I laid in the fetal position on his hospital bed I felt a profound loss of security and confidence in the world. I felt sick, I wanted to die, and dying was so much easier than feeling this pain. I not only wanted my Daddy back I wanted him to be well again. I felt so helpless. Why, why my Daddy. It’s been seven years and I still find myself searching for answers.  How could this happen in America, how could Medical Board’s fail to protect patient’s from unethical doctors? I searched for answers and what I found was shocking, the stories of malpractice across the world were heart breaking. I wasn’t along, I slowly learned my way around the internet. JOHN PUENTE wasn’t the only one who suffered at hands of these doctor’s at this hospital.

where the Board will put into public records that a woman MD did not 'deserve' a cast on a fracture because she was too 'seductive.'  Governor Kasich doesn't bother to read the crap, he just defends it - which is even stupider.   The Ohio Medical Board will spend 3 days of testimony, at huge legal expense to taxpayers, discussing a woman MD's 'dates,' because her patient care is above reproach.  They have to 'find' a case because the Medical Board suspended her license for hypothetical provisional that didn't pan out - because there is no due process in Ohio at the Medical Board - it's all for the Governor's 'pleasure.'  The Board wasted the time of a national psychiatric expert on this - for 3 days to discuss the sexual experiences of a woman MD to a salacious bunch of government employees - who got paid to question about a woman MD's sexual experiences. This was pertinent to her patient care?  This expert from NYC that told the Medical Board to stop this rot in 1995 - that case continues because Governor Kasich can't set priorities and standards.  It's for his 'pleasure.'   Mr. Whitehouse is gone, but the abuses continue - same old, same old.  Women MDs are the stats of bad MDs for the Ohio Board, even when they practice better than average Internal Medicine for Ohio, and have no patient complaints.  Someone has to be disciplined, so it has to be the woman who refused Dr. Nice?  That's a Medical Board case because his wife's family has money?  That's a personal choice, not a state issue.  But Governor Kasich, along with Dr. Nice, doesn't understand the difference - a personal refusal is not a state reportable & disciplinable event.  Nor is it a national event for reporting to the Physician Data Bank.   'Seductive' when begging for a cast, when she couldn't even comb her hair at the time?  Orthopedics in Ohio, and Governors, must imagine sex where there is none.  The woman MD didn't deserve a license because she wouldn't refer to Dr. Nice, go along with hip-and-knee orthopedics doing wrist fractures, or 'experimental' casts with no evidence that they work?  Who would?  Just because an immature orthopedic at University Hospitals wanted to try it for a publication paper - for his CV - the woman MD was supposed to do this experiment for his career or lose her medical license?  Who would go along with this except a 'talking head,' a robot, or a woman who has completely lost her moral compass = what the Medical Board of Ohio wants & rewards.    Deans of Medical Schools did not put women MDs through 4 years of Medical School in Ohio to be glorified prostitutes doing anything that the boys want, imagine, or lust for because guys do this - male MDs are not saints.  Or to say 'Yes' to the Governor and have a license at his 'pleasure.'  The Deans did not mean that women MDs would be glorified 'yes' nurses, or male 'escorts' on Rounds.  Governor Kasich apparently thinks, without consultation on this, that a Medical Board that wants this free-for-all is ok - what Ohio wants for 4 more years?  And that means that he's lost his professionalism, his sense of service, and the thought that medicine is a service profession, not a sex provider service for its Members & 'friends.'     Regarding one of the former Medical Board Members who made a mess in the 1990s: The Deans at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine had trouble with Carla O'Day MD, who Governor Celeste put on the Medical Board to go after her classmates - get back.  The reason - she played the 'Celeste card' through Medical School - skipping classes, flirting with male students when she was married (with 5 kids no less), and then she went after any classmate she remembered as disagreeing with her antics - taking licenses from 1990-3 that still aren't returned.  But Governor Kasich goes along like Governor Celester did, and there's been no review of these cases.  Every case that Carla O'Day MD voted on is suspicious for her 'getting back.'  Where's the common sense in this - letting a woman use the Medical Board for her revengagenda?   The Deans of Ohio Medical Schools did not ever think that a woman MD would have to say 'Yes' to sex for a medical license in 2013, be able to be complained about 'anonymously' or 'confidentially' (that's asking for sex for licenses), or that they would be disciplined for saying 'No' in regards to issues & choices about their own medical care.  You just can't do what every guy wants, even Governors.  Yet Anita Steinbergh DO is of the make and model where women did this, except that she was too mean ugly to be asked to do the stuff that other women have tried to say 'No' to - she just votes to take their licenses for personal choices that have nothing to do with patient care.   The woman MD is a threat to patients because she would try to intervene for them and prevent wrong care?  That a woman MD would say 'No' to stupid ideas, surgeries that don't work, jerks that want their egos massaged every minute of every day - is the stuff that women MDs are trained for - to be another point of view.  That a 'No' would be a reason to take a license for 'unknown mental illness,' is from the days when men would put women away for so-termed 'mental illness' so that they could marry again, or to collect the money. It's Victorian literature, to 'unknown mental illness' a career for a woman MD trying to keep a male MD from collecting an insurance fee, or billing, for an unneeded surgery or diagnosis. This is like Roman Empire 'ridiculous,' from the days when the Roman Emperors would be gods.  Women MDs are licensed at Governor Kasich's pleasure?    The reason that women MDs got in to Medical Schools, in numbers starting in the 1970s, was that the Deans were tired of the boys being boys, but Governor Kasich isn't tired of it.  Women's rights had little to nothing to do with it - the men in power were tired of the abuses of colleague males and the stink of no showers, male hormones, and crude talk.  Governor Kasich wants people serving at this pleasure, like the male MDs want women colleagues 'at their pleasure' or no license.     The Governor has failed to put some order at the Medical Board (1)continuing to reappoint Members who have already been there too long - Anita Steinbergh DO, (2) not allowing external review of the hundreds of false cases from his predecessors, and (3) appointing a Board that is a joke as to being able to discipline for negligences, or even define standards of care.  Anything that a 'friend' of a Medical Board Member does is defended, complaints about 'friends' are never seen or investigated.   The Governor does not have a channel of external review of cases with no merit, no Executive Workforce that understands the problem, and he hangs up when women physicians call - he can't meet and discuss the problems with a woman MD for 5 minutes - but you can hear him laughing in the background.   Deans of Medical Schools did not expect that women MDs would have to have 'aequanimitas' for the trash talk, for the seductive suggestions, for the patient mistakes and errors that were just because the boys were being boys.  Dean of Students Ken Scott, at Case Medical School, told us to improve things in the late 70s and early 80s - that he couldn't change things alone without help from the women students.  Deans of Medical Schools put women students through in order to have another point of view, to say something about the horrors that go on in the name of 'medical care.'  It's time that Governor Kasich started to help out women MDs.  If Governor Kasich can talk to patrons at Bob Evans, he should be able to spar with a woman MD with a MENSA IQ.  Too high for him?   ",Doctors

Beverly Hills, California USA ",http://www.flyermd.com/,310-659-9950,," Sadly, Dr. Brian Flyer is scamming his patients.  He says he accepts inurance to get clients, but in reality he does not honor their benefits.  So he charges patients upfront, ignoring the fact that you are supposed to only have a co-pay and then only pays you back what your insurance pays you back.  That is not how the Dr- Insunrance company relationship works.  Physicians go into a contract with insurance companies and they agree upon a contract rate for each service.  So if Blue Cross tells Dr. Flyer they wll only pay $175 for your check up, that is supposed to be all they can charge. I was suposed to have a free yearly check up.  With a normal Dr. you wold pay your co pay (or nothing) and that would be it.  Not here.  They force you to pay upfront before leaving the office.  Then they bill the insurance whatever they want- say $600.  Of course they already know that your insurance is only going to pay them back the agreed upon amount.  So if the agreed upon amount is only $175, then that is what the insurance sends the Dr. for your visit.  So then Dr. Flyer's office only sends you that back and you are out the difference. They do not explain this to their clients.  They want it to go over your head.  Lynn, who works in the office never even sent the small amount to me either.  That's a whole other double dipping thing they have going on.   I had to file a complaint with my insurance company to get paid back.  Many people have come out against him to talk about what he is doing. Just a warning.  I hope the insurance companies drop him.  If he likes practicing medicine, he should practice ethics first and just stop accepting insurance.  Come on, play fair.   ",Doctors

If you want them to retrieve and copy your medical records no matter how long or short, whether the copy is electronic or not, regardless of your ability to pay and even if they are for another doctor they charge a $50 fee. They justify it by claiming it's legal and ""reasonable"".  They stated that $15 of the $50 charge was for retrieving the records which, I believe, is not legal under HIPAA.  They stated that California law allows them to charge up to 25 cents a page for a copy - but I believe that is paper copy only, and they charge that for even an electronic copy. I am an advocate and personal representative for a young person that has no income and cannot afford $50 for a copy of medical records. They were requested by another doctor and normally, I'd expect the records to be transferred to the other doctor as a professional courtesty.  But there is no courtesy here, professional or otherwise!

I did not find this to be a 'bonus'. And as my friend does not know my entire family history, I'll try not to hold it against her. My own mother had the same grand idea, and as a result, I grew up without my own father. As a result, she selfishly robbed me of a great deal of things. But, if nothing else, I've learned what NOT to do. I contacted AMFM to inquire about their policy on this type of behavior from their physicians.

The final 14 months of my Daddy’s life August 7, 2006 Scheduled for a Lumbar Laminectomy at L2 thru L5: On a hot August morning we arrived at Renaissance Hospital in Houston, Texas at 7:00 am. Daddy said goodbye. We never dreamed our world would be turned upside down in the next 8 hours. Surgery went great, so we were told. Surgery was prolonged causing volume depletion, with significant blood loss. Postoperatively he suffered with respiratory failure, altered mental status, and required reintubation. His blood pressure dropped, heart rate went up, requiring two pressors for support, he developed some renal insufficiency, Along with paraplegia, for Daddy that was the most devastating of all. Dr. Lipsen was called for a consultation. He ordered Heparin to treat what he thought was a massive pulmonary embolism causing the hypotension and shock. [continued below]....
									
										..... Unstable and intubated Daddy developed an infection, had over 39 blood transfusions. He lost over 60 pounds in less than a month. Every 4 hours his blood levels were checked because of the heparin. After reviewing his results for myself, seeing the lab was warning the hospital that the PTT levels very high time after time and they didn’t stop the heparin until 8/19. Daddy was suffering, he was in terrible pain, limiting his pain medication because of his blood pressure. He became depressed and basically feared for his life, with good reason. The physician’s orders and nurses’ notes state a MRI was done on 8/14 and Dr. Moorehead received the results, he stated Daddy developed a hematoma and there was no evidence of a blood clot, which was the reason for the Heparin, however he failed to notify Daddy or my mother at the time. Expert witness’ all agree the deviation from the standard of care was using heparin in a protocol in a patient immediately exposed to such a major spine surgery. The risk was great. Our family watched as Daddy bled from his wound, blood products were floating in his Foley bag, he had large collections of blood under his skin, his stomach swell like a pregnant women’s. He was even falsely diagnosed with cancer. It was sickening to watch. I was exhausted I couldn’t imagine how Daddy felt after all this was happening to him. The Daddy we grew up with died, we now learned to love a sick, fragile man, who we knew had a limited amount of time left with us. His wound was open, at one point you could see his spine rotting. The smell was horrifying. Watching helplessly as the man I loved for everything he was, slowly wasting away. After being in 4 hospitals, suffering many complications, finally he was released to go home the first week in December 2006. My heart broke, again and again. I heard my father’s cries; I listened as he shared his fears, worries, and his overwhelming desire to end his life because of the emotional and physical pain he was suffering. Oct 11, 2006 John Puente’s wish came true. My biggest fear was now a reality. Not only was my Dad gone, his death was preventable; his life meant nothing to the doctors whose actions caused his slow agonizing death. It wasn't fair. When I arrived at my parents everyone was gathered on him weeping. I held his lifeless body in my arms, still warm to touch, weighing only 118 pounds.  As the funeral director wheeled Daddy out I followed, Daddy laid there lifeless, covered with a thin white sheet. I knew he was dead but my heart refused to accept it, I asked that they uncover his face, he couldn’t breathe.

Houston, Texas USA ",https://www.facebook.com/will.moorehead?ref=ts&fref=ts,(713) 728-9266,," Better Off A Dead Man................ The final 14 months of my Daddy’s life August 7, 2006 Scheduled for a Lumbar Laminectomy at L2 thru L5: On a hot August morning we arrived at Renaissance Hospital in Houston, Texas at 7:00 am. Daddy said goodbye. We never dreamed our world would be turned upside down in the next 8 hours. Surgery went great, so we were told. Surgery was prolonged causing volume depletion, with significant blood loss. Postoperatively he suffered with respiratory failure, altered mental status, and required reintubation. His blood pressure dropped, heart rate went up, requiring two pressors for support, he developed some renal insufficiency, Along with paraplegia, for Daddy that was the most devastating of all. Dr. Lipsen was called for a consultation. He ordered Heparin to treat what he thought was a massive pulmonary embolism causing the hypotension and shock. [continued below]....
									
										..... Unstable and intubated Daddy developed an infection, had over 39 blood transfusions. He lost over 60 pounds in less than a month. Every 4 hours his blood levels were checked because of the heparin. After reviewing his results for myself, seeing the lab was warning the hospital that the PTT levels very high time after time and they didn’t stop the heparin until 8/19. Daddy was suffering, he was in terrible pain, limiting his pain medication because of his blood pressure. He became depressed and basically feared for his life, with good reason. The physician’s orders and nurses’ notes state a MRI was done on 8/14 and Dr. Moorehead received the results, he stated Daddy developed a hematoma and there was no evidence of a blood clot, which was the reason for the Heparin, however he failed to notify Daddy or my mother at the time. Expert witness’ all agree the deviation from the standard of care was using heparin in a protocol in a patient immediately exposed to such a major spine surgery. The risk was great. Our family watched as Daddy bled from his wound, blood products were floating in his Foley bag, he had large collections of blood under his skin, his stomach swell like a pregnant women’s. He was even falsely diagnosed with cancer. It was sickening to watch. I was exhausted I couldn’t imagine how Daddy felt after all this was happening to him. The Daddy we grew up with died, we now learned to love a sick, fragile man, who we knew had a limited amount of time left with us. His wound was open, at one point you could see his spine rotting. The smell was horrifying. Watching helplessly as the man I loved for everything he was, slowly wasting away. After being in 4 hospitals, suffering many complications, finally he was released to go home the first week in December 2006. My heart broke, again and again. I heard my father’s cries; I listened as he shared his fears, worries, and his overwhelming desire to end his life because of the emotional and physical pain he was suffering. Oct 11, 2006 John Puente’s wish came true. My biggest fear was now a reality. Not only was my Dad gone, his death was preventable; his life meant nothing to the doctors whose actions caused his slow agonizing death. It wasn't fair. When I arrived at my parents everyone was gathered on him weeping. I held his lifeless body in my arms, still warm to touch, weighing only 118 pounds.  As the funeral director wheeled Daddy out I followed, Daddy laid there lifeless, covered with a thin white sheet. I knew he was dead but my heart refused to accept it, I asked that they uncover his face, he couldn’t breathe. For 14 months I watched my protector, a loving hard working man turn into a fragile, sick human being. On this day Oct 11, 2007 as I laid in the fetal position on his hospital bed I felt a profound loss of security and confidence in the world. I felt sick, I wanted to die, and dying was so much easier than feeling this pain. I not only wanted my Daddy back I wanted him to be well again. I felt so helpless. Why, why my Daddy. It’s been seven years and I still find myself searching for answers.  How could this happen in America, how could Medical Board’s fail to protect patient’s from unethical doctors? I searched for answers and what I found was shocking, the stories of malpractice across the world were heart breaking. I wasn’t along, I slowly learned my way around the internet. JOHN PUENTE wasn’t the only one who suffered at hands of these doctor’s at this hospital. I continue to reach out sharing the tragic death of my Dad, I follow the doctors that treated him causing his complications that lead to his death. Hoping one day the Board will take the necessary actions in order to hold doctors accountable to a punishment that fits the crime.A former Beaumont physician and office manager have been charged with health care fraud violations in the Eastern District of Texas, announced U.S. Attorney John M.

Columbus, Ohio USA ",http://www.governor.ohio.gov/Contact/ContacttheGovernor.aspx,(614) 466-3555,," Governor Kasich has spent almost 4 years defending horrible practices, and frauds, at the Ohio State Medical Board - where the Board will put into public records that a woman MD did not 'deserve' a cast on a fracture because she was too 'seductive.'  Governor Kasich doesn't bother to read the crap, he just defends it - which is even stupider.   The Ohio Medical Board will spend 3 days of testimony, at huge legal expense to taxpayers, discussing a woman MD's 'dates,' because her patient care is above reproach.  They have to 'find' a case because the Medical Board suspended her license for hypothetical provisional that didn't pan out - because there is no due process in Ohio at the Medical Board - it's all for the Governor's 'pleasure.'  The Board wasted the time of a national psychiatric expert on this - for 3 days to discuss the sexual experiences of a woman MD to a salacious bunch of government employees - who got paid to question about a woman MD's sexual experiences. This was pertinent to her patient care?  This expert from NYC that told the Medical Board to stop this rot in 1995 - that case continues because Governor Kasich can't set priorities and standards.  It's for his 'pleasure.'   Mr. Whitehouse is gone, but the abuses continue - same old, same old.  Women MDs are the stats of bad MDs for the Ohio Board, even when they practice better than average Internal Medicine for Ohio, and have no patient complaints.  Someone has to be disciplined, so it has to be the woman who refused Dr. Nice?  That's a Medical Board case because his wife's family has money?  That's a personal choice, not a state issue.  But Governor Kasich, along with Dr. Nice, doesn't understand the difference - a personal refusal is not a state reportable & disciplinable event.  Nor is it a national event for reporting to the Physician Data Bank.   'Seductive' when begging for a cast, when she couldn't even comb her hair at the time?  Orthopedics in Ohio, and Governors, must imagine sex where there is none.  The woman MD didn't deserve a license because she wouldn't refer to Dr. Nice, go along with hip-and-knee orthopedics doing wrist fractures, or 'experimental' casts with no evidence that they work?  Who would?  Just because an immature orthopedic at University Hospitals wanted to try it for a publication paper - for his CV - the woman MD was supposed to do this experiment for his career or lose her medical license?  Who would go along with this except a 'talking head,' a robot, or a woman who has completely lost her moral compass = what the Medical Board of Ohio wants & rewards.    Deans of Medical Schools did not put women MDs through 4 years of Medical School in Ohio to be glorified prostitutes doing anything that the boys want, imagine, or lust for because guys do this - male MDs are not saints.  Or to say 'Yes' to the Governor and have a license at his 'pleasure.'  The Deans did not mean that women MDs would be glorified 'yes' nurses, or male 'escorts' on Rounds.  Governor Kasich apparently thinks, without consultation on this, that a Medical Board that wants this free-for-all is ok - what Ohio wants for 4 more years?  And that means that he's lost his professionalism, his sense of service, and the thought that medicine is a service profession, not a sex provider service for its Members & 'friends.'     Regarding one of the former Medical Board Members who made a mess in the 1990s: The Deans at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine had trouble with Carla O'Day MD, who Governor Celeste put on the Medical Board to go after her classmates - get back.  The reason - she played the 'Celeste card' through Medical School - skipping classes, flirting with male students when she was married (with 5 kids no less), and then she went after any classmate she remembered as disagreeing with her antics - taking licenses from 1990-3 that still aren't returned.  But Governor Kasich goes along like Governor Celester did, and there's been no review of these cases.  Every case that Carla O'Day MD voted on is suspicious for her 'getting back.'  Where's the common sense in this - letting a woman use the Medical Board for her revengagenda?   The Deans of Ohio Medical Schools did not ever think that a woman MD would have to say 'Yes' to sex for a medical license in 2013, be able to be complained about 'anonymously' or 'confidentially' (that's asking for sex for licenses), or that they would be disciplined for saying 'No' in regards to issues & choices about their own medical care.  You just can't do what every guy wants, even Governors.  Yet Anita Steinbergh DO is of the make and model where women did this, except that she was too mean ugly to be asked to do the stuff that other women have tried to say 'No' to - she just votes to take their licenses for personal choices that have nothing to do with patient care.   The woman MD is a threat to patients because she would try to intervene for them and prevent wrong care?  That a woman MD would say 'No' to stupid ideas, surgeries that don't work, jerks that want their egos massaged every minute of every day - is the stuff that women MDs are trained for - to be another point of view.  That a 'No' would be a reason to take a license for 'unknown mental illness,' is from the days when men would put women away for so-termed 'mental illness' so that they could marry again, or to collect the money. It's Victorian literature, to 'unknown mental illness' a career for a woman MD trying to keep a male MD from collecting an insurance fee, or billing, for an unneeded surgery or diagnosis.

Dr. Lipsen was called for a consultation. He ordered Heparin to treat what he thought was a massive pulmonary embolism causing the hypotension and shock. [continued below]....
									
										..... Unstable and intubated Daddy developed an infection, had over 39 blood transfusions. He lost over 60 pounds in less than a month. Every 4 hours his blood levels were checked because of the heparin. After reviewing his results for myself, seeing the lab was warning the hospital that the PTT levels very high time after time and they didn’t stop the heparin until 8/19. Daddy was suffering, he was in terrible pain, limiting his pain medication because of his blood pressure. He became depressed and basically feared for his life, with good reason. The physician’s orders and nurses’ notes state a MRI was done on 8/14 and Dr. Moorehead received the results, he stated Daddy developed a hematoma and there was no evidence of a blood clot, which was the reason for the Heparin, however he failed to notify Daddy or my mother at the time. Expert witness’ all agree the deviation from the standard of care was using heparin in a protocol in a patient immediately exposed to such a major spine surgery. The risk was great. Our family watched as Daddy bled from his wound, blood products were floating in his Foley bag, he had large collections of blood under his skin, his stomach swell like a pregnant women’s. He was even falsely diagnosed with cancer. It was sickening to watch. I was exhausted I couldn’t imagine how Daddy felt after all this was happening to him. The Daddy we grew up with died, we now learned to love a sick, fragile man, who we knew had a limited amount of time left with us. His wound was open, at one point you could see his spine rotting. The smell was horrifying. Watching helplessly as the man I loved for everything he was, slowly wasting away. After being in 4 hospitals, suffering many complications, finally he was released to go home the first week in December 2006. My heart broke, again and again. I heard my father’s cries; I listened as he shared his fears, worries, and his overwhelming desire to end his life because of the emotional and physical pain he was suffering. Oct 11, 2006 John Puente’s wish came true. My biggest fear was now a reality. Not only was my Dad gone, his death was preventable; his life meant nothing to the doctors whose actions caused his slow agonizing death. It wasn't fair. When I arrived at my parents everyone was gathered on him weeping. I held his lifeless body in my arms, still warm to touch, weighing only 118 pounds.  As the funeral director wheeled Daddy out I followed, Daddy laid there lifeless, covered with a thin white sheet. I knew he was dead but my heart refused to accept it, I asked that they uncover his face, he couldn’t breathe. For 14 months I watched my protector, a loving hard working man turn into a fragile, sick human being. On this day Oct 11, 2007 as I laid in the fetal position on his hospital bed I felt a profound loss of security and confidence in the world. I felt sick, I wanted to die, and dying was so much easier than feeling this pain. I not only wanted my Daddy back I wanted him to be well again. I felt so helpless. Why, why my Daddy. It’s been seven years and I still find myself searching for answers.  How could this happen in America, how could Medical Board’s fail to protect patient’s from unethical doctors? I searched for answers and what I found was shocking, the stories of malpractice across the world were heart breaking. I wasn’t along, I slowly learned my way around the internet. JOHN PUENTE wasn’t the only one who suffered at hands of these doctor’s at this hospital. I continue to reach out sharing the tragic death of my Dad, I follow the doctors that treated him causing his complications that lead to his death.

Columbus, Ohio USA ",http://www.governor.ohio.gov/Contact/ContacttheGovernor.aspx,(614) 466-3555,," Governor Kasich has spent almost 4 years defending horrible practices, and frauds, at the Ohio State Medical Board - where the Board will put into public records that a woman MD did not 'deserve' a cast on a fracture because she was too 'seductive.'  Governor Kasich doesn't bother to read the crap, he just defends it - which is even stupider.   The Ohio Medical Board will spend 3 days of testimony, at huge legal expense to taxpayers, discussing a woman MD's 'dates,' because her patient care is above reproach.  They have to 'find' a case because the Medical Board suspended her license for hypothetical provisional that didn't pan out - because there is no due process in Ohio at the Medical Board - it's all for the Governor's 'pleasure.'  The Board wasted the time of a national psychiatric expert on this - for 3 days to discuss the sexual experiences of a woman MD to a salacious bunch of government employees - who got paid to question about a woman MD's sexual experiences. This was pertinent to her patient care?  This expert from NYC that told the Medical Board to stop this rot in 1995 - that case continues because Governor Kasich can't set priorities and standards.  It's for his 'pleasure.'   Mr. Whitehouse is gone, but the abuses continue - same old, same old.  Women MDs are the stats of bad MDs for the Ohio Board, even when they practice better than average Internal Medicine for Ohio, and have no patient complaints.  Someone has to be disciplined, so it has to be the woman who refused Dr. Nice?  That's a Medical Board case because his wife's family has money?  That's a personal choice, not a state issue.  But Governor Kasich, along with Dr. Nice, doesn't understand the difference - a personal refusal is not a state reportable & disciplinable event.  Nor is it a national event for reporting to the Physician Data Bank.   'Seductive' when begging for a cast, when she couldn't even comb her hair at the time?  Orthopedics in Ohio, and Governors, must imagine sex where there is none.  The woman MD didn't deserve a license because she wouldn't refer to Dr. Nice, go along with hip-and-knee orthopedics doing wrist fractures, or 'experimental' casts with no evidence that they work?  Who would?  Just because an immature orthopedic at University Hospitals wanted to try it for a publication paper - for his CV - the woman MD was supposed to do this experiment for his career or lose her medical license?  Who would go along with this except a 'talking head,' a robot, or a woman who has completely lost her moral compass = what the Medical Board of Ohio wants & rewards.    Deans of Medical Schools did not put women MDs through 4 years of Medical School in Ohio to be glorified prostitutes doing anything that the boys want, imagine, or lust for because guys do this - male MDs are not saints.  Or to say 'Yes' to the Governor and have a license at his 'pleasure.'  The Deans did not mean that women MDs would be glorified 'yes' nurses, or male 'escorts' on Rounds.  Governor Kasich apparently thinks, without consultation on this, that a Medical Board that wants this free-for-all is ok - what Ohio wants for 4 more years?  And that means that he's lost his professionalism, his sense of service, and the thought that medicine is a service profession, not a sex provider service for its Members & 'friends.'     Regarding one of the former Medical Board Members who made a mess in the 1990s: The Deans at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine had trouble with Carla O'Day MD, who Governor Celeste put on the Medical Board to go after her classmates - get back.  The reason - she played the 'Celeste card' through Medical School - skipping classes, flirting with male students when she was married (with 5 kids no less), and then she went after any classmate she remembered as disagreeing with her antics - taking licenses from 1990-3 that still aren't returned.  But Governor Kasich goes along like Governor Celester did, and there's been no review of these cases.  Every case that Carla O'Day MD voted on is suspicious for her 'getting back.'  Where's the common sense in this - letting a woman use the Medical Board for her revengagenda?   The Deans of Ohio Medical Schools did not ever think that a woman MD would have to say 'Yes' to sex for a medical license in 2013, be able to be complained about 'anonymously' or 'confidentially' (that's asking for sex for licenses), or that they would be disciplined for saying 'No' in regards to issues & choices about their own medical care.  You just can't do what every guy wants, even Governors.  Yet Anita Steinbergh DO is of the make and model where women did this, except that she was too mean ugly to be asked to do the stuff that other women have tried to say 'No' to - she just votes to take their licenses for personal choices that have nothing to do with patient care.   The woman MD is a threat to patients because she would try to intervene for them and prevent wrong care?  That a woman MD would say 'No' to stupid ideas, surgeries that don't work, jerks that want their egos massaged every minute of every day - is the stuff that women MDs are trained for - to be another point of view.  That a 'No' would be a reason to take a license for 'unknown mental illness,' is from the days when men would put women away for so-termed 'mental illness' so that they could marry again, or to collect the money. It's Victorian literature, to 'unknown mental illness' a career for a woman MD trying to keep a male MD from collecting an insurance fee, or billing, for an unneeded surgery or diagnosis. This is like Roman Empire 'ridiculous,' from the days when the Roman Emperors would be gods.  Women MDs are licensed at Governor Kasich's pleasure?    The reason that women MDs got in to Medical Schools, in numbers starting in the 1970s, was that the Deans were tired of the boys being boys, but Governor Kasich isn't tired of it.  Women's rights had little to nothing to do with it - the men in power were tired of the abuses of colleague males and the stink of no showers, male hormones, and crude talk.  Governor Kasich wants people serving at this pleasure, like the male MDs want women colleagues 'at their pleasure' or no license.     The Governor has failed to put some order at the Medical Board (1)continuing to reappoint Members who have already been there too long - Anita Steinbergh DO, (2) not allowing external review of the hundreds of false cases from his predecessors, and (3) appointing a Board that is a joke as to being able to discipline for negligences, or even define standards of care.  Anything that a 'friend' of a Medical Board Member does is defended, complaints about 'friends' are never seen or investigated.   The Governor does not have a channel of external review of cases with no merit, no Executive Workforce that understands the problem, and he hangs up when women physicians call - he can't meet and discuss the problems with a woman MD for 5 minutes - but you can hear him laughing in the background.   Deans of Medical Schools did not expect that women MDs would have to have 'aequanimitas' for the trash talk, for the seductive suggestions, for the patient mistakes and errors that were just because the boys were being boys.  Dean of Students Ken Scott, at Case Medical School, told us to improve things in the late 70s and early 80s - that he couldn't change things alone without help from the women students.  Deans of Medical Schools put women students through in order to have another point of view, to say something about the horrors that go on in the name of 'medical care.'  It's time that Governor Kasich started to help out women MDs.  If Governor Kasich can talk to patrons at Bob Evans, he should be able to spar with a woman MD with a MENSA IQ.  Too high for him?   ",Doctors

Beverly Hills, California USA ",http://www.flyermd.com/,310-659-9950,," Sadly, Dr. Brian Flyer is scamming his patients.  He says he accepts inurance to get clients, but in reality he does not honor their benefits.  So he charges patients upfront, ignoring the fact that you are supposed to only have a co-pay and then only pays you back what your insurance pays you back.  That is not how the Dr- Insunrance company relationship works.  Physicians go into a contract with insurance companies and they agree upon a contract rate for each service.  So if Blue Cross tells Dr. Flyer they wll only pay $175 for your check up, that is supposed to be all they can charge. I was suposed to have a free yearly check up.  With a normal Dr. you wold pay your co pay (or nothing) and that would be it.  Not here.  They force you to pay upfront before leaving the office.  Then they bill the insurance whatever they want- say $600.  Of course they already know that your insurance is only going to pay them back the agreed upon amount.  So if the agreed upon amount is only $175, then that is what the insurance sends the Dr. for your visit.  So then Dr. Flyer's office only sends you that back and you are out the difference. They do not explain this to their clients.  They want it to go over your head.  Lynn, who works in the office never even sent the small amount to me either.  That's a whole other double dipping thing they have going on.   I had to file a complaint with my insurance company to get paid back.  Many people have come out against him to talk about what he is doing. Just a warning.  I hope the insurance companies drop him.  If he likes practicing medicine, he should practice ethics first and just stop accepting insurance.  Come on, play fair.   ",Doctors

If you want them to retrieve and copy your medical records no matter how long or short, whether the copy is electronic or not, regardless of your ability to pay and even if they are for another doctor they charge a $50 fee. They justify it by claiming it's legal and ""reasonable"".  They stated that $15 of the $50 charge was for retrieving the records which, I believe, is not legal under HIPAA.  They stated that California law allows them to charge up to 25 cents a page for a copy - but I believe that is paper copy only, and they charge that for even an electronic copy. I am an advocate and personal representative for a young person that has no income and cannot afford $50 for a copy of medical records. They were requested by another doctor and normally, I'd expect the records to be transferred to the other doctor as a professional courtesty.  But there is no courtesy here, professional or otherwise!

what Ohio wants for 4 more years?  And that means that he's lost his professionalism, his sense of service, and the thought that medicine is a service profession, not a sex provider service for its Members & 'friends.'     Regarding one of the former Medical Board Members who made a mess in the 1990s: The Deans at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine had trouble with Carla O'Day MD, who Governor Celeste put on the Medical Board to go after her classmates - get back.  The reason - she played the 'Celeste card' through Medical School - skipping classes, flirting with male students when she was married (with 5 kids no less), and then she went after any classmate she remembered as disagreeing with her antics - taking licenses from 1990-3 that still aren't returned.  But Governor Kasich goes along like Governor Celester did, and there's been no review of these cases.  Every case that Carla O'Day MD voted on is suspicious for her 'getting back.'  Where's the common sense in this - letting a woman use the Medical Board for her revengagenda?   The Deans of Ohio Medical Schools did not ever think that a woman MD would have to say 'Yes' to sex for a medical license in 2013, be able to be complained about 'anonymously' or 'confidentially' (that's asking for sex for licenses), or that they would be disciplined for saying 'No' in regards to issues & choices about their own medical care.  You just can't do what every guy wants, even Governors.  Yet Anita Steinbergh DO is of the make and model where women did this, except that she was too mean ugly to be asked to do the stuff that other women have tried to say 'No' to - she just votes to take their licenses for personal choices that have nothing to do with patient care.   The woman MD is a threat to patients because she would try to intervene for them and prevent wrong care?  That a woman MD would say 'No' to stupid ideas, surgeries that don't work, jerks that want their egos massaged every minute of every day - is the stuff that women MDs are trained for - to be another point of view.  That a 'No' would be a reason to take a license for 'unknown mental illness,' is from the days when men would put women away for so-termed 'mental illness' so that they could marry again, or to collect the money. It's Victorian literature, to 'unknown mental illness' a career for a woman MD trying to keep a male MD from collecting an insurance fee, or billing, for an unneeded surgery or diagnosis. This is like Roman Empire 'ridiculous,' from the days when the Roman Emperors would be gods.  Women MDs are licensed at Governor Kasich's pleasure?    The reason that women MDs got in to Medical Schools, in numbers starting in the 1970s, was that the Deans were tired of the boys being boys, but Governor Kasich isn't tired of it.  Women's rights had little to nothing to do with it - the men in power were tired of the abuses of colleague males and the stink of no showers, male hormones, and crude talk.  Governor Kasich wants people serving at this pleasure, like the male MDs want women colleagues 'at their pleasure' or no license.     The Governor has failed to put some order at the Medical Board (1)continuing to reappoint Members who have already been there too long - Anita Steinbergh DO, (2) not allowing external review of the hundreds of false cases from his predecessors, and (3) appointing a Board that is a joke as to being able to discipline for negligences, or even define standards of care.  Anything that a 'friend' of a Medical Board Member does is defended, complaints about 'friends' are never seen or investigated.   The Governor does not have a channel of external review of cases with no merit, no Executive Workforce that understands the problem, and he hangs up when women physicians call - he can't meet and discuss the problems with a woman MD for 5 minutes - but you can hear him laughing in the background.   Deans of Medical Schools did not expect that women MDs would have to have 'aequanimitas' for the trash talk, for the seductive suggestions, for the patient mistakes and errors that were just because the boys were being boys.  Dean of Students Ken Scott, at Case Medical School, told us to improve things in the late 70s and early 80s - that he couldn't change things alone without help from the women students.  Deans of Medical Schools put women students through in order to have another point of view, to say something about the horrors that go on in the name of 'medical care.'  It's time that Governor Kasich started to help out women MDs.  If Governor Kasich can talk to patrons at Bob Evans, he should be able to spar with a woman MD with a MENSA IQ.  Too high for him?   ",Doctors

Beverly Hills, California USA ",http://www.flyermd.com/,310-659-9950,," Sadly, Dr. Brian Flyer is scamming his patients.  He says he accepts inurance to get clients, but in reality he does not honor their benefits.  So he charges patients upfront, ignoring the fact that you are supposed to only have a co-pay and then only pays you back what your insurance pays you back.  That is not how the Dr- Insunrance company relationship works.  Physicians go into a contract with insurance companies and they agree upon a contract rate for each service.  So if Blue Cross tells Dr. Flyer they wll only pay $175 for your check up, that is supposed to be all they can charge. I was suposed to have a free yearly check up.  With a normal Dr. you wold pay your co pay (or nothing) and that would be it.  Not here.  They force you to pay upfront before leaving the office.  Then they bill the insurance whatever they want- say $600.  Of course they already know that your insurance is only going to pay them back the agreed upon amount.  So if the agreed upon amount is only $175, then that is what the insurance sends the Dr. for your visit.  So then Dr. Flyer's office only sends you that back and you are out the difference. They do not explain this to their clients.  They want it to go over your head.  Lynn, who works in the office never even sent the small amount to me either.  That's a whole other double dipping thing they have going on.   I had to file a complaint with my insurance company to get paid back.  Many people have come out against him to talk about what he is doing. Just a warning.  I hope the insurance companies drop him.  If he likes practicing medicine, he should practice ethics first and just stop accepting insurance.  Come on, play fair.   ",Doctors

Newberg, OR, Oregon USA ","Portland, OR 97213",(503) 963-3100,,"  My negative review of Dr. Joshua L. Johnson, MD - Oregon Providence He appears to have a poor reputation for providing lackluster care and attention to detail. I heard from another local doctor who warmed me about Dr. Joshua Johnson. Despite these warnings and reading some negative information online about Dr. Joshua L. Johnson I decided to schedule an appointment and see for myself if he was good or poor like people are saying. Turns out I made a mistake and should have saved my money and time for another Doctor who could actually help me instead of turning me away. Here is my opinion and review of Dr. Joshua L. Johnson, MD who practices out of Oregon through Providence. [continued below]....
									
										..... I don't want other innocent patients to have to go through what I did with Dr. Johnson. I was upfront with Dr. Johnson and said I didn't want to waste his time or mine if he wasn't fluent with my disease Autonomic Small Fiber Neuropathy. After talking with him briefly it became apparent he was just another generic neurologist with no specialized understanding of Autonomic Small Fiber Neuropathy. Furthermore, Dr. Joshua L. Johnson, MD asked what triggered my symptoms and I explained usually only after I consume neurotoxins such as MSG and aspartame. However, he acted totally oblivious to the fact that MSG and aspartame even exist. It was clear I knew much more than him regarding this subject and it seemed he felt somewhat inferior. What's more, we were briefly discussing my syringomyelia tumor in my spinal cord. I explained we've been doing yearly cervical MRI's to monitor the syrinx. My confidence level in him declined even further when he said ""why do you have to do a yearly MRI of your syrinx?"" I had to explain to him we do this yearly imaging to make sure the syrinx is stable and to confirm it is not growing. 99% of well educated nueros know if you have a syrinx it's prudent to monitor it yearly or bi-yearly to ensure it remains stable. It seems clear Dr. Joshua L. Johnson, MD who practices out of Providence in Oregon is lacking some basic understanding of Neurology and should perhaps go back to med school instead of wasting his patients time and money. That's my opinion. One of the primary issues I wanted to discuss was my bladder since it still has a major impact on my sleep. He rudely said ""I don't do bladders"". I then asked him for a referral to a urologist. He then declined to give me one. How rude is that? Shortly after our conversation about the bladder he threw his arms up and rudely said ""I CAN'T HELP YOU"". I then got up and left the room quietly. There are good doctors and bad doctors. It is my opinion Dr. Joshua L. Johnson, MD is a ""BAD"" one.  I don't want other well educated people in need of quality health care wasting their time and making the same mistake myself and others have made.

Kenner, Louisiana USA ",,504-471-2750,," The doctor I see is at LSU Family Medicine.  Recently my insurance ran out.  LSU Family Medicine works in the fashion that if you don't have insurance office visit is $30 and additional services are on a ""sliding scale"" based upon your income.  When I started seeing a doctor there I had insurance.  I made an appointment and they asked if I had insurance.  I let them know that my insurance ran out.  I was told to bring proof of income and that the office visit fee is $30.I forgot to bring my last check stub.  The patient in front of me was denied service because he didn't bring his proof of income.  They offered to reschedule his appointment.  I figured I must have missed part of the conversation.  To me, refusing service just because a person doesn't have proof of income is one of the most asinine things I've ever heard of.  I was up next.I told the representative that I had an appointment.  He asked if I had insurance.  I informed him that my insurance had ran out at the end of the month.  He then asked if I had proof of my income.  I stated that I had forgotten it at home.  He then stated that I would have to provide proof of income before they could see me.  I responded that I could pay the $30 office visit.  This didn’t matter.  If you don't have insurance they require proof of income before they will see you.I then asked if they knew of any programs where I could get insulin at a discounted rate or for free.  I explained that I'm on two different insulin medications and one of them out of pocket is $182.  One vial only lasts a month.  He goes to the back and then comes back.  He informs me that I would have to talk to the doctor about that and for that requires proof of income.  In other words LSU Family Medicine will not assist in any way shape or form without insurance or proof of income.I did reschedule the appointment for tomorrow.  I asked how many pay stubs I needed to bring in.  I didn't want to bring just one and then get denied service yet again.  I was told to bring in the last two check stubs.I will be writing to Oschsner in regards to their policy of refusing service for lack of proof of income especially when they are not notifying patients of their asinine policy prior to the office visit.

In 1999-2000 the Sutter County District Attorneys Office violated a ""Warning"" on a official NCIS document by illegally disseminating it. It was used to spread false allegations about my Honorable Marine Corp and Gulf War service. The document was then used in an attempt to blackmail me. I had some problems due to serving in the Gulf War and had tried to get treatment many times from the Veterans Administration just like many other veterans that returned ill. But the VA and other government agencies would not admit to our exposures during the Gulf War and attempted to cover them up. There has been Congressional Investigations, Journalist Investigations/Reports and several books written and studies done about what has become known as Gulf War Illness. [continued below]....
									
										..... The best information can be found in a book entitled; Gassed in the Gulf: The Inside Story of the Pentagon Coverup of Gulf War Syndrome By former CIA Analyist Patrick Eddington. Some of the best research has been done by Dr Robert Haley UT Southwestern at Dallas. Patrick's book and Dr. Haley's research has overhelming proven that the government did lie and try to coverup the exposures from the Gulf War and the veterans illnesses commonly known as Gulf War Illness. Because the government wouldn't admit to my exposures and give me proper treatment I turned to self-medication and made some mistakes. I ended up in the Sutter County legal system and wanted the jury to hear my testimony about how I got there and I wanted them to hear about the way the District Attorneys Office illegally disseminated an official military document and how they used it to spread false allegations and made an attempt to blackmail me with it. Dr. Brennan at the time was claiming to be an expert in PTSD and Gulf War Syndrome so she was hired to do an evaluation and help prepare a defense. Issues that veterans have had because of their wartime service have been used countless times as successful defenses in court. I questioned her about research on Gulf War Syndrome and the top researchers but she couldn't name one. When she did her evaluation I presented her with a lot of evidence and documentation to prove to her that what I was telling her was true. Also gave her names and phone numbers of people that she could contact to verify my information but she made no attempt to verify any of it and paid no attention to my documents. I am not going to go through the whole report because of time and all the documents I would have to post. ( Please do a search on Gulf War Illness or the Coverup of Gulf War illness to verify me story on that. I told her about how the Sutter County District Attorney Carls Adams and his office had illegally disseminated the official military document NCIS Report), used it to spread false allegations and attempted to blackmail me with it. I showed her the document. Instead of writing a report about the way that the DA illegally used the NCIS report and giving be a proper diagnoses  that would help created a good defense she wrote out a report that said I was delusional and help cover for the DA illegally using the NCIS Report. Some of her report-"" I was simple surprised that Napa saw this man as a typical vet with Gulf War Syndrome and could not see that his paranoia went far beyond government cover-up of the disease ( which is pretty typical of the veteran community.) Another example-""the rampant corruption of the Sutter County legal system that will prevent him from receiving a fair trial and their attempts to railroad him into a plea deal."" I saw several doctors at Napa and several evaluations done that indicated I wasn't delusional so she was putting her opinion up against a state hospital and doctors that had many more years of experience. The hospital diagnosed me with Gulf War Illness and since this time the Veterans Administration has diagnosed me with PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury. Remember and check for yourself she has claimed to be an expert in PTSD and GWI. If she was such an expert she would have properly diagnosed me. If she was ethical she would have wrote a report on how the DA illegally disseminated the NCIS Report and reported what they did was wrong. I told her the Sutter County District Attorney Carl Adams and the Sutter County System was corrupt but at the time she wouldn't listen nor would others. But now I have the evidence-""Sutter County DA Carl Adams under investigation in connection with arson"". Carl Adams was having an affair with a former witness and prostitute Sarah Garibay. Not only was he having an affair with her he lied to investigators about it. If this is not corrupt then what is? ",Doctors

Las Vegas, Nevada USA ",Kozmary.com,702-380-3210,,"  I am a 52 year old widow and have been seeing Dr. Kozmary for 17 years, the last 10 or so with his PA Kristin who is wonderful.  For all these years I have gone to him each month for my prescriptions as there is really nothing to be done with what I suffer from except to ease the pain.  While my husband was alive he was also a patient for about 5 years.  So for 17 years I have been taking urine tests, 17 years of clean urine tests until . . . Earlier this year my urine test said that I was using methanphetamines!  I said it was absolutely wrong and ridiculous and quite frankly humerous if you knew me.  A couple of months later Kristin asked if I wanted to get the back shots again since my Medicare Advantage Insurance would now cover them, I said no as they really didn't do anything for me the time that I had them and that I no longer had someone to take and pick me up.  Fast forward to October 8, 2013 when I opened my mail and received a ""Letter of Discharge from Practice"" re: inconclusive urine test! The letter goes on to tell me that I should ""place myself in a drug rehab program promptly as well as find another physician promptly""!  I was beyond offended to say the least.  It follows with what to expect if I do not get another pain doctor, what my withdrawal symptoms will be from the meds he has prescribed me for 17 years!  I had just had my monthly visit with him on October 5th, he couldn't have talked to me about it then? Of course I immediately called the office and wanted to talk to him and/or Kristin because I knew that there was nothing in or out of my urine that should/shouldn't have been there ~ I KNEW!  Only the office manager would talk to me but wouldn't tell me anything but I was welcome to come to the office and look at my file.  I said that the results were wrong and that I wanted to be re-tested any day and any time Kozmary wanted, all he had to do is call me whenever I would take a urine, blood and or hair test, whatever test he wanted but that the test he is relying on is faulty, NO!  Could I write an affidavit for my file stating that I disagreed with the findings, NO!  Will he take it out of the file, NO!  Will he call and talk to me, NO!  I have been seeing him for 17 years and all of a sudden I am cut off and left adrift. I stated that I belive the law says that he must give me a full 30 days of medication and that I was there on the 5th, therefore I needed another month's supply of medication to give me time to get a referral and find a new pain doctor (with a faulty urine test in my permanent record this was not going to be easy) and to make an appointment in 3 weeks, it was nearly impossible to do.  NO!  I am no longer his patient therefore he will not re-test me, he will not prescribe another month's worth of medication and when I asked if he could refer me to another doctor I got another big NO! I wrote numerous e-mails pleading to be re-tested, stating that isn't it more likely that an overworked and underpaid lab worker made a mistake than it is that I all of a sudden at my age decided to use illegal drugs?  His snail mail reply to all my e-mails was that they use ""independent labs"" which I have found out by researching that this just isn't true.  I said that they are accusing me of a crime and I don't have any recourse?  No one would talk to me, no one. Today I called and asked for ""records"" and she must be new because I asked her to fax me my most recent urine test results and the one from earlier this year that said I had meth in my system.  I got 13 pages, most of them nothing but the most recent one was for a 58 year old in Texas with a Texas doctor and were for hepatitis.  The one from earlier in the year said nothing about anything that shouldn't have been there, everything was negative.  According to these tests he had no basis to discharge me from his practice. I can not stress enough how offensive, appalling, disappointing, maddening, sad and so, so stressful this is and has been. Would you not think that a doctor, especially one you have been seeing on a monthly basis for 17 years would, if he truly believed I was abusing illegal drugs sit me down at my appointment (which I remind you I was just there 3 days before the discharge and was scheduled again for Oct. 31st) and discuss his concerns?  To talk to me and ask me? And if I was using illegal drugs and he was concerned (which he should be as a doctor) wouldn't you think he would talk to me about options, my health etc. . ?  It is beyond my conprehension that any doctor but especially one who has been prescribing me narcotics for 17 years would without any discussion with me about his concerns would assume that I need re-hab and then just cut me adrift!  Everyone knows how long it takes to get into a doctor's, espeically a specialist and I had 3 weeks to do this with no assistance from Kozmary before I went into severe withdrawals that he so kindly warned me about in his letter!  It's beyond dumbfounding, and it just can't be up to a medical board's standard of care. I have a theory by doing a little web research.  I found that Kozmary was fined 1 million dollars in 2011 for ripping off medicare, medicaid and tricare(?) all federal insurance providers.  In the settlement he stated that they did have enough evidence, hence the settlement.  So, I think he is getting rid off all his patients on these programs (me included) because he can no longer over bill or bill them for services not performed.  I don't know, it's just my theory but I hope to find out because this behavior can not go un-noticed or un-punished.  He is leaving people in dire straights.  The bottom line is that he is not to be trusted.  If what I have been reading from numerous sources is true and that he is doing the urine testing in house and profitting from it there has to be a conflict of interest in that alone.  He discharges you on unfounded claims, will not talk to or respond to you and leaves you hanging with absolutely no assistance except a toll free number to find a rehab program! It is beyond a disgrace and I can not stress enough what this feels like. to literally be accused of doing something but not told what, to know that whatever that something is is going to be in your permanent record and to have zero recourse.  And of course the worry about finding a new doctor, having enough medication and the fear of going through complete withdrawals from meds you have been taking for years, it's terrifying.  He is a doctor, this is not supposed to happen, he is supposed to help heal not cause pain, stress, withdrawals etc. . . Do not visit this doctor, if he can do this to a patient after 17 years he will do it to you too, unless of course, he is able to make a lot of money off of you.  Patient beware. ",Doctors

Doctor continued to write prescriptions after surrender of his DEA registration  allowing him to prescribe controlled substances OCTOBER 25th, 2013 (PISCAYUNE,  MS) A Piscayune doctor was arrested  this morning pursuant to a complaint charging him in federal court in Mississippi with distribution of oxycodone, a highly-addictive prescription medicine  used to treat severe pain. Dr. Ivonne Del Carmen Fernandez is scheduled to be arraigned this  afternoon before United States Magistrate Judge Gary R. Brown at the U.S.  Courthouse. The charges were announced by Loretta E.  Lynch, United States Attorney; Brian R.  Crowell, Special Agent in Charge, Drug Enforcement Administration, New York;  Thomas V. Dale, Commissioner, Nassau County Police Department; and Joseph A.  D’Amico, Superintendent of the New York State Police.  This morning, as part of a federal and state prescription  drug abuse initiative within Mississippi, Fernandez was  arrested by members of a DEA Tactical Diversion Squad, comprised of DEA agents,  Nassau County Police Department detectives and the New York State Police  Investigators, on charges of illegally distributing oxycodone between January  1, 2012 and October 15, 2013. According to the complaint, during the first nine  months of 2012, Fernandez issued 2,953 oxycodone prescriptions – 376,469 pills –  to numerous individuals, without performing any meaningful medical examination  and in exchange for cash. In some cases, Fernandez issued the prescriptions  without even meeting the purported patients. On February 6, 2013, when members  of the DEA Tactical Diversion Squad contacted Fernanez, he voluntarily  surrendered his DEA registration authorizing him to prescribe controlled  substances. However, the complaint alleges that three weeks later, on February  28, 2013, Fernandez nevertheless issued a prescription for oxycodone. On March 13,  2013, a pharmacist, in the presence of DEA agents, called Fernandez about the  prescription. During the call, Fernandez confirmed that he had issued the  prescription and provided his surrendered DEA registration number, all in an  effort to persuade the pharmacist to fill the oxycodone prescription. “Instead of abiding by the charge to ‘do no harm,’  Fernandez allegedly operated under the credo ‘where’s the money,’ placing profits  above patient safety,” stated United States Attorney Lynch. “When doctors  participate in the diversion of addictive prescription drugs from their  intended use they fuel drug abuse and addiction. We are committed to vigorous  prosecution of this growing problem.” Ms. Fernandez expressed her grateful  appreciation to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Nassau County Police  Department and the New York State Police for their assistance in this  investigation. DEA Special Agent in Charge Brian R. Crowell stated,  “Illegal prescribing is the white collar money making crime of the decade. We  allege Dr. Fernandez, with no regard to public safety, abused his position as a  licensed doctor by prescribing pain medications to people with no legitimate  medical need in exchange for cash. It is estimated that Dr. Ivonne D Fernandez wrote  prescriptions for over 9,000 pills of oxycodone per week affecting the  availability of diverted medications in our community and on our streets. Over  26% of first time drug users began with non-medical use of prescription drugs  and it is law enforcement’s concerted efforts to thwart both the supply and the  demand.” Superintendent of the New York State Police Joseph A.  D’Amico stated, ""Oxycodone is a highly addictive, often abused  medication.  It is unconscionable for a medical doctor to put nearly  400,000 doses of this drug out on the streets, knowing that it was going  to be abused.  I thank the members of the Drug Enforcement Administration  and the Nassau County Police Department for once again partnering with the New  York State Police to put a stop to this diversion of pain  medication."" Nassau County Police Commissioner Dale stated,  “Addiction to prescription opiates is a burgeoning problem here.  In Nassau County, overdoses from these types of medications almost double that  of overdoses from heroin. Our partnership in the DEA Tactical Diversion Squad and  with the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York ensures  that law enforcement is doing their part to keep these illegally prescribed  drugs out of our communities.” If convicted, the defendant faces a maximum sentence  of 20 years’ imprisonment and a $1 million fine. The charges are merely  allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven  guilty. In January 2012, the United States Attorney’s Office  for the Eastern District of New York and the DEA, in conjunction with the five  District Attorneys in this jurisdiction, the Nassau and Suffolk County Police  Departments, the New York City Police Department and New York State Police,  along with other key federal, state and local government partners, launched the  Prescription Drug Initiative to mount a comprehensive response to what the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services’ Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention has called an epidemic increase in the abuse of so-called opioid  analgesics. So far, the Prescription Drug Initiative has brought over 120  federal and local criminal prosecutions, taken civil enforcement action against  a pharmacy, removed prescription authority from numerous rogue doctors, and  expanded information-sharing among enforcement agencies to better target and  pursue drug traffickers. The Initiative also is involved in an extensive  community outreach program to address the abuse of pharmaceuticals. The government’s case is being prosecuted by Assistant  United States Attorney Allen L. Bode. The Defendant:    Name: IVONNE D FERNANDEZ    Age: 33 ",Doctors

Finally he walked into the room, I went to say hello an how glad I was to finally meet him, instead, he raise his hand and motioned to me to shut me up and I was then told “I am the Doctor, you will not speak, I will ask the questions and you will answer them, with either a yes or a no. Here I think I’m going to get help and instead he belittles both me and my father to our faces. He told me the “Shoemaker Protocol” was the cure to my illness, and that I should be grateful that he had an opening to see me. At this point I tried to say thank you and he stopped me from talking again, I began to cry, my father got mad. I blurted out what did all these tests they gave me mean, he told me that I did not need to know, as the tests were important to only him, and I couldn’t understand them any way so it would just be a waste of this time. He did not spend more than 7 minutes with me. The nurse brought in some papers and gave me a prescription for “Cholestyramine”. I filled my prescription began to take the medication and got even sicker. I stopped taking it and went to another Dr. for help. This is the most arrogant human being I have ever met.

As soon as I started seeing him and explained my situation he accepted me as a patient. I saw him for the initial visit and he treated me ok but each subsequent visit his attitude changed. He preceded to do urine drug screens on me every visit. My insurance stopped paying for these screenings after a couple of them. When I complained to Dr. Harper that I was running up quite a tab with my insurance carrier he simply stated that he was going to continue to screen me as long as he gave me pain meds. Needless to say $3000 dollars later I am looking for a new PCM. He was rude, uncaring and I felt that he was prejudiced against pain sufferers in pain management. I've never been a drug seeker and never will be and to be treated that way by a man that I had respected and had always treated me well was very disappointing. I would never, ever recommend him to anyone looking for a compassionate ear or for that matter a professional physician. He greatly disappointed me with his horrible attitude.

My palm was black and blue. i was obviously very seriously injured. And the paid was even worse than what I was suffering with for so long. At this point, I will wake up screaming in pain. Sometimes I cant sleep at all because the pain is so bad.

As I was a patient with him, his offices started to expand I and I saw less and less of him. Instead it would be a PA or he would pop in for about five minuets. I had a sweating problem and he recommended Botox for my armpits. I did the treatment twice, but the second time I had it done, they committed billing fraud when they balanced billed me for the services when my insurance company denied the claim. It gets worse; they not only balance billed me but they sent it straight to collections without first sending me a bill. They claim they sent TWO bills but I never received them. Furthermore, Dr. Bobby Buka’s Office claimed the reason why my insurance had denied this pre-authorized procedure was because I had failed to submit a questionnaire to my insurance company.  I called my insurance company in a panic, as I was a student at the time with this near $2,000 collections notice in hand. My insurance company told me that the reason why it was denied was because the DOCTOR (Bobby Buka) had failed to submit procedural documents about the needle, how far it went in, etc. One of the reasons why this may have been looked over was because the procedure was not done by my Dr. but by his PA. To top that off my insurance company told me they were illegally balance billing me when the explanation of benefits CLREARLY said that my patient responsibility, even though it was denied, was zero dollars. When I called the office to relay this information they completely wrote if off and said I was lying and that my insurance company wouldn’t have said any of that. After a few weeks of failed attempts to contact their billing department, which by the way is only available via email, I threatened legal action and I was put in contact with the manager who was not helpful in the beginning. After about a week she agreed to contact my insurance company and talk to them. She, by the way he name is Sadie, never apologized nor admitted fault, still saying that this was the result of something I had failed to do. Shortly after this, she did say that my insurance company was ACTUALLY the one to blame (no apology). I told her to take me out of collections, as I wasn’t responsible for this debt, and about a week later she said that she had. I called the collections company to verify this and they told me that I was on hold but not out of collections. Only after I threatened legal action AGAIN, did they then completely take me out of collections. Skip ahead six to eight months. I made an appointment for a regular check up, as my mother had melanoma, and went into the office where I was initially told that I owed the balance that they has sent to collections. I knew that my insurance company had paid this so I said to check again and she found where I only owed a copay from it, which I was expecting even though they (admittingly) have yet to send a bill for this (my insurance company paid this in May and it is now October). I was told before the procedure that I could go on a payment plan as I was a student and didn’t have a sufficient source of income yet. This same receptionist then told me I had to pay the balance in full before I could be seen. I asked to speak to a manager and he told me that I had to pay half of it before I could be seen. I had anticipated needing to make a payment not all or even half. Again, I am a student and live paycheck to paycheck. I tried to tell him what had happened to me, but he was unyielding and unsympathetic. He told me I was not sent to collections for the full about, which I have the collections notice to prove it. He also told me that they had only sent me ONE bill prior to sending it to collections when previously I was told they send TWO bills before they send to collections. Again, I never received a bill for this but I did receive a bill for an unrelated office visit the same week I got the collections notice. I paid the $35 office visit that was on my account and said I can make a payment of about $50 towards the balance but that’s all I had in my account and couldn’t pay half of the balance. He took none of the past events into consideration, and as he swiped my debit card for the $35 he said you do know that this won’t allow you to be seen today right? I was partially in tears at this point. I left the office not getting seen.  It has been over a week since this. I have called the GM Sadie about five times. All but one of these times I was given an excuse that she was out or in a meeting or out all day ONLY after being put on hold for about 5 min each time (enough time for her to get tipped off). One of the times I was mistakenly sent straight through to her and she said, “Oh yes, Jonathan Kirkland. Give me a min.” From here she put me on hold and the call was cut after I was on hold close to 10 min. I called straight back and was told again that she was in a meeting after another 5 min hold. I’m done, they should be reported to the NY Board of Health for billing fraud, which I intend to do.  ",Doctors

Rancho Cucamonga, California USA ",inlandcosmetic.com,9099870899,,"  I went to Dr jacob haiavy last year for a simple scar revision/breast reduction. Paid him $8,650 plus $559.77 from my ins for removing a cyst and a foreign object. He knew from the start that my skin was thinner under my breasts but yet didnt offer any re-enforcement until they bottomed out again, then told me for another $6,000 he could go back in and ""fix"" them with ""Stratice"" which is pigs skin. Turned into a horrible nightmare, I'm now faced with widning scars under both breasts because of all the steriods he injected into the known thinning area of my breasts. My implants are at risk for coming through my skin. I told him I had bad reaction to dissolvable stitches and he still used them. He said he would only do a cresent lift on my left nipple because of previous surgeries he didnt want to compromise blood flow, I woke up and found he had cut completely around both nipples and days latter when the gauze came off, I had lost the whole outter part of my left nipple. Nothing but a deep hole in which I had to scrub everyday in the shower so I wouldnt lose the whole nipple. Omg I almost passed out many times in the shower from the pain of scrubbing my nipple and having to make it bleed =*[ I now have nothing but scar tissue in that area and no feeling at all. He offered to go back in and ""work"" with me, Ummmm NO thanks!! This has affected my life dramaticly, I don't have a social life, I will not have relations with any man. I am depressed, stressed, suffer from anxiety and post tramatic stress disorder. My life is hell now and I have no money for the repairs ($17,000) and can't find an atty to take my case because apperantely since it's ""cosmetic"" we deserve what happens to us!

I was referred to the child study team by my guidance counselor after ending up inpatient for a week, and they referred me to ""Doctor"" Jacobs. I'd only seen him twice; as I was fourteen and then fifteen during these appointments, my mother was in the room, and she bore witness to Dr. Jacobs pretty much telling me to confront my sexual harassment and intrusive thoughts by...get ready for it, having sex. Dr. Jacobs also prescribed me 300mg of Zoloft, when the FDA approved maximum dosage is 200mg for the maintenence of OCD. I entered a cycle of sexually abusive relationships during high school (the first one actually started in between my appointments with Dr. Jacobs, who insisted on seeing me every six months despite the fact I was clearly acutely ill). I ended up blaming myself for being ""stupid"" enough to go to Dr. Jacobs twice, even though my mother and I both agreed after the second appointment that I should probably seek help elsewhere. I'm 21 years old now, and I have more than just OCD these days, and I'm guessing it didn't really help that the first psychiatrist I ever saw apparently has been raking in money with disproven freudian theory since (at least) the 1970s. And before I get any rebuttals: no, we never filed a police report or malpractice suit, purely because of the way police have reacted when they are called to my house because I was displaying suicidal behavior, starting when I was 15. I'm not fond of dealing with them. I have a treatment team that actually know what they're doing and accept my medicaid, and we actually discussed my experience with Dr. Jacobs in a session recently. I thought to google his name to see if I just got 'lucky' getting stuck with this guy for two sessions, and found this monstrosity of consumer complaints.

I have several medical conditions, one being diabetic, high blood pressure, and general anxiety disorder. Upon my first visit they did everything perfect, checked my blood sugar, etc. My second visit I asked that my blood sugar be tested, it never was, the doctor came in and refilled my prescriptions and said goodbye, spent maybe 4 minutes with me. After that about a week later Maria the nurse called and stated that I needed to see a physiatrist for an evaluation that needed to go into their file once a year to continue to fill my meds, she said she would set up a place for me that would be free of charge, I finally got the information, called the place and they said they didn't do what the dr was asking for, so I called Maria back and told her and she said you could go downtown at 7 am and stand in line a take a number but before doing that she would call the other place for me and find out the problem, week went by and I heard nothing, so I called Maria back she said she forgot but would call them for sure and get back to me, she never did. I then had an injury that put me in the hospital for a week, and after getting out I made an appointment the next business day (Monday) and went in the hospital gave them a sheet with the meds to keep me on and ones to take me off of, seems the Hydrochlorothizide I had been taking for years caused my body to stop producing potassium and mine was bottomed out. So once again I asked to have my blood sugar tested and they once again forgot to do it, met with the doctor told him about the accident at work and gave him the hospital paperwork, and he wrote out prescriptions and emailed them to Walmart, never said a word about seeing the physiatrist, nor did he the second visit he had the nurse do it over the phone a week later. During this last visit he never said anything about changing my meds or dosages other than what the hospital letter contained about the hydrochlorathizide. So I get to Walmart after the doctor office closed pick up med medication only to find out he cut my anxiety medication by 1/3 without even discussing it with me, which according to the journal of medicine and all articles I read said this could cause serious harm to me. I had stopped smoking for three months and now pack to a pack a day. I went back to the doctors office the next day to ask him why he had done this and why he had done this without discussing it with me at least. The lady at the front desk said well if you want to talk to him it will cost you another $50 office visit, I told her I was just there the day before and I wasn't there to visit he needed to come out and explain his actions to me, so she went and got another lady (the office manager) and she said he would not talk to me, that he cut it down because I had not gone to see a physiatrist yet to get a paper to put in his file, which was his employees fault not mine, and he should have discussed this with me during my office visit the day before if there was an issue. They said he was not going to talk to me and there was nothing I could do, but get the letter and see him next month, leaving me short of my medication I have been on for 8 years. So today I went back to the hospital and located the doctor that treated me there as he was really great and wish he had his own private practice. I told him what had taken place, and he agreed that the doctor was wrong in cutting the dosage by that much at one time that it could cause me problems, serious problems, and that the physiatrist letter he was requested is not law or mandatory, just some doctors are scared and want to cover their butts, but that he should have discussed it with me himself instead of saying nothing, and he definitely should not have cut the dosage by that large of amount. He referred me to three other doctors that he said would take good professional care of me. do yourself a favor STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!! ",Doctors

Not only did Dr. Paull question whether I actually HAD cystic fibrosis, he utterly ignored my comments regarding my specific genetic mutations and family history of the disease. He treated me as if I was lying to him about having been diagnosed with this disease and wanted my medical records to prove my diagnoses. He asked me questions about my disease that were on par with asking a 15 year old genetic questions from high school biology (I honestly question his medical credentials). I am 28 years old and I have a PhD in a science field. I am VERY well-versed in the causes, treatment and manifestation of my cystic fibrosis as well as the latest clinical research in the field. I was offended, upset, and left my appointment in tears because he was so disrespectful and condescending to me. The medical profession is a service field. I expect my doctors to listen to me when I discuss my symptoms, rather than interrupting me and telling me to be quiet, as well as believe that I am not lying about having a quite awful genetic disease that I wouldn't wish upon anyone. If you have cystic fibrosis, please consider seeing another allergist because Dr. Paull is simply disrespectful and high on his own ego. ",Doctors
Olathe Medical Center,"  Olathe Medical Center  20375 West 151st Street Suite 251 
Olathe, Kansas USA ",,913-393-5359,," On 03/08/2013, I had lab work done through Olathe Medical Center's Internal Medicine; the doctor was Jessica Gillespie Gephards, and she and the office are approved through Humana's in network program--my insurance provider. Since they are an in-network provider, the co-pay for this service is $10. They billed Humana Choice PPO for $249, they paid $156.01, and the total approved amount is $166.01; therefore, the difference is my co-pay for $10. According to Mary at Humana, a rep that I spoke with on 08/22/2013 at 2:00pm, they should not be billing me for any additional amounts. I received a phone call from RSH (RFH?) and Associates on 08/22/2013; the person I spoke to was Bill Shears. They initially left a message on my call notes stating they were attempting to collect a debt in my name, which is not legal for a 3rd party collection agency to divulge on a machine--anyone could retrieve the message. I called Bill Shears back, and he states that I owe the remainder amount that Humana Choice PPO failed to pay--approximately $82.99 which is the difference between the original billed amount and Humana's approved pay outs for their in-network providers. I advised him that my insurance is responsible for the amount, and all I owe is the $10 co-pay; obviously they and Olathe Medical's billing office have made a billing error. I also explained the in-network agreement, and I stated it was atypical to place an account for collection within 5 months of the debt (I used to work as a Credit Manager in underwriting), but also for the original account holder not to notify me in writing stating that I owed an additional amount, and  that it was going to be placed for collection if not paid within x number of days. I told him not to call me again, since I do not owe the bill, and he began to argue with me advising me that I owed the amount; moreover, he stated ""why would Olathe Medical send them this as a collection item if I really didn't owe it""?  I finally terminated the phone call. I didn't want to argue with him, and his question seemed highly redundant considering I already told him what Humana was worked out with their in-network providers. You would think that RSH and Associates would immediately place a call to Olathe Medical's billing department rather than to continue to argue with a person who obviously is not going to pay. What a collossal waste of time and resources. In the meantime, I called Humana Choice PPO back, and they did a three-way call with Olathe Medical's billing department. We spoke to a person named Cassie--a supervisor--and she advised that she could not research the problem today, because their computer system was down. Mary at Humana advised me to Humana back on Monday if the problem still had not been resolved (I would imagine Human would consider this to be insurance fraud and would want to began an investigation if it was not cleared up promptly). In the meantime, I decided to file a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau complaint against RSH and Associates, and an Attorney General and BBB report against both Olathe Medical and RSH and Associates for erroneous billing and harrassment. Since I didn't RSH and Associates physical address, I had to call them back. Once again, I spoke with Bill Shears. It took me almost five minutes to get their address from him, since he kept arguing with me and talking over me, and I finally had to request to speak to their on-site operations manager before he forked over the complete address. When he transferred me, I spoke to someone who claimed to be the director--Nick Carraway--and he was equally as rude and obnoxious. He kept talking over me, kept arguing with me, and even went as far to tell me that I wasn't even in their computer system. Why then was Bill Shears attempting to collect this debt from me, telling me I owed almost $90, if they did not even have me in the system? I'm guessing this wasn't even a director that I was speaking with. More likely, Bill probably transferred me to one of his collection cohorts to keep himself out of trouble. I can't imagine any director of a collection agency would handle a person like I was handled, speaking over me, not letting me talk, and yelling at me when apparently he couldn't even find me in their system. If you have also had a problem with RSH and Associates or Olathe Medical Center, please file complaints with the Comsumer Financial Protection Bureau (collection agency only), your Attorney General, and the BBB. Refer to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act before filing a complaint, since not all collection calls apply. In addition, there is another complaint against Olathe Medical Center on Rip Off Report. Apparently they have a pattern of sending accounts off for collection that are not owed.     ",Doctors

Konene & Assoc,"  Konene & Assoc  3600 Gaston Ave #360 
dallas, Texas USA ",,214 820-7246,,"  I have been a patient of Baylor Center for Pain mgt since 2011 (formerly Pinacle pain mgt of dallas). I had one visit with Dr brian Flanagan who never put a finger on me to check my ROM or pain level using oswestry scales prior to scheduling a series of epidural steroid injections.  The injections were done at 3 different facilities, and I never had any relief from the pain.  My injury is not facet, disc or joint pain, and the theory was that most likely these would not have any relief anyhow. After the initial “exam” with Dr Flanagan, he never physically visited with me again. Each month I visited with his FNP Sarah.  Although I did like her, she basically had my prescription completed and waiting on me when I walked in the exam room. I knew that the ESI series is typically 3, so I never really questioned that. Never did anyone ever examine me nor did they change or offer to change medications or treatments until all 3 ESI’s were complete. Also, each time I went in, my prescription, although completed by Sarah, was signed by Dr Konen or Dr Flanagan. (I still have never even seen Konen) A year later, and there was still no change in my treatment, and pain was increasing.  A family member and myself demanded to speak to Dr Flanagan. Again he didn’t do any examination, only decided I needed a spinal stimulator. Again, I comply. After surgery to do the test implant, it was found that the leads were not placed in the proper region of my spine. I was sent home any way and was told that if it didn’t eventually help me, to call Sarah and have her remove it.  Well, obviously it didn’t help. I called the manuf. Rep, scott and informed him of my dilemma. Long story short, I have to date had 4 ESI’s, 2 trial neuro stimulators,(that are out of network and you have no clue till you get the bill from medtron. They don’t even file the claim. They assume you owe whatever the  insurance in network percentage is, not paying attention to the fee schedule you would actually be paying against if in fact they were in network therefore it never gets applied to your yearly accumulations at the insurance company-deductible, out of pocket, etc.), 2 lab test’s via urinalysis that was charged to my insurance for $3700.00 each one, for drug compliance testing (that by the way is out of network with all insurance companies-no worries because they only charge us in network fees up to $250 out of pocket per the office manager). So since I signed the form in the hallway saying I realized that the lab company is solely owned by the doctors in this practice, I am liable for the charges (which btw end up being almost $250 my part after my insurance paid). I have had heated discussions with my physician regarding all of the treatments or should I say non treatments since literally nothing is working. I have gone without pain medication because the FNP said she would call in something if the stimulator didn’t work, only to find that the doctor overrode her decision and decided I needed to come in for an actual appointment, even though I was in their office, they had nothing available.  I have gone round and round with Dr Flanagan and now I have finally changed to someone else within the same practice. This doctor is a female and I love her so far. She took time to visit with me, went over everything in the past 2 years and changed medications that finally helped me.  Due to my diagnosis there is no real fix for my problem. I was told that I am just going to have to be made comfortable as they can. So as my body becomes accustom to the medication, I will need to change to something else. I want to say that the office staff, may be “ethnic” as another patient stated on their rip off report, but that has absolutely NOTHING to do with their abilities to perform. I LOVE the staff. Especially, the front office girls. They are a product of their environment, folks need to realize this. They have to feed their families too, and they only tell you what they are told to say from their bosses, the doctors. So if you have a beef with one of them, remember that information. However, Sabre and the others have only been professional with me, never anything less. I have come to realize that Konen and Flanagan have their hands in several pots. Kickbacks if you may, from the neuro-stimulators, (Dr Flanagan and Scott are buddies) and then with the lab they require you to have compliance testing thru. ",Doctors

White Plains, New York USA ",www.ucc-ny.com,1-877-UCC-OFNY,,"  I want to describe my experience with this ""Doctor"" and hope to find others that have been scammed in a similar way. I should preface this by saying that whatever ails you, Dr. Gertner has a ""study"" that will show that Upper Cervical treatments will cure it. I had elevated blood pressure and a pinch nerve in the upper cervical spine that was causing me pain and discomfort. Dr. Gertner was able to convince me that his treatments would fix my blood pressure and cure by bulging disc. After allowing over 16 months of treatments, I was convinced that neither was true, at least not for me. I know when people are in pain, they will try anything to alleviate the pain. This Doctor uses this to convince you to sign his form with monthly charges on your credit card. I should warn you to not let him have access to your credit card number, if you decide to find out for yourself. Pay him monthly, but not automatically give him your number. After agreeing to treatments from Dr. George Gertner of Upper Cervical Chiropractic on August 2011 for $4,280.00, I began to pay him $357.00 monthly. It appears that this was for only 54 treatments per year, although this information was never clearly explained to me nor in the 16 months that I received treatment from him, was I ever notified that I had gone over the allotted treatment number and would begin accruing a bill that would only eventually be revealed to me when I decided to end my treatments. I was hit with a whopping $2,000.00 bill that the ""Doctor"" ""generously"" cut in half and billed my credit card nearly $1,000.00 for overage when I stopped. In all this time, I was under the wrong assumption that the $357.00 per month I was paying was for services rendered during that particular month. The reason I assumed that is because the Doctor would tell me when I should come again. I would ask at the end of each session when I should return and was given the next recommended appointment day. With no regards to my financial situation, this Doctor took advantage of me by having me visit his office twice per week without ever once mentioning that I was over the 54 treatments. When I finally got an itemized bill when I terminated his services, I was able to count how long it took me to reach 54 visits. I had reached 54 visits within 6 months. So for over 10 months, no one in his office or the Doctor bothered to inform me that I was over the allotted visists. I know now that this information was withheld because had I been told, he would have risked my stopping the treatments sooner. I was strung along so that I would continue to come and pay. I was only a revenue source to this Doctor. Another reason I felt that the monthly payment of $357.00 was inclusive of each monthly treatment was because the Doctor began to charge $15.00 for missed appointments. Why would he do that, wouldn't he just deduct that from the 54 treatments. So if I missed an appointment, wouldn't I have used up one? With no clear policy anywhere, this Doctor does what he wants and changes the rules as he goes along. The patients are his victims. I know of no other Doctors office that would not want to be paid when due. Have you ever been to a Doctor that did not give you a bill after services? Why would this particular Doctor not want to get paid right away?? Why would he wait until the end to present the Super Bill?? The answer is because he does not want you to know for fear of losing you as his patient. He may justify this anyway he wants, but it is a disgrace that a licensed professional would be allowed to practice medicine in the State of New York with such deception. The patient puts their trust in a Doctor and in this case it is misguided, because this Doctor is more concerned about money than his patient care. If you decide to find out for yourself, notice the hard sell and the monthly ""meetings"" to try and recruit more ""patients"". Once he even was giving away a huge flat panel television, all in trying to recruit more ""victims"". I want to send a message to this Doctor in smalls claims court that this unacceptable.

He preys on people that have PPO insurance by doing surgeries that aren't needed. It's really a shame when a doctor gets to the point when he stops caring about patients and more about the money. Doctors are so well protected by all that crap they make you sign before they do anything it leaves the patient basically screwed. I had multiple procedures done by Dr. Pugach and none of them ever solved the issue. It came to the point where I had visited him so much that everyone knew me by my first and last name. After having the first surgery that was a complete failure and ended up causing another issue I was a bit weary of him. (The surgery performed by him was considered a failure after multiple other urologists took a look and examined me.) Still even tho I was suspicious of him I was in a position that the other issue needed to be fixed now and it would be difficult for another doctor to understand everything. [continued below]....
									
										..... So I went in for the second procedure to fix the problem. Indeed that did fix the issue that was caused by the failed procedure but still didn't fix the initial issue that I was having. So now I'm 2 procedure's in, 25k in the hole and back to exactly where I started. So at this point he basically tells me in a nice way he cannot help and best of luck to you. So years later after finally coming out of that financial and medical nightmare I found out he actually sued me and got a default judgment for a very small amount of money. So now at least every week I have this really shady collection agency telling me that they have a judgment against me and they are going after my assets. After several failed attempts to try and negotiate a fair payment because the doctor want's ever cent of the payment, I've finally said forget it and refuse to even talk to them. I guess the $25,000+ in insurance money that the doctor received wasn't enough! It wasn't enough that he performed surgeries that didn't fix the issue. He just had to go the extra mile and sue me to get every last penny he could. This just shows you the greed of this guy, his true colors of being a doctor can careless about his patients well being. Dr. Pugach will never get another cent from me and he's lucky that I didn't sue him for malpractice. I guess me being the bigger person and just moving past the situation doesn't always work out. Especially when you have someone like this scam artist that intends to milk you for every cent that you have. After doing a bit of research on his reviews online it also looks like he hires an agency to write fake reviews to try and cover up the negative publicity that he has received. You can simply tell this by the reviews being so closely written together and just the way they are written. I recommend to anyone that is thinking about going to this doctor or is having a procedure done by him to reconsider. There are so many other doctors out there that actually care about their patients and are actually skilled surgeons. Also always get an second opinion before having any type of procedure. Don't let someone pressure you into having a procedure done, take your time if its not an emergency. Take the time to read reviews, if they look fake they more then likely are. If a doctor has to hire someone to write fake reviews for him that's a big red flag.   ",Doctors

Oxnard, California USA ",Ventura County Hematology Oncology.com,805-485-8709,,"  Dr Ann Schrader Kelley is the worse Doctor in all of Ventura County.  I was seen by her in June 2013.  She had no treatment plan and when I decieded to find someone else she started calling me and telling me treatment plan.  She kept on giving me test after test yet my cancer was in a state that it could spread.  She informed me that I should and will be contacted by the Cancer Center yet I did not give her any authorzation to do that.  She sent me a Federal Express letter and it made no sense at all.  Do not go to this Medical Group, they could kill you with there unknown practices.  I realize that your insurance will only cover them, but find out another group. This Doctor should not be practicing Medicine, she has a delayed though pattern that my friend and I saw.  She did not know what to do with me, in her practice yet she kept giving me test after test.  She never ordered a complete blood panel and her physican assistant is rude. I had so much pain in my left arm and she never helped me with that, she did not file the RX with the pharmacy correctly and went I went to pick it up they never received the e mail from Dr. Kelley.  Cancer is a life threating and life changing diagnoise and you must act fast with a good team and this Doctor does not have that type of working in her practice, she has 3 offices and also runs the Cancer Center of Ventura, yet when you confront her she makes up stories.  In the letter she sent me Federal Express her words made no sense at all.  The test that was done was already in my hands going to my new doctor.    It is like she dangles a carrot over your head and all that she is interested in is money, and how many test the insurance company will pay for.  She is dangerous in her so called patience care as she informed me that I would need Chemo 5 days a week, yet in her letter it stated Radiology and that is an In correct statement. Again, do not go this Doctor or Medical Group she doesn't know what she is doing and her office does not either.   ",Doctors

Affordable Evaluations,"  Affordable Evaluations  631 S Brookhurst #117 
Anaheim, California USA ",,877 789 9339,," Don't even know where to start. I had an appointment for 6pm for a medical marijuana evaluation at Affordable Evaluations located at 631 S. Brookhurst, #117 Anaheim Ca, 92804. I WOULD have been on time but their flyer had the wrong address on it so I spend 30 extra minutes trying to find the place since their phone always goes straight to a recorder and I could never get a live person to help me. When I finally do find the office, it's located in a dingy, dirty hole in the wall type place that you're more likely to take a hooker than see a doctor! I finally got inside and to my dissappointment, found myself about the 30th person in line even WITH an APPOINTMENT! I was livid, I asked the woman at the front when I'd be able to see the doctor and she said the doctors an hour late bc hes driving from down south. So ok, I get my paperwork and after filling it out and again return to the front desk and include my coupon that I got from a dispensary on the clipboard. [continued below]....
									
										..... The woman rudely informed me that since I had an appointment that I would be unable to use the $25 coupon I had for the renewal and it would be the full $6 since my rec was expired for more than a month! ( I was only 2 months late renewing!) I argued that they should honor the coupon bc the doctor was not even there for the time I had scheduled! But they still said they would not allow me to use it. I'm pissed now but I've already spent the 30 minutes filling out the insane paperwork so I wait it out. 2 HOURS LATER I am finally in front of a doctor, who is taking his time asking me anything bc hes too occupied with his sushi lunch! OMG! I tell him I think its unprofessional and he actually gets an attitude with me! I try to ignore it and go into telling him about my pain from a car accident but he cuts me off and rushes right thru the evaluation with no concern. He then tells me that he only writing me a 6 month recommedation! Are u kidding? I've had 3 renewals before coming to this dump and all 3 doctors wrote me one for a year. I knew then this was a bait and switch and i should have left the second the woman at the front denied my coupon. I ended up paying $60 for a 6 MONTH rec and another $20 for an id card which I now find out is pretty much bogus without the actual paper rec! They couldn't even cut me a break on the card after seeing how much I went through! No customer service care here. Not even a damn apology for all the inconveniences! I then found out from another guy that he went there and they did the same thing to him. Why this place is still open I have no idea bc I will NEVER go back here!

" Dr. Roderick Sanden, Advanced Neurospinal Care ","  Dr. Roderick Sanden, Advanced Neurospinal Care  3609 Mission Ave  Carmichael, CA 95608 
Carmichael, California USA ",http://www.rsandenmd.com/,(916) 484-4444,," It is extremely frustrating that I have to write this review about the horrific experience I had with Dr. Sanden and his childish front office workers. I absolutely have to share my experience with this office as I feel obligated to warn anyone even thinking about going to see Dr. Sanden. I advise you to please beware and choose an alternative potential neurosurgeon otherwise you will likely have to deal with a similar experience that I underwent. After a dehabilitating injury to my lumbar spine and the subsequent MRI showing excessive damage to my lower discs, I was forced to pursue a neurosurgeon and potentially go through surgery to repair the damage done by my injury.  This search eventually led me to Dr. Sandens office, whom I was referred to. When arriving at the office, I was able to see Dr. Sanden for maybe 5 minutes before he passed me on to his Nurse Practioner. [continued below]....
									
										..... I understand that he is extremely busy, and seemingly doing these surgeries on a daily basis. Although the Nurse Practioner and Dr. Sanden weren't rude to me directly, their operations and strategies became abundantly clear. They obviously make money by performing spinal surgeries on patients in a huge amount of pain - patients looking for a solution. No problem with that - however - I was really hustled inside their office, and told I absoutely needed to move forward with surgery ASAP. (I later found out from other surgeons that this was incorrect and very 'sketchy' in regards to him pushing me towards surgery so quickly) Thankfully I sought second opinions, and these other surgeons were much more professional and helpful, and didn't seem to rush me through the office like I was on a 'surgery assembly line'. Nonetheless, despite the fact that Dr. Sandens office was seemingly reading off a 'sales script' and really trying to manipulate me into immediate surgery ($$$ for them) - I will say that Dr. Sanden and his Nurse Practitioner were not mean or rude. My main woes have nothing to do with this segment of my experience. Where things get ridiculous however, are when having to deal with their front office. These woman are the most unprofessional and rude workers I have ever come across in any industry throughout my almost 30 years on this planet. I am  not exagerating or embellishing anything in any way, this is the raw truth and I feel that it is important for prospective patients to understand. If the front office is behaving and managing patients in this way, I can only imagine the horrific experiences post-operative patients have when they have a question, need help, or anything that requires minutes of time from the front office or doctors themselves.  Although they were in fact pretty rude and seemingly incompetent when I was INSIDE the office, the real issues came to fruition after I left. Let me explain: After my consultation, I received an invoice as expected. I had a few questions about the invoice, and contacted their office. After a few calls and voicemails, I did in fact receive a call back, and the woman Judy or Margeret stated they would send me an explanation via mail. After time elapsed, I did finally receive this in the mail. It was written in barely legible cursive/sloppy writing, so I had a few quick questions.  So it began - I contacted and left a voicemail. No call back. Every few weeks or month afterward, I received another invoice, and contacted them - leaving a voicemail EVERY TIME, asking to please return my call so I could make payment and take care of my pending invoice. KEEP IN MIND, MY ONLY GOAL WAS TO SIMPLY PAY OFF THE INVOICE AND ASK A FEW MINOR QUESTIONS. I documented every time I called, and in total, I left 13 (THIRTEEN) voicemails for them, at varying times of the day, varying days, and so forth. These 13 additional calls, with the sole goal of trying to pay off my invoice, were spread out over the remainder of the year. However, I NEVER received a call back.  Eventually I receive a letter from a collection agency, demanding payment or I would receive a credit ding. I was absolutely BAFFLED at this ridiculous display of incompetence by their office. All they had to do was return my call, or PICK UP THE PHONE, and I would have gladly made my payment!  At this point I call again, and leave a voicemail. To my amazement, they actually decided to call me back this time, detecting how frustrated I was by the scenario.  They were RIDICULOUSLY rude and unprofessional when I was able to speak with them. They continually seemed to call me a liar, and were acting like children when I explained the situation. I wanted them to pay me back for the additional fees the credit collection agency applied to my bill, as I had desperately tried to make payment to them directly non-stop for months on end.  How did they reply? They verbally berated me and acted like absolute children. They were so rude, I cannot even attempt to put it in words, as it's beyond my capabilities to act so unprofessional - and quite simply, I just don't feel comfortable relaying how they spoke to me. Their whole demeanor was composed of ""WELL, WE DID CALL YOU BACK"" (regarding the ONE call back I received a week ago - and not addressing the 13 times I left voicemails beforehand). Even more crazy, is that they said ""WELL YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST SENT IN PAYMENT"".  Because I wanted to ask a few questions (1-2 minutes of their precious time), and wanted to make payment via credit/debit card or ACH bank payment ON THE PHONE --- they state that I'm in the wrong - and that I should have just sent in payment via mail. This is unreal and ridiculous, and it reflects upon Dr. Sandens practice extremely poorly. I have no idea how he continues to do business or perform surgery when his front office are acting so unprofessional. IN THE END: BEWARE.  1. They suck you in and hustle you, trying to get you in and have surgery AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Please, if you're thinking about seeing them, DON'T, go get a second opinion from another surgeon. 2. Once they have you, their customer service drops off the face of the planet. They WILL NOT RETURN YOUR CALLS. Imagine if you're post-operation, and in a ton of pain, or having issues - AND THE OFFICE WON'T EVEN RETURN YOUR CALLS. I imagine this happens often to poor unsuspecting patients. 3. Their front office is BEYOND incompetent, extremely unorganized, and the most unprofessional experience I have ever had to deal with. They refuse to return calls, and make it next to impossible to make a payment to them. Finally, they'll then send you off to a credit agency, RATHER THAN SIMPLY CALL THE PATIENT! Again, all they had to do was CONTACT ME, or RETURN MY CALL, and I was ready and would have GLADLY made a payment. Instead, they NEVER return calls, LIE ABOUT IT, and then act like children when I contact them to attempt at finding a solution. If this is how they treat perspective patients, I can only imagine the horror stories poor patients have after having surgery. Stay away from this place, find a better surgeon with an office that will treat you like a human being. Thank you ",Doctors

I went to Dr Hector Viera for a mini face. He showed me how I would look on his computer if I get certain procedures done to my face and it looked good. I ended up getting full face lift, forehead lift, neck lift and chin implant. I trusted him that I would look better. That's not the case. It was a disaster after surgery. I have all kinds of infections and had to keep going back to his office to try to fix the problem. It's been over a year now and I still have infection. I went back to see him many times about it and he kept telling me that it's not infection but the fluid coming out from different areas of my face smells aweful and all my friends and family told me that it smells like rotten dead animal. Finally after seeing him a few times about the infection which he kept telling me that it's not infection even though it's swelling, all red and fluid dripping out constantly. I asked him for some medications for my infection and he refused. He said that they don't use antiobotic there because they never have anyone with infection and I find that hard to believe. I kept trying to talk him into doing something to help my infection and he finally perscribe me some antiobotic but it didn't work so I had to go back for 2 more surgeries which he suggested and yes I did have to pay a few more thounsands of dollars for it. I paid $11,000 to start with. Now my face is deformed. My eyebrows are uneven from brow lift. My mouth is uneven. my cheeks are uneven. Chin implant had to be remove cause of infection which I was suffering pain for a year and can't eat certain food. Thank goodness it's out. Now I have uneven droopy puffy frowning pancake face which I didn't have before, and look 10 years older than before the surgery and just deformed. I am seeking a Dr that can help fix what Dr Viera has done to my face and couple of Drs didn't want anything to do with my face after they seen the pictures of my face. I requested a copy of my medical from Dr Viera and he got really mad and had an attitude with me and his exact words were "" Go see six, seven eight Drs I don't care"" .  After $14,000.00 and 3 surgeries later with Dr Hector Viera, I now have uneven face, on-going infections and looked 10 years older and have been very depress since the first day he touched my face.

HealthPort,"  HealthPort  P.O. Box 409900 
Atlanta, Georgia USA ",www.healthport.com,877-595-9900,,"  I requested copies of my medical records from one visit to the doctor each for myself and my husband. The doctor's staff at Medical Group of the Carolinas then handed me a form to fill out so that I could have access to the records. I filled it out, thinking I had read everything correctly. A couple of weeks later I recieved the requested information along with a bill from HealthPort that I was not expecting. No one at my doctor's office mentioned a fee. While I don't mind paying fees for my medical records, I do expect to be notified that there will be a charge and what that charge will be. When I called HealthPort about my bill and notified them that I had not been informed that there would be a charge, let alone what the charge would be, they told me that it was not their responsibility to do that. They told me that my doctor's office should have notified me that there would be a fee. I then asked how, in the future, I could know what the charge would be up front when requesting my medical records and a HealthPort employee told me to ask my doctor, after stating, "" We don't know what we will bill until the invoice is generated."" When I asked how I could possibly be notified in advance what I would be billed if that is not determined until the invoice goes out, the employee (#2245) went silent. Despite repeated attempts at asking for her help, the employee remained silent. She then said that she would not discuss the matter with me any further.  I asked for a manager, and she simply stated that one was not available. I asked for a supervisor, and she put me on hold. When she came back on the line she told me that a supervisor would call me back. I asked for his direct line and she would not provide me with it. I asked for the complaint department or for some way to write in about my problem and she refused both requests. I asked for an address for the company and she would not give me one. I then proceeded to ask if she could explain how the billed amount was generated and if there was a set rate. She said that she would not discuss billing with me. I asked if I called the right department and if she was in billing.....silence. I don't understand how a company can bill you for something after the fact, and then claim that it is some other company's responsibility to disclose the fees. When I was told to call my doctor's office to ask about the fees, I said, "" Well it's not my doctor's office charging the fees is it? It's HealthPort's fee right? My bill was not as high as what other people here have reported, however, given the amount of information I actually received it seems to be too much. For my file, I was billed $13.32. I receieved 20 pages. Out of those 20 pages 3 were not medical records at all, but Healthport paperwork and invoice. 2 or 3 pages were duplicates where it looked like a record didn't print out completely the first time so was just printed out again. 2 pages contained only an electronic signature from my doctor ( no other information at all...practically a blank page. And a couple more pages were nothing but line after line of producer IDs (all the same lab). If you do that math, it is as if I paid more than a $1.00 per page when accounting for all the paperwork I didn't need to receive. After reviewing the authorization to release that I signed, I did find something in the fine print. It reads, ""Fees will be charged in accordance with SC Code and Federal Rule....."" This fine print was stuck inside a box titled:"" Purpose of release,"" a section of the agreement where I was to indicate why the record was needed. Seems like a strange place for that kind of disclosure huh??? While I really liked my doctor, I HATE the fact that he utilizes HealthPort for the handeling of my medical records. Be careful of outsourcing in your doctor's office. You won't know where your medical information is going and you will be bounced back and forth between your doctor and other companies until you're about ready to scream!   ",Doctors

Then I calmly asked him how much saline he adds...and I even laughed, telling him, I was only jokinG by asking (joking or not, the point is, when a patient asks you questions, based on their CONCERNS, this should not be a problem!).  He stormed out of the room, telling about how I ""don't trust him"", I should go someplace else, etc., etc...yelling!!  I said ""Are you being serious right now?""   Eventually he came back in the room, and gave me the Botox.  He said I needed a higher amount of Botox around my eyes if I want it to last this time.  I said "" Fine.  That's fair...whatever it takes to make it LAST this time...it's worth paying more."".  as afterwards, I said ""Great...thanks...so...now that I'm getting more Botox today, like suggested, it'll last Longer than 6 weeks, and I won't need to come back for a touch up in a month?""  He LOST it!  Yelling! He said ""I'm not doing anymore touch ups, If it doesn't last, I can't guarantee that!"". I said ""first off, why are you yelling at me?  And secondly, why did you suggest I pay for a higher amount of Botox this time, if you're not guaranteeing it?"" (I have a right to ask questions...I'm the patient).   He threw me out of his office and said ""No charge!  Find someone else to do your Botox!""   I have no idea what happened.  He seemed more and more confusing to me, each time I wehim in for more Botox.  He would always tell me I got a different amount than what I had in my records...I think he was just confused.  Bt when he flipped out on me for asking questions, I thought:  something's not quite right.  I actually feel bad for him.   ",Doctors

A while back I starting searching for a better, honest hair doctor and came across this article appointing Dr. Pizarro as the Medical Director of a company called BioStem, which specialized in PRP and had the same John Satino as President...the scammers had united!!! http://www.globalshareholder.com/scripts/cgiip.wsc/globalinvestor/news.r?nid=746460 After doing more research, I found another article showing BioStem's CEO getting arrested by the FEDS for creating a SHELL COMPANY...ripping off millions from investors.  http://clearwater.patch.com/articles/clearwater-companys-ceo-among-14-arrested-on-fraud-charges  If you look at her website after the FAQs, she even states she doesn't promise any results...even after charging people money and even telling me a year before that PRP was not proven to work!!!   http://www.drpizarro.com/thebiostem-method.html  I'm making this report for no monetary compensation nor any refunds.  I am doing it for the sole purpose to warn the public of these unethical people who only care about money!   ",Doctors

Brown Hand Center,"  Brown Hand Center  1605 Airport Freeway 
Bedford, Texas USA ",www.brownhandcenter.com,817-267-4100,," Had Carpal Tunnel surgery performed in the Bedford, TX office in mid March. When talking with the finance administrator gave all my insurance information prior to arriving for initial exam. She told me pricing for doing the surgeries with my insurance on both hands would be approximately $2,150 including the one area she did not bill directly, which was the anesthesia. She estimated that to be $600. Consequently I was expecting a $1550 bill from Brown Hand Center. After the surgeries I discovered they were billing a total of over $150,000 to my insurance company for what amounted to two outpatient surgeries each totaling about 30 minutes. I received a bill today for close to $100,000 of which insurance hopefully will cover some portion. After dealing with them I believe they are set up in business to milk your insurance for massive claims for what I could only consider to be exorbantant and fraudulent. And they seem to push other procedures and prescriptions that are billed at very excessive amounts to the insurance. Those included pain relieving creme and a electrical stimulation machine.

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.gov/,(614)466-3555,"Dave Board Constituent Affairs Governor John Kasich Ohio having women MDs ordered to serial psychiatric 'goes' (>5) for objecting to wrong care to themselves because of outdated medical standards in Ohio, it's one thing to do evaluations in a medical sense  Columbus, Ohio","
										Governor Kasich, the State Medical Board of Ohio, and staff, are misusing psychiatric evaluations to find 'cases' against women MDs after 20 years of licensure suspension for provisional cases that didn't work out.  The Governor has an authoritarian Medical Board with no checks in power.  You only have to have a theoretical, or provisional, case to take medical licnese in Ohio and ruin careers.  And there's no statute of limitations, so year after year the Board tries to find cases in the bad cases - to get out of liability payments.  But this is the wrongest way to break a woman MD for political purposes, to wreck a personality as well as a life, to torture.   
At the Ohio State Medical Board - and Constituent Affairs run by Dave Board - there is no policy to dismiss a false case against a physician, and get the physicians back to work with re-credentialing courses and licensure fees.  What every other state does, doesn't work in Ohio.  How many women are in this psychiatric 'go' limbo is unknown.  
The OHIO State Medical Board is broke with the line item of investigative services - investigating innocent physicians, or finding a case, when the non-case from the 'confidential' physician complaint didn't pan out.  But to have the boys getting into the psychiatric evaluation game - without protection from HIPAA or opening the complaint - is just government gone wrong.  Constituent Services gone to the amoral poli-sci nerds.
The psychiatric evaluations are a thinly veiled attempt to defend mistakes of licensure suspension - to get out of statute of limitations liability when the Board 'buys' a bad case from 'confidential' sources.  Evaluations are used to find cases for personality issues - that your personality isn't 'right' for Ohio.  This is so below the belt, but the getting into it of the Governor's Staff is alarming.  If someone refused a date from Dave Board - send her to psychiatric evlauation will be the mantra - what he learned on the job.
Care standard debates in medical fields have to be 'fair,' and not be involving licensure suspensions & disciplines for physicians who trained out of a certain state and have different ideas.  Bringing up new care suggestions is a good thing, and mentioning an error can save a patient's life.  If we all did what the co-pilot, who didn't mention the fuel being low to the pilot, did - we'd all crash and burn.  
Anything involving humans has error - Medical Board decisions, medical care decisions - but 6 ordered psychiatric evaluations - so that the Governor & Dave can spend spare time reading about the sex lives of women MDs in Ohio - that's insane.  A woman MDs dating history is not why the orthopedics goofed with her fracture care, with the cast applications, with the forgetting to order physical therapy.  Blaming the women - is not the answer to bad medical care practices in Ohio.
Governor Kasich and Dave need to step up to the plate and order reviews of cases that the Medical Board has admitted cheating on, cases that had no merit cases where the MD had no patient complaints.  But it's easier to order a 6th psychiatric 'go?'  Where is the logic, the thought process in that?  Allowing a Medical Board to go 'rogue' to get cases is not a good business policy - someone will eventually sue if not the AAPS (American Association of Physicians & Surgeons).
But having Dave Board hang up saying - you have to 'get another evaluation' when the women got through Medical School & training, passed her Boards, and practiced without patient complaints - well that just jealousy, stupidity, and government by the people who couldn't get into Medical School - government by the truly stupid.  
Governor Kasich, his aides, and the Medical Board should at least sit down and discuss with the physicians, open the 'confidential' complaints in cases where the Medical Board gave 'friend' physicians their complaint, and look at the non-suit agreements offered.  It shouldn't be a 6th psychiatric evaluation vs a non-suit agreement - that's bad legal advice.  Get out of the bad case is what every legal mind would tell the Medical Board - but they aren't even that smart.  
In the meantime, Dave Board should work on his phone skills, dates should beware of his propensity for ordering women to 'psychiatric goes,' and he should work on getting more informed about the problems in medical care and for women patients in Ohio.  Women do need blood work, and ob-gyn care, and you can't railroad their careers for political purposes when they need this medical care, need to be having families, and need to have the support of the Medical Board in changing bad care practices - not be tortured into continuing the bad practices.
Looking forward to next week and Dave Board hanging up, finding irrelevant things to say, and justifying 'goes' at women MDs.  This administration has lost 'focus' on the real issues, the real problems, and that 'goes' at women MDs only ruin the best in Ohio - the women who can achieve and should be role models - not trashed.          									",Doctors

These psychiatric evaluations are not done by any rules; the Rorschach answers are fixed and the diagnoses don't have to exist according to any DSM.  Then the Medical Board makes fun of experts that co-author the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Psychiatry - the US experts that the women MDs seek some 'help' from.  The Medical Board of Ohio practices a 'rogue' psychiatry - and book of diagnosis unto itself.  The Kasich Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Psychiatry.  And Dave Board's family doesn't know what he really does in Kasich's office - hang up on women MDs who refuse this rot - repetitively.  
Holding the opinion that this psychiatric evaluation stuff done unnecessarily, brutally, and without a moral compass is 'wrong,' is a 'grudge' personality disorder that has to be fixed before re-licensure.  You can't say that this is wrong - to Governor Kasich or Medical Board Members.
The psychiatric abuse of innocent physicians for Medical Board Member amusement is what has to be 'fixed.'  Pre-fixed psychiatric evaluations by Ohio 'cleaner' psychiatrists, are a reality of Big Brother in Ohio, ie Governor Kasich.  And the Governor & his staff don't think that this is the wrong to save liability money for the budget of Ohio, that the Ohio Medical Board is not responsible for wrong decisions, wrong cases, and huge abuse of monies on investigations for wrong reasons.  The Ohio Medical Board buys these bad cases from the hospitals that they should be penalizing for the bad care - because some Board Member is on staff & won't recuse themselves.      
Governor Kasich & staff sit in their office and pretend to be civilized - upset when the reality of repetitive abusive psychiatric evaluations, if you can't spout the party line of the State Medical Board, is posted on Ripoff - well do something about the abuses - wake up to the reality in Ohio.  Order #2003 for yet another 'go' at a woman MD with no patient complaints is not ok - the case has to be 'opened for reforms' as suggested in 1998 and by the Ohio Court of Appeals in 1993.  Kimberly Anderson needs to be replaced yesterday.
The woman MD objected to wrong care - ripening of fractures to excrescence, and experimental casting of fractures with no physical therapy or blood work ordered.  Basically the woman MD objected to 'care' that would never be done to Governor Kasich - but can be done to everyone else - even Dave Board.  That should be enough to get him off of going along with psychiatric evaluation order no. 2003 - it's like the Gulag - an excuse for bad government.     
No better than water-boarding - serial psychiatric goes are done in Ohio when the Medical Board makes a mistake - and there is no number limit to the number of evaluations that an out-of-control Medical Board can order on any individual licensed practitioner.  You are in a room and over and over asked about your personal life, about what happened with the fractures when no one can figure out the details with the lies on the medical records, asked over and over why you didn't 'like' Dr. Nice (if that is his name).  And regardless of HIPAA, it's all put into public records and on the Board's website.  The Medical Board's website is like an obscene blog site - everything wrong & inaccurate is posted - there is no truth on that site.
Governor Kasich can't allow a statute of limitations, an opening of the 'confidential' complaint, a review of the case - just another order for psychiatric 'go' number 6 - this time at the expense of the physician, but with the experts 'picked' by the State Medical Board.  It couldn't be more unfair, fixed, or an abuse of power than in a Communist State.  What is the purpose of these psychiatric evaluations, when it is not about patient care?    
This is the misuse of Russian psychiatry with the full 'go-ahead' of Governor Kasich and his staff in Constituent Affairs (Dave Board).  Russian psychiatry with Ohio experts trained in it - and Dave Board doesn't like the details - or maybe his family is upset that this is what he is involved in at Constituent Affairs.   
Governor Kasich is a Governor who endorses psychiatric 'goes' - after 3 national experts have told the Medical Board of Ohio to 'stop this' - to save the state from damages and statutes of limitations.  And every 'go' increases the monetary damages, but no one understands that you don't continue over and over to do the wrong thing - but that's cheaper than millions in legitimate damages for wrong care when the physician has offered a non-suit agreement?  
It's all about money; that if the state is liable they won't pay & would rather the physician 'go crazy' with mistreatment & abuse.  Money that Governor Kasich would have except for the line item expense of abusive investigations of physicians with no patient complaints.       
The woman physician's life is then ruined; she can't have a family or medical care, can't get a decent job until she admits the Board's case - but that would mean knowing the Board's case ie knowing what she is accused of.  State highway patrol come to her parent's house and wonder where the children are - she wasn't allowed to have any - but Governor Kasich was - on a second marriage when the woman MD was not allowed one - for politics as usual in Ohio.  
And you can't resolve anything when you don't know the complaint, or can't say that one of the signers was hitting on you for personal needs, and that you didn't know (had never met) another of the signers, etc.  It's an abusive system that is just getting worse while other states reform the abuses at their respective State Medical Boards.  There are no rules of evidence at the State Medical Board of Ohio - no verification of facts - any hearsay is a go.  
Governor Kasich has refused to appoint someone to externally review the mess at the State Medical Board, someone to propose long-overdue reforms.  A State Court of Appeals Judge (or panel of 3)could fill this bill easily - to review all cases unresolved after 7 years - which is the longest statute of limitations in any other state and mediate resolutions.  There are stacks of innocent physician cases in the backrooms of the State Medical Board of Ohio - stacks that Dave Board won't admit - and his family goes along with this - ok as long as Dave Board isn't psychiatrically evaluated 6 times.  It's the staff & their families, as well as Governor Kasich & his wife - anything for a government salary.    
But continuing to order psychiatric goes after 20 years is beyond belief - not a civilized government.  With the 'confidential' complaint system, certain Board 'friends' get their complaints, and the women MDs are counter-complained about, but don't get their complaints to defend themselves.  The 'rules' are broken daily for Board Member 'friends.'    
You can't fight a 'case' where you are accused of some psychiatric impairment that you disagreed with wrong care done to yourself - even though you did not disagree that the out-of-date physicians could continue the bad care.  And if bad care doesn't stop being done to women physicians, it won't stop being done to other women patients.  
Ohio male MD care of women patients is out-of-date badly - but Anita Steinbergh DO is at the helm of the State Medical Board of Ohio allowing this - as long as the bad care is not done to her & as long as she doesn't have to endure 6 psychiatric evaluations.  Dr. Steinbergh has been personally responsible for ordering 4 of the psychiatric evaluations on the woman MD - and she's not a psychiatrist. and there were no patient complaints of any wrong care or patient personality issues with the woman MD.  This is a colleague case - where the woman MD had to disagree with the care of Dr. Steinbergh's 'friends.'  The woman MD did better care than Dr. Steinbergh - had more training and more degrees - but she can't have a medical license.  It's like the worst nightmare of equal opportunity.  ",Doctors

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ","www,governor.ohio.gov",(614)466-3555,"Governor John Kasich Ohio Dave Board Constituent Affairs are to be faulted for not seeing 'through' the false political cases at the State Medical Board of Ohio, physician careers derailed for decades for saying something about wrong care of Board Members o Columbus, Ohio","
										Just like you have to ask Case Faculty Practice dentists to see the x-ray, as Governor you have to ask the Medical Board about the cases and the evidence, and why certain cases with no patient complaints are going on for 20 years.  You can't presume that the State Medical Board, unlike any other medical practitioner, won't try to take advantage, hide problems, and make money on your stupidity - just like Case Faculty Practice dentists - they have a drill under their sleeve. 
Six psychiatric evaluations of women physicians objecting to wrong care is not going to 'find a case.'  And this was partially for asking for her medical records?  Every physician is allowed their records without Medical Board censure for asking for them - one woman MD just asked for her orthopedic records - which a Board 'friend' was editing.  
Case Dental Faculty Practice will try to drill on old films, and the Medical Board will try to rehash old cases unless there is a statute of limitations.  Cases that are deadended, where the Medical Board made a mistake, have no way to get dismissed in Ohio.  And one case is about a woman MD who asked for her orthopedic records or a summary, then filed a complaint when after 6-7 months they were still being edited - a complaint never investigated.  What is the secondary gain in that?  Improving patient care?     
Board cases that have been going on over 7 years - which is the longest statute of limitations at any other Medical Board - need to have an external administrative review - separate from the Governor's office, but built into the system to avoid fraud and continued misuse of state funding for personal vendettas.  This Department would pay for itself - in funds saved on wrong investigations that the Board won't admit are wrong.  This is not personal Dave Board, it's just that the Fitzgerald is going to take advantage of a Governor that has no oversight of his Medical Board.
Allowing the Ohio Medical Board to go after innocent physicians who are medical mistakes of Board Members or 'competition' for Board Members, ahead of boxes of physicians with multiple complaints, with no point system or accounting for 'confidential cases' with no patient complaints = bad business investment.  Simply not good cash flow.  
 
When women MDs are targeted, their health needs are ignored and they are taken advantage of by practitioners who try to do things on them because they are then the natural history of neglect of health care  Dr. Licata at Cleveland Clinic watches the woman MDs bone condition go to ground without bone meds or help.  Meanwhile, every Jewish woman, and her out-of-state or Israeli relatives, are on some bone med 'help' from the Cleveland Clinic.  Not that complaining to the Governor will get Dr. Licata to help the woman MD he left to rot.
But wrong Medical Board cases endorsed by Governor Kasich, literally destroy the good health of women physicians falsely accused by the Medical Board, physicians who made competitors like Carla ODay MD jealous.  They dont get ob-gyn care, Dr. Stellato will try to schedule a surgery instead of injecting a complication, his secretary Carol will use the situation for her employment benefits, & even Mayo Clinic will take advantage with a procedure outdated since 1926.  Dr. Stellato should be able to handle abdominal nerve inflammations, to undo wrong surgeries for this, and to write the sentinel article on this problem - to stop the abuse of women patients by male surgeons.  And the Governor should get on his case for this.  He was runner up for Chief of Surgery at Case Western University Hospitals Medical Center - and still is second if there's a resignation.
The heath care of the woman MD goes to ground  on purpose while her competition on the Board laughs.  While your medical license is suspended, your health care needs are neglected by your colleagues on purpose  they want you dead and get a chance to do this with complaints that never end because the physician is not guilty.  You can't sign a resolution to end the case with a 'confidential' case - you have to know what you are admitting to.  
What they couldnt do in Medical School, your competitors can now do legitimately with the sanction of the Ohio Medical Board.  The confidential complaints have to be opened  and Governor Kasich doesnt see this.  This is a blind spot that blind justice does not work - you have to be allowed due process, to present evidence, and to get things over with before 20 years or the American Association of Physicians & Surgeons is going to sue you - and then where will you be Governor Kasich?  Especially in a cost-effective system - the facts have to be there or no money.  
The bias, qualifications, involvement, and personal interests & agendas of the confidential complainers have to be assessed  did the physician falsely accused even know the person?  In one case at least one signer had never met or spoken with the physician  she was just paid.  And you cant say that without opening the confidential complaint  its speculation.  Its a way to get complaints that would not pass the muster in any other system  they wouldnt go anywhere in a transparent physician complaint state like Rhode Island.
The Medical Board is allowed to pick and choose cases, not for merit, but for what the Medical Board members can collect from the cases.  Governor Kasich lets this happen; the choices of cases of the Medical Board are not random, objective, or unpolitical.  If you are a job or career threat to a Medical Board Member, you will be a provisional case that is never proven  one case has gone on for 20 years with ORDER after ORDER for psychiatric evaluations of a normal woman MD.   
Governor Kasich doesnt see the game.  Psychiatric evaluations are fishing expeditions to find a case.  And in one case there have been five  with no case found.  No other system allows repetitive evaluations or procedures to find a disease or fault - with no return.  No medical insurance will cover this.  
The Medical Board confidential complaint and discipline system is used to take out innocent physicians for the greater good of certain Board Members like Anita Steinbergh DO and Lance Talmadge MD.  And to prove that Kimberly Andersons Investigative Services are justified  she would not pass her investigations or be able to comply with her ORDERS.  
Its a sanctioned evil taking out good for the statistics.  Someone has to be the victim poster child for the State Medical Board  so make it a US-trained physician with no patient complaints.  How stupid, but then Governor Kasich doesnt get the stupid part.  Dave Board has to find someone to hang up on.  Better behavior is expected or Fitzgerald will start finding fault with an abusive costly system leaching all funds of the State Medical Board of Ohio, raising physician dues, and not improving patient care.

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.go,(614)466-3555,"Governor John Kasich Ohio Dave Board Constituent Affairs engaging in a ghoulish 'harvesting' of women physician disciplinary stats for the State Medical Board of Ohio, where woman MDs have licenses taken after objecting to wrong care, medical care withheld  Columbus, Ohio","
										Governor John Kasich, and his aides, are engaging in a ghoulish form of Medical Board 'games' where women MDs have their licenses taken for 20 years for objecting to wrong medical & orthopedic care - fracture care, blood work, gyn care, and even dental care are then withheld, or done viciously to make a case that the Board can count on year-after-year, a case that the woman is 'unstable' as she can't take this abuse.  
What did the woman MD do per the State Medical Board - 'she made too much of bad care.'  That is a reason to take a medical license in Ohio for 20 years?  This is Governor Kasich's Medical Board - and his Administrative Policy at this time.  He laughs when his staff hangs up - it's like the cheating at the State Medical Board - a Columbus joke.  Like the Steubenville boys, the Kasich boys do their thing with women also - but they withhold medical care, jobs, insurance, and life for no sex.       
When the Ohio Medical Board didn't find a case - and the Ohio Court of Appeals threw out the case in 1993 - as there is no statute of limitations at the Ohio State Medical Board - the Board got into the withholding of medical care game.  To make the woman MD admit the case.  The 'confidential' complaint has never been revealed - who complained about her or what they said - the woman MD and has not been allowed to properly defend herself in any US Constitutional sense - it's Governor Kasich martial law in Ohio - you do what you are told - ORDER 2003.  
The withholding of a decent job that might have benefits game - she was supposed to 'work in a lab' and give her patient care to others.  The woman MD was supposed to sign the Board's case or never practice medicine again.  
The Medical Board of Ohio doesn't have to prove a case against a physician - they just take the job, the health insurance - provisionally - and threaten any physician in Ohio that might help you - so that you continue to break bones, the Mayo Clinic wants to remove your abdominal nerves in a gruesome surgical procedure that has been outted since 1926 (but let's try it again cause the woman MD is a 'goner' anyway), the Dental School Dr. Assaf wants to drill the teeth affected with the bone condition (which are not cavities, but show up as lucencies on the dental films - which idiots can't differentiate), Dr. Stellato gets to have you roughed up by the South Euclid Police, Dr. Licata refuses to give you a bone med - and you die slowly and painfully.  While Dave Board orders pizza, just like Dr. Nice in the ER.  Toppings anyone?  
MEANWHILE, the State Medical Board continues the case with ORDER AFTER ORDER, trying to find a case, changing the 'confidential' complaint, not allowing the woman to know the complaint.  Kimberly Anderson is now at it - recommending that we go back to ORDER 2003.  Whatever the woman MD did is still 'confidential' - so confidential that she has to die for it.  It's a horrible situation with a lack of moral compass on the part of everyone involved - from Governor Kasich, to Dr. Nice, to Dr. Keith, to Dr. Tom Stellato, and to Dr. Licata.  Anyone who could refuse the woman care in Ohio did - to get points with the State Medical Board of Ohio.  And their secretaries. . . 
Everyone else went along - even the Cleveland Clinic where Dr. Angelo 'Tony' Licata could be counted on to not treat the bone problem.  But he did the labs for the thyroid problem, and a vitamin D level finally, in 2007 - only after ORDER 2003.  
Anita Steinbergh DO has that letter, but she thinks that this is just a get-back (she didn't get into Medical School apparently).  The woman MD had to get gyn care out of town, couldn't get married or have a family unless she changed her story about what happened with her fracture care from hell - and she didn't so she will never have any kids - kudos to Carla O'Day MD for the bleed out sterilization procedure.  
The medical workup was not allowed for the 1995 Hearing (order of Anita Steinbergh DO).  This is a pre-fab case, where no one would not be upset and calling Kasich's office, and where he can't get the message that withholding medical care is not the best way to find 'bad physicians' for the State Medical Board stats.  But this extreme care withholding is only done to women with license challenges - at a time when women MDs need gynecological care, have bone & thyroid issues, and need continued medical insurance.  Women MDs get provisional license suspensions that become 20 year battles, because the Medical Board made a 'mistake' and has no medical mistake provisions.  Other states give the license back with some limited damages to get re-certification courses and award re-licensure fees.  
The woman MD re-applied in 1998 - the Ohio Medical Board cashed her check and never got back.  And she's supposed to try this again?  The re-licensure takes two years to do all the paperwork, and after 20 years the references are gone - no one can remember her good care of patients - that was the plan.  
And until a physician is proven guilty - no provisional license suspensions should be allowed - they need to continue their jobs, patient care, insurances, and getting health care to get over any illness or injury that might have led to the disagreement.  This is especially important as physician illness tend to be 'zebras,' or they would 'fix' themselves.
This woman MD had her license provisionally taken in 1992 - it is now 2013 - for something that she had no criteria for - her personality is better than most physicians in Ohio - she has a personality.  The Medical Board has allowed state-paid experts to 'cheat' twice to continue the case, but refused to allow the Board to dismiss the case or admit wrong.  That has to come from Governor Kasich - who is too busy gearing up for re-election.  
In 1998-9, the woman agreed to a Medical Board 'offer' - that her case would be opened for Medical Board reforms - she would get her license back, but no damages.  She and other 'innocent' physicians agreed, but the agreement was gone back on - because the cases were so bad, and the statute of limitations might not have expired.  No one knows the exact number of years for this, but 20 is better than 10, and 21 is better than 20 as the Verizon commercial goes.  There is no accountability at the State Medical Board of Ohio - not by Governor Kasich, Dave Board, or the Medical Board.  
Governor Kasich sits cozy in his office, Dave Board orders his lunch, and the woman MD hasn't had a decent job in 20 years in-between psychiatric evaluations trying to find a case - while treatment of a serious thyroid condition, gyn care, and treatment of the thyroid condition are withheld.  This woman MD has been treated like a lab rat, like a discarded animal - and in NYC dogs get better treatment - they get casts on their fractures.  Treatment for everything that the women MD really has, has been withheld, treatment for everything that she has no criteria for has been offered, ordered, and refused - because it's not the care that she needs.  It is Kafkaesque, demonic, revolting and status quo - it's insane.
The lab work was finally all done after the ORDER of 2003 conveniently - ten years after the Medical Board took her medical license for making too much of horrible neglect & abuse.  The delay was to make a case for something else, get an admission of guilt, or kill the woman MD.  Leaving a thyroid condition untreated can go to lymphoma or thyroid cancer.  She was too much competition so . . .    
The woman MD did nothing wrong regarding her patient care or CME, drug or alcohol use - she was a 'target' because other physicians were deemed more valuable - expendable for stats purposes - someone has to play 'bad physician' for the Medical Board of Ohio.  And it can't be their friends.
She practiced an above-average-for-Ohio Internal Medicine - therefore she needed to be destroyed.  An experiment, like her experimental casting - how much 'Jeffrey Dahmer' torture could she take?  Board expert Dr. Resnick knows the drill on this, and he's taught the UH Physicians (Keith, Lafferty, Stellato) well - they can do a Dahmer impression.  
Four psychiatric evaluations, two Hearings, one Court of Appeals attempt to throw the case out - and the case is still going like an EVERYREADY BATTERY.  Everyone then wants to collect a piece of her for some billing or experiment - Dr. Tom Stellato causes a nerve inflammation and then wants another surgery, the Dental School wants to drill her teeth, Dr. Licata at Cleveland Clinic wants to see how long she can go without fracturing her hip.  
Dr. Stellato knew that there was an injection for abdominal nerve inflammations, but his secretary Carol needed to get a little 'piece' of the action and wrongly scheduled things.  Everyone's got a get-back for this woman - Carol didn't get into Medical School either.  Dr. Stellato can't repair the 3 muscles that Mayo Clinic cut to remove a nerve damaged by lack of treatment of a thyroid condition that even Mayo Clinic missed - only a T4 was ordered and that is an Endocrine medical student miss - not a Mayo Clinic miss.  It's embarrassing, unforgiveable, and so sad.  Dr. Stellato can do abdominal nerve repairs in his sleep, but he won't - he's being Dr. Stellato.   
The Ohio Medical Board takes licenses without allowing 'care-to-function,' which makes women physicians most vulnerable as they would have diagnoses that the men would not get, and then want to get off the liability of.  Hillcrest & University Hospitals of Cleveland male physicians left a fracture to ripen, then experimentally casted.  The Endocrinology Department did not do even a thyroid profile (and neither Governor Kasich or Dave Board know what that is), and the Board took the woman physician's license before she could finish the workup at Mayo Clinic, finish physical therapy, find out what she had, or get treated for the bone problem causing the fractures.  
There is no provision of medical care, medical insurance or way to get a decent job as a physician when the Medical Board takes your license - even wrongly - and plays games for 20 years to 'find a case.'  The case: they got a reaction out of the woman for this amount of neglect of care.  Score one for the Medical Board - the limited of human endurance has been reached and breached.
The aim appears to be to kill the woman MD by neglecting medical care.  Her thyroid labs were not ordered for 10 years and had to be done out-of-state.  There were no blood tests allowed before her medical license was taken for 'bone pains' that she was supposedly 'exaggerating.'  
This is suable care, but you can't sue the State Medical Board of Ohio.  She had extreme gyn problems and finally ended in emergency care at Columbia-Presbyterian in NYC - the woman MD will never have a child - that was the jealousy of Carla O'Day MD - a medical school classmate who was on the original Medical Board that started this. 
Carla O'Day MD - a medical school classmate - ran the case against this woman MD after the Hillcrest ER goofed on her fracture care and triage.  Carla O'Day ran the ER & let Dr. Nice eat pizza in the ER instead of doing a fracture reduction, getting an x-ray, or ordering some blood work.  The woman MD was supposed to do her own workup, order her own x-rays, supply her own cast padding, and find her own diagnosis - because male MDs can't think in Ohio.  They need a brain.
The lack of treatment of the thyroid problem - and the cancelling of her medical insurance with the provisional actions of the Medical Board - caused complication after complication - which Ohio physicians mistreated, ignored, or just laughed about.  Dr. Stellato wrongly treated an abdominal nerve inflammation that he caused, because he could - no injection, no blood work, no scans, and by calling the South Euclid Police Department to get out of responsibility - he wanted to be the Chief of Surgery at Case Western University Hospitals in 2005 but didn't get the nod.  But taking advantage of a former student?  Dr. Licata, of Cleveland Clinic Bone Metabolism, left the bone condition untreated and under treated - to get another fracture to disable the woman MD - natural history of thyroid bone disease and all that.  Governor Kasich is making the woman a 'scapegoat' to get to reform the Medical Board - to show the problems - but the lesson has gone too far. 
Kimberly Anderson is insisting on compliance with Order 2003 - before the blood work got done once in Ohio.  The order wants another psychiatric evaluation, and now the Medical Board wants a report of the medical isses that they have caused.  Whoopie!!!  We are now thinking MEDICAL.  They now realize that a woman MD - with her license provisionally & unjustifiably taken - might get into health issues that she would not be able to get proper treatment for.  So waste all that good education with horrible care and kill the woman MD to get Dr. Nice out of bad fracture care & harassment charges.  Penny-wise and pound-foolish - STUPID.
Governor Kasich needs to order a review of the Medical Board cases that have no end, cases with no patient complaints.  These cases have horrible information on the Medical Board's website - things that never happened, aren't true, and someone just made up.  But to come to Columbus and walk the halls for a meeting, you have to have that off the web - or you will be mistreated by even the secretarial & other staff.  There needs to be meetings scheduled for each of these cases - to start to resolve things - to get a plan besides Dave Board hanging up.  Dave Board needs to attend to see what is going on - really going on.  Boys need to grow up, and there needs to be some common sense at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  ",Doctors

										The problem of false cases at the State Medical Board of Ohio needs to stop.  The problem of the false postings about physicians, on the Board's website - cases never proved or resolved - needs to stop.  In some cases, the physician wasn't physically able to do the things alleged, wasn't in the state, or they are complete fabrications.  Dave Board is upset if you say the truth - that he hangs up and is whitewashing the problems - well many physicians have much worse posted about themselves - with not a grain of truth. 
The minute that this behavior stops, postings about Governor Kasich not being up-to-the-job with the Medical Board of Ohio will stop.  Governor Kasich campaigned knowing that there were huge problems with practioner standards and care in Ohio - that the ol' boy network sabotaged any improvement in women's medical care on a daily basis.  That much of this bad care affected women patients & MDs.  He has done nothing to improve the situation, 'confidential' physician complaints have to stop - you can't solve the problems then.
Get the stuff off the Board's website, and sit down in meetings/discussions with the physician & a lawyer and solve the problems - this has been offered daily for 20 years - non-suit agreements have been offered.  
Many physicians agreed with a Board offer in 1998-9, to have their cases opened for reforms - under conditions that they would get no damages, but their licenses would be returned, if they were found to be innocent.  The Board had physicians agreee to this - the stack of probably false cases - and then reneged on the agreement.  This agreement needs to be honored.  
You can't prove 'innocence' without the complaint being known.  The lawyers have told the Medical Board this for 20 years - that with the confidential physician complaint system, everyone gets into the confidential complaint business.  Complaints are filed by ex-spouses, business associates, insurance companies that don't want to pay the physician, colleagues that you didn't sleep with or refer enough patients to, physicians counter-complain when they get their complaint - and the Board is left holding the bag of bills for these disagreements.  In one case the bill is over $500,000 after 20 years - and the woman MD did nothing wrong to patients.  
Confidential complaints that are 20-years old can be opened - you can't sue - no judge would allow the case in any court.  This is unnecessary stupidity.  And no one knows what the problem was as the physician was a really good physician - who just didn't 'do it' with Dr. Nice.    
Many of the false cases - the physician did nothing except to not go along with wrong care.  Which a physician is professionally trained not to do.   
Open the complaints - where the statute of limitations is over - and solve the problems.  You can't discuss when no one knows what the issues are or what started this.  Honor the agreements made to certain physicians in 1998-9.  Thank you.   									",Doctors

The Medical Board of Ohio has not allowed this woman MD her credentials, her license, a decent job (per Mr. Dilling she was supposed to work in labs until she would admit things and lie for the boys), or appropriate medical care - she has an untreated bone problem.  The medical insurance of physicians falsely accused by the State Medical Board of Ohio goes in the first month of suspension - maybe it will be covered under Obamacare?  
Psychiatric GOES: All the Medical Board is into is serial psychiatric 'goes' (that is the Ohio Board 'name' for it) - putting woman MD 'dates' or dating history into public records at taxpayer expense, fictionalizing stories on the website of behavior that never occurred as the woman MD wasn't even in the state.  
This should not be on Ripoff, it should not happen.  This is about legalized fraud, legitimized fraud - and yes, Dave Board & Governor Kasich are involved.  So schedule a meeting, get to the issues, and solve the problems at the State Medical Board of Ohio - it's been 3 years.  There are only 7/9 MD appointments, and Anita Steinbergh's 20-years are up on 4.28.2013.  But Anita Steinbergh is perpetually on her cellphone, or telling women MDs what books to read, and to lie to get your license back - not her problem.
Disagreeing about wrong care done to yourself is a MD licensure 'thing' in Ohio - because medical care of women is so outdated in Ohio.  And no woman wants to be a public humiliation - a public 'A' for adultery that she refused to do with Mrs. Nice's husband.  In Ohio, the 'scarlet letter' is for saying 'No' in a state of horrible permissiveness and moral lack.  The woman MD, to get her medical license back, has to refer to Dr. Nice - and we all know that is not because he does good orthopedic care.  Referrals should be to the best orthopedic, not to the state 'fool.'    
Nothing is ever discussed, everyone just hangs up and calls the woman MD psychiatric names - she didn't want to have to disagree with her own care being out-of-date.  Again: NO WOMAN MD WANTS TO HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH A MALE - from a male Governor, to a male MD to Dave Board - the woman MD should be caring for patients, doing her CME, having a family, and having a life.  But she can't, because the Governor's Office won't admit the problems.  Her life is in limbo - no one knows what the case is about - it's 'confidential' - for 20 years.  And it isn't about her patient care.  
Ripening of wrist fractures, experimental casts, and no blood work is just not even 1950s care.  The answer: open the outdated 'confidential' complaints and solve the problems, remove the piles of fabrications online at the Medical Board's website - the woman MD was not 'seductive' with two wrist fractures - wrist fractures are not eyeliner, makeup, or attractive.  The case was supposed to be 'opened for reforms' in 1998-9, and no one knows why it 'didn't happen' as the woman MD agreed to getting her license back, but no damages - the 'dream solution' was refused.  
It's not like there haven't been boxes of emails, and letters, begging for some sanity and rules of something - never answered except to comply with the ORDER OF 2003.  Before that there was the ORDER of 1992, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2003 - all for just disagreeing about awful 'boys being boys' care - not for patients, just that the woman MD didn't want this for herself as it didn't work.  
If the 'boys' wanted to do this care on other patients, she couldn't stop that - she was trying to set an example of 'good care' with her own care - like other physicians have tried to change medicine by changing their own care (ie H. pylori where the physicians gave the infection to themselves to prove a point about better treatment).  And today in April 2013, the Medical Board, and Governor's Office, will read the Ripoff post and do nothing.  Dave Board will hang up - the posts will stop the day there is a schedule of a meeting to discuss - hasn't happened in 3 years.
In a meeting with Mr. Dilling in 2003, it was admitted that the Medical Board paid for experts to cheat and lie in testimony during two Hearings (1992 & 1995) - for experts to fabricate fictional test results and psychiatric diagnoses that didn't exist.  But the case wasn't dismissed for some reason.   
The Ohio Court of Appeals tried to throw the case out in 1993, but the Medical Board restarted the mess.  The Ohio Court of Appeals told the Ohio Medical Board to 'end this case' in 'another way' - not as a discipline - but 'fixing' the problems - that was in 1993.  That the woman MD was 'ganged up on' when she had to disagree about her own care - care that she was trained NOT to do in this way.  
Writings on Ripoff will stop when the Governor starts a discussion, some meetings to find out what the case is about and how the problems can be solved at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  And if things are not fixed, the American Association of Physicians & Surgeons has scheduled a suit of the Ohio Medical Board - so fix things so Ohio doesn't have to go through what the Texas Medical Board is going through.  
The woman MD's family had to get an expert from NYC to say that the Ohio diagnosis didn't exist in Hearing #2.  And the only message that gets through to Govenor Kasich is if you post on RIPOFF.  God Almighty he should be more sensitive, more aware, more gubernatorial. 
It costs $50,000 to have a Hearing (for a physician falsely accused), and $50,000 to pay the DSM expert to redo all the tests cheated on by Ohio experts.  The State Medical Board is allowed to cheat - it is a legislative joke.  The woman MD's family paid and paid for piles of lies to be debunked in Columbus - the Medical Board has nothing else to do but 'frame' a woman MD for obecting to Dr. Nice care - a woman MD who does better-than-average Internal Medicine care for Ohio.  
The Medical Board takes out the better MDs, and leaves the dregs who will do anything, say anything and approve any care - even without consent.  The woman MD did not consent to ripening of her fractures, experimental casts, or refuse a workup that Ohio physicians didn't know how to do.  But then all they have to do is 'call the Mayo Clinic' - and Ohio physicians can't even place a phone call.
The Governor's office can't place a phone call, they just hang up on phone calls and read Ripoff to find out why the woman MDs are mad - because they are publicly humiliated, mistreated, and trashed for testosterone high-fives - they 'showed' that woman MD, just like the boys in Steubenville.  They are all Steubenville boys.
Ohio orthopedics can't order cast materials, don't know what the correct cast padding is, haven't heard of bone density testing, don't believe in vitamin D levels, and we have a Medical Board that goes along with this.  
Governor Kasich laughs in the background while his staff says 'No, he won't do that' - when you call.  Governor Kasich can't review the problems at the State Medical Board: no statute of limitations, the Board can cheat, no rules of evidence, no due process, women MDs are ordered to unending psychiatric 'goes,' and 'confidential' complaints are leaked to Board 'friends.'  
You get hung up on, called names, and trashed for getting a MD in Ohio.  And David Board wants it to stop: but nothing has been done for the last 3 years to improve things - the Board appointees are not even up-to-date.  Anita Steinbergh DO has been re-appointed for 20 years, and she hates women MDs and couldn't get into Medical School, and is 'friends' with Dr. Nice - who gets to do care that no one has ever heard of.  Ohio medical care has eponyms like Dr. Love and Dr. Nice.    
It's a 20-year $500,000 joke; trash women MDs for the guys - just like the footballers in Steubenville.  Women MDs are to be date raped (procedures done without consent at Case Dental Faculty Practice or University Green Road).  Women MDs are miscasted, left uncasted, no blood work, no career, and no anything.  
Well the way to stop this is for the Medical Board, and the physician, to sit down and discuss and solve the care problems - 10 psychiatric evaluations of a normal woman MD won't 'fix' things and is not the answer.  The Order of 2003 is a joke - multiple orders have been complied with, and it never ends because the Board is liable - so get a non-suit agreement for the woman MD to sign.  Have a way to end cases that are false at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  
Currently, there is no way to get physicians back to work.  And no one wants this posted on Ripoff - but it will be until there is an end - then Ripoff takes things down.  And hopefully all physicians in Ohio will have a way to end false complaints about themselves, without $.5M in debt and 20 years.  
Governor Kasich knew about this case, and the 'stack' of false cases, before taking the oath of office.  And it is the worst case in the US at any Medical Board - a woman MD wasting her life calling the Governor's Office - no patient complaints - she couldn't go along with Dr. Nice care.  But she complained to get her medical records to the Cleveland Clinic or Mayo Clinic - hardly a crime.  
The 'confidential' complaint is her medical record apparently - it alleges that she has some impairment that keeps Ohio - not orthopedics in NY - orthopedics from casting her fractures correctly or ordering blood work.  There's a problem with women's care in Ohio.  So Dave Board if you want this to stop: open the complaint and lets get to the bottom of what is the problem.  But 20 years of begging hasn't gotten anywhere, and as Mr. Whitehouse put it, 'the statute of limitations is over.'  And your office has done nothing Mr. David Board.  There's Dr. Nice care, the Medical Board, and David Board.    
Well Kimberly Anderson is not going to review the stack of false cases, and orders of 2003 don't apply.  There are only so many times that you can psychiatrically evaluate a woman MD because she wouldn't go along with bad care, work with an idiot, sign a pile of lies, or 'understand Dr. Nice because his wife didn't.  The truth: no one understands Dr. Nice in Cleveland - not his wife, his staff, his patients, or any other physician at his hospital.  
Cases where the woman MD has been told by the Medical Board that she is 'probably innocent,' but nothing is ever resolved as there (1) is no statute of limitations, and (2) no way to get women MDs back to work after a gap for fraud - no way to re-educate and stop the lies - the Board won't admit mistakes, misinformation, and just lies on the Medical Board website - and the Governor's Office has finally noticed.  Per David Board - they won't talk until it stops, and nothing can stop or end until the Governor's Office stops it.  For 20 years the woman MD has been lied about for politics and amusement - lies that are unimaginable, horrible, and wrong.  Take down the rot on the Board's website.  It's a disgrace.
The State Medical Board has been doing fraud cases for 20 years; taking medical licenses because women won't 'do it' with Dr. Nice.  So sit down and discuss, open the 'confidential' complaint and if the physician did not know the complainers or could not do what they asked - the case is over.  
Grow up David Board - this woman has lost her life to fraud for 20 years - while you sit with a job and hang up on her.  It wasn't about her patient care - she didn't want her fractures ripened, or experimentally casted, didn't want any tooth drillings for x-rays from 3 years ago by Muslim dentists at Case Western Dental School of Foreign Dentistry.  There was no blood work - as women MDs don't deserve blood work in Ohio (quote Mr. Dilling).  The woman MD has begged that people sit down for 20 years, with the complaint and find out what happened and what can be done to stop the lies.  
There is no way to end cases at the State Medical Board of Ohio except after 20 years and signing piles of lies.  There is no way to correct the misinformation on the Medical Board's website - information that the Medical Board has known to be false for 20 years.  This case was about wrong care, in part done in a Board Member's ER at Hillcrest Hospital (wrong triage), and a Board Member's 'friends' at Hillcrest & University Hospitals (Cleveland).  The end has to come from Governor Kasich, ie reforms that he promised 3 years ago.
  
There is no review of anything, David Board hangs up, the 'confidential' complaint has never shown up - how can anyone be positive?  The woman MD had Boards in Internal Medicine, and a wasted career, for objecting to Dr. Nice care and because she wouldn't refer to him, understand him because his wife didn't, and play along.  
Playing along with Dr. Nice is not what you go to Medical School for.  Governor Kasich, David Board, Kimberly Anderson and Anita Steinbergy DO have been asked to DISCUSS for 20 years - and it never ends.  The woman MD has undergone 5 psychiatric evaluations for Dr. Nice - that she didn't 'like' Dr. Nice - that not criteria for a psychiatric evaluation.  All the State Medical Board of Ohio is about is DR. NICE.   
The State Medical Board of Ohio is the worse Medical Board in the US: 'confidential' physician complaints, no statute of limitations, boys being boys care - Governor Kasich has to decide to fix this.  The women MD who got caught in this has tried in every possible way to end things in a civilized manner without more psychiatric evaluations, ridiculous orders, and with some 'reforms' to allow physicians to work with the Medical Board of Ohio.  These postings will stop the day that Governor Kasich sets up a meeting for discussions, for reforms, and to end the false cases at the State Medical Board - which is not today.",Doctors

										My visit to Dr. Ondash was the worst experience I have ever had at a doctors appointment. I would not recommend him to anyone. 
On the day of 12/24/2012 I arrived at the doctors office forty-five minutes early. Set in the waiting room an hour and a half. After finally being called back, set undressed for over thirty minutes, and was told to get dress the doctor was not going to see me today, because he was on call for someone else and needed to go to the hospital. However, he will write my prescription I needed for blood pressure pills. He came in, and put the intake information I filled out into the computer.  I received my prescription and left.  I should have found out who was on call for him, while he is on call for someone else.
This is the treatment I received from Dr. Ondash, with him knowing I needed a check-up, because I was told to see my primary after an urgent care visit for my heart. 
I received a billing statement stating I owe $30.00 co-payment. I was informed on appointment date that there will be no charge to me. Moreover, I am being charged for services that was not received. Therefore, it is fraudulently to charge the insurance company, or myself for a New Patient, Level 2 visit. On the grounds that I never received a check-up of any kind. 
I spoke with your billing representative Larisa, whom informed me that I had to pay a fee even if I did not receive my new patient check-up. That if I had received the check-up it would have been free, since I did not it is a fee, this is unethical billing practices. This office has offered me the opportunity to pick-up  my prescription on two different occasion without seeing the doctor, I chose to wait on the appointment date because I have to drive from Las Vegas to Vista, Ca. After all I went through now they are charging me for what I could have received at no charge. 
To top it all off I drove from Las Vegas to be at that doctor appointment, had to stay in a hotel, because I wanted to be seen by someone I could continue to see after I move to San Diego. Dr. Ondash did not give me a physical, after I invested time and money getting to San Diego, now I am asked to pay for services that was not rendered.									",Doctors

										Kimberly Anderson, graduate of Capital University Law School, is the Interim Director of the State Medical Board of Ohio.  She has a past case of a woman MD with no patient complaints, who was mistreated by Ohio physicians who didn't know what she had, until the woman MD complained.  The ORDERS have been followed but the Medical Board has admitted cheating at least twice in Hearing testimony.  No one can do anymore orders about a case where no one knows what the case is - the woman MD had no patient complaints.  
The woman MD's license was suspended for not handling Ohio malpractices with 'grace,' and saying to 'call the Mayo Clinic.' Why?  The woman MD's cousin had the same problem - and concurrently was being treated at Mayo Clinic - so all the Ohio orthopedics & Medical Board idiots had to do was allow the Mayo Clinic to take over the case and sign-off.  The Ohio orthopedics just could not spend 5 minutes to sign off the case in between sex and personal needs - the Dr. Nice habits.
All the 'statute of limitations' people at the Medical Board had to do was 'call the Mayo Clinic' and learn a little Medicine.  But Dr. Steinbergh spends her time reading bestsellers & saying that it's not her fault that woman MDs are threatened when the guys goof.  But the guys don't have to goof if they just place a call or order a consult.  
So this case that isn't a case, has gone through 20 years, wasted the career of the woman MD, destroyed her health.  There have been about 10 orders to do ridiculous things by physicians that don't understand what the woman MD has - but it isn't psychiatric and the Medical Board has not gotten that message in 20 years.  After 5 psychiatric evaluations for disagreeing with Dr. Nice.  All the evaluations talk about is Dr. Nice - and who is Dr. Nice? 
Constituent Affairs is a bunch of boys that don't know Medicine anymore than Kimberly Anderson knows any Medicine.  But if someone took her job without allowing proper fracture care & blood work - there'd be a million dollar suit.  The woman MD is not allowed care that is allowed to Kimberly Anderson or Dave Board - she's just beaten up in MD offices and trashed in public records - the 'seductive' MD with two wrist fractures who couldn't comb her hair.
It's not about another ORDER - the Board cheated, the case is ridiculous, and it's 20 years - the statute of limitations is over.  Could someone please give Governor Kasich the message? No one can sue anyone at this point - given the message to Dave Board - is about getting the license and keeping the woman from dying of malpractice & stupid physicians.  Dr. Steinbergh could not get into Medical School, ditto probably Dave Board.  Kimberly Anderson could not get into a more than 1/5 star Law School - she sounds like a first grade teacher lecturing school yard kids.   ",Doctors

										Psychiatric evaluations are being misused at the State Medical Board of Ohio - in multiples of 2.  
Anita Steinbergh DO - current Medical Board President has misused them to protect 'friend' physicians - Dr. Nice - whose wife she knows.  And she's probably going to be re-appointed, because Governor Kasich is stupid medically - and hasn't a clue.  Anita Steinbergh thinks that the answer to 'bone pains' is to read ICEBOUND ie New York Times Bestsellers & lie to get your license back.  There is a workup that has to be done for bone pains BEFORE a license is taken - not 10 or 20 years later.  And we can't comply with an outdated 2003 order - where no one knows what the case is about - except Dr. Nice.  
You have to pay experts because the experts for the Ohio Board cheat & lie - are allowed to cheat & lie.  Every Hearing costs $50,000 for the physicians and for the Board - it's a waste of time when the problem is that the woman MD didn't just want to sleep with Dr. Nice a la every other piece of flesh at Hillcrest Hospital.  Mrs. Nice put up with this, allowed to her children to see this behavior.
It's all about feeling 'sorry' for Mrs. Nice at the Medical Board when women MDs report his bad care, his sexual comments, and that they tried to speak with Mrs. Nice and tried to get referred to prevent things.  But psychiatric evaluations have to be ordered AFTER care-to-function - which includes blood work, x-rays, and consultations.  They take licenses because women MDs don't like fractures without casts, to do sex that way, to 
Women MDs in Ohio - not DOs - have explain and re-explain themselves as Dr. Nice hits on the neighbors with his obsession to his personal sexual needs.  This is not the fault of a female colleague - no one makes Dr. Nice think seductive thoughts.
The one woman MD tried to speak with Mrs. Nice - at a party - and her mother tried at a polo demonstration - both Nices did not get the message.  The woman MD was not interested in a three-some, or hanging with a married MD, and told the orthopedic to find a male Internist to work with - not her.  The woman MD's family paid $100 for the donation to the Polo Demonstration, so that the mother of the woman MD could 'speak' to Dr. Nice that the phone calls to her daughter at all hours 'for patient care' were not appropriate.  20 years later the Medical Board still does not get the message - this was not the woman MD's fault and the discipline of her for this needs to stop.  And it is about sex - which Constituent Affairs does not want to hear - but there was no orthopedic care that was worth even billing for.  So what do males hang around women for?  It wasn't a good professional situation, and there is no EASY way to handle this.
You don't take a woman MD's license for trying to stop the advances of a male orthpedic when she has fractures and only wants an appropriate referral.  Which the guy didn't get.  And you can't do this for 20 years blaming the woman MD for existing.  She got along with everyone who treated her professionally - patients, 700 other physicians at Hillcrest, got through Medical School and was friends with a Dean - this is not a bipolar or personality disorder.  This is a situational problem of abuses of guys first.  And it's not a psychiatry 'thing.'  The personality disorder psychiatrist expert in the US - from Columbia-Presbyterian - tried to tell the Medical Board & Anita Steinbergh DO this in 1995-6.  Anita Steinbergh could have met with him personally - but she didn't have the time.  And all he answered questions about was 'why the woman MD didn't like Dr. Nice.'  Well Dr. Nice is not a hand, or general orthopedic, he does hips-and-knees and was trying to do a wrist fracture for unknown reasons.    
It's not the psychiatry problem of the women MDs, or RNs, that Dr. Nice goes after.  And 2003 psychiatry orders, when the woman MD was not allowed blood work before her medical license was taken - so that Dr. Nice could get 'off' his misdiagnoses & wrong treatments (bad triage) - can't be done.  The 'confidential' complaints in cases involving requests that 'Catholic girls are easy' have to be opened - what were the expectations of the woman MD.  6 psychiatric evaluations can't be legally binding without knowing what was the 'complaint.'  
Governor Kasich is allowing that Anita Steinbergh - whose term expires 4/28/2013 - misuse psychiatry evaluations to 'find a case' in a 20-year old case that is about bad orthopedic care that she's tried for 20 years to get her orthopedic 'friend' off of.  The woman MD supposedly holds a grudge that she reported the bad care so that someone would set the standard 'straight.'  These 'evaluations' are all about why the woman MD didn't 'like' Dr. Nice - well, there was nothing to like.  Dr. Nice goofed, got on the phone drunk (what they call drunk dialing), refused to send the woman MDs records, said 'nothing to do' when she was going to lose her hand, etc.  You can't start orthopedic care and not refer appropriately & professionally.      
The psychiatric evaluations & orders - when the woman had a missed thyroid problem causing the fractures - has to stop.  Dr. Nice did not think to order thyroid function tests - the woman physician was made fun of as 'unlucky.'  The thyroid tests had to be ordered by Georgetown University when she was trying to do a graduate degree - because Dr. Steinbergh would not allow them.
Dr. Steinbergh blocked a medical workup of the woman MD in 1995 - would not allowed Dr. Skodol to do this as part of a psychiatric evaluation at Columbia-Presbyterian.  What women does this kind of abuse, mischief, and withholding of needed care - only a total monster.  
Dr. Steingbergh - in her haste to psychatrically diagnose women MDs - will order the withholding of medical care & workup while issuing continual orders to have another and another psychiatric evaluation.  We have received the additional information you provided, which has been reviewed and retained for future reference.   On December 11, 2003, after carefully considering all evidence, the Board issued an Order that established the requisite conditions necessary for you to regain medical licensure in Ohio.  (Should you wish to review the Order, it can be accessed by performing a name search utilizing the licensee profile and status option on the Boards website at www.med.ohio.gov.)   When you are ready to pursue the potential restoration of your certificate to practice, please submit an application in conformance with the conditions set forth in the Order so that the Board can consider your request.   Thank you.This is what you get in an email - the application and all materials were submitted in 1997-8.  No action was every taken, and you can't keep doing this for someone else's perversity.  Tests were taken, references submitted and the only thing you get back is to 'get another psychiatric evaluation' for saying 'No' to Dr. Nice.  An application fee was paid in 1997.  
When the Board takes a license without cause, with lies, with misinformation - it is the Board's responsibility to undo the damage - no Ohio physician can pay to resubmit and resubmit applications & redo psychiatric evaluations 6 times.  The Board was told to give the license back in 1995-6.
The applications have been repeated and repeatedly submitted - the case needs to be dismissed.  It is not any woman MDs problem that an orthopedic 'doesn't have a wife who understands him,' and it isn't appropriate to continue care with that kind of needy person.  Dr. Nice & his wife were told that - this is not a licensure matter except that the care went to 'hell' when Dr. Nice would not refer.  That's not a reason to continue this argument for 20 years.  Dave Board - no one has your email.  
It's 2013, and not 2003.  In 2003, the Medical Board Director did not think that women MDs deserved blood work, medical care, gyn care - they were supposed to be psychiatrically evaluated over and over to find a case - until death.  This is beyond any ethical code, against any human anything, and just torture because the Medical Board of Ohio makes mistakes and has no capacity to deal with them - except to comply with 2003, and then comply with 2016 - like you comply with 1993, 1995, 1997, 2000, and 2003.  It's a game.  It's takes weeks and 50 calls to get ahold of Kimberly Anderson - who hasn't a clue about anything medical.   									",Doctors

										Case Faculty Practice, where faculty of the School of Dentistry practice, should be a premier dental practice, and it's a for-money-take with huge fraud - films are faked or wrong and not thrown out.  X-rays are being misused to drill on 'artifacts' that go away by the next film - in one case Dr. Assaf (from wherever) in 2013, used an x-ray from 2010 to drill on a supposed lesion that had gone away - negative x-rays in 2011 & 2012.  This going for the 'lucency' without any tooth abnormality or pain - is killing teeth.  Allergic reactions are significant to the composite that they use - generalized rashes, petechial rashes - and there is no skin testing, no call backs.  
The foreign dentists & residents - many of them Muslim are not willing to discuss anything with women patients - will drill with x-rays YEARS old.  Irrelevant x-rays.  How can you drill on a tooth were the 'lesion' isn't there anymore - they will try and they will bill - and where is the Islamic money going for this?  The residents come in with veils - which would be ok, if they didn't 'make fun' and not notice that the dentist was 'out-of-his-mind' to drill on an almost 3-year old artifact from the x-ray process or the person doing the film - saliva that caught on the 'bite.'  No recent x-rays were seen, and it was apparent only after the procedure that it was a 'take.'    
The problem seems to be oversight by the Ohio State Dental Board - where they have done nothing to stop this abuse of old films.  And that the foreign staff does not have the American ability to talk with women patients and discuss options according to the Dental Bill of Rights.  They want MONEY.
You will get an allergic reaction and they will never call you back.  They drill on 'normal' teeth.  And the problem is that where is this kind of money going with the Islamic dentists, or the Jewish, or whatever?  This is dentistry for the money and needs to stop.  And it shouldn't be used for foreign agendas.  
All of the current residents are foreign, and complete idiots that allow an x-ray to be irrelevant while they stare at an unnecessary drilling and laugh.  Why pay for x-rays?  And there are errors in x-ray development, taking the films, old film, machinery problems - when something happens on only ONE x-ray they drill or they faked the film.  And you can't say anything - it's CAVITIES.  And these were no cavities.  
In Medicine, the mantra is that you treat the patient and not the x-ray - this needs to be applied to US Dentistry - and to CWRU School of Dental Medicine and Faculty Practice.  All composite in patients allergic has to be removed at Case Faculty Practice expense.  Going at someone with a drill is as violent as it gets in Dentistry.

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614)466-3555,"Governor John Kasich  lets the Medical Board of Ohio order women MDs to serial psychiatric evaluations - without cause except that the woman MD has disagreed with wrong care, admittedly bad care - women MDs were let into O Columbus, Ohio","
										Women were let into Medical Schools in Ohio, in bigger numbers, beginning with the classes of 1980 and on.  Deans knew that this would cause troubles in that the care of women patients wasn't good.  Women were not in clinical trials of anything until the 1990s & Bernadine Healy MD.  So everything was learned from male studies, but didn't always apply - from fracture care, to thyroid, to bone problem, to just about any illness.  
In the late 1970s, at McDonald House in Cleveland, Case Western Medical School women were aghast at the abuses and attitudes on the wards.  One woman resident had her pumped breast milk thrown all over the place - like toilet paper on trees.  Women patients were left on kidney-damaging drugs (Gentamycin and other aminoglycosides) with no drug levels ordered, and no BUN or Creatinine ordered - until they practically knocked out their kidney function - it was a 'hoot'  to watch the drug nephrotoxicity happen - as in a lab rat. 
Pretty every female in the class of 1980 hit up Dean Scott with the problems - he said that we would have to change things and it would not be easy.  But he didn't think that the males would fake that the woman MD had a psychiatric disorder - because she saw the problems in her fracture care and had to complain after months of harassments.  Dr. O'Day would not take this much harassment from either of her two ex-husbands, but she would not allow this woman MD to complain.   Dr. Steinbergh doesn't take 5 minutes of the kind of abuse that she has made this woman MD take for 20 years.  It's not about aequanimitas, the care has to be improved.  You can't spend one year healing complications of wrist fractures - one of those child-bearing years.
The Medical Board of Ohio, cognizant of the problems, has been penalizing & disciplining women MDs for complaining about bad care practices - for the last 20 years.  One woman MD has had her license suspended for 20 years, and been ordered - by a Board of non-psychiatrists to repeated non-confidential psychiatric evaluations in violation of her HIPAA rights, her patient confidentiality and every human common sense & decency.  She objected to her wrist fractures being mistreated and her bone condition being laughed off as being 'unlucky' without any lab work - Neanderthal medicine.  The Medical Board of Ohio of Non-Psychiatrists is still trying to find a diagnosis of a personality problem that the woman MD was trained to speak up to 'save herself.'  
Her fracture care:  the boys laughed while they left her fractures to ripen, casted them badly without reduction or referral to any of the Hand Certified Orthopedics in Cleveland, a UH guy casted one fracture in a hockey stick 'experimental' cast (everything for male orthopedics has to look like a piece of sports equipment).  The workup - she wasn't allowed even a complete thyroid 'panel' before her license was taken in an Emergency session for the provisional diagnosis of a personality problem - objecting to admittedly wrong care.  Every other state allows care-to-function.  
The statute of limitations for the orthopedics & the Board Member involved had to expire.  The care was bad, but the Medical Board wasn't going to acknowledge or improve it, just make the woman MD 'suck up' by evaluating her so much that she would be mindless, ambitionless, and so emotionally damaged that they could take further advantage of her - and they have.  And no care in Ohio given to her in the last 20 years has been other than brief, inadequate, and demeaning - even the dentists try to take advantage - wanting to drill on a negative x-ray for fun.  
The answer to bad care, when the woman MDs can't make a point, is further discussion - not evaluation.  It's not a psychiatric disorder to object as you were trained.  Many men trained women MDs, but wouldn't stand up for the 'changes' needed.  You can't leave fractures to 'ripen,' women have different causes for fractures and you have to do a bone density test, thyroid tests have to be the whole panel & men 'miss' this point as they don't - as a gender - get thyroid problems.  There are gender differences in care.  And if you don't put adequate padding in a women's fracture, her skin will break down, her tendons will rupture, and her nerves will be damaged - all of which happened to this woman MD.
But instead of listening and stopping the bad practices - practices that Governor Kasich campaigned to stop - the Medical Board is trying to do a 'Village of the Blind' on this woman - to cut out her education about differences in care practices - to make things one global care nightmare.  Put her on some drug to stop her changing things that she was educated to change.  Most women in Medicine want better paradigms, care flow charts, and options for women patients - but they suck up.
The Medical Board of Ohio should not be ordering 6-10 psychiatric evaluations on women MDs to 'find a case' 20 years into the case.  There is no state that would not have dismissed this case by now - no state has this much money to waste on stupidity.  Governo Kasich hasn't changed this, or reviewed any of the wrong 'mistake' cases at the Medical Board of Ohio - he can't even keep up with appointments.  He's a guy.  
The Medical Board if there is no psychiatrist, should allow the psychiatrist of the woman MD to see all the files, and make recommendations.  15 years ago, the US expert on personality problems told the Medical Board to give her license back - that she had no impairment - but that the fracture situation got nasty in that it was a 'boys have to be right' situation.  The care wasn't going to work for a woman professional - even if it worked for a male physician - because of her bone problem.  But the care was much worse than a male MD would have tolerated for 5 minutes, and comments were R-rated.
The Medical Board of Ohio is not the physician of the physicians licensed - it can recommend that there be a consultation with a cardiologist, psychiatrist, or whatever - and let the psychiatrist, cardiologist, or osteopath order the procedures.  Psychiatric evaluations are procedures, with emotional damage for someone who is 'normal' and subjected to this abuse repetitively.  It brings up memories forgotten, wounds healed, and it's not recommended to discuss bad fracture care for 20 years without improving the situation and the male behaviors.  
Caring for colleague physicians is a difficult balancing act, and physicians often have 'zebra' diagnoses.  But their confidentiality (negative psychiatric evaluations should not be in public records with details from dating histories), their medical problems, and their fractures have to be handled professionally, courteously, and with the same completeness as other patients before any Medical Board actions.  The woman MD even after 5 psychiatric evaluations, has a poorly treated thyroid bone problem - the Cleveland Clinic won't treat her as they want to be 'in' with the Medical Board - they are into the PR game, not the medical care game.  The 'boys' on the Board are watching the natural history of untreated thyroiditis with bone effects - it's a game - like with the antibiotics in McDonald House.
The Medical Board has to stop evaluating women for trying to say that some of the care that is ok for males is not ok for women patients, and some of the conversations that males have with male MDs are not ok for women patients - we don't need to know that the orthopedics are having trouble with their sex lives with their wives, and not getting regular sex.  The serial evaluating, lying, cheating on Rorschach tests & making up psychiatric diagnoses to waste everyone's time and emotionally damage a woman with challenging care problems is just being 'bad.' ",Doctors

Continental Reserve Urgent Care,"  Continental Reserve Urgent Care  8333 N Silverbell Rd. 
Tucson, Arizona United States of America ",,520-202-7700,"Continental Reserve Urgent Care    Northwest Medical Urgent Care Beware, They Charge Over $7,000 per Hour Tucson, Arizona","
										Beware, this place is a viper's den that preys on anyone that has the misfortune of not having insurance or having an insurance claim denial. It pretends to be an Urgent Care but bills like an ER.  An outrageously expensive ER. 
My claim was denied, for miscoding as a ""dental"" care by Northwest, so what would have been a $108 bill if paid by my insurer for a 5 minute visit was billed at $597. For 5 minutes in an Urgent Care. That is $119.40 per MINUTE or $7,164 per HOUR! 
Here's what else it did and probably does as a matter of course: it does not disclose its ""chargemaster"" (its billing schedule),  it charged 2 office visits ($325.88 and $219,25 respectively) when there was only one 5 minute visit and it  charged $52.12 for a blood sugar test using a strip that doesn't even cost a $1.00. 
When you take Northwest to task on the bill, they all duck and run. You do, however, get a nice letter from the CEO Kevin Stockton about how ""sorry"" he is and how much he appreciates the feedback. Sorry for sure. After I complained, they offered to reduce the charges ""as a patient relations gesture"" to a mere $5,016.48 per hour or $83.61 a minute. What arrogance! 
Health Care providers are one of the major culprits responsible for our health care crisis. Northwest is certainly doing its best to make it even worse.
Find another Urgent Care to go to and when you do, ask for their rates in advance. These guys are bandits pretending to serve.									",Doctors

										Dr. Paul Salinas of Frisco Spine in Frisco TX disabled me permanently for life. 
Dr. Paul Salinas misdiagnosed my case and elected an aggressive surgery when a radiology report stated surgery wasn't necessary at this time. I was alone in the hospital on strong medication and given only one option, ""Surgery"". Had I not been on medication I would have been in sound mind to seek other means of treatment that were less evasive than the ""only"" option Dr. Paul Salinas provided. Both of my legs were working normal before the surgery. I woke up after surgery with my right leg completely paralyzed. Dr. Paul Salinas cut & damaged a nerve in my right leg leaving me paralyzed & damaged from ever being repaired. Dr. Paul Salinas told me that it would take 2 years for my nerves to repair. Today I only gained back 40% use of my right leg thanks to Dr. Paul Salinas. I have lost over 60% use of my right leg. [continued below]....
									
										.....
I went to another surgeon to try to repair the damage Dr. Paul Salinas caused during his surgery. The new doctor ran extensive test before making the decision to cut. With a good game plan the new doctor planned a strategic approach to remove the crumbing product and replace it with new FDA approved product. I was notified Dr. Paul Salinas used non FDA approved product in my back which had to be removed 10 months later by another neurosurgeon that found the non FDA approved product in my back ""crumbling"". Dr. Salinas used an old method to do a 360 fusion approach stated by the neurosurgeon that completely removed the materials Dr. Paul Salinas placed in my back. Dr. Paul Salinas used an Infuse product by Medtronix which has now a class action lawsuit for being a bad product. My doctor found mixed matched parts not approved by the FDA, some being Medtronics and some parts that were not meant to be used with the Infuse that were non FDA approved in my back which was the reason the fusion was crumbling. By using products that were not FDA approved to be used together is the reason why my fusion did not take & was crumbling.
I have seen numerous specialists and again insurance has spent over 2 million in hopes to improve my quality of life. I live in pain daily from both physical & mental thanks to the damage Dr. Paul Salinas, MD of Frisco Spine in Frisco, TX.
Dr. Paul Salinas has shown no mercy or compassion. He is the most inhumane doctor I have ever met.

Dr. Paul Salinas took me to court, suing me for non payment. He claimed $19,100 for his surgery that left me paralyzed for the rest of my life. I wasn't going to pay for services that destroyed my life. My current insurance company has paid out over 2 million dollars to try to correct the physical damage Dr. Paul Salinas caused to my body.

										I returned to the clinic post surgery as directed by my doctor for routine examinations and to have the sutures removed from the incisions and reported to the doctor at some time thereafter that I was still experiencing pain from the carpal tunnel which he at some point perscribed steriods to eleviate this pain. It became apparent to me that I was going to be returning only to pay for further exams that to me were nonproductive toward oleaviating my pain in my hand. To date I still have a high level of pain on a continuous basis and at times there are stabing sharp pains which awaken me during the night. The price tag associated with these surgeries/followups, etc. were to me exterme to say the least which I related to my doctor. Brown's administrative department billed my insurance company which I later discovered from them that they submitted as part of they're claim that one of the surgeries they had performed was not necessary; therefore my insurance company elected nonpayment understandably. I had a communication with their attorney relating all this information and I was told that their billing department was having some issues and they would get back with me regarding this situation. Brown resubmitted the claim again as an unneccessary surgery and again payment was denied. My insurance compamy related to me that they would gadly have paid the claim had it been properly submitted. They're attorney reccommended that I schedule an appointment with yhe doctor there for an evaluation and followup. Why on earth would I allow the very individual who created my problem administer to me any further? They are still billing me and I still have the pain in my hand and I cringe when there is any pressure placed against the ball of my hand, i.e. a hand shake, gripping things or pushing anything.

Governor John Kasich,"  Governor John Kasich  Riffe Center, 30th floor 77 South High Street 
Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614)466-3555,"Governor John Kasich  has the Medical Board take the MD licenses of women who are 'hurt' by Members, their hospitals, or their friends - to prevent suits, allow the statute of limitations to expire, or for payouts of appoi Columbus, Ohio","
										Governor Kasich is the Governor of serial psychiatric evaluations - when his Medical Board takes a MD license on provisional-hypothetical, and the complaint falls through - he then allows the Medical Board the use of serial psychiatric evaluations to find anything that can be used to 'make a diagnosis.'  There's nothing to DISCUSS.  The Governor's office tells you to discuss, and you can't get anyone from the Medical Board on the phone.   The Medical Board of Ohio has no policy to admit a mistake, pay damages for re-education & re-licensure of wrong physicians, and get the physician back to work - because they can keep the case going.  With another psychiatric evaluation - the excuse to neverend a case.  This is unlike any other US state.  Jobs for wrongly accused MDs in Ohio are not a Kasich priority.  
The criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis differ in Ohio, and psychiatrists working for the Medical Board of Ohio can invent diagnoses, fix psychiatric tests, make up Rorschach answers or lose them - they cheat and it's a local Columbus legislative joke.  All the State Legislators know that the Medical Board cheats on cases - and that the 'confidential' complaint system allows this.  
Political cases can be put ahead of boxes of complaints about physicians with multiple patient complaints - if a Board Member is involved in the wrong care.  Complaints against Board Members are roundfiled - which is why Member physicians try to stay on the Board - the worse of a physician that they are, the better that they can 'fix' things.  There's no recusal for conflicts of interest - its all about the conflicts of interest.  There's no point system, it's purely whimsical, political, the Board Member's choice.  And how can non-medical Board Members know anything about what constitutes malpractice, negligence, or standards of medical care?  They don't.   Governor Kasich's wife, should get a signed 'no-evaluation' clause.  The Rorschach is not a reliable psychiatric test, but it is the only test used to take a medical license in some Ohio Medical Board cases.  Judges in a civil court can't use that test for anything - it says more about the evaluator, than it does the person taking the test.  Any state agency using that test is just 'faking' things.  And Mrs. Kasich - if Governor Kasich does this to innocent women MDs - he'll do it to you and your daughters.  Psychiatric evaluations are being used to get women MDs to submit to bad care practices, bad sexual practices, and to ruin any 'moral compass' that they might have had about things.    
The US expert on personality disorders, a co-author of the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Psychiatry, has told the Medical Board of Ohio to stop this since 1995-6.  That they can do serious emotional damage to the MD with this technique - it's 'Russian psychiatry' after all - do an evaluation until you find a diagnosis - no matter that the Board Members have obvious diagnoses.  
Kimberly Anderson has a inordinate interest in the personal information of female physicians - she's obsessed with finding fault in ways that she could not survive the scrutiny.  And you can't get her on the phone.
No Member of the present Medical Board of Ohio would survive 6 psychiatric evaluations - and the male MDs get away with saying that they just won't 'play' this game.  As many psychiatrists go into Psychiatry to avoid diagnosis of themselves, Medical Board Members are there to prevent disciplinary actions against themselves.  Kimberly Anderson is there for the salacious details - which is a kind of perversion.  If she can't find them, she invents them as in one case where the woman physician with two wrist fractures was so 'seductive' that Dr. Nice could not cast her properly.  That's made up -- it's bad fiction.   
But this out-of-the-book psychiatry continues under Interim Director Kimberly Anderson & President Anita Steinbergh.  Anita Steinbergh DO is 'obsessed' with finding a diagnosis in the case of one woman MD - $500,000 state monies obsessed - to the point of disagreeing with 3 national psychiatric experts.  And the woman - Dr. Steinbergh - couldn't get into Medical School.  She's running the State Medical Board of Ohio, and has been re-appointed 4 times as the Governors can't find another DO?  Any day now, Governor Kasich will come out with her 5th appointment - she's setting a Tiger Woods record as far as State Medical Boards & cases that don't end after 20 years.  In any other state, even a physician with a patient death doesn't have their medical license suspended for 20 years, and isn't mandated 6 psychiatric evaluations by state pre-fixe experts.   
Governor Kasich is doing nothing to stop the practice of the misuse of psychiatry at the Medical Board - he won't order a legal panel review of the 'stack' of innocent physician cases - cases where the 'confidential' complaint didn't pan out against the physician.  His staff in his office tell you this, ie that you are supposed to discuss with the Medical Board.  Discuss means that you have to get them on the phone, or into a meeting room.  
Well, when the State Medical Board can keep ordering psychiatric evaluations of a physician, and you can't get the 'confidential' complaint, you can't resolve the case - and you have no bargaining power to get the Medical Board to a discussion or arbitration - because they can continually 'change' the case to 'find a case' - and the Medical Board tells you this when you call.  But you can't get anything on paper to file a suit.  These physician cases have a virtual reality case - no one knows what the physician did or how to resolve things.  It's not about patient care.  And does the 'confidential' complaint really exist - no one has seen it lately.There's no 3-judge review panel mandating a fair review of anything - with any 'binding' power over the Medical Board of Ohio - the Medical Board of Ohio is an arbitrary power unto itself.  But the Medical Board of Ohio is bankrupt with these serial cases & psychiatric evaluations, and is going to start bankrupting Ohio with this rot.  
Governor Kasich's office is naive about what is going on at the State Medical Board, and at same time allowing the abuses to defer 'settlements' on hundreds of false cases investigated and acted upon by the Medical Board in biased ways - without due process.  The Medical Board doesn't even have a full Board at this time, the appointments are late, and the Governor's Office is hiding the problems.  
Most states have done away with the 'confidential' physician complaint system - they don't have the money for this 'game' of disciplining physicians 'confidentially.'  You have to give a name, and have your credentials verified as knowing the physician & being able to accuse, before filing any physician complaint in Rhode Island at the Medical Board.  Ohio has the highest number of physician disciplines per physicians licensed.   
Because the physician is never allowed to directly respond to the complaint, or to give the 'connections' of the individuals signing the complaint,  the cases can't be resolved.  In one case, the accusing physicians did malpractice on the physician - they kept her fractures uncasted, made fun of her at the hospital, and wanted her to 'do it' with one of the orthopedics as sort of a ritual of passage.  Date rape just continues in Ohio at the Medical Board - the Steubenville kids learn from the Governor & his staff how to have a party and get away with the 'date rape' under anesthesia.  You can't resolve a case with the State Medical Board of Ohio when you don't know the complaint, it keeps changing, or the Medical Board is allowed to order a 6th, 7th, or 10th psychiatric evaluation of you.   
The Medical Board uses the 'psychiatric evaluation' get-out-of-liability-free card after 'confidential complaints' don't pan out - leading to huge costly investigations over many years.  Kimberly Anderson has, until recently, been in charge of those inappropriate expensive investigations.  So put the woman leaking the budget of Ohio in charge of the Ohio Board?  It's like putting the Vatileaks in charge of the Vatican Bank.  It's a nonsensical appointment.  
Neither Governor Kasich, nor his Medical Board Staff, can be described as 'normal' in this.  ",Doctors

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614)466-3555,"Governor John Kasich  the only Governor to allow the political abuse of 'Russian psychiatry' at the State Medical Board - where you allow the repeated psychiatric evaluation of women MDs with no patient complaints - causin Columbus, Ohio","
										Governor Kasich thinks it is funny that the State Medical Board go after women MDs with repeated psychiatric evaluations - they call it 'GOES' in Ohio - for objecting to wrong care & R-rated sexual comments - for trying to get the 'right' care for themselves without the running testosterone commentary.  His whole staff embraces Russian psychiatry for politics.  There are no mistakes in Ohio medical care - you just get evaluated until you can't SPEAK them.       
Nothing at the State Medical Board is about patient care - it's about having the right dumbed down personality - where you are so stupid that you can't disagree.  The Medical Board of Ohio is where Russian psychiatry is used to go after medical dissidents - women who disagree with fracture care from Nice & Keith (ripening fractures & experimental casts) - not real dissidents, just women who studied in Medical School & Residency.  The Ohio Medical Board is where careers are 'tabled' on the basis of old-wives-tale beliefs about 'good care' for women - beliefs that women just 'make too much' all the time.  Women don't get blood work, and if they do, women MDs should order their own and be quiet about it - women don't need blood work (Dilling, Whitehouse).  
Then after 5-6 psychiatric evaluations, there's no strength left to argue points anymore - so the same-old same-old bad care continues in Ohio.  There's no improving anything - even the procedures at the Medical Board are antediluvian, archaic, and biased.  Ohio is the worst Medical Board in the US for abuses of psychiatry, power, and old-boy stuff.
When you've been gone at > 5 times with 'goes,' your personal everything published, your PAP smears & dating life in public records - the question is how do you recover from this loss of 'boundaries' - the loss of sense in your life?  And this is what a career in Medicine was supposed to be?  You are so humiliated that you have no bargaining power - Governor Kasich's staff hangs up on you, and the boys & girls want another and another go - the talking head staff spouts the party line -  everyone wants to find a case after 20 years of the Medical Board not being able to 'find a case.'  That the woman MD holds a grudge for what has been done to her is the classic 'case.'  Well, who wouldn't?  The Medical Board of Ohio needs Glasnost reforms.
Governor Kasich needs to get an epiphany about what is really going down at the Medical Board - to start an enlightenment of tolerance for woman professional opinions.  The Deans at Case Western Reserve Medical School have encouraged women for the last 40 years - encouraged them to think independently, to be leaders, and not to take bad comments.  What good was that if it was just for the suspension/discipline stats?    
But continuing the Russian psych approach punishment in Ohio - the Anderson-Steinbergh-Talmadge way - will not work.  The appointments, policies, and rulings of the State Medical Board of Ohio need to be improved - starting with the Membership and the 'confidential' physician complaint rule.  How can one fight, or resolve, a disagreement if one doesn't know what the case is about, who said what, and there is a continual effort to lie and cheat?  The Medical Board admits that they cheat on cases, but so what - CHEATING is a part of life at the State Medical Bord - they are never made to pay damages or recompense.    
When the physician complaints are 'confidential' there is no way to bring the physician and the complainers into a room to 'discuss' - before more psychiatric evaluations, 20 years, or that there is severe damage to the woman MD's health & career.  The Medical Board Members don't see the provincial 'dynamics' - and you can't rely on the local resident Board psychiatrist (Dr. Resnick) to 'get the Cleveland dynamics - unless the Executive Director & the President have the physician & complainers meet to 'hash out the problems.'  
Physicians & complainers can meet locally with a Board representative - but nothing will end until both sides come to some agreement.  Have Cleveland problems meet with the closest Board Member to discuss in a Cleveland area meeting establishment - mandatory that the complainers & the complained about physician meet face to face to see what the cases are really about, ie sex, money, office space, patient referrals, sex.  This should happen before any provisional or hypothetical suspension. 
This is especially important if this is a colleague complaint that deals with personality issues.  No matter how strong a woman MD is, the males want you submissive even unto the death of yourself or a patient.  They want you like Gabby Reece in the bedroom, and the hospital is not a home or 'family' situation - one bad decision can cost a life or a limb.  You can't be the physician co-pilot not telling the pilot MD/DO that he/she has run out of gas.    
Resolution options for cases need to be improved, and physicians need to get back to work and doing patient care - not compiling stats or going at each other for referrals, power, and money.  This includes Board Members, who are supposed to be representative of, and helpful to physicians - helping everyone keep their daytime jobs and livelihoods - for tax purposes if nothing else.  
No medical license, barring a patient death, should be taken for more than several months - to get the gist of the problem, give the options, and have a resolution - 2 pages not 20.  You can't re-educate physicians from lenghthy licensure suspensions - the costs are astronomical even for MESNA IQ physicians.  There's never going to be the perfect report from any psychiatric evaluation - the Medical Board will never be completely exonerated from doing the wrong thing for whatever reasons - even the right ones.  Yes the physician might have over-reacted, but the Medical Board should have had medical mistake laws & policies to handle problems of women getting care that is better for guys - in at least one case.    
The coffers of the State Medical Board of Ohio are depleted and ransacked from bad decisions, bad cases, and the abuse of power - while Governor Kasich, and his staff, laugh and spout one liners about 'another psychiatric evaluation.'  And that physician had no patient complaints, no drug/alcohol, no CME violations - she just objected to wrong care and 'boys' went at her.  It's all about boys being boys, and girls being girls - no maturity, no sense, and no growing up in politics - Ohio Board Members seem to be like the Gerard Butler character in Playing For Keeps - never quite getting the picture or the responsibility of being a Board Member.  The punishments should fit the crime; complaining about care to get the physicians to refer and send the medical records is not a reason to suspend a medical license - that's not the law.

Governor John Kasich,"  Governor John Kasich  Riffe Center, 30th floor 77 South High Street 
Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.go,(614)466-3555,"Governor John Kasich  appoints the fools at the Medical Board that take licenses of women-MDs with no patient complaints, based on provisional-hypothetical, then subject the MDs to >5 psychiatric evaluations to find a pers Columbus, Ohio","
										Contact forms at www.governor.ohio.gov don't work - and the Governor is not keeping up with Medical Board appointments - only 7 of 9 MD Members are presently (April, 2013) appointed, and several have expiring terms this & last month.  The Medical Board of Ohio is increasingly bizarre in investigations, and actions - 'confidential' complaints allow that the credentials of the complainer are never checked, and that patient complaints of Member-friends are roundfiled and never see the light of day.  But the main problem is the misuse of Russian psychiatry to get a 'case' against physicians - the misordering of psychiatric evaluations for sport.The Ohio State Medical Board is a political Board with no checks & balances - the Ohio Court of Appeals can never ever (like in Taylor Swift songs) get the files on cases - they just have to 'reverse' and 'remand.'  The Ohio Board, and the Court of Appeals, are never ever getting 'together.'  Which wastes time, money, and the substantial judicial skills on the Ohio Court of Appeals - reversing cases does not use the judgment skills of the Ohio Court of Appeals to reform the Medical Board practices - to stop the roundabouts from the Medical Board mistakes and falsified psychiatric evaluations - one case had a falsified Rorschach and a psychiatric diagnosis that did not exist - which the Medical Board was going to make the woman MD get treated for of course.  The Ohio Medical Board cheats on cases & evaluations - they admit it.There is no review of the merit of cases decided by the Ohio Medical Board, except to sue the Board - and physicians getting this far have no funds left.  Suing the State Medical Board when you can't get the complaint to find out what the case is about, is an art form.    Governor Kasich, shortsighted as usual, has refused to appoint an EXTERNAL REVIEW BOARD (there are plenty of extra judges in Columbus), to review Medical Board cases that have gone on over 10, and 20 years, with no resolution - where the physician, after huge abuse, appears to be INNOCENT.  
This Review Board could recommend resolution conditions, and reforms necessary to bring the State Medical Board of Ohio into the 21st century (getting rid of the political misuse of psychiatry to resolve disputed cases that the Inspector General's Office can't undo or get some relief help for).  When all else fails, as Governor Kasich saw 2 weeks ago, the Medical Board will say that the woman MD has to 'get another psychiatric evaluation' - this is going on #6 for one woman who just disagreed with her orthopedics, their care and the 'hitting on' her - a woman MD with no patient complaints.  And if she needed a psychiatric evaluation, the patients would have been the first to point this out.  The woman MD no longer has insurance to do a #6, #7, and #8th evaluation - which Senator Grendell knew several years ago - with a 'new' right Ohio psychiatrist of Kimberly Anderson & Anita Steinbergh's choosing.  The women MDs are not allowed to choose their psychiatrist - just like in Russian psychiatry.  Some of the Ohio experts retained by the Medical Board have certification in Russian psychiatric techniques - the one woman MD, now on #6, was first evaluated by such a psychiatrist (something out of Stephen King).  And the Medical Board women ordering the 'evaluations' never speak to the women-MDs personally - it's a knee-jerk order - check in a box.While the Medical Board cases go on, there is a provisional suspension of the medical licenses and the physicians can't work - don't have health insurance.  There is currently a huge stack of files that the Ohio Board has targeted over the years of 'confidential' complaints.  But it is Governor Kasich's failure to see the abuse that is most worrisome; he doesn't see the fraud, his office taunts the woman MDs about another psychiatric evaluation (like it would happen in Russia in the 1960s & 70s), and this is all going to Dante's hell before it gets better.   
Confidential physician complaints feed into the misuse of psychiatric evaluations, diagnosis & treatment recommendations at the Ohio Board - currently there is a 'treatment' to go along with objecting to Dr. Nice care - and most physicians disagree with Dr. Nice (700 on the Staff at Hillcrest Hospital at one time) fracture care - where the fractures are 'ripened to excrescence.'  Anita Steinbergh DO and Lance Talmadge MD endorse this care.  Why is the question that is never answered. 
The Medical Board of Ohio misuses psychiatric evaluations on women MDs - you can't order more than 2-3 on normal individuals for professional 'care' standard disputes, before there is emotional damage that even the 'best' psychiatrists in the US can't 'fix.'  Even one ordered for the wrong reasons takes 2 years to get 'out of your head.'  It is humiliating, causes depression & suicide - why they used it in Russia for dissidents & Nobel Laureates.  Kimberly Anderson, Interim Director, doesn't care.  The goons in Governor Kasich's office don't care.  Two weeks ago they were hanging up on one woman MD, which huge credentials, telling her to 'get another psychiatric evaluation' or nothing they can do.  Well for starters, they can stop be idiots as to what is going on at the Medical Board of Ohio - and that has to start with Governor Kasich.  They can start being thinking human beings starting with Governor Kasich's secretary.  
This is why the Russians use this for dissidents - is has a compounding effect - then everyone gets into the 'diagnosis throwing' game.  The Ohio Board has embraced the political abuse of psychiatry - which the DSM expert used by one woman MD tried to point out in 1995 (DSM = Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Psychiatry).  One woman MD had to hire a co-author of the DSM after the Ohio Board expert started to make up diagnoses for her - as she didn't have anything to take her license for.  This expert was paid by the Ohio Medical Board to make up psychiatric diagnoses & treatments - taxpayer monies were used for this.  Psychiatric evaluation is not the answer to finding a case, when there was a 'mistake' in pursuing a 'confidential' complaint that was bogus - trial by psychiatrists is not the answer to false testimony & the abuse of 'confidential' complaints.  You have to check the validity of the complaint, the credentials of the signers, and if they even 'knew' the woman MD in question, or ever spoke to her.  Complaints are paid-for in Ohio.  It's a business in Ohio to manufacture 'confidential' physician complaints.  It's a 60-Minute problem - that 60-Minutes has no 'take' on.
If the US expert on personality disorders tells the Ohio Medical Board in 1995-6 that the woman MD does not have a personality disorder, that an administrative mistake was made in assessing that it was a personality problem to disagree with wrong orthopedic care of oneself - then the case should have been closed & dismissed in 1995.  What is it that Ohio physicians won't/can't agree with the guy who writes the textbook, and defines the criteria for psychiatric disorders in the US?  Sounds like a narcissistic-personality-disordered Board - they like what they say rather than the valid content of the decision.  Maybe all appointees to the State Medical Board of Ohio should get a psychiatric evaluation - to see if they can be objective?  The Board Members in Ohio have been apparently diagnosing themselves in accusing other physicians - Anita Steinbergh DO is a bit of a personality disorder who puts this label on as many women MDs as she can manage.    Political abuse of psychiatry is the misuse of psychiatric diagnosis, repetitive evaluations, detention and treatment for the purposes of obstructing the fundamental human rights of certain groups and individuals in a society.  It entails the certification and committal of citizens to psychiatric treatment based upon political rather than mental health-based criteria.  Disagreeing with Dr. Nice in Ohio is a political criteria - his orthopedic care is terrible, but he & Mrs. Nice have 'friends' on the Medical Board of Ohio who will commit his detractors to perpetual psychiatric evaluations ordered by the Ohio State Medical Board - 20 years of evaluations in one case of a women MD who would/could not 'understand him as his wife didn't.'  The woman MD was sane enough to say 'No' to that request, but not sane enough to have an Ohio license.  There currently is no Director of the State Medical Board of Ohio - just an Interim Investigative Chief serving in this position - but the present Medical Board can keep ordering psychiatric evaluations on women MDs - no matter that Mr. Whitehouse is gone.  Training different from certain 'right' Ohio physicians is attempted to be 'cured' - so that all physicians will think as the Board does - which is not a 'good' thing as the Board is as 'average,' and stupid medically, a group of physicians as you can get.  Prior to the appointment of the Right-to-Life President, reservations on the use of third-trimester abortion were attempted to be 'cured.'  Planned Parenthood has nothing to worry about, Mike Gonidakis is just balancing Lance Talmadge; both third-trimester abortion & right-to-life are now represented now.  Wonderful - so when do we get to women MDs on the Board who can make changes in women's medical care & get rid of the psychiatric evaluations?Serial psychiatric evaluations are ordered by Board Members, none of whom are psychiatrists, none of whom are women MDs, and for a situational problem where the woman MD had to disagree with a male about her own care?  Where did the emphasis on patient care go?  This is a Board serving itself.  And Governor Kasich gets into the name-calling, and he isn't a psychiatrist either.    
Complaints about women MDs not going along with the 'boys,' are placed ahead of boxes of complaints about physicians from patients & about patient care issues.  There's no point system, no transparency, and no statute of limitations - bad investigations go on forever.  
Women MD personalities are the issues - if they don't agree with the men on the care issues - and it depends on the training, the year of the training, and if the male MD has 'kept up.'  The only issues about the women MDs being perpetually investigated, concern that they didn't/don't refer enough to the 'right' physicians - Board friends - and aren't submissive enough (apparently Gabby Reece has a point there).  And that they don't agree submissively to wrong care - especially for themselves - it may work in a marriage, but not in medical care - which is the problem with submission.  But carrying on cases that have no intrinsic merit, for >20 years, trying to find a case with serial psychiatric evaluations (mostly about the physician's sex life), has to be the modus operandi from hell - it's heinous.
Governor Kasich needs to do something about the 'bias' of the Medical Board appointees, the scope of experience of the appointees, the gender of the MDs on the Board (all male), and the appointing of the MDs to have a Full Board.  Governor Kasich campaigned to revamp the Medical Board.  Senator Patton has an appointee for consideration, and other Representatives/Senators have possible appointee names.  Could we get on with things, and get some of the false cases dismissed and an end to Russian psychiatry - to seeing medical options not as political issues?  
Governor Kasich is going along with appointing Members who hate women MDs - currently there are no women MDs on the Medical Board - just a DO who hates them.  If you don't get into Medical School, you hate the women that did - they don't have the 'right' personality to license in Ohio.  Can't Governor Kasich see this?  
Anita Steinbergh DO needs to be replaced.  But more than that, ways of improving women's medical care in Ohio need to be addressed - you can't just have aequanimitas about the male abuses & crazy ideas.  Standards of care are professional disputes, not political ones, and not solved by repetitive psychiatric evaluations of someone who trained in a different place, in a different time, and has more Boards or degrees.  The woman that the Board wants evaluated for the 6th time has more education than any Board Member, Governor Kasich or Senator Patton - her MD, Boards in Internal Medicine and 2 Master's degrees - but she's crazy.  And this is the crazy that we need 'more' of rather than 'less' in Ohio.  'More' is always better as the commercial goes.

										The Mayo Clinic is a bastion of testosterone and horny men - who will take a woman patient to surgery for a diagnosis that the Medicine Service handles with an injection of an anesthetic agent (2% lidocaine) - just like the boys in Steubenville will do anything to get a 16-year old naked.  The lies that the Surgical Service tells, the omitting of the Carnett's test, are no better maneuvers than the high school footballers use to get teen girls drunk in Ohio - they flatter, they have the 'look,' and they talk about the 'glory' of Mayo Clinic while saying in effect that you wouldn't object to getting naked in a surgical suite - it's the halo effect of the white coat and the Mayo Clinic.  It's a take as much as an Obama campaign speech.  And Dr. Sarr will order the anesthesia for the woman patient - like a 'date rape' drug.  The Anesthesia Service goes along with this IV 'date rape.'    
Anterior abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment problems - where a superficial abdominal nerve is inflamed - are especially misdiagnosed, lied about, the patient is immediately rushed to Surgery before the Medical Service has a chance.  An unnecessary surgery at St. Mary's ORs - and St. Marys should be a place of honesty - not duping patients into unnecessary procedures.  
Dr. John Bundrick should long ago, with the help of the Legal Department & Jill Smith, mandated that any abdominal point tenderness be seen by the Medical Service before Surgery - and the triage is backwards at Mayo Clinic.  This is intentional deceit, intentional railroading of Medicine patient to an unnecessary surgical procedure that has morbidities.  It's malpractice.  But the problem is the doing of an unconsented for neurectomy.  Where an abdominal nerve is removed, causing loss of abdominal wall sensation, skin atrophy, and chronic pain from the neurectomy.  It's not the cure for abdominal wall nerve pains - and the Surgical Service knows this.  It's a procedure for the students, residents and the money. 
The Mayo medical students expect that attendings will get them surgeries while they prance around in pristine whites - Blacks, Whites, Hispanics & Asians - are just as bad as the Steubenville highers - they don't take responsibility for their education, getting their own patients, knowing the case.  Black students especially play this 'card,' and should not be in an OR without (1) knowing the case, and (2) the consent of the patient.  Dr. Sarr & others 'get' the patients that black medical students 'scare' and butcher - which is not appropriate.  They show at the bedside of neurectomies - and they have not read the Mayo Clinic Proceedings or their clerkship materials.
All Mayo surgical residents & students should be responsible for their own education and participating in 'getting' the surgeries & the workup - the consent should be gotten by the student & resident pair with the attending surgeon in tow.  And that's not what happens to the privileged Mayo students, residents & fellows - who walk in and take-over appointments & surgeries.  But these surgeries cannot include abdominal wall pain before a Carnett's test - and no one mentions the Carnett's test at Mayo Clinic - but it is in their literature.  And it seems that only patients, and physicians not hired by Mayo Clinic, read the Clinic Proceedings.The Minnesota Medical Board claims that they have no control over Mayo Clinic, and can't regulate that Mayo Clinic will do unconsented procedures on women patients - procedures that have never been discussed or even remotely considered by the patient - even the MD patients, and Mayo physicians on other services, are shocked at some of the ad lib.  So in effect, the Minnesota Medical Board supports that physicians at Mayo Clinic can do unconsented for procedures on women patients without consent, discussion or need - which is going to lead to a mess.  Medical Boards finally legislated in the 1980s & 90s that mastectomies & lumpectomies had to be consented to, now that's apparently gone too.  
It's the same 'take' - get a girl naked and laugh - in the OR as at footballer parties in Ohio.  But the clincher - the Mayo Clinic surgeon - like Tiger Woods post-interview comments - will say to the family on the phone that, ""So what the patient gave no consent, and there was no discussion"" - Dr. Sarr IS the Mayo Clinic.  Too bad that the Mayo Clinic doesn't put some restrictions on the use of the brand name - that they let Dr. Sarr & his staff abuse the meaning of patient care - that it's just a game for the money - trick the patient and play the medical insurance card.  
First, women patients trust that male attendings, and Chiefs of Surgery at Mayo Clinic, will give them all their options, do the complete workup with scans & tests - before taking a patient to the OR.  MD patients should not have to send Dr. Sarr the paper from the Surgical Literature that cover their 'case.'  Yet at times, it's a come-on and a quickie surgery without thought.  And yes it is tempting to fill an OR slot prematurely, but a Chief of Surgery at Mayo should not do this - and this should not be allowed by OR supervisors who let Dr. Sarr start a procedure without consent all the time.   
The  Minnesota Medical Board allows this but they shouldn't.  And when the Mass General Hospital does an incorrect unconsented procedure - they publish how they handle this (NEJM 363;20 nejm.org November 11, 2010) - they immediately undo, and do the correct operation.  And the Massachusetts Medical Board goes along with this to encourage unnecessary complaints, suits, and legal actions.  But the Minnesota Medical Board does not encourage Mayo Clinic to handle these incorrect operations by undoing, repair, and apology - they lie about it.  Dr. Sarr doesn't undo his incorrect procedures, he tries to sue the patients for defamation - of a character that he lacks.
It is a thought that the Mayo Clinic should adopt some of the pre-OR checks of the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the outlook that incorrect surgeries should be undone, apologized for, and a settlement made for the damage asap.   ",Doctors

										Governor Kasich is 'truly stupid' to allow the State Medical Board of Ohio to take women (not male) medical licenses for 20 years, subjecting women MDs to psychiatric evaluation after evaluation, for no patient complaints.  To find a case, to see what evaluations of women MDs 'show' as the joke in Columbus goes.  A fishing expedition of the most devastating kind.  Complaints are processed, and women physicians disciplined for complaining to get their own medical records to consultants after medical mistakes - to allow a consultant to handle the complications of Ohio care so that the physician can work.  Asking for one's own medical records is 'making too much of bad care,' and a matter for Medical Board discipline in Ohio.  How stupid have we gotten, how irrelevant, how crazy, how wasteful?  Yet it is only the women MDs that get ordered to these psychiatric evaluations - when their personality conflicts with the male egos, eccentricities, and sexual addiction disorders.  Guy's wouldn't ever be expected to 'sit through' this humiliation - they have better things to do ie sex.  So while the woman MD's life is ruined, the male MD's sex live is a 'green pasture' - they just use the example of the woman MD who refused to go along - the poster child threat.
Asking for one's own medical records, is a matter for discipline for the Ohio State Medical Board - they just can't allow a woman MD to get her records and get on with her life in another state - can't allow someone to have a life.  Stupid - truly stupid as it's 20 years, 5 psychiatric evaluations later, and the Ohio Medical Board has ruined the physician's life but doesn't have a case.  Poor baby - they might have to pay some damages - but any damages would be less than the cost of even one more ridiculous evaluation.  No one knows if the original 'confidential' complaint ever existed in most cases, or still exists - it's a virtual reality - a bluff - a scam.  
Governor Kasich, with the shortsightedness that he showed regarding the high-speed rail issue, has refused to order a review of the 'stack' of ridiculous cases at the Medical Board of Ohio to get these 'innocent' physicians back to work - he can't even do his appointments on time.  It's not about JOBS for Governor Kasich, it's about being STUPID - TRULY STUPID.  
There are plenty of Ohio Appeals Court Judges who could review this 'stack' and make recmmendations - good ones.  This is not reading that Anita Steinbergh DO is going to do - she only reads New York Times Bestsellers - and then told one woman MD what she should be reading to get her license back - truly ridiculous.
Truly stupid is going after a physician trying to recover from orthopedic medical mistakes in Ohio care - who hasn't finished physical therapy, workup, or gotten back to work.  The orthopedics couldn't even be bothered to order physical therapy in this case - they were on to the next victim.  Truly stupid is a 6th psychiatric evaluation for this, and any further discussion time at the Medical Board.  This is not a patient complaint - it has to deal with the wrong handling of physician mistakes in Ohio - no medical mistake laws.  
No training in handling mistakes, yet Physician Assistants are given courses in this as part of their curriculums - just not physicians.  The woman MD couldn't 'invent' her records for the consultants, and the consultants wanted the two 'idiot' orthopedics off the case.  The woman MD was only doing what the consultants asked as the condition for taking her case & 'fixing' things.    
Physician mistake laws in 40-some other states allow the physician to admit the problem, to refer & to solve the problem before 20 years - to undo an incorrect procedure right away.  The woman MD tried non-suit agreements, lawyers, talking to friends/Chiefs of the erring orthopedics - but it didn't work.  
Calling the Medical Board to get her records didn't work - but this is not a matter for the suspension of her medical license.  In every other state, physicians are allowed care-to-function, including all records, blood work & x-rays/scans, etc. - before any Medical Board actions for impairments, bone pains, or disagreements in the care process.  What the hell is a 6th psychiatric evaluation of this woman's personal life going to reveal that 5 previous evaluations, and the Medical Board's website, haven't tried to detail in bad fiction?

										The State Medical Board makes mistakes with the Ohio 'confidential' physician complaint system - where the physician is not allowed to know what they have done, where the woman MDs are told to go along with care practices, personal demands, and referrals that they can't do or be complained about - where any MD can be investigated with no rules of evidence, transparent reason, or statute of limitations for over 20 years - because the State of Medical Board of Ohio is bankrupting itself with these cases & ridiculous investigations of above-average physicians for jealous colleagues or Board Members.  The 'Queen' of these Investigations is the Interim Director of the State Medical Board of Ohio - Kimberly Anderson - an appointment that just couldn't be more inappropriate, wrong, and just insane. 
Women MDs in Ohio are investigated for disagreeing about their own medical care, when the care is wrong or admittedly bad - when the care provider has 9 suits and has been kicked off the staff of a community hospital for abuses (Dr. Timothy Nice).  To get re-licensed women MDs are told by Dr. Anita Steinbergh that they will have to 'refer to Dr. Nice' - and the patients won't go - and this was told to her in 2000 - that there is a problem with Dr. Nice care and that associating with him is a complicated problem.  Dr. Steinbergh is friends with the Nices, a neighbor of Governor Kasich, and has been reappointed to the Medical Board 4 times; she's made a career of destroying careers of women MDs for nothing to do with patient care. 
Governor Kasich can't seem to appoint any 'new blood' to the Ohio Board except for the President of Right to Life (Michael L. Gonidakis) - while another lifetime Member is a third trimester abortion amicus brief physician (Lance Talmadge MD).  Michael Gonidakis is a neighbor from Dublin Ohio.  The Board currently only has 7 of 9 physician Members appointed - because Governor Kasich hasn't kept up with his appointments.
The investigating of women MDs to the 6th psychiatric evaluation, is however, emotionally damaging, cruel, Russian psychiatry and beyond reason.  Psychiatric experts for the Ohio Medical Board have training in Russian psychiatric dissident techniques as one attorney for a woman MD found out.  If the Medical Board has been told by a US expert that they made a 'mistake,' then the answer is not a 6th psychiatric evaluation and for the staff in Governor Kasich's office to hang up - it's for the 'mistake' to be rectified - the woman MD won't be able to sue the State of Ohio unless she wants to ruin what's left of her life.  It's just a tragedy of bad government and an inadequate Governor -  not up to the problems, solutions or appointments.
It's a Board that investigates only women MDs who have no patient complaints, no suits, and practice above-average care for the State of Ohio - where the colleagues have done the complaint, not the patients.  Boxes of complaints about male physicians with multiple complaints are never investigated - because they have 'friends' on the Medical Board that roundfile these complaints.  
Certainly Governor Kasich can do better than going along with >5 psychiatric evaluations on women MDs - when the State has been told by the US expert on personality disorders that this is a situational problem, where the guys 'ganged up' when the woman MD was mistreated with less than average orthopedic care of fractures.  Greater than 5 psychiatric evaluations, when the State of Ohio cheated on 2 of these evaluations & the case should have been dismissed in 1993, is cruel and unusual punishment when the woman MD was trained to object to wrong care - as her job.         									",Doctors

										The Medical Board of Ohio has some antedeluvian practices & procedural rules, but the worst is that of taking women MD medical licenses for disagreements about their own care - for decades this has gone on without Governors reviewing this situation.  Governor Kasich has refused to review the bizarre policy externally-to take a woman MD's license for a justified disagreement about her own care.  Or to review cases that the Ohio Court of Appeals has thrown out, but been unable to 'hear' because the Medical Board would not provide the case files or evidence.  
No one challenges that the care was bad in these cases, but that the woman MD didn't 'handle' it properly and has to have therapy, and never speak of the problems again before she can have her license back - therapy so that she won't sue for negligences that need to be addressed with penalties at the Medical Board.  Fractures are not 'fruit.'  Leaving fractures to ripen, or not casting properly, means that the orthopedic needs some remedial education, and that he has to refer for any complications - mandated.
 
Licenses are taken in Ohio if a Board Member had participated in the bad care of a colleague.  This sums as, to take a license to let the statute of limitations expire for a Board Member, and then for the Medical Board's 'mistake.'  It's all about expiring 'statutes of limitations' at the Ohio Medical Board of Ohio - there's no way to admit a mistake and get the MD back to work with some paid re-education & license expenses - like in every other state when the Board's have to admit that mistakes happen.  
The OHio Board is currently in the red 'broke' from investigations into physician sex lives as a way to justify 'mistakes.'  And the mess continues because Governor Kasich hasn't got a clue, never observes a Medical Board meeting, and everything is 'confidential' about who gets investigated and who's complaints go into the roundfile and never see daylight.  
Governor Kasich can't even do his appointments on time - there's current expired term Members sitting on the Board this month (April, 2013).  Governor Kasich has had 4 years to find appointees to put his 'signature' on the Medical Board - and the Chairs are being filled with Members from expired, or expiring, terms - Members from Govenors as far back as Celeste & Voinovich.  No one is being 'prepped' to be a Member - sitting in on overlapping sessions to get up to speed on the case files and problems.  An internship is done in all other fields.  Complaints about 'friends' of Medical Board Members in Ohio never see 'daylight,' never happen, and other cases are moved ahead when the case is just about the physician objecting to wrong medical care of himself/herself.  The difference is that the physician had a Board Member involved in the care gone wrong - the Board protect it's own.  Because everything is 'confidential,' no Board Member ever recuses himself/herself.  No one knows the conflicts of interest, or the payouts for decisions.   
Even when the Ohio Court of Appeals disagrees, saying it is a 'mistake' to take a license for the boys 'ganging up' on a woman MD trying to get more 'recent' care of fractures, the Governor doesn't get the 'message.'  Even when the expert for the woman MD co-authors the diagnostic Manual for Psychiatry, the Medical Board will disagree and proclaim their own 'rules' -- taking the woman MD's license for almost 2 decades for the impertinence of daring to disagree.  The Ohio Medical Board only license the less-than-average care physicians - nothing brilliant.  
The woman MD had to get an out-of-state expert after the Medical Board allowed a new right Ohio psychiatrist to invent a psychiatric diagnosis so that the Board could continue to suspend her medical license - until the statute of limitations expired.  Discipline is for not hiding the errors.  In Ohio, experts for the Medical Board will be paid to invent psychiatric diagnoses and treatments - for being a difficult female MD - for showing 'smarts' from training.  And in Medical School at CWRU, in the late 1970s, almost a whole class of women disagreed with what was going down at McDonald House for the ob-gyn clerkship - women were trained to disagree and improve things for women - it's not a character flaw.  Dr. Anita Steinbergh has gone along with this for 20 years - as long as it's a woman MD - not for DOs.  Dr. Steinbergh wasn't trained to improve things - to question - she didn't get into Medical School. 
Even when the expert is the US personality disorder guru, the boys in Constituent Affairs won't believe the mistakes.  They make fun of the woman MD, say that Governor Kasich won't review her case, and there's nothing that they can do - the boys will be boys.  And Mrs. Kasich knows about this case and should be concerned - that so much 'bad care' of women is continuing in Ohio.
Disagreeing, getting the blood work, is something that every Ohio Board Member is allowed to do however - without their medical license being taken - to try to avoid a care mistake with consultation & referral.  And it's to be wagered that Governor Kasich will disagree with his own medical care if it strays to the ridiculous, ie a Dr. Nice 'casting' or 'ripening of a fracture.'  But Dr. Nice - who pioneered 'ripening of fractures to excrescence' is still practicing, and the Medical Board of Ohio is still endorsing this practice.
So a woman MD not on Club Board, can't disagree without finding herself in a Medical Board Hearing - for her own care gone bonkers - casts that were wrongly angled, splints that didn't work from University Green Road PT & Rehab, x-rays for another fracture, cast padding that she had to buy a box of, physical therapy that her father had to arrange.  Dr. Nice didn't know how to angle wrist fractures, or how to reduce them, or what padding to put under the cast, and refused to order physical therapy even though he owned a physical therapy outfit.  Dr. Keith angled the fracture experimentally, left a cast on that almost ruptured a tendon, and then refused to order physical therapy.  All of this the woman MD, and her family were supposed to pay for without an objection.  The Mayo Clinic had to salvage the fracture, and the woman MD had to wear a splint for a year, after which the State Medical Board took her license for daring to request her records for the Mayo Clinic/Cleveland Clinic, and that the Ohio orthopedics stop with the chart editing, harassments, posturing, and lying.  Medical Mistake Laws would have stopped much of this, but they don't exist in Ohio.  About 40-some other Governors can sponsor these laws, but not Governor Kasich.  In Ohio a woman MD can still get her medical license taken for objecting to long-outdated care abuses, and that the orthopedics won't send the records or a summary to Mayo Clinic.  Governor Kasich only takes advice from the truly stupid, the talking heads, and the boys - IQs well below MENSA.  
It was a miracle that the one woman MD healed from the care at Hillcrest Hospital at all - her one wrist fracture was left uncasted & deformed for almost 3 weeks - to prove that the boys were 'boss.'  Harassment & hazing gone wrong 20 years ago.  But it's surely wrong that it still continues without some 'action' from Governor Kasich - to stop these 'false' Medical Board suspensions & disciplines for women MDs disagreeing about their own care.  The expert in the case is a NYC US expert - not from Westerville or Dublin, and not from a Community Psychiatric Practice north of Columbus - he's the real deal.  In this case, Governor Kasich is disagreeing with the guy who writes the book - and he can't 'see' it.  
But the boys at Constituent Affairs think that the woman should just 'get another psych eval' - which won't improve the care problems for women in Ohio.  The one woman has an expert who co-authors the Diagnostic Manual of Psychiatry - the Ohio Board just says that they can make up whatever diagnosis they want - to cover for the mistakes of the Medical Board.  The Ohio Board has it's own Diagnostic Manual of Psychiatry.
When physicians will do things to a woman MD, they will do it to all women - and fractures will not heal with 'ripening to excrescence' - which makes things so swollen that you increase the fracture healing time.  And once the Medical Board starts to call the woman MD 'psych names' - even if she hasn't got one criteria, the situation degenerates to a mud-wrestling fight of experts - where the Medical Board has resorted to ingenious never-before-heard-of diagnoses & the faking of tests - while the woman MD has no career and her bone condition is allowed no treatment.  'Doing harm' is what the Medical Board does best to woman MD careers.  
The Ohio Court of Appeals in the one case, told the Medical Board to 'solve the case' in 'another way' in 1993 - that it was just the 'boys ganging up' on the woman MD, calling her names, and saying whatever, because there had been mistakes & problems in her fracture care.  Further, that these mistakes were not her fault.  The woman went to see a psychologist because she was threatened - that the one orthopedic would 'make or break her,' keep her from ever practicing medicine again in any state, and 'kill' her (figuratively at least).
It's sad that Ohio care disagreements get to the loss of the medical license of the woman MD who is more recently trained, doesn't want the old crap of care done on her, and is trying to improve things by example for other women - that they will challenge 'old wives tales' of care paradigms. 
Currently the Medical Board has an Interim Director - the Director of Investigations - responsible for  
bankrupting the Medical Board with costly irrelevant investigations, reading of personal letters, the inventing of psychiatric diagnoses that only happen in Ohio.  It's Creative Writing 101 at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  When all else fails as a case, the Medical Board makes up that the women MDs have some occult psychiatric problem that they failed to disclose to the Medical Board - a personality disorder of objecting to bad care - admittedly bad care.  It's a charade, a comedy of errors, the Medical Board has been told for 15 years that making up psychiatric diagnosis to solve care problems is not the way to go - but they persist in this under Governor Kasich's lack of leadership.  
The leaderboard of Medical Board Members on the Board's website displays the problems.  Anita Steinbergh's term is up 4/25/2013 - and she should not be reappointed after 5 terms of taking women MD licenses for disagreeing with continued 'bad' Ohio care.  Mark A. Bechtel, M.D., Supervising Member - his term WAS UP 3/18/2013 - but he's from Westerville and can do what he wants at the Medical Board - he's a Kasich neighbor.  Darshan Mahajan M.D - his term was up last month 3/18/2013 - but he's still sitting on the Medical Board.  The Medical Board is outdated Members, expiring Members, and no Director.  Governor Kasich campaigned to reform this - to get a 'new' Medical Board and it's same old, same old in Columbus.  The boys will be boys.

										Dr Anthony Katz from Paradise Valley Family Medicine in Phoenix Arizona is terrible, in my opinion.He gave me the creeps from day one. I tried to switch to another Doctor in their clinic, but Dr. Katz would not allow it. I had problems getting him to call me back with test results.
Finally, after the 5th try, I demanded to talk with him. He was very upset with the fact that I had insisted on talking to him. After 5 days of calling and no return call, I thought that it was my right to get answers, he was very rude, very
rushed and told me that he had little time because he had to get back to his work. He ignores my calls for 5 days, and he is upset with me?! This guy is very strange!
I truly felt uncomfortable with him (he creeped me out). He came across very strange with me. I should have insisted on seeing one of the other Doctors, but he obviously did not want that to happen. On one or two occasions, my wife came with me and she felt the same way.
I cannot recommend this physician. I have had 5 doctors over the past 48 years, and I HAVE NEVER come across someone like this. Very strange experience. Bottom line, I will never see Dr Antony Katz from Paradise Family Medicine
again. There are 100's of good family doctors in Phoenix, I am not sure why I stayed with Dr Katz for so long. Very disappointed IN Dr Katz and i was very surprised with the way he treated me; very unprofessional!									",Doctors

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614)466-3555,"Governor John Kasich Ohio  letting a woman who could not get into Medical School and a woman Capital lawyer run the Ohio State Medical Board into the ground with inappropriate investigations and repetitive psychiatric evaluatio Columbus, Ohio","
										Governor Kasich is letting two women run the State Medical Board into millions of financial & legal liability with inappropriate physician investigations, suspensions, disciplines for personality differences, and repetitive psychiatric evaluations of innocent women MDs to 'find a case' - Dr. Anita Steinbergh & Kimberly Anderson JD.  
Governor Kasich has his office screaming at one woman MD on the phone 'to get another psychiatric evaluation' this month (April 2013) - the question is for what, and that maybe Governor Kasich needs a psych evaluation as to why he refuses to take control of the State Medical Board and order an independent external investigation as to what is really going on there.  It's not just an obsession with pill mill physicians that is the problem.  The woman has asked repeatedly that he order a review of the State Medical Board actions that have not resolved in over 7 years - a huge stack of innocent cases.
Mr. Whitehouse had to resign after the Inspector General was going to conduct an investigation - but that tabled the investigation.  The Ohio Inspector General can't do anything about any Medical Board case that the Board has wrongly ruled on, the Court of Appeals can't hear those cases because they can't ever get the 'confidential' files.  The physician can't sue the state because they can't get the case file of what they are accused of - it's confidential.
Currently it is estimated that there are hundreds of false disciplines & suspensions of good Ohio physicians dating from the early 1990s when the Medical Board started investigating 'confidential' complaints.  Confidential complaints are hard to process, hard to find a case with, often wrong or with ulterior motives, the complainant signatures can't be investigated as to their interests, and in Texas and most other states - the 'confidential' complaints system is not working.  And physicians can't resolve any case involving a 'confidential' complaint because you can't sign any thing legally binding based on 'confidential.'  When the Medical Board can't find a case, as in the woman MD mentioned above calling the Governor's Office, the Medical Board will order serial 'psychiatric' goes to find a case or emotionally damage the woman MD beyond repair.  And Governor Kasich endorses this policy.  
The Medical Board was told in testimony in 1995 - testimony that Governor Kasich needs to read - that repetitive psychiatric evaluations of 'normal' individuals, especially women, will emotionally damage beyond repair if done over many years - what the Russian psychiatrists knew.  This was testimony by Dr. Andrew Skodol - a US expert on personality disorders & problems that occur in the workplace - which is what the case was - a woman MD harassed into fracturing bones at a Cleveland area hospital (Hillcrest).  
Some of the Ohio Medical Board psychiatric experts have training in Russian psychiatric techniques - and they practice it.  And they somehow got this started at the Ohio Medical Board.  The women MDs are kept without medical care, unable to get a decent job, with their malpractice and health insurances gone, and ordered to another and another 'go' as they call it in Columbus.  Governor Kasich goes along with this & his staff think this just a joke.  But you can emotionally severely damage someone with this - beyond repair by even the best psychiatrists in the US.
With Dr. Steinbergh and Dr. Talmadge, the problem is not the pill mill obsession, the problem is the ordering of repetitive psychiatric 'goes' for women MDs - this is supported by an arrogant, stupid, cruel, and self-serving Governor Kasich at this time.  Governor Kasich has absolutely no idea of what is going on at the State Medical Board, and is willing to blame any innocent physician who calls his office.  And when you call you can hear Governor Kasich laughing in the background.       
The repetitive psychiatric evaluations of women physicians at the State Medical Board of Ohio, to find a case, need to stop.  And it's always a woman MD in the room with a bullying male shrink - a new right Ohio psychiatrist - it's a gender thing.  There is always another, and another, psychiatric expert at the Medical Board, but Ohio has a scarcity of good male orthopedics or general surgeons.  The General Surgeons in Ohio can't diagnose abdominal nerve inflammations, and do a procedure where they take out the women's abdominal nerves for sport = the Ohio neurectomy.  The orthopedics leave fractures to ripen and then experimentally cast them = women's fractures are 'fruit' in Ohio.  
There needs to be a statute of limitations beyond which the Medical Board dismisses the wrong case.  At this time, Governor Kasich needs to order an independent review as to what is going on at the State Medical Board, and appoint a new Member to the open slot of Anita Steinbergh DO.  Get a new Board President from North of Westerville Ohio - North of the Ohio 'Wall' in Game of Thrones syntax.  The Cleveland Clinic has been without Member representation on the Medical Board for over 20 years.  The Director of the Medical Board slot has been open for 6 months - with Governor Kasich not appointing anyone, but telling women MDs to 'get another psychiatric evaluation.'  Governor Kasich is not a psychiatrist - he's practicing without a license.  
If the Governor can't do his job with regards to the Medical Board, he should resign and for sure not run again - his wife doesn't even like the Governor's mansion.  If its too tough to hear what an independent review would say, then it's time to get another Governor - who wants to solve the problems and behave better than 'boys being boys.'  It's not just about the pill mill physicians - that's just what is 'unconfidential.'",Doctors

										Calling physicians names when they call the Governor's Office, hanging up, telling a MD to 'get another psych eval' - when the US needs good physicians in many rural areas (even Ohio), and the Medical Board started the fight to protect the negligences of a Board Member and two associates - is not ok.  The woman physician in question is hugely brilliant, knows her Internal Medicine, and is a researcher who was supposed to start a Fellowship in Bone Metabolism at the time - so Governor Kasich continues the stupidity because he CAN'T REVIEW THE CASE.
Governor Kasich can laugh in the background, appoint the Ya-Ya Girls to the Medical Board, and can't get his head around even high-speed rail transit to benefit the educational facilities in Ohio - the great Colleges & Universities who are at a distance from even good state applicants at times.  No one in Kasich's office brought this up - they just hang up.
There is real disease that needs cures - multiple sclerosis - and real problems at the Medical Board in Ohio.  The Medical Board acts wimsically on 'confidential' reports & complaints - protecting friends.  The woman MD had no patient complaints, her fractures were left uncasted & mistreated to 'show her who was boss' - the boys.  Wrong x-rays were ordered, even splints had to be obtained out-of-state.  Georgetown Student Health, when she went for the graduate degrees, had to do the blood work that Cleveland Clinic & University Hospitals for some reason could not order. 
The Medical Board took her license on provisional - without allowing her to finish even the physical therapy for her fractures, without finishing the Mayo Clinic workup, without blood work (nothing came back in Ohio), with the wrong diagnosis as to the cause of the fractures = huge liability for any Medical Board.  Blood work can be ordered, and come back, at Georgetown Student Health - but not at University Hospitals of Cleveland or Cleveland Clinic?  That's a conundrum. 
But the answer is not to waste her life and call the MD names - that's juvenile.  The answer is to get her back to work, back working on her PhD in breast cancer treatments.
The problem with the name calling is that it is adolescent - not even - like the boys digitally raping the high school girl in Steubenville, it is an assault on the woman's dignity & achievements. 
The Medical Board is liable is the problem - they made a mistake.  So get a non-suit agreement?    And unless Governor Kasich gets the story straight, he just continues the injustice.  More is expected of Governor Kasich than name-calling, and psych eval nonsense.  The woman is the loveliest woman MD that is around - that's the problem - she's kind, goes out of her way to even do home visits & take a needy patient to the hospital.  That was the problem - this woman MD set a different bar standard - she wasn't just interested in the money.  
But name calling, insult throwing, is not going to improve or reform the State Medical Board of Ohio.  New appointees with different perspectives are needed to fill the expired Member seats.    ",Doctors

										DR Kimberly Sackheim, DO MD That used to be at the Seaport Medical Clinic opened her own brand new office in march 2013 located at 151 East 62nd St  New York, NY 10065 Phone (212) 288-8832. I had an appointment to see her for pain management pain medicine. She was personally emailed my family DR and his phone number as a reference, My MRI, Medical reports and medication list before the appointment and agreed to treat me threw Zocdoc, I have had a DR not agree to treat me and they simply just cancelled the appointment and called the next day to inform me they only do pain injections not medicine. A very respectable thing to do in this day and age of personally emailing Doctors off  Zocdoc a great invention.
. I have United Healthcare Insurance but they would only see me as a 'CASH PATIENT'. I agreed and figured as long as she already knows my history and is willing to treat me i don't have any issue paying $350 then $150 monthly. [continued below]....
									
										..... As soon as i got to my appointment a month after waiting i walked in the door and was told to start filling out paperwork and pay the copay. (The $350.00!) So i payed and sat down to complete the papers. 
 Literally As soon as the receptionist seen me sign the first paper they immediately said OK your good to see the dr and took me into the back. ( I thought to myself what about all the other papers) I waited in her office and she came in, She did not introduced herself until i introduced myself and i started talking. All she did was quickly glance at my MRI and medical records including pharmacy print outs of the current medications and my past doctor's over the years. I have been on PM's 8 years since a motorcycle accident left me with herniated discs, bulging discs and disc degeneration at only 29 years old. She then went onn to inform me i was on very high doses of medications (which was not new news to her or for me) and she went on to tell me she doesn't prescribe anyone that much medications and told me i should go on methadone for the pain. When i said i didn't want to go on it she said let me call your last DR but i don't think i could help you. She called him and came back in the room and said to stick with your last DR. I explained he was not doing pain medicine for anyone anymore and cut me down %40 percent on my meds last time and another %40 next time i see him which is way too sharp of a drop and that was why i came here. I even asked her if she can at-least prescribe me 2 weeks of meds because i was out and it takes time to find a new DR. She refused and got angry and said if you don't leave i will call the cops. I was frustrated but calm and non threatening in any way just talking to her, I was shocked i have never been treated so poorly before so I walked out to the waiting room to let her cool off and a half hour later asked the guys who work there if they can please get her so i can ask her one last thing. There was no other patients in there the whole 2 hours i spent there. She is literally a brand new DR in a new office. She wont last long if she keeps treating pain suffering patients like she did to me, she will be out of business within a year.
Finally she came out and i said DR please if  you can't treat me why didn't you cancel my appt on zocdoc instead of making me wait a month, call my family DR who had nothing but nice things to say about me and make me pay $350, My old dr called me a month before to inform me she called him right after making the appointment and asked if i was a good patient, she asked him if i was into illegal activity's, and he said no and he told her the truth, I have always been a good patient but he is only a family Dr who treated me for pain years ago for 3 years but i needed a pain specialist.
So, I asked her for my money back, because the way i see it is she knew my history and medications and called me in to give her $350 for nothing. She claimed she didn't ever read any zocdoc email or she would not have had me come.. Here's the thing, It was not an innocent mistake she made cause If she didn't read my email she would have never had my family DR's phone number to call him a month back when i made the appointment. She refused a refund or a half refund.  This is while i was standing in the waiting room with her face poked out the door and then says ' read the paper (hey sneakily had me sign) that stated she doesn't have to prescribe any medications the first visit,and the cops were already called and on there way. She knew how bad she scammed me and 'the cops are on there way' was all she could possibly come up with to get me out of there. I sat outside 40 mins in NYC and no cops were called.This DR is a lousy Lier that contradicted herself the whole time. She is greedy, uncaring and out for the buck. I should have known better she is only a 3 year old MD with no clue how to talk to anyone or treat there pain or even treat a paying patient
STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS QUACK OFFICE IF YOUR ON PAIN MEDICATIONS. I LEFT THIS SAME REVIEW ON VITALS AND ZOCDOC BUT SHE WAS KICKED OFF ZOCDOC AND HAS DELETED MY VITALS REVIEW SOMEHOW AND LEFT NEW ONES SAYING HOW GOOD OF A DR SHE IS. SHE IS SO TRANSPARENT IT MAKES ME SICK. I WONT STOP POSTING REVIEWS ONLINE AND TELLING PEOPLE THE TRUTH ABOUT HER. IF I CAN SAVE 25 PATIENTS A YEAR FROM WASTING $350 I WILL BE HAPPY.

										Governor John Kasich campaigned in 2010 to 'clean-up' the State Medical Board of Ohio - wanting to have the Medical Board all resign & appoint a 'new' Board.  Now 3 years into his term (2013), so far not one of his appointments has made any difference, cleaned up the Medical Board in any way as far as outdated policies & unresolved backlogged cases, or done anything but continue to bankrupt the Medical Board with inappropriate actions against innocent physicians trying to point out the problems in Ohio care and at the Medical Board.  The main problem is the list of Members, and the lack of any significant reforms at the State Medical Board of Ohio for the last 20 years.  It's like the Inquisition at the State Medical Board - you prove your innocence by a trial of fire with 'confidential' complaints.  
The Medical Board of Ohio is in the worst fiscal condition of any State Medical Board - the Ohio Medical Board 'fiscal cliff.'  The yearly physician dues are continuing to rise, the unresolved actions are crippling the Board, and the coffers are empty.  Governor Kasich refuses to appoint an independent reviewer(s) - JD, MD, or panel of 3 - to legally review cases that have gone on for 7 years or more, and are unresolved because there is no case against the physician involved.  
In one case the State Medical Board just orders the woman MD to another and another psychiatric evaluation - when the last evaluation doesn't produce anything wrong with the physician or her above-average Internal Medicine care of patients - this has wasted one physician career for 20 years - because Anita Steinbergh DO hates her.  If a physician practices above-average care for Ohio, maybe whatever diagnosis that physician 'has' is what the rest of Ohio physicians should 'get' - doing one's professional job is not a personality disorder.   
Personal vendettas are consuming State time, careers, lives, and worsening the care in Ohio - because 'friend' physicians can get away with any kind of medical neglect or malpractice ie Dr. Timothy Nice, Dr. Carla O'Day.  And the Board Members, Directors, never change - just are recycled - Kimberly Anderson is now the Interim Director where before she was Chief of the over-done Investigations.  Ms. Anderson has risen to her level of incompetence as the Peter Principle goes.  Going after physician personal lives is not a function of a State Medical Board.  
The State of Pennsylvania Medical Board only has physicians pay dues biyearly, and at times forgives dues with surplus monies - they never go after a physician without patient complaints.  
The Divine Sisterhood of  Ya-Ya 'girls' at the helm of the Medical Board of Ohio are continually shopping for bad cases, going after innocent female medical colleagues or spending inappropriate monies on ridiculous investigations.  It's a perpetual shopping expedition at the State Medical Board of Ohio with no statute of limitations on cases - every other state will dismiss a case after 7 years.  An independent review by the Governor's Office, besides reviewing cases that have gone on beyond 7 years, could pinpoint reforms needed for the Medical Board to function.  Right now Governor Kasich is still refusing to 'own' the mess - allowing staffers to order physicians to another and another psychiatric evaluation for pointing out the problems.  And no one knows what is going on at the State Medical Board of Ohio because everything is 'confidential' - a Review Board could 'get' at this confidential & recommend long overdue reforms.   It would be more cost-effective to admit the problems, and get on with the reforms instead of having office staff hang up on physicians.  Governor Kasich's secretary is expert at this.
Right now the Medical Board of Ohio is not functioning, it is just consuming monies.  And the Membership needs to be representative of the 'whole' of Ohio - not Governor Kasich's neighbors in the Columbus suburbs - they don't need high-speed rail to commute.  Right now the State Medical Board is an albatross in his Administration - functioning poorly if at all.  
The chief Medical Board function is to tell Kasich office staffers that the Board needs repetitive psychiatric evaluations on physicians where they don't have a case - and there's a stack of those 'innocent' cases - cases which need dismissals & monetary damages.  The problem: the State has no monies to repay physicians for damages (emotional, physical & career), so they 'neverend' these cases, and in some instances destroy physician careers over years stretching to decades.  The State Medical Board of Ohio makes mistakes and has no money to repay the physicians.  There is no procedural way to handle mistakes at the State Medical Board, and get the physicians back to work with re-credentialing courses & fees.  No money - so the Board never dismisses, or ends, cases although there is a 'form' to do this - you 'X' a box.  The Board has the forms, but doesn't use them - because the physicians will then sue the Board for damages - and win once the Board admits an error.  And there is a stack of 'errors' at the Board in Ohio - milions of dollars of damages.  Non-suit agreements - the Medical Board won't spend the time to draw them up & have physicians sign; it's easier to do nothing and hope that the wronged physicians die.  Literally.Anita Steinbergh DO - a Westerville neighbor of Governor Kasich - has been re-apointed to the State Medical Board of Ohio five times - she's a repeat offender in this cycle of abuse.  Despite the candidates for the Governor to choose from for appointments, he seems to stick to the Westerville & Dublin Ohio crowd.  The high-speed rail system that the Governor vetoed would have enabled physicians, and appointees from all over the State, to come to monthly meetings in Columbus without giving up practices and long commutes.  The main reason for that high-speed rail that Governor Kasich killed, would have been to enable new State appointees from areas outside of suburban Columbus to go to Columbus for monthly meetings without air travel & long drives.   
Each year hundreds of thousands of Columbus-Ohio dollars are spent investigating physicians who have personally experienced the bad medical care in Ohio & said something about it, or complained about a colleague doing it - because they will be sued in the 'sue everybody' clause - as having consulted in the care or signed the chart.  With one bad 'Dr. Nice' physician causing physical injury to patients - or a physician-patient - the morbidity affects everyone in the equation & the hospitals.  Bad physicians drive up the malpractice rates, give hospitals bad 'karma,' and medical mistakes not handled properly have compounding malpractice settlements.  There are no medical mistake laws in Ohio because Governor Kasich won't admit the problem - his office is on medical marijuana - continually spaced out about reality at the Board.  
In Cleveland, certain orthopedics are allowed to leave fractures to 'ripen,' and experimentally cast them.  If a woman MD notices this, or gets her fracture caught in this 'bad' care cycle, she has her medical license suspended on 'provisional' and 'hypothetical,' and is ordered to repeated psychiatric evaluations trying to find a case against her.  The psychiatric evaluations of 'normal' women MDs never end at the State Medical Board of Ohio - it's a sport  These evaluations always discuss the 'sexual' dating history of the woman MD - Dr. Steinbergh seems to be particularly interested this gossip, and why the woman MD doesn't 'like' the bad care providers - who are often 'friend's of long-time Board Members such as Anita Steinbergh DO and Lance Talmadge MD.     
'Friend' physicians of Members are protected in 'confidential' meetings & Medical Board actions by allowing them to (1) get their 'confidential' complaints, and (2) having the Board suspend/discipline any physicians who experience or point out the problems in the friend's care.Governor Kasich needs to take charge of the Medical Board problems, and sponsor reforms recommended  by an independent review of the situation - there are physicians & judges all over the State who could be appointed to such a review panel for 6 months.  Otherwise the Ohio State Medical Board is going to bankrupt whatever Governor Kasich managed to 'save' by vetoing the high-speed rail system - a rail system which could have highlighted the educational facilities of Ohio & helped parents with the commute to send their kids to Ohio colleges - it was short-sighted as much of Governor Kasich's decisions have been.      									",Doctors
Governor John Kasich Ohio,"  Governor John Kasich Ohio  Riffe Center, 30th floor 77 South High Street 
Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",http://www.governor.ohio.gov/,(440)466-3555,"Governor John Kasich Ohio  is not doing his job regarding keeping up with appointments to the State Medical Board & having his office tell a woman MD to get a sixth psychiatric evaluation because she had to disagree with the Bo Columbus, Ohio","
										Governor Kasich campaigned to change the Ohio State Medical Board - initially wanting all Members to resign - but now that he has the chance to make appointments - the appointments are lagging behind the open chairs.  
There are four vacancies this year: (1) Anita M. Steinbergh, D.O., President, Westerville, OH, Family Practice, Term: 7/8/1993 - 4/25/2013.  (2) Mark A. Bechtel, M.D., Supervising Member, Westerville, OH, Dermatology, Term: 1/17/2012  3/18/2013. (3) Laurie O. Elsass, Dublin, OH, Consumer Member, Term: 3/29/2011 - 7/31/2013. (4) Darshan Mahajan M.D., Elyria, OH, Neurology / Child Neurology, Term: 5/13/2008 - 3/18/2013 - and so far no one has been appointed or re-appointed to the 2 spots open since 3/2013.  
Notice on the Medical Board roster that everyone seems to come from Westerville, Dublin, and south of Cleveland - it's a Board representing only certain parts of Ohio.  The last time that a Cleveland Clinic physician was on the Board is over 20 years ago, no one can remember when a University Hospitals or MetroHealth physician was ever on the Board.  But Dublin & Westerville are the hot spots to be if you want to be on the State Medical Board.  The Kasich's live in their Genoa Township home just north of Westerville.  Dublin is about 18-20 miles from the Kasich's - so Kasich picks his neighbors for the Medical Board - provincial picks.  Steinbergh & Kasich are neighbors - which is hardly objective, fair, or 'beyond the box' thinking.   
It really helps if Board Members know what they are doing a month in advance however, and the Medical Board has had no Director for the last 6 months - but Kasich I'm sure is looking in Westerville.  Kimberly Anderson - the cause of the expensive inappropriate evaluations of physicians bankrupting the Medical Board coffers - is not acceptable.  Anita Steinbergh DO has been recycled 5 times, and is the cause of many of the false cases at the Medical Board - her criteria for taking a medical license are not the legal criteria.  There are personal vendettas involved in a stack of cases at the State Medical Board, and during her tenure on the Board, the Medical Board - as a policy - does not investigate complaints where her 'friends' are involved.  In one case - Anita Steinbergh DO is a personal friend of the complained about physician and his wife - Dr. Nice - and mentions Mrs. Nice in Board meetings.  that case was never investigated.  
Dr. Nice complaints are never investigated, and he has gotten a copy of any complaints involving himself against state law through the years, courtesy of Dr. O'Day, Dr. Steinbergh, and Dr. Talmadge.  Friend treatment.   
While Governor Kasich does not have time to name appointments that he supposedly wanted to fill 3 years ago, he is having his office hang up on a woman physician who has had a 'case' with the Medical Board for 20 years for doing her job as a physician - professionalism means reporting the problems when those problems interfere with patient care.  And having his staff tell her that there is nothing to discuss unless she gets a sixth psychiatric evaluation - which is inappropriate, being a jerk, and boys-being-boys.
(1) the woman has had 5 psychiatric evaluations with no psychiatric diagnosis found, (2) the Medical Board used taxpayer monies with pre-fixed experts to go after her twice & both these evaluations involved admitted cheating on the part of the Board to get a case/diagnosis, (3) all that these evaluations concentrate on is the sex life of the woman MD and why she didn't 'like' Dr. Nice or want to do his 'personal needs' (because he can't do wrist fracture care), (4) there is no cause for a sixth psychiatric evaluation as the US personality expert psychiatrist has come down in the woman's favor 15 years ago - that this was a political Board case, not a psychiatric diagnosis case (he writes the Psychiatric Textbook for the US Residency Training = the DSM of Psychiatry), and (5) that all the Medical Board does instead of 'settling,' as the Ohio Court of Appeals told them to do in 1993, is to order another and another psychiatric evaluation to postpone the liability assessment - the Board is at fault in this case.  They were negligent, wrong, and caused severe damages = wrecked a physician's life for sport = Westerville-Dublin-Genoa sporting event.  
The Medical Board is at fault for taking the woman MD's medical license without due process, without cause, with gender bias, without checking the facts, for withholding needed medical care & not allowing the woman MD care-to-function, for ordering her to successive psychiatric evaluations under duress (emotional damages), and for the loss of her career, family life (marriage), & Fellowship = two-digit millions.  
Governor Kasich is in deep doodoo with this case - so he behaves inappropriate, unprofessionally, out-of-his-sphere to say or recommend, and stupidly without any consultation.  And the case is not his fault except that he has continued it, and his office has repeatedly insulted the woman MD on the phone, and refused to help (1) have the case externally reviewed to determine a monetary damage, and (2) bring the parties to the discussion table and make them sit there until a resolution is reached.  You can hear him laughing in the background when she calls - it's all a joke.       
It is not criteria for a psychiatric evaluation to report Dr. Timothy Nice, and that orthopedic care of women in Ohio is sometimes terribly bad - as experienced by this woman physician.  Dr. Nice has care problems - the Cleveland Clinic knew this when they trained him years ago.  He might be Anita Steinbergh's friend, but he is a jerk and a totally negligent orthopedic - he has no real talent for orthopedics & less interest except in the money.  And no one on the Medical Board has questioned the truth of the bad care, or that Dr. Nice does very bad orthopedics much of the time, just that this woman MD handled it wrong.  And what was the RIGHT WAY to handle this situation? - no one knows.  There are no medical mistake laws in Ohio - the legislature doesn't believe that medical mistakes are a problem in Ohio.
But 5 psychiatric evaluations, and a sixth evaluation, are not the solution to this boys-ganging-up-on-the-girl who complained problem.  She had no patient complaints, and could not work with the Ohio care that she got, was not interested in playing with Dr. Nice, she ended up at Mayo Clinic - and the two sides haven't discussed in 20 years.  Everyone speaks through psychiatrists or lawyers, shouting or hanging up, and the woman MD has no criteria for any psychiatric diagnosis - but she does have a bone problem which is still untreated.  Dr. Licata at the Cleveland Clinic won't treat this woman MD unless he is assured that his license is 'safe.'   
The Ohio Medical Board suspended her medical license 20 years ago with a provisional hypothetical excuse of a case that didn't pan out, and has had her go through 5 psychiatric evaluations - which did not yield a diagnosis - no surprise there as she has a MENSA IQ and practiced a better version of Internal Medicine than is practiced in Ohio.  But she has a case worker and no patient complaints - while there are physicians with >5 patient complaints at the Medical Board and no case worker.  
So the Medical Board suspended her license for nothing - and because no one on the Medical Board is a psychiatrist and no one is an orthopedic - the Board has been doing malpractice to make a diagnosis without office visits, workup, or testing - and has no expertise in the care that she is questioning.  The Medical Board of Ohio is a completely inadequate group of people who just keep ordering psychiatric evaluations of any physician who objects to the bad care problems, and licensure problems, in Ohio.  The Board, as it is currently comprised - the current Members - and with the current policies - can't function.  There have needed to be reforms at the State Medical Board for the last 20 years, but no one knows what reforms are needed as everything is confidential.  No one knows why this woman MD needs a sixth psychiatric evaluation - that is 'confidential.'  All that Anita Steinbergh says is 'psychiatric evaluation,' read bestsellers, and I'm not responsible for that.  But all that Kasich's office was doing last week was talking psychiatric evaluation - and behaving as if they all needed one - from Elliot to Dave to John.  
Fast forward to 2013: The orthopedic care is still bad in Ohio, and the woman has her license still suspended, Governor Kasich is hanging up and saying 6th evaluation or no dice (and that won't happen because there is no indication of the need for that, and serially psychiatric evaluations of normal people cause emotional damage = why Russia does this Governor Kasich, why the Gestapo did it).  Kimberly Anderson investigations are likened to Gestapo. 
However, none of this is the way to handle orthopedic care problems that go bad, and orthopedics who are male jerks.  Governor Kasich getting into the fight, when he knows that the 'confidential' complaint system is the problem, is just beyond inappropriate - it's stupid.  To hear the staff of his Gubernatorial Office, hanging up on the woman MD with all her credentials, sacrifices to get where she got, and her attainments - it just nauseating, inexplicable, and insane.  It's like the world has turned upside down, been thrown into a Vitamix, and come out tipsy.  
The Medical Board now wants a sixth evaluation to try to 'find a case' 20 years later - as there is no statute of limitations at the Ohio State Medical Board.  This is just completely missing the point of having a Medical Board - to go after physicians with patient complaints and improve the care before 20 years.  The Ohio Legislature hasn't gotten around to reforming the State Medical Board for over 20 years.   
For Governor Kasich to suggest that someone get a psychiatric evaluation as a criteria for medical licensure, when all that caused the problem was that she was doing her professional job - to report care abuses, negligences, and wrong care (that she herself had to experienc) - is totally malpractice - practicing without a license.  It's absurd, bizarre, and out of place - as much as the woman suggesting to Governor Kasich to get a psychiatric evaluation would be.  
Governor Kasich doesn't have a MD.  For the State Medical Board to handle this situation with abusive psychiatric evaluations - when the woman MD is a lovely person except when she has to say 'No' - is completely negligence, unprofessional, and like using a bazooka instead of a fly swatter (to quote from THE GOOD WIFE).   
And the reason that she said 'No' has never been asked - but there's a guy MD at Parma Pediatric Services who won't talk to her until this is over.  That's the main reason to end this - the physician that she was interested in never got a chance - she was supposed to 'do it' and 'work with' Dr. Nice - no one knows WHY however.  
No one thought, or asked, that she was trying to keep up appearances for another person - because she really wasn't interested in Dr. Nice - she was pleasant for professionalism and never touched him.  And to have it in public records that she was 'seductive' with the jerk - when she met with him time after time to assert otherwise - is a tragedy.  A girl should be able to say 'No' and get a chance with the right guy before 20 years.  But there's no happy ending with this case - Governor Kasich has seen to that.  He's completely out-of-it and one can only hope that he will do better as a father to his daughters - and not wreck their lives.  Governor Kasich is completely inadequate to his job.      ",Doctors

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614)466-3555,"Governor John Kasich  State Budget Plan #1 line item for the State Medical Board = Dr. Nice's personal needs = defending male physicians against malpractice done to women MDs for sport with $500,000 that won't be accounted Columbus, Ohio","
										The Ohio State Medical Board is broke - this is a no-brainer - the yearly dues are on an exponential rise curve.  The line items breaking the Board are inappropriate investigations of physicians, particularly women physicians with no patient complaints.  
The Medical Board of Ohio defends 'friend' male physicians by taking the licenses of any woman MD who notices, or wanders into an orthopedic office for care - on the basis of a 'confidential' complaint that the woman MD can't defend herself from.  Ohio orthopedic care is legendary for the screw-ups; they like to leave wrist fractures uncasted for weeks to get a surgery if the hand survives.  The male orthopedics just believe that every woman is 'unlucky' - unlucky enough to break a bone in Ohio for sure.    
One of these cases - Dr. Nice's personal needs - has cost the State of Ohio $500,000 and a woman MD being out of her license for 20 years for not going along with Dr. Nice - who no one went along with for very long at his hospitals.  Even Mrs. Nice couldn't 'understand' him - but the State has ordered five evaluations to make this woman MD understand Dr. Nice, or not have a medical license.  The State of Ohio is obsessed with defending Dr. Nice - they will ruin anyone to defend this jerk - his 'jewels' must be insured for millions in stud fees. 
A condition of the woman MD's re-licensure is that she refer to Dr. Nice.  Dr. Steinbergh, the current President of the State Medical Board of Ohio, has a term that expires 4/2013 - could Governor Kasich please find someone more budget savvy - who is concerned about patient care?  Dr. Steinbergh will debt the Medical Board into a blackhole for this guy.  
There is no Ohio medical malpractice insurance that will insure that woman MD if a condition of her re-licensure is to refer to Dr. Nice.  There are several psychiatric opinions against that already at the Ohio State Medical Board - that this would lead to physical abuse of the woman MD.  But that's exciting for Governor Kasich - a little mudwrestling with a woman MD.
What the wives can't do, the women colleagues have to do, or get their medical licenses suspended.  The woman MD had no patient complaints, no drug or alcohol abuse, no CME lapses - her problem was Dr. Timothy Nice.  Not a faithful guy, but the Ohio State Medical Board will spend millions to defend him and his bad orthopedic care - his 'fruit treatment' of fractures has apparently 'caught on.'
  Even if the woman MD gets back to work for the next 10 years, she won't recoup that investment for the State of Ohio - her debts will make her tax payments refundable - and meanwhile the dues for every Ohio physician continue to climb with this 20-year fight - a fight that the State is not going to win.  Every day the Medical Board spends time on this case - how to find a case - for 20 years - that's a huge amount of billable time.  They hang up on the woman physician, ask for another psychiatric evaluation - the Board has been asking for another and another psychiatric evaluation for 20 years - that won't end the case.  It's a game, a ruse - and Governor Kasich is stupid enough to buy it.
This is a fight that the State can dismiss & settle - Dr. Nice care was not good or standard orthopedic care - no matter the spin.  10 psychiatric evaluations of the woman-that-said-NO-will not end this case - someone needs to enlighten Governor Kasich on this point.  The Ohio State Medical Board paid experts to cheat twice-already; that didn't end the case.  
This is a $500,000 straight down the drain poor investment fight -  as the woman MD has no criteria for any psychiatric evaluations except that she didn't sleep with Dr. Nice (worried about HPV).  Can the State prove that Dr. Nice did not, and does not have any sexual transmitted disease - he's not faithful - his wife is/has not been his only sexual partner - that's another no-brainer.  Women MDs want to work with male physicians who have a moral compass - no STDs please.  A condition that the woman MD has in referring to male MDs.   
If the State of Ohio had to do a Financial Report on the State Medical Board expenditures - this would be the biggest single expenditure for an individual - Dr. Nice.  This is $500,000 down the drain, for Ohio Medical Board President Anita Steinbergh DO to defend Dr. Nice's bizarre orthopedic care.  Dr. Steinbergh knows Dr. Nice & his wife, and mentions them at any meeting where the MD offender didn't cozy up to the two - she has bias regarding any case with Dr. Nice but never excuses herself from the vote.  Dr. Nice likes to leave fractures to 'ripen,' so that he can get surgeries when the fracture sites turn excrescent.  But fractures are not 'fruit' - except in Ohio.    
$500,000 - two Hearings, one Court of Appeals appearance - was spent by the Ohio Attorney General's office to go up against a woman MD who just said ""No"" to Dr. Nice orthopedic care & finally complained when it was forced on her.  That's alot of money for one male physician's needs - a lot of taxpayer's contributed to that Nice fund - and Dr. Nice is not even 'nice' as patients will tell you.  DeWine is keeping the case going - what would the Attorney General's Office do without the malpractices of Dr. Nice to keep them busy?  Dr. Nice needs a whole floor of legal experts to get him out of trouble, and Columbus State Attorneys - Kimberly Anderson - do nothing else.   DeWine wants the Physician Dues at the State Medical Board to go up - his office was told by the Ohio Court of Appeals to 'settle' this case in 1993 - that the State can't win.  
No one has been able to stop the inappropriate Ohio State Medical Board investigations - for everything other than patient care.  Dr. Nice has given State lawyers business for the last 20 years, confidentially complaining about women colleagues - who have no patient complaints while he has had as many as nine suits at a time in the last 20 years.  Dr. Nice does not do very good orthopedics, but the Ohio State Medical Board keeps him in business to complain about women colleagues.  What would the State Medical Board of Ohio do if they couldn't go after certain women MDs for their personal dating histories - it's salacious stuff.  The one woman had two days of discussion in Columbus about her dating life, that she didn't 'like' Dr. Nice - what woman is supposed to like her orthopedics or her orthopedic care?  It's not shopping or ebay.
The State Medical Board of Ohio - when they can't find a case except that the woman didn't do Dr. Nice's personal needs - will keep a case going for 20 years.  They will order successive psychiatric evaluations - that detail the woman's sex life but not her patient care - for decades - looking for a case.  If a case does not have a case after 20 years, the case needs to be dismissed - not continue to raise physician dues.  The woman MD is not going to sleep with Dr. Nice for any license, or work with him for any re-licensure deal.  Could Governor Kasich's office please get the message?  That spending an afternoon hanging up on the woman MD is not cost-effective, that a sixth psychiatric evaluation of her not liking Dr. Nice is unlikely to yield a diagnosis or 'case?'  She doesn't like Dr. Nice, could the State please get on to State of Ohio business?  Dr. Nice is not a line item expenditure.   									",Doctors

Senator Patton's Office refuses to look into a case in his district that has gone on for 20 years - wasting the life/career of the woman MD involved and huge amounts of State monies.  More than the State paid into her education has been spent trashing her - and she had no patient complaints and practiced a higher standard of medical practice than went on in Ohio - jealousy was the problem.
The 'boys' in Governor Kasich's Office haven't a 'clue' what is going on with the Medical Board, and refuse to request an investigation into these false cases, evaluations - and the Medical Board takes advantage of this.  Because they fail to get after the Medical Board, the Board is wasting state monies in huge quantities for false investigations, suspensions, & disciplines - disciplines where the woman MD did nothing wrong except try to get 'care to function.'  
Women MDs in Ohio are disciplined for trying to get the 'right' care for themselves.  They can't get blood work, fracture care, workups, or care for themselves adequately.  The 'boys' don't know about lab work, can't cast fractures, and don't have the Certifications that they need.  ",Doctors

										On May 17th, 2011, I had a Mommy Makeover, which included a tummy tuck and breast lift.  I entrusted Dr. Rademaker to deliver reasonable results discussed from our prior consultations. I clearly explained to Dr. Rademaker the problem areas and relied on his advice as what needed to be done. After post-op I discussed several times concerns of the outcome of my surgical procedures with Dr. Rademaker. He agreed to take care of me but then wanted to charge us $8,650.00 to repair his mistakes. Of course by this time we were greatly disappointed that he refused to compromise in any other way. We decided to call an attorney to try and resolve the situation.I have been left physically and emotionally scarred as a result of this surgery. A demand letter from a law firm was sent with description of my physical appearance and post-op results as well as the cost of how much it would be to have another plastic surgeon correct Dr. Rademaker's work.  He chose to ignore all of these letters and phone calls sent by the law firm.Unfortunately, our lawyer informed us that they were unable to pursue further litigation due to the expense of filing such a claim and lack of cooperation from Dr. Rademaker. My husband and I spent an exorbitant amount of money on these procedures and feel we got nothing out of it except pain and suffering. In fact, I look worse now then before the surgery. My breasts are asymmetric (one is bigger then other) and the areoles are not centered. I have significant excess tissue of both breasts. I have held up my before and after pics that I took and the only difference is gross scarring! My stomach has extensive fatty tissue and skin that protrudes out on the lower abdomen.Furthermore, I had gallbladder surgery performed on March 23rd, 2012. My general surgeon was unable to perform the standard laparoscopic procedure through the belly button to remove my gallbladder due to the extensive scare tissue left from Dr. Rademakers tummy tuck. Unfortunately, another incision was done underneath my right breast area by the rib cage. This added more down time and cost out of our pocket to pay what insurance did not cover.At this stage, we have exhausted all avenues and hope that someone can still help us. I have all documents to support my complaint and hope someone will feel the pain I have gone through emotionally and physically.									",Doctors

Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine,"  Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine  30 E. Broad St., 14th Floor 
Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov,800-282-0515,"Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine Kimberly Anderson Interim Director State Medical Board  going after kids in Steubenville while ignoring when women MDs complain about the 'boys' leaving women MD patients without casts, to collapse at the hospital, making fun of body parts - kids are being Columbus, Ohio","
										Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine is going to look into more Steubenville charges.  Mike DeWine is next going after the classmates, teammates, absentee parents, & delinquent coaches who watched - looked the other way - while the digital raping of a semi-conscious 16-year-old went on in an Ohio small-town culture of testosterone-fueled drinking parties that passes for high school 'education.'  High school 'education' in Ohio is problematic.    
Where he really needs to look is in his office, at the Ohio State Medical Board, and to the example he sets - to the example that Mike DeWine abuses women MD professionals when they complain about the culture of abuse of women in Ohio.  It's not paranoia, it's real.  Mike DeWine sets the standards for the kids in Steubenville - he's as guilty as the kids he prosecutes, and hypocritical in that the male adults aren't as responsible as the kids. [continued below]....
									
										.....  Where do Big Red footballers learn digital penetration?      
Mike DeWine's office looks the 'other way' when women MDs complain about abuses at Ohio hospitals - assisting the State Medical Board of Ohio in legally going after women MDs for making too much of 'boys being boys.'  So how can kids be held to a standard that adults are not in Ohio?  Male MDs in Ohio are allowed to do 'boys being boys care' of women patients, so how are the male teens any different?  It's not even a football thing, it's a male thing in Ohio - digital unconsented rape goes on in Ohio hospitals every day and the patients are awake.  
The male 'culture' of 'boys being boys,' including Mike DeWine, contributes to abuses of women patients in Ohio - every day - without alcohol or football being part of the regression equation.  It's more than a 'binge drinking' problem - it's a culture that denigrates women, abuses women starting with teens, and where you can't trust men to be compassionate, have a moral compass, to ask for consent, or to be taking care of anything.    
Certainly the two Steubenville footballers did not demonstrate maturity, lacked compassion, and lacked a moral compass - but are they the real-deal 'sex offenders' when physicians do worse without the consent of female patients in Ohio?  Male physicians in Ohio are no better.  The Ohio Medical Board allows much worse than was done to the 16-year-old girl under the pretense of medical 'care,' and DeWine's Office goes after the women MDs who complain.  Women patients are raped every day in Ohio - with unconsented anesthesia (oral penetration), rectal exams (anal penetration), and pelvic exams (digital penetration with hands, speculums, & jokes).      
Digitally raping a 16-year-old given too much to drink, or drugged, is hardly new in Ohio.  Beer Rounds are a staple at every residency training program, and every Ohio hospital.  When the male physicians are doing it, how can one blame the kids?  Male MDs do multiple pelvic exams of women patients under anesthesia - sometimes 8 to upwards of 10 or more during procedures.  And while the woman/teen patient might agree to 2-3 pelvics, the medical students line up once the woman-student-teen is under an anesthetic.  Gang rape.    
Many times women patients, students at Case Western Reserve University, are put under unnecessary anesthesia for these pelvic exams = which are actually assault, stripped naked when underwear can be left on (have to get a grope of the breasts even when the exam is not needed).  
Women patients are put under anesthesia to bring in the medical students, or residents, to do the case - and no one wants a medical student, or resident, twittering about what they did to another student, colleague, or peer.  The twitter feed is as reprehensible as the texting in Steubenville.  The women patients say 'No' to the trainees - and are just drugged under.  The Dental School Faculty Practice will almost assault a woman patient to do a drilling that they then bring in 5 leering residents to watch - no consent was ever signed and the last 2 years of x-rays were negative.  How is that not assault with a drill?  
Currently the Ohio State Medical Board has a woman MD suspended for 20 years for objecting to wrong orthopedic care of herself - admittedly wrong care, admitted inappropriate male comments were in play in the situation.  Her fractures were left uncasted to 'ripen to excrescence - a male MD joke in Cleveland.  Eventually the fractures were casted without padding, and referrals refused - while about 700 other physicians on staff at the hospital watched, joked, and did nothing.  30 other orthopedics on staff did nothing, but watch the women MD's fractures collapse as a male bonding thing.  Much like football in Steubenville.  The woman MD was conscious enough to beg repeatedly.     
The Medical Board of Ohio cheated in two Hearings for this woman MD - admitted that they cheated and lied about the woman MD - in sexual innuendo terms.  She was 'seductive,' and didn't deserve a cast on her fractures - and her name is in public records even though there were sexual advances & comments all over the case.  Everything is about SEX in Ohio - so how can the Steubenville kids be any different than their teachers, coaches, physicians, and Attorney General's Office?  Mike DeWine doesn't respect women MDs - he thinks they are a joke even with the degrees. 
The woman MD was reported to her Internal Medicine Chief as close to passing out when the fractures were not casted, and looking very ill - Dr. Robert Botti of Hillcrest Hospital (Cleveland, Ohio) ignored the abuse reported, ignored her begging for care and looking unsteady, and signed 'confidentially' to have her hospital privileges suspended for 'making too much.'  Dr. Botti was in his 60s at the time.  The woman MD was a joke - a 'Catholic girl' who was supposed to be 'easy.'  Is that any different from the drunk 16-year-old teen who was taken advantage of in Steubenville?  The male physicians are never labeled as 'sex offenders.'  The woman MDs mother was not allowed to testify, comment, or be heard. 
Certainly the town of Steubenville, the high school students, the missing delinquent parents, the football coaches, and the Attorney General's Office have a point - this was a tragedy.  But this same tragedy goes on daily everywhere else in Ohio - where women are mistreated for sport.  And the real sex offenders are not on any list.      
The footballers were just imitating their male physicians, coaches, teachers, Attorney General's Office, and the Ohio Medical Board - their lack of role models is the problem.  The allowing of women to be hurt, be put in bad situations, be neglected, be abused medically, to be made fun of is an Ohio problem.  The Ohio Medical Board never apologizes for the abuse of women patients or physicians.  It's an Ohio culture to 'score' with the abuse of women.

											..... He is committed to providing patients’ with the best in education, surgical techniques and technology, highest standards of care pre and post-operatively, and to ensure all patients with a safe and enjoyable surgical experience.  Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery / Statement from the owner:  ""I wake up each morning feeling blessed to be able to help others through the talents and skills God has given me. Aesthetic surgery is my passion. I love that I am able to make a difference in patients’ lives. Helping a patient feel better about him or herself, bringing out a patient’s inner beauty, and giving patients self-confidence are what motivate me to continue to do what I do.

I am committed to providing a safe and enjoyable environment for patients, as well as to delivering the unparalleled surgical results they expect. I hold myself to the highest standards in providing excellence in patient care, in always listening to and respecting patient’s needs and to living life as an upstanding human being. I am first a doctor, then a surgeon. I care immensely about each and every patient, and am always available for my patients.” STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM BHPS.

Their new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. They are willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers. 

“We have an open door policy, and encourage frequent and open communications. We value our patients’ feedback and are grateful for the thousands of positive reviews on patient experience at our practice, and happiness with surgical results. We frequently interact with our patients post-surgically and diligently monitor patient recovery process. Because of our attention to patient care and needs, we have been voted Best of Spa in LA, Top Plastic Surgeon in LA, and awarded with Patients’ Choice Award for the 5 year in a row. We are humbled by such recognitions, and strive to continue to be the gold standard in plastic surgery.” 

“We have one of the most frequent post-operative, follow up schedules in the plastic surgery community. The doctor sees all patients himself for numerous follow up appointments. We also are known to be extremely accessible. Patients have the doctor’s cell phone number, home number, direct line at office, in addition to patient care coordinators’ direct lines and cell phone numbers.” Testimonials from physicians who have worked with Dr. Chiu and Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery:  ""I have known Dr. Chiu for more than 10 years, and from 2003 to 2005 we worked for the same specialty group. During this time, I personally observed his clinical and surgical skills. He is highly respected by our peers and patients for his technical and artistic ability. He also has a deep respect for our surgical practice. He often attends meetings, above and beyond what is needed for CME requirements, in order to stay abreast with the latest changes in our profession. Although we no longer work for the same surgical group, I still maintain a robust academic relationship with him, and we consult each other for suggestions and advice on different topics involving plastic surgery. He has proven himself to be an outstanding and caring surgeon, and I recommend him to you without reservation.” – Dr. Howard Hu, plastic surgeon

“I have known him for 9 years and have worked with him for 4. I have worked with him in the operating room as well as in patient care. I have found him to be of superior knowledge in his field of plastic surgery. He is excellent in the operating room where his technique is wonderful and his care of patients superb. Lastly, he is wonderful with his patients, who love him.” – Dr. Richard Hodnett, plastic surgeon

“His clinical acumen and bedside manners are admirable. He has proven to be an excellent source of information and I frequently find myself adopting his recommendations. Judging by the number of his referrals, his treatment plans more than satisfy his patients’ needs. His surgical habits are as meticulous as one would hope for. He organizes a sound surgical plan but his the flexibility to adjust to any situation that may arise. He is efficient with his time, yet is artistic to his patients’ individual needs. He has always shown himself to be ethically responsible and upstanding. He cares very much for his patients. I have always known him to look out for his patients’ welfare and health above any personal gain. He exemplifies the spirit of professionalism and care. I am proud to call him a colleague and recommend him to you without reservation.” – Dr. Paymon Simoni, plastic surgeon

“He is an excellent surgeon and physician. He is one of the most meticulous surgeons I have ever worked with, and is well-respected by his medical peers, nurses, and operating room personnel who have had the pleasure of working with or for him. His attentiveness, skill, professional integrity, and patient care is commendable and consistent throughout the entire surgery process and I will continue to recommend my patients, friends, and family to him without reservation.” – Dr. Paul Nassif, facial plastic surgeonThe information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Christine Chiu during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery, Inc.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..


In order to provide great customer care for patients, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery offers customer service that is provided by Client Services Coordinators who are specifically assigned to each patient for the entirety of their relationship with the office. Christine Chiu stated that, “All aspects of the anonymous complaint made against us appear to be unfounded, false, and without merit.” 

Their Client Services Coordinators consult individuals about their pretreatment process and are also responsible for following up with clients after treatment to ensure that the clients’ healing continues as expected. 

After complaints were made about them on Ripoff Report, their office staff still continues to provide excellent service to each and every customer and client. 

When asked to describe their standard practices for resolving customer complaints Mrs. Chiu explained, “Each client is provided with the office phone, mobile phone, and home phone number for their surgeon, as well as for their Client Services Coordinator. Any issues are addressed immediately and if immediate action is not possible, then the issues are addressed as soon as reasonably possible at the client’s 100% convenience. For example, if a client sends a text message or calls at 1:00 am the surgeon and the Client Services Coordinator will both respond within a few minutes, if not sooner.” 

Their process for advising treatment plans for patients is a one-on-one process handled by the surgeon, as well as the Client Services Coordinator. 

Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery, Inc. maintains that complaints made about them on Ripoff Report are false. For example, one of the anonymous complaints stated that the client was happy to know the office could remain in business because of the other surgeons in the practice. However, they only have one physician/surgeon in their office. 

During the onsite interview Mrs. Chiu was asked about a complaint that was made by a patient that did not feel as though they received accurate and complete consultation before and after treatments: “The anonymous complaint is based on vague and untrue information which does not reflect the experience of any patient ever seen by our office. 

With over 15,000 successful procedures performed on just as many clients, there have only been complaints by less than 1/10th of 1%, which is effectively less than 10 patients in the very long history of the office’s practice. In each one of those cases, the office bent over backwards to make sure that any and all issues were eventually resolved to the final satisfaction of those clients.” 

All patients are advised accordingly in an open, honest and ethical manner, especially when handling a situation where a client is looking for a procedure to be done that, in the physician’s professional opinion, is not an area of concern for their current state. 

Their company has taken the filing of this apparently false complaint as a real “gut punch.” Customer service has always been their top priority and it remains so at this time as they move forward.

His work really stood out the most to me and I decided to go see him. I was still a little nervous but after talking with him all my fears were taken away. The way he talks about everything is so informative and honest. He doesn’t give you unrealistic expectations and helps you understand exactly what you need to know is best for you. I was worried about my recovery and if I would be able to take care of my kids after. My recovery went better than I thought and I had very little pain. Everything turned out so good thank you!"" 
Gina ""After having four children I never thought I would be happy with the way I looked ever again! After meeting with him I regained hope of feeling beautiful again. He talked with me about all my options and gave me all the information I needed. My husband and I agreed with everything he proposed and my results turned out amazing! I can’t believe how great I look! My husband is very happy also mostly because I am so happy. Thank you so much!""

NOW TO THE ORIGINAL REPORT THAT WAS FILED   Dr. Gabriel Chiu and Christine Chiu Dr. Chiu Dr. Gabriel Chiu 's Malpractice and Gross Negligence - Lawsuit - Christine Chiu Beverly Hills, California Dr. Gabriel Chiu   Dr. Chiu s Malpractice and Gross Negligence - Lawsuit   Christine Chiu The scope of extensive damages that Dr. Gabriel Chiu did, by his negligent work, is what doctors get sued for and what closes down their offices.  I could shut down their entire office with one lawsuit due to how grossly negligent Dr. Chiu was in my case and all the physical and emotional damage he caused. I cant even begin to explain what this uncaring and dangerous doctor has put me through.  If I share all the details, and what Dr. Chiu did and what damages he caused and what happened to me as a result of his negligence, everyone would be so shocked and disgusted by Dr. Chius gross negligence that they wouldnt go near their dangerous and Godforsaken office.   Dr. Gabriel Chiu, very negligently, performed and prescribed completely unnecessary and dangerous procedures and products that caused extensive damages.  Dr. Chiu assured me that everything was gentle and safe, which only proved how uneducated, reckless and uninformed he really is.  Everything that he did was completely unnecessary and only caused extensive harm.  He did not do even one thing right. He only caused harm.  In addition to hurting me physically, he has put me through so much emotional distress by his gross negligence, all due to his lack of attention, education, care and skill.   I should have paid attention and seen it as a clue when I saw how unsanitory he was.  I should have also checked his degree and the low-rated and poor quality school that he has attended, instead of looking at his Beverly Hills office.  If Dr. Chiu and his greedy wife put a fraction of the effort they put in their office dcor towards actually caring for their patients safety and Dr. Chius knowledge and education, this gross negligence would not have happened.  Every doctor that heard and saw how Dr. Chiu did these numerous and major mistakes (and charging so much money for it) just shook their head in disgust as they could not comprehend how any plastic surgeon, let alone a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, can be so grossly negligent, uneducated and cause so much damage to their own patient, especially a young person.  No wonder that so many people work for him and bring in their own clients. A negligent and unwise doctor like Dr. Gabriel Chiu would not be able to run an office all on his own. His very greedy and unfair wife, Christine Chiu, only cares about money and protecting her incompetent husbands reputation.  Christine Chiu is even more heartless than her husband and proved, by her unprofessional, aggressive and rude behavior that all she cares about was for nobody to find out about her husbands negligence.  She had absolutely no care or compassion about how her negligent and incompetent husband actually harmed me.  If anyone saw how unfairly and gross she acted, and how her husband harms patients so negligently, they would not go near this office or even be friends with these Godless people. Its so disgusting that Christine Chiu is so heartless and has absolutely no concern about how her negligent husband harms patients.  She is so clueless that she doesnt have the capacity to understand that any type of harm that her negligent husband does to anyone that walks into their office will go back to them multiplied.  She's so ignorant that she actually thinks her and her husband can get away with doing harm to patients. Christine Chius lack of compassion and extreme audacity about Dr. Chius malpractice and negligence only shows how disgustingly unjust and audacious she really is.   Instead of thinking and caring about the type of pain and damage that her terrible and reckless husband has caused a patient, and how he has harmed and affected them physically and emotionally, she is only concerned about pathetically attempting to intimidate patients by her childish and desperate behavior and trying to make sure that people dont find out about Dr. Gabriel Chius ridiculous negligence and malpractice and that nobody files a malpractice lawsuit against them.   Little does she know that she cant do anything about that when her husband has been so grossly negligent.   Christine Chiu is also too ignorant and blind to see that there is a bigger court that God runs and one day, someone is going to harm them even worse than what Dr. Chiu did to me. And at that time, both Gabriel and Christine Chiu will know what justice really is and that they shouldnt harm their patients.  They seem to think theyre untouchable, but they will pay for every bit of pain and harm theyve caused. They dont know that God is a just God and Dr. Chiu and his family will pay for every single mistake and damage that he did in my case and for every bit of tear, pain and harm that he has caused by his gross negligence.  They will also pay for Christine Chius disgusting and ridiculous audacity and lack of any care or compassion.   They pathetically try so hard to make themselves appear as such professionals and put a bunch of glorified reviews on their homepage to fool patients and write fake online reviews to cover up for all the bad reviews that they so desperately try to delete.  Just do a good Google search to find out more about how terribly negligent Dr. Gabriel Chiu really is. Gabriel and Christine Chiu are a good match. They are both Godless and heartless people who only care about making money and have no concern about how their negligence affects and hurts someone.  I don't know how either of them can sleep at night after doing such physical and emotional harm to someone.  Both Gabriel and Christine Chiu will pay for every tear, pain and harm they have caused. They won't get away with even one tear shed or any issues caused by Dr. Gabriel Chiu's gross negligence.  Ripoff Report Verified™ REVIEW:

Their new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. They are willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers.

We frequently interact with our patients post-surgically and diligently monitor patient recovery process.

“We have one of the most frequent post-operative, follow up schedules in the plastic surgery community. The doctor sees all patients himself for numerous follow up appointments. We also are known to be extremely accessible. Patients have the doctor’s cell phone number, home number, direct line at office, in addition to patient care coordinators’ direct lines and cell phone numbers.” Testimonials from physicians who have worked with Dr. Chiu and Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery:  ""I have known Dr. Chiu for more than 10 years, and from 2003 to 2005 we worked for the same specialty group. During this time, I personally observed his clinical and surgical skills. He is highly respected by our peers and patients for his technical and artistic ability. He also has a deep respect for our surgical practice. He often attends meetings, above and beyond what is needed for CME requirements, in order to stay abreast with the latest changes in our profession. Although we no longer work for the same surgical group, I still maintain a robust academic relationship with him, and we consult each other for suggestions and advice on different topics involving plastic surgery. He has proven himself to be an outstanding and caring surgeon, and I recommend him to you without reservation.” – Dr. Howard Hu, plastic surgeon

“I have known him for 9 years and have worked with him for 4. I have worked with him in the operating room as well as in patient care. I have found him to be of superior knowledge in his field of plastic surgery. He is excellent in the operating room where his technique is wonderful and his care of patients superb. Lastly, he is wonderful with his patients, who love him.” – Dr. Richard Hodnett, plastic surgeon

“His clinical acumen and bedside manners are admirable. He has proven to be an excellent source of information and I frequently find myself adopting his recommendations. Judging by the number of his referrals, his treatment plans more than satisfy his patients’ needs. His surgical habits are as meticulous as one would hope for. He organizes a sound surgical plan but his the flexibility to adjust to any situation that may arise. He is efficient with his time, yet is artistic to his patients’ individual needs. He has always shown himself to be ethically responsible and upstanding. He cares very much for his patients. I have always known him to look out for his patients’ welfare and health above any personal gain. He exemplifies the spirit of professionalism and care. I am proud to call him a colleague and recommend him to you without reservation.” – Dr. Paymon Simoni, plastic surgeon

“He is an excellent surgeon and physician. He is one of the most meticulous surgeons I have ever worked with, and is well-respected by his medical peers, nurses, and operating room personnel who have had the pleasure of working with or for him. His attentiveness, skill, professional integrity, and patient care is commendable and consistent throughout the entire surgery process and I will continue to recommend my patients, friends, and family to him without reservation.” – Dr. Paul Nassif, facial plastic surgeonThe information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Christine Chiu during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery, Inc.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..


In order to provide great customer care for patients, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery offers customer service that is provided by Client Services Coordinators who are specifically assigned to each patient for the entirety of their relationship with the office. Christine Chiu stated that, “All aspects of the anonymous complaint made against us appear to be unfounded, false, and without merit.” 

Their Client Services Coordinators consult individuals about their pretreatment process and are also responsible for following up with clients after treatment to ensure that the clients’ healing continues as expected. 

After complaints were made about them on Ripoff Report, their office staff still continues to provide excellent service to each and every customer and client. 

When asked to describe their standard practices for resolving customer complaints Mrs. Chiu explained, “Each client is provided with the office phone, mobile phone, and home phone number for their surgeon, as well as for their Client Services Coordinator. Any issues are addressed immediately and if immediate action is not possible, then the issues are addressed as soon as reasonably possible at the client’s 100% convenience. For example, if a client sends a text message or calls at 1:00 am the surgeon and the Client Services Coordinator will both respond within a few minutes, if not sooner.” 

Their process for advising treatment plans for patients is a one-on-one process handled by the surgeon, as well as the Client Services Coordinator. 

Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery, Inc. maintains that complaints made about them on Ripoff Report are false. For example, one of the anonymous complaints stated that the client was happy to know the office could remain in business because of the other surgeons in the practice. However, they only have one physician/surgeon in their office. 

During the onsite interview Mrs. Chiu was asked about a complaint that was made by a patient that did not feel as though they received accurate and complete consultation before and after treatments: “The anonymous complaint is based on vague and untrue information which does not reflect the experience of any patient ever seen by our office. 

With over 15,000 successful procedures performed on just as many clients, there have only been complaints by less than 1/10th of 1%, which is effectively less than 10 patients in the very long history of the office’s practice. In each one of those cases, the office bent over backwards to make sure that any and all issues were eventually resolved to the final satisfaction of those clients.” 

All patients are advised accordingly in an open, honest and ethical manner, especially when handling a situation where a client is looking for a procedure to be done that, in the physician’s professional opinion, is not an area of concern for their current state. 

Their company has taken the filing of this apparently false complaint as a real “gut punch.” Customer service has always been their top priority and it remains so at this time as they move forward.

His work really stood out the most to me and I decided to go see him. I was still a little nervous but after talking with him all my fears were taken away. The way he talks about everything is so informative and honest. He doesn’t give you unrealistic expectations and helps you understand exactly what you need to know is best for you. I was worried about my recovery and if I would be able to take care of my kids after. My recovery went better than I thought and I had very little pain. Everything turned out so good thank you!"" 
Gina ""After having four children I never thought I would be happy with the way I looked ever again! After meeting with him I regained hope of feeling beautiful again. He talked with me about all my options and gave me all the information I needed. My husband and I agreed with everything he proposed and my results turned out amazing! I can’t believe how great I look! My husband is very happy also mostly because I am so happy. Thank you so much!""

Quite frankly, with all the bad faith coming from one individual, its surprising no one

										TRM is a fertility clinic.  My husband and I went for testing to determine why we were not getting pregnant.  Semen analysis was done and we were told there were no issues.  TRM then advised labs, ultrasounds, and xrays for me.  $3000 later I am told Im healthy.TRM gave us their sales pitch for IFV at $28,000 plus $5,000 in medication.  TRM during my labs and other procedures failed repeatedly to return my calls re: medication questions being prescribed and some cramping/abnormal bleeding between procedures.  So, I was not comfortable at this point to trust them to perform IVF.I left their practice and met with two other doctors to review my file. Both reported my husband labs (done by TRM) indicated low sperm count and not normal as TRM reported.  TRM also told there were no other options for me except IVF and I have been given several other options for care and infertility treatment.   They also told me an ultrasound they performed showed very little scarring from a past surgery I had.  I was later informed scar tissue can not be seen on any ultrasound or xray.  TRM also told me hormonally I was healthy with all levels normal.  Both new doctors confirmed my labs done by TRM indicated some low levels that could effect fertility.  I was laced on medication to fix a under active thyroid. I was told untreated, it could cause birth defects if I had become pregnant. I was given reportedly bad information.  Clearly helping me get pregnant was not in TRMs best interest, but selling $33,000 in IVF was their goal.									",Doctors

										My complaint is against Dr. Todd Glassman. I made an appointment to see him as he had been recommended to me by a friend. He calls himself a pain management Dr except he is not licensed in Pain Management which I did not find this out til later. When I made the appointment they quoted me $145.99 for an initial visit. This sounded reasonable so I kept my appt. When I got there I was informed that it would be $245.00 plus lab fees for urine tests plus $75.00 for and exg. Don't ask me why they needed that as I had all my records sent over with a recent ekg report. I unfortunately paid this exorbitant fee but I suffer from such severe pain all over I would have paid $1000.00 if I had that much just to get rid of it. I have been going to pain management for over 10 years and have been prescribed many different pain medications. I know which work and what doesnt. After arguing with him for 15 minutes he wrote me a prescription for OPana 10mg. It is Morphine Sulfate and 60 milligrams doesnt even work for me. But I took the prescription and got the hell out of there as he was so rude and condesending I could not be in the room with him one more minute. I come to find that over 45 pharmacies I went too Nobody in South Florida carries this medication. They can order it but it is $500.00 dollars. I told him I had no insurance and his doctor visit just about broke me that week. Makes me believe he is getting kick backs from the drug companies which last time I checked it was illegal. I cancelled my credit card but because I actually saw him they would not give me a credit. I made a deal with him that if I brought the Opana prescription back he would give me generic medication that would work and be alot less expensive. When I got there they demanded another $245.00 just to switvch the prescriptions when when I called they said it would be free. Then he decided even if I paid him which I was not going to do he still wouldnt switch the prescription out. This Dr is a crook a liar and a thief. If you have any sense you will not use him as a Doctor. I would hate to see him pull the same thing on someone with documented pain issues.									",Doctors

Rochester, Minnesota United States of America ",www.mayoclinic.org,(507) 284-2511,"Mayo Clinic Rochester Department of Surgery Jill Smith Esq not handling safety issues in care & diagnosis when patient harm is done with a procedure that the patient did not consent to or discuss, without proper workup, to fill an OR slot, with help that shou Rochester, Minnesota","
										Medical mistakes are a problem for Massachusetts General, and for Mayo Clinic, but the difference is the handling of the mistake, and the wrong procedure, or a procedure that was never consented to for good reasons.  When a woman MD won't consent to a procedure, and you don't have more than 5 minutes to discern the reasons, there is a good reason - which there was in one case at Mayo Clinic that went horribly wrong 15 years ago.  The case is still not undone.  
And you can't shut the patient up so that she/he can't help mark the sight of pain (sign-the-site), or tell the surgeon the other facts if she/he needs to - with an anesthesia that she/he did not agree to.  OR vacancies don't cost as much as the care to undo this one mess.  OR vacancies should be handled not by the individual surgeons, but by OR management that then puts another case into the room.  You don't say to a MD patient that the only 'opening' you have is an OR slot tomorrow.  So take it or no care.  The Mayo Clinic has Jill Smith Legal Counsel blame the patient, cut the patient emails by administrative blocking so that there can be no follow-up care, and not undoing the surgical harm - for even 15 years - resulting in a mess of compounding surgical and decision-making errors that are not improved.  It's not just the individual patient that suffers, if the Mayo Clinic refuses to undo the harm, admit the harm and change protocols.  Jill Smith handles things in an outdated quality-minus way. 
When patients come to Mayo Clinic they are second-opinions.  It means that surgeons can't be taking people to the OR the next day, without checking all the facts & scans, to fill an OR slot - as Dr. Michael Sarr does.  It's not a language difficulty, it is an information transfer problem - that any physician can only take in so much patient history per 20 minutes.  And the patient will be in pain, and misdiagnosed, but you still can't have the medical evaluation done by a fellow studying for her Boards, and bring in the graveyard crew of a hapless surgical intern, and the worst medical student in whites, to help with the surgery.  
Attendings at Mayo Clinic are expected to throw out the unprepared, and not keep an inadequately trained intern & medical student for the procedure - no matter the race or gender.  All Mayo Clinic attendings should be able to insist on proper 'help' at the level of Chief of General Surgery - and if Dr. Sarr can't, he should be removed.  Because that is bad management.       
The wrong procedure was done for this problem, the medical consultation might have picked things up if done in a routine way, and a scan needed to be done.  The OR staff should have bounced the procedure without a consent form, no anesthesia consult, no scan, and no surgical marking done. 
But no one did.
Mayo Clinic needs to accept responsibilty for this case, and undo the wrong procedure - there was no correct procedure needed.  But more than that, Mayo needs to adopt quality care management.
A OR mistake at Massachusetts General was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2010.  Mayo Clinic needs to adopt a similar protocol. 
First when a patient comes for a workup - you don't fill an OR slot with that patient without checking with the physician from out-of-state.  Even a physician patient needs to be checked on - because sometimes they don't know all the facts - no one is completely honest even with a physician patient.  You don't not do the workup - even if it has been reported as negative - you do or re-do all scans and labs and not pressure the patient about the time needed for this - it's well spent.  It's not a patient's fault that an OR slot is suddenly vacant for a Mayo MD - that's the problem for the OR staff & scheduling team - they can fill this slot.  
If a patient does not agree to more than a limited 'biopsy' kind of procedure - there does not need to be an intern & student on the case.  If that 'help' does not know the case, they should be sent out of the room and 'off' the case.  No excuses.  If anesthesia has not seen the patient with clothing on, then the case needs to be off the schedule until anesthesia clears.  Surgeons should not be scheduling cases before anesthesia clearance - in person, with clothing on, with the labs & scans and then an exam in a gown - as all other consults go.  
If the patient hasn't got the consent form, the anesthesia clearance, and the site is not marked - that is not the fault of the patient - Mayo Clinic needs to cancel the procedure.  And Jill Smith needs to insist on this - and she doesn't. 
Once a wrong, or unanticipated procedure happens, it is Mayo Clinic's fault & responsibility to undo as soon as possible.  When a procedure that the patient did not consent to is done, it is the same problem - it has to be undone.  Jill Smith Esq can't negate this physician responsibility - it is Mayo Clinic's responsibility.  Other physicians can improve the deformity temporarily, but it is Mayo Clinic's responsibility to undo as soon as possible - not 15 years later.
When the wrong, or an unconsented procedure, is done the physician - even the Chief of General Surgery - has to call the patient & family, admit the problem, and offer to undo.  Most surgeons will not undo a wrong procedure that Mayo Clinic has done - because Mayo Clinic does some signature procedures and closures.
What should be done with OR mistakes at Mayo Clinic?  First the physician, OR staff, and Jill Smith, should admit that the procedure was not consented to, waive all charges (including Dr. Sarr's fee), and offer to undo without cost to the patient.  A financial settlement can be negotiated depending on if the procedure can be undone.  
When all charges are waived except Dr. Sarr's fee, and then Dr. Sarr tries to sue the patient for defammation - the Mayo Clinic is not admitting the problem.  Patients need to know this - that instead of admitting surgical errors, that certain Mayo surgeons will try to sue the patient for defammation.  Defammation suits are messy, and the Mayo Clinic will try to say that the patient needs psychiatric help.  So going to the Mayo Clinic, all patients need to discuss 'errors' with their surgeon or internist - what will happen if errors occur?  If that Mayo surgeon will sue for defammation to deny the facts, then you need to leave the room.
Denial doesn't help, and in one case the law firm had to refuse to file the defammation suit.  The law firm had to tell Dr. Sarr that he made a mistake, and needed to correct the problem, and accept the blame.  But Jill Smith should have told him the same thing, as Chief Legal Counsel for Mayo Rochester, and she didn't.  
Mayo Clinic has been doing unnecessary abdominal wall neurectomies on patients for the last 15-20 years.  The Medical Board of Minnesota has been informed of this, but not been willing to intervene because of the fact that neurectomy is a procedure even if being misused by Mayo Clinic surgeons - General, Vascular, Neuro, etc.  It's a system error apparently - you can't take the licenses of a group of physicians misusing a procedure, or it's messy.  It's a Mayo Clinic error, which Mayo Clinic Proceedings has published the correct treatment on.  The surgeons need to be held to the standards published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings.
The treatment of this nerve inflammation is just a 2% lidocaine injection - as discussed in a Mayo Clinic article in Mayo Clinic Proceedings in January 2011.  So all these neurectomy procedures need to be undone - the treatment since 1926 has been an injection of an anesthetic agent - not a trip to the OR.  The procedure needs to be stopped at the highest levels at Mayo Clinic.  Dr. Sarr needs to inform patients of all options, and that surgery is a last resort - not a next day picnic.
All patients requesting undoing of this - undoing of the common mass closure and repair of the abdominal wall fascia cut - need to be offered the corrective procedure.  Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals of wherever, etc. can't undo these procedures - and they are painfully deforming closures.  The neurectomy procedure is a general surgery procedure needing anesthesia - which should not be done without informed consent - earth to Jill Smith.  Dr. Sarr needs to 'sign-his site' of surgery.  Writing his initials over the planned incision site with a permanent marker before the patient enters the operating room.  The sight of neurectomy pain needed to be marked - if he was ill-advisedly taking these to surgery.  He was deficient in this - and it was not the responsibility of the 3-month woman intern, or patient, to do this.  Dr. Sarr - as Chief of General Surgery at Mayo Clinic - needs to mark & sign his surgical sites.  Patients reading this, who have appointments at Mayo Clinic, need to have their 'site-signed' even for x-rays - so that a marker can be applied for the radiologist.This is the Sign your Site program & campaign - and it works.  Then there needs to be a systematic & consistent approach to identify the correct patient, correct operation, and correct site before each operation is started - the intern needs to insist that the site is marked.  And in the one case the intern was a 3-month inadequate poorly trained assistant - worse than a surgical technologist as she didn't know the suture types, and she had apparently never used a scalpel.  Medical Student training is not uniform, and the first thing with new surgical residents is to put them through lab simulations and some surgical technology training - with sign-offs by staff viewing the labs & simulations.  
All Dr. Sarr's errors need to be disclosed with this procedure: how many of these procedures were never consent to?  And they need to be undone with a general & plastic surgeon at Mayo's expense as soon as possible.  Jill Smith needs to get up-to-speed, or Mayo needs another Chief Legal Counsel.   ",Doctors

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",http://www.ohiosenate.gov/patton,(614) 466-8056,"Senator Tom Patton Kimberly Anderson Interim Director State Medical Board of Ohio don't allow women MDs blood work - while every woman JD in Columbus makes sure to get her thyroid function tests for fertility (and testosterone for aggressive), but no women MDs are allowed this before Columbus, Ohio","
										Ultimate stupidity in Ohio is making the classic mistake of ordering multiple serial psych evaluations for assorted symptoms that in the end turn out to be just missed thyroiditis.  Especially when a woman MD is falsely accused of all kinds of bizarre things at the State Medical Board, it should be a no-brainer to check thyroid function tests.  You can't be seductive, paranoid, a personality disorder, bipolar, asking your orthopedic out 'ice skating' - and have no patient complaints.  Translation: there's something 'wrong' with what the orthopedic did to the woman MD.  
The 'crazy' confidential Medical Board complaint in Ohio, is a clue that the woman MD had 'serious' mistakes in her own medical care, and that she probably has a missed diagnosis that the male geeks (unfashionable or socially inept person) are trying to get out of by accusing her of being 'crazy.'  Happens every day in Ohio at the Cleveland Clinic - happens because colleagues can misuse the 'confidential' complaint system and vote to suspend hospital privileges when there are medical mistakes at Hillcrest & CCF - mistakes made in the care of the woman MD.  Medical Board suspensions are being used to hide the scope of the medical mistake problem in Ohio.  Tom Patton, and his pre-law guys, just go along with the con.  Testosterone does not equal insight.    Tom Patton himself has weight gain, but he'll never know if that could be due to a thyroid problem unless he gets tested and learns something about thyroid disease - which they don't teach you at Cleveland State - even if you finish your degree.  The first clue - hypercholesterolemia unresponsive to diet - but which corrects with synthyroid.  His son the policeman might have had this - leading to a premature heart attack on the job.  But Tom Patton will never know unless he gets a thyroid panel, and finds an Ohio physician who can 'read' that panel.  Male MD/DOs in Ohio are notorious for misreading the thyroid function tests - even when the interpretation is printed out the sheet.  Lance Talmadge MD comes to mind.
A thyroid panel is all that needs to be ordered (3 tests + thyroid antibodies), not just a T4 - which is all that women MDs are allowed in Ohio before their medical licenses are taken for 'provisional.'  And the T4 had to be ordered out-of-state for the one woman MD.  In Ohio MDs, and Medical Board Member MD/DOs, don't order thyroid panels.  
Lance Talmadge MD doesn't believe in them (thyroid tests), Anita Steinbergh DO doesn't allow women MDs medical workups (she's a DO & only DOs get medical workups in Ohio).  Thyroid panels cost less than psychiatric evaluations, less than Medical Board Hearings or Meetings, and less than 20 years of someone's career and multiple fractures.  
Senator Patton won't discuss, won't listen, and won't admit the problem - the problem of medical mistakes in Ohio and at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  The State Medical Board of Ohio wants to diagnose women MDs with psych disorders that they don't have, while refusing to allow medical & thyroid workups & treatment.  Thyroid symptoms are a mixed bag, run the gamut, but you have to order the blood work - and women MDs writing letters because the blood work is not done does not equate with a personality disorder.  
The State Medical Board of Ohio makes this mistake every day - spending huge sums of money saying that women MDs are exaggerating thyroid symptoms - and thyroid symptoms are all over the 'map' of symptoms.  Gail Devers went to testify before Congress in 2000 about these missed thyroid problems in women - the problem caused by her misdiagnosed Graves disease.  On Wednesday, January 26, 2000, five-time Olympic gold medalist and thyroid patient Gail Devers testified to Congress about her own years of misdiagnosis, during which a severe case of hyperthyroidism went undiscovered.  Meanwhile, in Ohio the woman MD thyroid patient is still inadequately treated - because she is supposed to admit that she 'made too much' and not mention the medical mistakes that happened in her care.  She can't even be a spokesperson for herself - her thyroid problem is not allowed treatment officially.  In Devers' case, doctor after doctor failed to recognize the signs of severe Graves' disease, as the Olympic gold medal-winning athlete dropped from 125 to only 87 pounds, suffered debilitating fatigue, lost nearly all her hair, and suffered other symptoms she has described as ""traumatic.""  In one Ohio woman MD's case, she has been traumatized by lack of care of thyroid symptoms and serial unnecessary psychiatric evaluations for the symptoms - fractures & bone pains.  So there is at least one woman MD who has been subject to years of misdiagnosis of her thryoid problems in Ohio, and had her medical license taken for objecting that there was 'something else' wrong = thyroid disease is an impairment in Ohio.  And there are probably more - and these women MDs have no patient complaints and do their CME.
The Gail Dever's miss - the Gail Dever's saga repeats in Ohio at the State Medical Board probably daily - as the Board looks for women to 'make or break' when they object to wrong care, missed diagnoses, and medical mistakes by male MDs (and male legislators) in Ohio.  In 2000 Devers' testimony was part of a Congressional investigation into ways to combat medical mistakes that are estimated to kill up to 98,000 hospitalized Americans a year.  An unknown additional number of people are harmed or killed by mistakes outside of hospitals each year as well - as this Ohio woman MD was.  The Congressional inquiry was based on a report that was released by the Institute of Medicine in November of 1999.  The study called for mandatory reporting of medical errors, and for Congress to create a Federal Center for Patient Safety to investigate ways to prevent medical errors and establish better standards for patient safety.  There is currently no mandatory reporting of medical errors in Ohio, there is general misdiagnosis and misunderstanding of thyroid problems even among Medical Board Members & Ohio Legislators, and this is 2013.  And no legislator is interested in investigating ways to prevent medical errors in Ohio - they don't occur.  The woman MD in Tom Patton's district 24, who has had her MEDICAL license suspended x 20 years for 'making too much of bone pains' which led to serious fractures, which in the end were found to be caused by neglect of treatment of a thyroid condition - this woman MD was made fun of, even though her symptoms were classic thyroid - severe fatigue & bone weakness among them.  The woman attorneys, like Kimberly Anderson, get you in a room and just laugh at you - it's a big joke.
Even though every woman Medical Board Member, Kimberly Anderson, and every woman legislator (ANIELSKI), and her staff (HALLIE), gets thyroid function tests - the WHOLE PANEL, it was a policy of Richard Whitehouse, and before him Tom Dilling - that women MDs did not need blood work - just a new right Ohio psychiatrist.  That's the classic thyroid miss, mistreated with psych evaluations.  
The Tom Patton 'made an example of' woman MD did not have the HUGE health problems & systemic symptoms of Gale Devers - but she was not just 'unlucky.'  She didn't almost lose her leg or feet, but she was subjected to unnecessary procedures & 20 years of 'hell.'  This woman MD did at least deserve thyroid function tests, and treatment of her thyroid condition, BEFORE her medical license was taken for 'making too much.'  
If you don't treat thyroiditis, it can lead to thyroid cancer or lymphoma, besides divorce, medical mistreatment, and unnecessary surgeries for abdominal or extremity pain, swelling, and nerve inflammations.  This woman MD should not have had to 'make too much of admittedly bad care.'  And she has not been able to testify to the State Medical Board of Ohio how Ohio physicians dismissed her symptoms and counter-complained about her to the State Medical Board of Ohio so that she wouldn't sue for the mistakes in orthopedic care.  The woman MD's symptoms were 'nomal' for a woman MD.  
In Devers' testimony, she described how doctors dismissed her symptoms of weight loss, fatigue, rapid heart rate, and dry skin as normal for an Olympic athlete in training.  After more than two years, and in such a severe state that doctors discussed amputating her leg, Devers was finally diagnosed.  She had radioactive iodine treatment to disable her thyroid, and was put on thyroid hormone replacement therapy.  She went on to win gold medals in the 100-meter dash at the 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games.  
In the woman MD's testimony, she described severe fatigue, bone pains, fractures that didn't heal, and the misdiagnosis went on for 10 years, and even 20 years later the Ohio State Medical Board will not admit the misdiagnosis and mistreatment of the woman MD.  She's supposed to get a 6th psychiatric evaluation, and not ever mention the mistakes and bad care again - so that it gets done to another woman patient or MD.  And this is after the Congressional Hearings mandating reporting of medical errors.
Medical errors are not mandated reported in Ohio - there are no stats on the scope of the problem.  And there are no stats on how many woman MDs have had their medical licenses taken to admit a diagnosis that they don't have to cover up the medical mistakes done to them - but there is at least one that Tom Patton is sitting on - her thyroid symptoms are still NOT adequately treated, and she now has no medical insurance as she has no medical license or decent job.
Devers is now urging Americans to learn the early warning signs of critical conditions, including thyroid disease, so they can better communicate with doctors and demand better care.  But that didn't save the woman MD - the demanding of better care - who has now had 20 years of misdiagnosis & mistreatment of her thyroid disease - even telling her physicians what she had didn't get the Cleveland Clinic to treat her - because they are afraid that their medical licenses will be taken for admitting the mistake.  Tom Patton is going along with this 'conspiracy of silence,' as is Kimberly Anderson as long as she can get her thyroid function tests ordered.  Tom Patton needs his own thyroid function tests ordered - but he won't have to lose his Senate job to get them.    
This is hypocritical, and Ohio needs to have mandated reporting of medical errors starting with the thyroid problems missed.  Medical licenses should not be taken without care-to-function; allowing that all symptoms are worked up & accounted for.  No woman MD should get 4 psych evaluations mandated by the State Medical Board of Ohio, without complete blood work and thyroid function tests mandated first.  The problem in this case: that the Ohio orthopedics, and Medical Board Members, and woman Board attorneys could not recognize thyroid symptoms if they had the symptoms themselves - but they wouldn't go near a psychiatrist - they reserve that humiliation for women MDs.
Gail Devers is a paid spokeswoman for the GlandCentral Campaign, sponsored by the American Medical Women's Association, and funded by Knoll Pharmaceuticals, manufacturer of Synthroid brand levothyroxine sodium thyroid hormone.  Gail Devers is allowed to say the mistakes that happened.  In order for the Ohio woman MD to get her medical license back, she is supposed to 'get over it,' and not mention the problems that still need fixing in Ohio - per Anita Steinbergh.  Thyroid disease is not a psychiatric diagnosis, and doesn't require a psychiatrist - and Anita & Lance should know this.  
The standards of bad care that women MDs in Ohio are supposed to tolerate, are not standards that any Medical Board Member, or State Medical Board attorney, would ever tolerate.  But the woman MD was just 'making too much?'  The standards of judging a woman MD are more than any Medical Board Member would pass, or agree with being done to themselves.  
Time for Tom Patton to learn something about thyroid disease - it affects women under stress, runners, MDs, RNs, and pregnant women.  And it can affect men - weight gain is one of the symptoms - so he might want to get his profile checked - not just a T4.  But the woman MD needs her medical license back, her thyroid & bone condition correctly treated.  There needs to be an end to the misdiagnosis, and missed, thyroid problems at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  You don't call Dr. Resnick.

University Suburban Health Center,"  University Suburban Health Center  1611 South Green Rd 
South Euclid, Ohio United States of America ",www.universitysuburban.org,216-382-1868,"University Suburban Health Center Thomas Stellato MD Medical Director can't diagnose or treat conservatively the most common cause of abdominal wall pain, despite being a Chief of Surgery at University Hospitals, can't repair 3 abdominal wall fascia des South Euclid, Ohio","
										The most common cause of abdominal wall pain - Anterior Cutaneous [Abdominal] Nerve Entrapment Syndrome (ACNES) - does not require surgery.  But it requires a surgeon with a brain - to tell, discern, or elucidate this problem from a surgical problem, and not schedule an unnecessary surgery.  The treatment: an injection of 2% lidocaine makes the diagnosis & treats.    
This is something that is goofed up from Mayo Clinic, to Cleveland Clinic, to Massachusetts General; General Surgeons don't get abdominal wall pain - how to diagnose, how to treat, the physical exam, the anatomy, the pathophysiology & clinical presentation.  This is probably because the surgeons who write about abdominal wall pain do it badly - from Silen to Stellato.
Abdominal wall pain is the most common cause of ABDOMINAL PAIN - muscle spasms can cause this, pregnancy, and sports injuries - abdominal muscle overuse syndromes occur with exercise machines, track, football, soccer, lacrosse, abdominal crunches, yoga, pilates, and that joke of a sport that can still lead to sports injuries - cheerleading.    
Carol, Dr. Stellato's secretary, doesn't get the clinical presentation anymore than he does - if you try to say that you need to discuss, Dr. Stellato thinks that you are 'standing him up.'  Dr. Stellato needs to get beyond college dating - or beyond cheerleading.  
Dr. Stellato has a list of things that he can handle on his PR materials (and he lists a Nurse Practitioner who is more phantom ghost than real): cholecystectomy, bariatrics, etc.  Nowhere on the list is abdominal wall pain = the commonest reason that a patient would seek consultation with a general surgeon.  Before a patient gets morbidly obese, they get obese and all the nerve exit points are stretched, irritated, and inflamed.  This nerve inflammation, if recognized & properly treated, should be reason enough to lose weight in the 'right' hands - it brings the patient to the surgeon before the need for bariatric procedures = a good thing.Before something goes wrong with the appendix, ovary, or gallbladder - and the Administration at University Suburban is to be faulted for not understanding this - something will go wrong with the abdominal wall.  This problem is a gold mine for those able to recognize the problem - and it doesn't involve a scalpel, an anesthesia guy/gal, or a gurney.  It requires a brain. 
Sports injuries, pregnancies, surgical incisions - you name it - can cause abdominal nerve compression = ACNES.  Women, with smaller abdominal walls, develop this problem more than men - and it needs to be differentiated from kidney, bladder, ovarian, gallbladder, stomach, or other - and kept off surgical scheduling until there is an injection - complete relief of pain by an injected anesthetic agent establishes the diagnosis.  No one who has trained under Dr. Stellato, as a medical student or resident, has ever seen him do an exam for this, a workup for this, or an injection for this extremely common problem.  He's missed all of these cases for 64 years of living - unable to see an abdominal wall that doesn't need an incision, or another incision, he will call the South Euclid Police to remove these patients.  Carol is in on the problem in a big way - she's a complete dufus when speaking to a woman MD, or a patient with abdominal wall pain.  But the bigger dufus is Dr. Stellato.      
Dr. Stellato doesn't have a code to bill for this injection or exam.  The diagnosis requires an injection, NOT AN OR.  Which is why Carol has a problem with this - she can't get her head around abdominal wall pain that does not involve a surgery.  She can't communicate to Dr. Stellato, and Dr. Stellato doesn't discuss with women MDs.  It's like playing 'telephone' with the old Campbell's soup cans - nothing is said that is intelligible.  Each time a patient's abdomen is examined for any reason, the examiner should feel for the anterior abdominal wall aponeurotic nerve openings, easily palpable except in obese patients.  This exam is never done.
Surgeons have to avoid these openings when making incisions - so they have to be diagrammed on the physical exam abdominal wall picture - prior to surgery.  This documentation has to be done by all surgeons: from Dr. Ponsky, to Dr. Stellato, to Dr. Rosen - and none of them do this so all of them miss this benign cause of abdominal wall pain, and they all cause problems with incisions that cut nerves, or damage the anterior abdominal wall nerves.  
Dr. Stellato does this with regular statistical predictability, and the others do also.  There isn't a General Surgeon in Cleveland that doesn't cause this problem with misplaced incisions or damage during the procedure (as they don't know what they are feeling).  Dr. Stellato never goes into a procedure and palpates these openings directly to make sure that they are not part of the abdominal pain problem.  They should be felt before any appendectomy.      
There are 10 openings that classically can cause localized pain along the lateral rectus muscles: T-8, T-9, T-10, T-11, and T-12/L-1.  You can find cartoons with these illustrated on the web.  And as Dr. Stellato reads my 'Ripoff Reports,' but doesn't want to discuss, they are listed here.  
There's no Chief of Surgery that currently teaches this exam, but the problem starts in the Review Materials for the Boards of General Surgery - review materials that Dr. Stellato is responsible for, review materials that are minus entities that women get more than male patients.  If Dr. Stellato had diagrammed these nerve exists before surgery, he wouldn't miss all the ACNES nerve problems that occur after his surgeries.  And the women MDs wouldn't be 'standing him up' in the OR to try to discuss.  There isn't an intern or resident at UH that knows how to do the exam, ditto Mayo Clinic and Akron General.  Cleveland Clinic ignores the problem - they just deal with HEARTS.       
Dr. Stellato doesn't appear to have the ACNES brain - and ACNES is nowhere on the Boards of General Surgery questions.  Despite being the most common cause of abdominal wall pain, and the most commonly overlooked cause of abdominal wall pain, almost everyone who has written about abdominal wall pain overlooks this diagnosis - including him - something that he has contributed to.  Dr. Stellato has contributed big-time to the SINKHOLE in the literature on this problem.  
Everyone misses the diagnosis, including him, because he doesn't put it in the Review Materials for the Boards of General Surgery.  And University Suburban doesn't put this problem on the coding list for abdominal wall problems - so it doesn't get diagnosed or treated properly - and Administrative gaffe.  If you can't bill for it, you can't diagnose it - or so the mantra goes.  The Billing people start the problem.
Carol, Dr. Stellato's secretary, hasn't a clue what this is to put on the office sheets, scheduling, the billing sheets, or to answer questions about it.  Carol has just graduated to being able to do a BP check - which is not the major problem or diagnostic dilemma of a General Surgeon's office.  Maybe if she knew how to listen to abdominal wall pain symptoms things wouldn't be so screwed up, but she has no medical training.        
Then Dr. Stellato can't repair the botched surgeries for this problem:  Mayo Clinic will take and cut the muscle fascias to remove the normal nerve.  Dr. Stellato should be able to repair muscle fascias, but he apparently doesn't list that on his 'do' list either.  Repairing muscle fascia is what every surgical closure is basically in General Surgery - but he can't do this repair?  Having missed being conservatively helpful, he can't be surgically helpful.
Dr. Stellato, and University Suburban, need to improve things so that abdominal walls are examined properly - for all patients from professional MDs to dirt-bags.  Dr. Stellato needs to put these nerve foramina exams/locations on his office charts, and to learn to treat conservatively - which Carol should have a code for as Kaiser treats this diagnosis in clinics in bulk.  
Dr. Stellato pretending that he can't repair abdominal wall fascia in layers, while protesting that he should have gotten the Chief of Surgery nod at University Hospitals, is hypocritical.  What do Chiefs of Surgery do besides abdominal wall pain, fascias, and abdominal wall pain.  The criteria for the Chief of General Surgery at University Hospitals should be to be able to teach this problem - and none of them can - that includes Mr. Hernia Dr. Rose - who thinks that you have to open women up to tell this problem.  If the pain goes away with the injection, it wasn't a suture or a neuroma, it was ACNES.  You don't need the OR Dr. Rosen, and $250 an office visit is a bit much for someone to teach you this concept.      
Chiefs of Surgery, and the art of surgery, means that you do the proper exam, do the differential, and do only what needs to be done with aesthetics while treating the patient with dignity & respect.  Not doing the exam, missing the diagnosis, and calling the South Euclid Police Department to threaten the patient is not respectful, necessary, or standard of care for ACNES.  It's surgical bullshit - the pretend of being a surgeon.  
Dr. Stellato should not have been missing this problem from 1990-2013.  There's no indication that University Suburban has improved the diagnosis, treatment, exam, or even obtained the correct billing codes for the treatment (an injection of 2% lidocaine).  It does not involve a trip to Wright Surgery Center, unless the patient had to go to Mayo Clinic and be cut up - needing a fascial repair.  And Dr. Stellato's office notes should have gone to Mayo Clinic on that case - with the nerve foramina diagrammed - so that he could have seen that one of the foramina was inflammed by the chart.  
None of this missed diagnosis, or botched treatment of it, belongs in the South Euclid Police Department.  Because Dr. Stellato didn't do the studying of the problem, didn't incorporate ACNES into the General Surgery Boards materials, and couldn't discuss with any of the list of women patients that he missed this on - none of that is the fault of the South Euclid Police Department.  That's Administrative malpractice of the grossest kind - can't find the billing codes, call the police department?  
The Administration, and the Medical Director, at University Suburban Health Center needs to attack this overlooked cause of abdominal pain with improved triage, improved documentation, and improved treatment - getting the correct billing codes from Kaiser would be a start, having an in-service from a Kaiser physician would be the next step, and Dr. Stellato apologizing to the women patients that he has 'slammed' is the last step.  
No one wants to disagree with Dr. Stellato - as you will probably lose as a woman MD - but patient care of this entity needs to improve starting with Dr. Stellato - before it gets to Ponsky & Rosen.  Dr. Stellato needs to see the WIZARD OF OZ and get a brain that has neural circuits for ACNES.  Women patients are 'half the sky.' 									",Doctors

										State Senator Tom Patton, Ohio 24th District, is going along with Anita Steinbergh DO & Lance Talmadge MD, current longstanding Members of the State Medical Board of Ohio, fabricating 'confidential' cases at the State Medical Board - for years-to-decades now.  Both Members have been re-voted to continue on the State Medical Board of Ohio for 5-year terms while participating in fraudulent cases, blaming the woman MDs with no patient complaints.
The Legislative Senate Health Committee is 'in' on the con - there are never any new names to appoint to the State Medical Board of Ohio - the old ones are just re-cycled and the 'game' continues.  There are no term limits at the State Medical Board of Ohio, but Tom Patton voted one for himself?  What's the profit, or the bluff?   
The mantra at the State Medical Board of Ohio is: blame the woman MD, and get her psychiatrically evaluated multiple times until she admits the false case to get her medical license back.  There are case workers assigned to this bullying - whose whole job is calling the MD lawyers & telling them to admit the case.  That is the State investigation - blackmailing cases.  If you can't work, you can't pay the lawyers.
There is no external review of cases, or decisions, at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Fraud rules, and nothing has anything to do with patient complaints.  Senator Patton has been there for the last 5 years, and done nothing.  He pretends to be Catholic, and the 'Catholic girl MDs are supposed to be easy' for the boys in practice - doing the personals, not the patient stuff.  Catholic RNs, and women MDs, are abused daily in hospitals in Ohio, ie Hillcrest Hospital (now part of Cleveland Clinic Foundation) - while the padres at St. Francis watch the physical, medical & emotional abuse and say nothing (the padres are not doing the abuse, but parishioners are like Dr. Robert Botti Sr).     
Women MDs are not allowed to get medical care-to-function, will have their licenses taken for not going along with bad care, and no one says anything about this because of the 'code of silence.'  If women MDs won't do the 'code,' then they don't 'deserve' to practice medicine or have a medical license.  The Medical Schools trained these women to be honest, to admit mistakes - they passed Medical School with this 'code.'  
The 'code of silence' is difficult to non-workable if the woman MD is the patient being lied to, the patient whose care is being botched.  It's the 'code of silence' vs the 'admit the mistakes' code.  The Harvard Partners & Massachusetts General Hospital systems have a code to admit the mistakes, correct the problems, and pay small cost compensations - it works.
Blood work, bone density testing, routine ob-gyn care, and having a family are not allowed women MDs falsely accused - they are damned to life cycles of psychiatric abuse that they reported bad care - that they 'make too much of admittedly bad care which should not be going on anywhere' - care that however IS going on in Ohio.  Fractures are not supposed to be psychiatric criteria.  Senator Patton is going along with one woman MD not getting proper treatment for a bone condition - for 20 years now so that she dies without the State having to 'pay out' for the damages & liability.  He, and Governor Kasich, watch while she continues to fracture bones.  The Cleveland Clinic won't do treatment until assured that they will not have licenses taken for the 'confidential' of treating a bone condition that the State Medical Board of Ohio won't admit exists despite multiple fractures over 20 years.  
This is as unethical as Hitler was, as unethical as Osama was.  This woman MD's case has no merit.  There currently is 'no case,' but there is no statute of limitations and no procedural way for the State Medical Board of Ohio to admit a mistake - so the woman MD's license has been taken for 20 years - while Tom Patton smiles the smile and gets heavier.  This is done to inflate the stats at the State Medical Board of Ohio, and for the profit of Members who vote for cases that have no merit to get hospitals & hospital systems out of liability.  
The payback is in hospital contract jobs, hospital appointments, hospital privileges, and retirement funds & arrangements - but it's all 'confidential.'  The conflicts of interest of State Medical Board Members are never investigated - because everything is 'confidential' about why certain cases are investigated, and others not.  Current Interim Director Kimberly Anderson has been in charge of these pseudo-investigations for years now, bringing anything into cases including sexual & dating histories.  The Members of the State Medical Board of Ohio never have to recuse themselves from a case - it's all 'confidential.'    
Cases at the State Medical Board of Ohio have to have transparent criteria, statutes of limitations, and allow for proper medical care of the physicians until the case is proven or not proven.  Board Members with conflicts-of-interest need to be required to recuse themselves from ALL votes & investigations that they are involved in, or a party to.  To this end there needs to be no 'provisional' suspensions - so that the medical malpractice & health insurances of the accused physicians are continued to help the physician cope with the costs of the investigation, and continue to get adequate health care.  Destroying an innocent physician's health should not be the way to blackmail a case into existence.
Senator Patton needs to find his moral compass, and insist that the State Medical Board act with due process, with respect for physician confidentiality & health care needs, and in a timely fashion; 20 years is not timely or appropriate.  Cases going beyond 7 years need to be dismissed - as at every other State Medical Board - if Tom Patton did the research & his homework on this issue.  The pre-laws in his office should be on this 'case,' doing something besides filling out their applications for law school, and inflating their resumes with State of Ohio dysfunction.   									",Doctors

										State Senator Tom Patton is allowing that the Ohio State Medical Board of Ohio takes things too far: suspending a woman MD's license for 20 years for objecting to wrong fracture care that she's supposed to get over and never mention again - but oops the orthopedic care has not changed or improved.  
Male orthopedics in Ohio still leave women's fractures uncasted until they feel like casting them (it's mostly males in Ohio), leave the padding out as a joke, and order the wrong x-rays - all of which a woman MD can't undo.  And then if the woman MD complains, breaking the code of silence, the Medical Board takes her medical license for the provisional impairment of not going along with the boys.  Translation: making too much of her bad care - she reported things that went too far - just to get her medical records.  The medical records in the case showed up two years later with edits all over the place: wrong dates, wrong care, wrong everything.  
Hazing, harassment, and belittling - physically & emotionally - is part of medical training especially in a bullyrag state like Ohio - where women are less than men.  It's not that males don't get harassed, it's that the harassing would not continue into care of an illness as it does with women MDs.  
Senator Patton is going along with a woman MD in his district being out of medicine for 20 years and not allowed treatment of the bone condition that the male MDs, who complained about her asking for care, missed.  She had no patient complaints.  Her fractures were left to 'ripen to excrescence,' her blood work was never ordered (Rick Whitehouse & Tom Dilling didn't believe that women MDs needed blood work), and her bone problem was ascribed to 'exaggerating her bone pains' and needing just a new right Ohio psychiatrist.  
Fractures are not manifestations of a psychiatric illness except in Ohio, except for Tom Patton (who didn't finish Cleveland State), and except for the Ohio State Medical Board.  So far Kimberly Anderson has continued the madness - not allowed the woman to get treatment of her bone problem.  But if Ms. Anderson had a thyroid problem - it would get the correct lab work, the correct treatment, and never lead to bone weakness & fractures.  But she doesn't allow women MDs the same treatment.  
Senator Patton needs to call a halt to this situation.  There needs to be an investigation into the misuse of the 'confidential' complaints system at the State Medical Board of Ohio - especially the colleague complaints that lead to loss of medical licensure without patient problems - the jealous complaints.  The hazing went too far in this situation - the reason that the woman had fractures was not the same reason that men have fractures.  So her fractures collapsed badly - requiring 2 years of physical therapy and healing of complications - at a time when she wanted to get married & start a family.  
There needs to be reforms at the State Medical Board of Ohio - even Tom Patton should be able to see this.  The harassments, the bad care of women, and the lying that leads to Hearing after Hearing for 'stuff' that no Medical Board considers except Ohio - it's wasting taxpayer monies and careers. ",Doctors

										Dr. Stellato expects that patients will schedule surgeries with him with no discussion, no explanation, no way to directly speak with him for questions (that come up when you leave the room & there's no phone number to call to discuss), no paperwork from his secretary Carol to confirm the appointment, surgery, directions or instructions, ie to show up 30 minutes in advance to sign the consents & show the insurances.  
No one, be they physician, or regular patient, can work things that roundabout screwy way.  And a physician can't make up for Carol's nonchalance & lack of any help - and women physicians shouldn't be the secretaries for Dr. Stellato & Carol.  There's more respect due than that - especially in 2013.  You can't come up with a consent form for Dr. Stellato, or call the Wright Surgery Center for information that it was Carol's responsibility to give to patients.    
Then when you call & cancel into a message machine - because you can't show at a procedure that you have no paperwork, or written confirmation of in this day of security people - Carol pretends that she never got the message - and you call several times trying to reach her directly.  
Carol never answers directly- or didn't until recently.  When you try to confront Dr. Stellato about this - he swears that you 'stood him up' for the appointment you had no paperwork for - a procedure that no consent was ever signed for.   Dr. Stellato hasn't a clue about the things that Carol doesn't do, or refuses to do, or screws up - she can lie and it will always be Carol telling the truth.  And this was a procedure that the patient had no pre-op instructions for, ie shower with Betadine, no food from the night before, etc.
Dr. Stellato's consent need to be signed before 30 minutes before the procedure - because a patient only knows what is really planned from that consent form.  Physicians, including Dr. Stellato, talk a blue streak about what the surgery/procedure will involve, but only what is put to paper is the 'real deal.'  And you have to be able to say: no residents, no interns, and no medical students before the day of the procedure - because that is a disaster in an era where no one follows the surgery except maybe the surgeon of record.  If someone wants to be in on the procedure, they need to be in on the workup, the exam, the signing of the consent, and the follow-up; not a one-day wonder with a scalpel in their back pocket.
Then if you say anything on a blog, or Ripoff, Dr. Stellato will only speak with you to discuss if you get Ripoff to remove the information - and that won't work because once you remove things - Dr. Stellato still won't discuss.  There's no surety that Dr. Stellato will ever discuss - and this has been a life problem for him - that he doesn't discuss.  As Dr. Stellato is the Medical Director for University Suburban Health Center, the rest of the physicians have little example, or incentive, to do a better job of it.
Dr. Stellato needs to discuss, and stop believing that Carol is Miss Perfect - she makes mistakes like everyone else and it is not the patient's problem to be blamed for this.     									",Doctors

										I went into Dr Angel Camacho Baez, Florida office with an appointment for teeth cleaning tooth pull last week. My tooth was in pain for years had regular swelling. I had to wait a minute before going in for my exam x-ray. Along the way he explained the details how to care for teeth. He did cleaning tooth pull in less than an hour. With the prescription antibiotics by the second day, I had no pain. I'm grateful for his work. I'll come back again. Heres the post-operative recommendation from the doctor.
- After Oral Surgery and Post-Operative Care
On day 1:
on Bleeding: Following tooth removal bleeding is to be expected. Keep biting on gauze for approximately 1-2 hours. Repeat if necessary, replacing gauze 30-45 minutes. If heavy bleeding persists, our office.
Do Not smoke, rinse your mouth vigorously, or drink forcefully through a straw for 48 hours. These activities will disturb the forming blood clot and can lead to a painful condition called dry socket.
Do Not Rinse Mouth: You may drink liquids as usual, but do not rinse and spit as this may dislodge clot in the healing site.
On day 2:
Following extraction, gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water (1/2 tsp. salt in 1 glass of warm water). Rinse mouth ever 3 to 4 hours (especially after meals). Continue rinses for several days.
You brush and floss your teeth as normal, being careful not to brush extraction site. Proper oral hygiene will speed the healing process and diminish sensitivity. For the first few days following oral surgery, light, gentle pressure when brushing and flossing around surgical site.
On day 3:
Following extraction, you pick out any food from extraction site. Continue to do this until the area is completely healed, usually about 3-4 weeks.
on Swelling: After an extraction, you may feel some discomfort or swelling. A plastic bag of ice wrapped in a towel should be applied to the operated area-30 minutes on and 30 minutes off-for 4 to 5 hours.
on Medication: For mild average pain, use non-aspirin type of pain medication you like. If your surgery was extensive, a prescribed medication for pain or antibiotic for infection should be taken as directed.
on Food: Drink fluids maintain a soft, light diet for the first couple days following your surgery. Do not suck on extraction site and avoid strenuous activities for 24 hours following your surgery.
Bony Edges: Small, bone fragments may work up through the gums during healing. These are not roots; if they are annoying please return to the office for removal.
on Healing: Remember your mouth is in a healing phase and will need time to return to normal. If you have any problems or have any concerns, please contact our office.									",Doctors

										Jill Smith Esq will allow Mayo Clinic staff surgeons, interns, residents & students to do procedures without consent and defend them with Mayo monies - by trashing, cutting off the email, blaming, and denying the patient further care.  Many of the students are NOT Mayo Medical School students - and they can't be doing procedures on patients.  And it happens alot, and many times the procedures are not what Mayo Clinic recommends that other physicians, surgeons, & hospitals do for patients.  The Mayo Clinic Proceedings needs to address this problem in some future issue; when you call and tell them that the John Bundrick MD 'pearls' are not known by any Mayo resident, intern, surgeon, or Staff Member that you have encountered.  John Bundrick MD is not available to screen, or do the medical clearances on Dr. Sarr patients - he's a face on YOUTUBE.  No resident, intern, or student knows what a Carnett's test is, but they have a sterilized scalpel in their back pockets.  
There's a big gap in the knowledge promulagated by Mayo Clinic, and what is done at Mayo Clinics in several states.  But Jill Smith Esq - Chief Legal Counsel - is a force where a patient can't insist on proper consents, that a procedure is undone, and that a situation is handled with reason, repair, and improvements in Mayo Clinic paradigms & policies.  She has yet to order the undoing of countless unnecessary neurectomies - where normal nerves were sent to Pathology.  She's an accessory to the crime of no informed consent at Mayo Clinic.
Jill Smith has her favorites on the Surgery Services:  Dr. Michael Sarr will tell you that he 'IS MAYO CLINIC,' and can do any procedure to you without consent, discussion, or even need - the Mayo Clinic Proceedings will have a more conservative approach published for instance for abdominal nerve pain & entrapments - surgery makes the situation worse, but Dr. Sarr & Jill Beed haven't got a clue.  They want the MONEY.  
When a MD patient calls The Mayo Clinic Proceedings about the discrepancies, published vs practice, they are told (1) that the woman answering the phone gets 'good care' at Mayo Clinic, (2) that this problem has been brought up to Mayo Clinic Proceedings before (that the Mayo staff don't read the journal or do/know the 'pearls'), and (3) that she's going to hang up after notifying Jill Smith in Legal.  
Jill Smith in Legal has been asked to ok the undoing of all Mayo Clinic neurectomy procedures - with abdominal wall repairs for those who were railroaded into an unnecessary, unrecommended procedure - a procedure that the Mayo Clinic Proceedings does not advise.  No consent was obtained for many of these procedures, and only limited information was given to other patients - not informed consent. At least the abdominal neurectomies where the procedure was never discussed or consented to and the patient said 'NO' to any removal of nerves or cutting of muscles in a general sense - aware that Mayo Clinic will rip a patient apart if not restricted in a general sense - at least those patients need to be 'undone.'  
Mayo Clinic uses a deforming common mass closure on these procedures - a closure that ruptures in 3-5 years and then the patient will need mesh - a worse deformity.  Mayo Clinic does this to keep getting the patient back.  In the 1980s, without the economic crunch, the preferred closure was an anatomic layered closure - a closure that in a patient with a reasonable BMI doesn't rupture, isn't deforming, and doesn't ever require a mesh redo.  It's all about using the MESH - which then gets infected - and triggers lawsuits = business for Jill Smith = making her a fixture at Mayo Clinic for several decades now.  The more mesh, the more Jill Smith.Jill Smith causes the problems that will require her continued services - and neither the Mayo Clinic Board of Trustees, the CEO/President, or the Chiefs of Services have a clue.  
There is a gap between what the Mayo Clinic Proceedings says to do and what really happens at Mayo Clinic - where the staff go 'ape' with trying to 'cut' patients up without workup, without reason, without consent, without discussions.  The residents show up at gurney side for the 'kill,' and you never know their names.
All unnecessary refused neurectomy procedures, that were just 'done' on patients, need to be undone and repaired at Mayo Clinic expense.  ASAP.  Jill Smith needs to require consents, and to refuse to use Mayo Clinic monies if no consents are obtained and the patient is just surgerized for money.  But probably the ultimatum on the misuse of Mayo donated monies, and changes in policy, will have to come from the Board of Trustees.
This policy should have been stopped decades ago - with refusal of Mayo Clinic to defend any staff member doing anything without consents or need - from medical student to Chief of Service. 									",Doctors

										I originally found this doctor on the internet as he puts up a very good internet site and follows up with emails quickly.  I had no insurance in USA and was needing Knee Replacement to one or both my knees.  I sent my X Rays via email and he responded quickly to say they both needed replacement and he could do it for X dollars for a sports knee that he has been using on many patients.  He even gave me a few patients that just had surgery to contact.  This all sounded good and he seemed to be very competent.  Little did I know that I was headed for many problems and now it looks that I will pay for his negligence the rest of my life.
I had bilateral replacements in India one Feb 4, 2010 and the other Feb 9.  After the surgery for the first several months I had difficulty standing without dancing around and I think this was the first sign to the problem that just got worse. [continued below]....
									
										.....  I contacted Dr. Venkatcalam on several occasions about problems with my right knee replacement only to be told it takes time so I let more time pass until I was so bad that I went for two other opinions.  Both agreed that the knee was severely unstable due to the incorrect size spacer. 
 I was advised to have a surgery quickly to prevent a dislocation.  My surgery was scheduled after tests were done and there was a possibility of loosening, also.  My doctor was prepared with several sizes of spacers and a few different sizes of the prosthesis or implant that maybe loose.  The doctor reported to me after surgery that Dr. Venkatcalam did several things wrong; the bone cut was not correct, the prosthesis did not fit the bone which fell off during the surgery, the spacer used was too small.  The surgeon did what he could to repair the damage and felt I may be ok. 
It was not ok and now 13 months after the second surgery, I am having to go back for another revision to the same knee. Three knee replacement to the right knee in three years.  My surgeon who did the last surgery confined with me the big problem which was that Dr. Venkatcalam butchered my knee and did not use the proper cutting blocks to prevent this nor did he have the correct size implant of spacer when this error was made. 
Dr Venkatcalam performs many knee replacement surgeries at reduced rates.  He lures his clients to him assuring that he is very capable of doing the surgery.  He does not mention that the hospital is a training hospital for new doctors.  I feel my surgery was done in a training session and I am not sure who made the gross error of the bone cut.  I am upset about the doctor not having the correct cutting blocks for the surgery nor having the supplies need for this type of error available.  
I did contact Dr Venkatcalam after the second surgery to tell him of the findings.  He denied all the findings so not to be responsible.  I filed a complaint to the consumers board of India only to be sent back that I must of misunderstood  my surgeon in the USA.  No recourse!
I am now having problems also with the left knee replacement and will more that likely have to have a revision done soon.  I am sadden by my decision to go to India and trusting a foreign doctor of having the same standards of doctors in the USA.   My left knee will need a stem placed with notches inside the prosthesis to help reduce the amount of bone that was cut and lessen the thickness of the spacer.  I just hope this works and I can utilize my knee for many years.
My friends all advised me to put some type of warning on the internet so others do not make the same mistake as I did and trust Dr Venkatacalam.",Doctors

Franz Dool allowing Dr. & Mrs. Botti to lie and destroy the careers of other parishioner's children, for money, for their second marriage they destroyed the first marriage of another MD, for their reputations &  Gates Mills, Ohio","
										St. Francis Parish will participate in an eight county Sacrament of Penance from 5-8pm on 2.20.2013, as part of the YEAR OF FAITH proclaimed by Pope Benedict XVI.  For that event Fr. Caddy, and Fr. Dool, will urge the school children in 3rd-8th grades to go to confession, and to go through the Ten Commandments as an examination of conscience - when it's the parish adults that need the confession, or a good confession, and the top 10 excuses.  
Thinking back to what kids do - the worst are the white lies, the cheating, and the excluding of other kids for spite - the clubs & cliques.  What adults do is destroy marriages, careers, the health of neighbors, and their hopes and dreams for their children.  Adults destroy other people's children - and it's not the same as kids going at other kids because the advantage is to the adults.  
It's not just irregular marriages, or belief in God, or going to Mass that's the Catholic problem - it's the living of the Christian mantra to 'love your neighbor as yourself' that's the problem - the lack of love in the parishioners that give a regular collection as their Catholic manifesto - as their blackmail for Fr. Caddy's silence.  And that works.  
At 80, or 20, or 10 - the commandments are the same - even if at 80 you can get the Gates Mills police to say that you don't have to talk to the person you destroyed - that they can't come near your mansion & oil well property - property you got with a retirement settlement to 'lie for' from Hillcrest Hospital - for lying about a care situation so that the hospital 'got off.'  
Certainly Fr. Dool is 'right' when he says that it's better to be the victim of bad behaviors, situations, and problems than the instigator (cause) - but it's better that those problems don't ever happen Father Dool - trouble is trouble, drama is drama, and no one has the energy to spend a lifetime fighting lies & misinformation - we all have better things to do.  None of us were born to fight Botti lies.  
It's better that Father Dool would instruct that people tell the truth - and that the truth often 'sets you free,' so that you don't have to worry about the lies for 20 years or more.  It's the lies that waste the money, that cause the damage, and that ruin lives.  Often in telling the truth the disciplining body is so impressed that they never punish, discipline, fine or suspend - in school or at the Medical Board - but you have to tell the truth to get to that point of forgiveness, healing, and reforming of the system and problems.  With truth telling, you give the system a chance to see the problems, to address the problems, and to not punish because at least with medical mistakes, these are system failures - multiple errors by multiple parties.  No medical mistake is ever the fault of a single physician, a single error, or a single point in time - it's a circle of errors.  
In this particular situation, there were multiple errors and a failure of a care situation - multiple failures of diagnosis and treatment that the Medical Board of Ohio needed to address 20 years ago - for the safety of subsequent patients at Hillcrest Hospital.  So especially in multiple system failure situations, lying helps no one -- and it's better not to be the cause of the trouble, but it's also not good to be the victim.  With Medical Board situations, the 'victim' will sometimes commit suicide - unable to cope, rationalize, have faith, pray or believe that the system will work - because it takes years & reforms.  Lies work much better, and have a bankability.  So maybe Fr. Dool can come up with a better thought than comparing the victim to the cause of trouble - neither  really wins - there's no 'better' deal Fr. Dool.  And you didn't make Dr. Botti have a twinge of conscience - he's got his retirement.               Fr. Caddy & Fr. Dool are good priests, and totally committed to the school kids and the parish, but they know that abuse does not stop at child abuse, and that some of the adults of the parish have been self-serving in allowing abusive medical care & personal situations for the children of established parishioners - situations where a male MD preyed on a woman MD who was a neighbor's kid for personal needs.  Kids in Medicine are the new 'kid' on the Hospital Staff, the 'kid' who just finished a residency or Fellowship, and the 'kid' who just got engaged - one of these kids had to trade her engagement for the Botti's second marriage that needed funding ($).  Robert Botti Sr has never been satisfied - he wanted it all. 
When the woman MD complained to the State Medical Board, the Bottis lied about it - for their neighbors - instead of getting the guy help, and Dr. Botti making some administrative changes at Hillcrest Hospital to allow for better care of patients when physicians would goof & not be available & better policies as to sexual harassment.  There were no sexual harassment laws at the time, and literally anything 'went on' - 'anythings'  that women MDs were just supposed to take in stride.  
Yes it was 20 years ago, but lies have no statute of limitations, and lives have been ruined for the Bottis to have a second-go at marriage.  Lives that could still be resurrected even though they will never be what they could have been.  And ironically, it was not Dr. Botti doing the abusing, but Dr. Botti covered it up with outrageous lies - for the payoff.  Dr. Botti was as addicted to peer pressure as the most go-along second grader.   
There is nothing wrong with a legitimate widow, and widower, pledging a second marriage - but the problem is if they did that based on a substantial windfall of an early retirement that Dr. Botti got for lying about a situation that Hillcrest would have otherwise had to pay legitimate damages on.  The damages went to Dr. Botti to guarantee his testimony and signature on a complaint about the woman MD - a totally unjustified complaint as the woman MDs father had (1) saved Dr. Robert Botti JR from a similar situation at Marymount Hospital, and (2) sent the Bottis father-and-son thousands of dollars of referral business for cardiology consultations, catherizations, and other care - invasive & non-invasive. 
Dr. Robert Botti SR has destroyed many physicians in his career - first by taking the wrong applicants when he ran the Cardiology Fellowship at University Hospitals of Cleveland - his son instead of a better qualified applicant for starters.  Dr. Botti has also been known to tell the Armed Forces not to take anyone who disagreed with him, and in general been the scourge of many aspiring MDs.  Dr. Botti has based his life on agreeing that the medical 'code of silence' was what mattered most - that you didn't 'rat' on the other guy even if that guy needed ratting on.  And that's no longer the case, and it wasn't even 'right' 20 years ago.  Why did Dr. Botti not let the guy MD get caught, who needed to get caught, and thereby stop a pile of bad care situations that ensued?  A MD that does bad care doesn't do it once; it is usually a habit especially when the guy quotes that he has 'friends on the State Medical Board of Ohio' and could 'make or break' the woman MD involved who didn't like his personal habits.     
Currently physicians, except maybe in Ohio where there are no medical mistake laws, are supposed to admit medical care mistakes and make a plant to undo or correct them - the liability is still there but often if the physician tells the truth and makes an alternative plan, the patient never sues or complains.  The physician does not have to admit the mistake, but they have to recognize and refer the patient appropriately.  Had Dr. Botti done that when he was asked by several physicians at Hillcrest, referred the mistreated woman MD patient who was close to passing out walking, he could have changed a life.  That woman would have been able to have a marriage, and at least 2 kids, who would have maybe been as brilliant as she - gifted with her MENSA IQ.  We make society worse by putting our personal needs first, we don't give God a chance to reward us for doing the right thing.  Father Caddy doesn't see this in trying to legitimize the Botti's second marriage for their companionship & mutual profit - Betty the Body is now Betty Botti.  It's not Fr. Caddy's decision to trade one life for another, and since Dr. Botti was not at fault except in covering things up - he wouldn't have gotten docked 20 years ago.  However now Dr. Botti has now participated in a 20-year fraud - which the Medical Board knows, but so far won't call him on it.  Twenty years later it is not any easier to tell the truth.  There's an Examination of Conscience for KIDS published by Catholic Parents Online, and the VIII Commandment reads - You shall not commit false witness against your neighbor - and has the following kiddie questions: (1) Am I honest in my school work?, (2) Do I tell lies to make myself look good?, (3) Do I tell lies to protect myself from punishment? and (4) Do I tell lies that make another person look bad or get them in trouble?  These questions apply to adults in medicine and to the Bottis - Betty & Bob Sr.  They gave false witness against a neighbor's kid, when that neighbor's kid reported a bad care situation at Hillcrest: an abusive relationship that a close neighbor & friend of Betty's (Dr. Timothy Nice) had with the daughter of another MD in Gates Mills/St. Francis.  And it wasn't the first time that Dr. Nice had 'strayed,' he made a policy of this at Hillcrest and Geauga Hospitals - the Gates Mills police know this FACT.  
The medical equivalent for the VIIIth: (1) Am I honest with my medical consultations and care advice?, (2) Do I tell lies about other physicians in complaints to the State Medical Board so that they lose their licenses & I get the business?, (3) Do I tell lies so that I get rewarded with early retirement packages, job contracts, and patient care privileges?, and (4) Do I lie so that neighbor's kids get in trouble when they did not cause the trouble, or are held to be 'seductive' when the male MD friend of Betty was preying on the neighbor's kid against her consent (nothing more seductive than Land's End was worn)?  It was a 'generation' thing - an older more established male practitioner wanting a little 'understanding' from a Catholic girl a decade younger - the child of an associate MD at the hospital.  It was the male version of a cougar - manther - preying on a new woman MD on the staff - the child of another staff MD - someone he promised to give experience to - and not the sexual kind.  
Fr. Caddy & Fr. Dool need to be a bit more circumspect, and honest about these situations - that you can't solve them from the pulpit saying that it's better to be the victim than the cause of trouble.  That's just justifying martyrdom, and not character.  And confession is not going to solve many of these situations - forgiveness will have to include telling the truth.    									",Doctors

Columbus-Strongsville, Ohio United States of America ",http://www.ohiosenate.gov/patton,(614) 466-8056,"Senator Tom Patton - Ohio Senate District 24  would rather that a woman MD die of neglect of her medical care - and parishioners at St. John Neumann should know this - rather than allow that the Medical Board of Ohio took her medical license 20 y Columbus-Strongsville, Ohio","
										Medical care in Ohio involves many patient mistakes - but the problem is, even for women MDs, that when mistakes are made you are supposed to cover up & lie - change the story - rather than admit things so that simple mistakes at least can be corrected.  The conspiracy of silence exists & runs the State Medical Board in Ohio.  
The Ohio Medical Board makes mistakes, and has no policy to handle these errors and get physicians back to work with a re-entry program.  The Medical Board in one 'innocent' case has changed more policies & rules than thought possible; every time the woman MD's attorneys would file for dismissal citing the breaking of a rule, or the Board not getting a filing in on time, the rules were changed to allow the Medical Board to cheat - procedurally.  There is not a policy, or rule, that can't be changed in favor of the Ohio State Medical Board by the Board Members - overnight.  It is a kangaroo court - when the woman's attorneys would need clarification - the clarification would come after the time to file.  
Forty-plus states have laws about this - that you have to admit the mistakes or risk that your facility, office or hospital will be closed within a week - Pennsylvania has the strictest Medical Board law on this.  They are called MEDICAL MISTAKE LAWS - and we don't have them in Ohio - and Tom Patton hasn't a clue what they are, how they work, or why the need for them.  Physicians coming from Pennsylvania, to Ohio to practice, are in culture shock at the culture of 'cover up,' or lose your medical license policy, for not handling things in the 'right' way.
Currently before the Ohio State Medical Board gives one woman MD her medical license back, they want extensive counseling, and for her to not mention the bad care that she experienced 20 years ago - conditions which have almost killed her as she has an untreated bone condition from the mistakes 20 years ago.  The bad care has never been improved - the orthopedic is still allowing fractures to 'ripen to excrescence.'  
This woman MD was not allowed routine blood work, because of what would be found that her male MDs missed, before her license was taken for 'making too much of admittedly bad care.'  The problem: that Tom Patton hasn't gotten the records (he can subpoena them if the Board won't produce them, but he won't), and ordered an external investigative review on the case.  Governor Kasich won't order a review because of what that review would find - that Governor Kasich has been negligent in monitoring and over-seeing the actions of the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Lowering taxes won't correct this waste.
This 'cover up the mistakes' policy is especially problematic for more recent grads of Medical Schools & residency training programs - where the training has been to admit the medical, surgical or drug  mistakes early on in patient care, and thereby try to save the patient.  The states 'covering' this medical mistake approach allow that the physician acting in good faith in this way cannot be disciplined at the Medical Board level, or have points leveled against their malpractice insurance.  The physicians don't have to admit their culpability in the mistake, just that they recognized the mistake and acted to correct it.  It is a no-fault policy when things are done in the right way.
Medical mistakes happen: blood work is omitted, fractures are casted wrongly by orthopedics with not enough experience - and there needs to be a way to correct this without expecting that the patient will just accept the injury and get psychiatric counseling.  Psychiatry is not the way to handle CORRECTABLE MEDICAL ERRORS - which have to be referred or consulted on early - and Ohio has no way to handle this.  
The problem:  Tom Patton is going along with the 'code of silence' about what is going on at the Medical Board.  This breaking of the code of silence is an 'impairment' - to get more disciplines & suspensions than any other state (including Pennsylvania); the taking of women MD licenses for not handling mistakes with lying about them is a policy at the State Medical Board of Ohio - and a Governor Kasich policy.  The problem comes when the woman MD has to lie about her own medical care.Just know Parishioners of St. John Neumann that:  Tom Patton will do nothing about the HUGE problem of medical mistakes in Ohio, so that when you experience a mistake it doesn't have to be referred, consulted on, or corrected.  And this can be quickly lethal with medication errors (heparin, chemo), biopsy errors, and x-ray errors.  Know that Tom Patton will let a woman MD lie rather than admit problems at the State Medical Board of Ohio with falsified cases, or if she can't lie he will go along with the loss of her medical license - for as many years as it takes to kill her.  Father Kriege knows about the problem - but he's hiding it just like the Diocese hid the priest-child abuse problem.  It's not enough to not be the abuser; hiding any system abuse, of any person, is morally wrong - be that person a child, a wife, a woman MD, a person in a retirement home, a State Senator or Congressman/woman.  
These 'false' Medical Board of Ohio impairment cases each year waste millions of taxpayer dollars on frivolous investigations of physicians - which include their personal lives, dating histories, PAP smear and PSA value publications - anything to embarrass is put into public records to force the physician to sign a deal (a pile of lies).  
You can be as 'straight as Jesus' and still be lied about as a whore, too 'seductive,' or having some kind of gay/lesbian FANTASIES that waste the time of the Medical Board in 'confidential' discussions.  And you can't do what Jesus would have done - turn the other cheek as your medical license & reputation is involved.  That 'you and your homosexual friends' are involved in some kind of whatever (even when the woman MD has no friends, homosexual or straight) - because you won't sleep with your male orthopedic who has a monied tennis court wife & two kids - is the scenario.  The current Interim Director of the State Medical Board of Ohio - Kimberly Anderson - is the QUEEN of false investigations and public records personal details - the QUEEN of this type of physician BLACKMAIL.The Medical Board should not be inventing cases, inventing sex lives for physicians, and inventing psychiatric diagnoses when women MDs don't want to get cosy, personal, or familiar with their male orthopedics in the Biblical 'personal habits' sexual sense.  The Medical Board is not a call-service, an escort service, or a colleague provision service - those arrangements have to be made by the individual physicians and not on Board time.The taking of medical licenses for provisional, hypothetical, or otherwise unproven allegations has to stop.  This is a separate problem than the 'confidential' physician complaint system, a system which allows insurance companies, exes, spouses, Medical School classmates, or colleague competitors to 'get back' without ever being responsible for the lies, the misinformation, or the 'provisional' that the Board can't prove but acts on.  It's a no-fault system like none other.  Eliminating Ohio Medical Board actions for provisional, or hypothetical, will stop some of the problem, eliminating 'confidential' physician complaints is really the issue.  You can't prove, or disprove, a case that is 'confidential' - however it can keep attorneys in houses for decades - which was the thought ie keep the lawyers of Ohio in a job.  However, State Legislators can subpoena, if necessary, these files - and they choose not to - they choose not to see the problem that needs the reforms.  Tom Patton won't speak to one of the woman MDs involved in an admittedly wrong situation at the Medical Board - he can't understand it when she uses medical terminology, even when she tries to explain in Strongsvillese - she has a MENSA IQ and he doesn't - so he writes her off for the 'kill track.'  She's his age, comes from a family of nine kids, and they might be 'friends' in any other circumstances - but that won't happen - she's dying of neglect and heartbreak and he can't see it. 
This is where Tom Patton stands - going to confession saying that the he allows the lies for his own political PR and 'get along with the boys.'  And the St. John Neumann kids, who toured the Columbus Capital & his offices, are supposed to go to confession for Lent, while the Adult Evenings of Communal Penance are just jokes.  
Senator Patton has the self-justification excuse that if he allows the lies, he will be able to be the State Senator - that the possible good that he does will justify killing someone else's career and chance to have a family & children.  It's the me-first policy that Tom Patton lives by - despite being a Catholic - and this makes people think that Catholics are hypocrites for the most part, e.g. against third trimester abortion but electing President Obama, against lies except when the lies can be beneficial - this is the Tom Patton excuse that the ends justify the means - Commandment #11.  
If you don't have a college degree, you lie, because you don't have the smarts to see through the lies.  But he should be telling the truth - and the truth might get him elected to a higher office even without the college degrees.  Because what voters really want is the truth, in simple 5-8th grade terms - which Tom Patton has the diploma for.  No one should be killing women MDs who made it through Medical School & residency - they deserve to get appropriate & timely medical care with the male MDs held responsible for providing this care - the hazing ends in residency.  
Tom Patton needs to take a stand against the continued 'hazing' of women MDs in situations where they seek medical care - that's not the appropriate time for a male MD to mention that you have to 'understand him because his wife doesn't.'  And Tom Patton needs to understand the grade school pastorism that the ends do not justify the means - ever.  ",Doctors
State Senator Tom Patton,"  State Senator Tom Patton  1 Capitol Square, 1st Floor, Senate Building 
Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",http://www.ohiosenate.gov/patton,(614) 466-8056,"State Senator Tom Patton State Medical Board of Ohio no review of Medical Board cases dismissed by Ohio Court of Appeals but remanded back to the Board when the Board has admitted cheating, no way of judging the merits of  cases - or helping a constitue Columbus, Ohio","
										Senator Tom Patton does not 'get' that there is no way to objectively review Ohio Medical Board cases - that the Medical Board is left to correct their own mistakes and never does - they just don't answer the phone when they goof.  Can he get the State Medical Board of Ohio, or Ms Kimberly Anderson (the Interim Director who brings the physician's dating history into cases), on the phone?  
Senator Tom Patton  has no knowledge of medical terminology, and no way to review things that he doesn't understand - which the Medical Board counts on.  There is a general ignorance among Ohio Legislators as to what goes on at the State Medical Board of Ohio - they know nothing about the State Medical Board and how it functions.  Unlike in many states there is no way to externally review a Medical Board case - facts & findings - and the Hearing Officers are part of the Medical Board System; they will never admit that the Medical Board made a mistake.  The Administrative lawyers in Ohio know this, and know that they will 'clean up' on Medical Board cases for decades.  
If a case is thrown out by the Ohio Court of Appeals, and the Ohio Medical Board has admitted to cheating in Hearings, there needs to be an opening of the case for reforms at the State Medical Board of Ohio - a fact that the State Medical Board of Ohio knows - but they won't act to reform themselves.  And no one knows how much money is wasted/case.  Senator Tom Patton can't ask that question for some reason - though he asks it everywhere else - even of the Mayor's courts.  The Ohio State Medical Board is a 'Board Court' - with no rules of evidence, no statutes of limitations, and no policy that can't be changed.  It is a self-serving autonomous Board.      
So cases can go on for decades, can be thrown out by the Ohio Court of Appeals, and no one knows what the case is about while the Medical Board continues to 'look for a case.'  The Ohio State Court of Appeals can never 'hear' a case, and the Inspector General can never review cases where they can't check on the complainer's credentials or the facts.  And after a decade everything blurs, except that the physician's license has been suspended - which effects every job that the physician tries to get - there is no clearance mechanism in place, and Ohio suspends more medical licenses that any other state - confidentially.  
Ohio suspends medical licenses for 'reasons' that no other state can understand, and everything is 'confidential.'  Ohioans are to trust a Medical Board where the Members are only human, and can't verify any information, or check the credentials of the complainers.  The Ohio State Medical Board is a Medical Board that is never responsible for its mistakes, with complaint signers that are never responsible for what they sign.  The Ohio State Medical Board can't check that the 'confidential' complainer even knew the physician, or ever met them.  Complainers can be completely irrelevant to the situation - just a signature.  
In one case at least one or more confidential complaint 'signers' never met the physician whose license was suspended - they just collected 'benefits' from the hospital that got out of liability for the situation by blaming the physician.  Benefits = hospital staff & ER privileges, retirement packages, hospital appointments, hospital contracts or real estate packages/deals for the non-medical Members.  Being on the State Medical Board of Ohio, or being a signer of a 'confidential' complaint, can be a profitable 'deal.'  One that can't be verified, checked or traced - you are never held responsible.  
And Tom Patton knows this case.  Included among the signers were the neighbors of the male physician that the woman physician complained about - and that complaint was released against state law.  If a woman physician complains about a situation - her complaint is released to the male physician & hospital involved - AGAINST STATE LAW.
So a woman physician can complain about another male physician in Ohio - that complaint will be released - and the countercomplaint will be 'confidential' when the male physician uses his neighbors & Medical Board 'friends' to go after the woman physician he goofed on - to get out of whatever male physicians want to do to women physicians - leaving their fractures uncasted, hitting on them, beating them up.  Certain complaints are not confidential - those involving Medical Board friends - so that they can 'fight' them and counter-complain.  Tom Patton knows this 'guy benefit' - and won't change it.          
The Medical Board of Ohio will take licenses based on a hypothetical, or provisional, that has no bearing on anything - that is completely faked.  The physician is then out their career - and cannot get a job based on a licensure suspension - even if there are no patient errors, and the Medical Board has never proved a case.  Tom Patton's office has no answer to this problem.  
No other State Medical Board can verify anything, even if the Medical Board admits cheating in the Hearings, on the evidence, or in testimony - the physician has to admit the Medical Board's case to get their medical license back.  Admitting falsified evidence then makes the falsely accused physician the liar, and further complicates the case.  What lie can you tell to get out of a lie?  
This is a catch-22 of the State Medical Board of Ohio - a problem allowed by legislators with no medical knowledge.  Tom Patton can't talk with a woman MD, let alone the State Medical Board of Ohio.  In one case, the Ohio Medical Board has admitted to faking evidence in two Hearings - and nothing can be done about it - it is a Capital joke - but not a joke for the physician involved - who can't get her license back even after this admission.  There is no policy to no-fault dismiss a false case and get the physician re-entried - there is no DNA to check.
There is no policy for the State Medical Board of Ohio to get a MD back to work when the Board takes a medical license and the evidence is false - they can't admit that they made a mistake under Ohio law.  The Legislators have no way of judging the merits of a 'confidential' case when the Ohio Court of Appeals can't get the facts, the Inspector General has boxes of lies that can't be publicly confirmed or denied, and there are no patient errors or complaints - so the Board just doesn't answer their phone for 20 years.  Every legislator wants to believe the Ohio State Medical Board, and does, even when the Board admits tweaking things and falsifying information - and each Hearing costs a physician $50,000 straight up.
There need to be reforms at the Ohio State Medical Board - a fact that Tom Patton knows, but is doing nothing about.  And no one wants to complain about Tom Patton but he isn't getting the 'picture.'  ",Doctors

										Dr. D Verma is knowledgable but doesn't seem to like seeing patients in the office.

If you disagree with her be prepared to be discharged. I have more than one disease process going on that I am being treated for and is somewhat rare. I had an appointment at the office and he was in the hall when I was placed in the exam room. I thought since he was there I would get to see him but he left and I was stuck with seeing the FNP. When she came in the room I was informed he had left and that I had not specifically requested to see him. I asked her if she knew anything about one of my diagnosis and was told that ""No! I don't and I don't need to to treat you!"". I further questioned her asking if she was aware that the symptoms overlapped and she said no that she didn't need to. [continued below]....
									
										..... I asked to be rescheduled and was told it would be 3 months away for the next available to see him. I told her I had already waited 2 months and an appointment was found a week away early in the morning. I thought great but the morning of the appointment 15 minutes before I was scheduled his office canceled at the last moment. I was told that they would call me as soon as they knew when he was going to arrive and I could come over and see him. They never called me back. When I called them back for an update I was told that he wasn't coming back in. I told them I had been sick for several days and needed to be seen so I  was sent to the ER at the hospital where he was and he would see me there. Not the case! I had to see the ER doctor who did not have a clue how to treat me and was sent home to end up in another ER a day later and admitted for a week.His office staff is equally rude. They change or cancel appointments at the last moment without consulting the patient. If you have been canceled one would think that you would be rescheduled immediately, however it may be months before you get back in to see him. If you have questions or concerns and call the office or email them through the patient portal chances are you will not get a response in a timely manner (24 hours) or at all as the nurse practitioner and doctor do not return phone calls or emails. They prefer dumping patients to the local ER. If he is at the hospital that his offices refers you to he will not take the time out of his busy day to come see you in the ER and you are at the mercy of the ER doctor who gets caught in the middle. If you are unlucky enough to be admitted to the hospital chances are you will not see him daily and when he does arrive he is constantly on the phone. He is usually in your room less than 5 minutes and during that time he is answering his phone telling the person to call back in 5 minutes. He may give the patient one plan of care and then doesn't follow through or changes the plan without informing the patient. Upon dismissal from the hospital you would think that you would get to speak with him so that you can be informed about you're plan of care as an outpatient but that will not happen. If you have a procedure scheduled be prepared for it to be rescheduled at least once if not twice without your knowledge. He either doesn't know what goes on in his office when he is not there or doesn't care, either way it is bad news for the patient.									",Doctors

South Euclid, Ohio United States of America ","www,universitysuburban.org",216-382-1868,"University Suburban Health Center Cleveland Thomas Stellato MD Medical Director allows Dr. Stellato to threaten patients if they have a common complication of his surgical procedures - if Dr. Stellato can't handle the most common complications of his surgeries, early or late, the South Euclid, Ohio","
										Dr. Stellato is allowed to call the South Euclid Police for patient complications of his surgeries.  The one problem that he can't handle is the most common cause of chronic abdominal wall pain - and Dr. Stellato is a General Surgeon.  Dr. Stellato is a former Chief of General Surgery at University Hospitals, the former Hubay Professor of Surgery, a former Chief of Bariatric Surgery, and the writer of the General Surgery Board Review Materials for the American College of Surgeons.  But in regards to abdominal wall pain, Dr. Stellato needs to return to General Abdominal Wall Exam 101.    
A more educated male surgeon, with a more glaring surgical repertoire 'hole' can't be found.  Dr. Stellato is to Chronic Abdominal Wall Pain as Obama is to Christianity.   
The chronic abdominal wall pain problem is huge - and the money is huge - and General Surgeons, Family Practice, and ER see this problem as well as Obstetrics & Gynecology physicians - if they recognize it.  Peds surgeons, and Pediatricians, also see this problem if they look.    
This problem occurs all too commonly after any abdominal procedure, after pregnancy or a C-section, after sports injuries, and just happens = Abdominal Cutaneous Nerve Entrapment Syndrome (=ACNES, that is not acne).  If anyone has ever heard Dr. Tom Stellato say it, they should get $5 or maybe $50.  
Not only has Dr. Stellato never said it, but he has never written about it - never considered it part of the Surgical Literature or a General Surgery Board Review item.  Chronic abdominal wall pain is not part of Surgery for Dr. Stellato - it's the scope of the South Euclid Police Department.  Almost everyone who has written about abdominal wall pain overlooks the diagnosis of ACNES in the writing - Dr. Stellato, and University Suburban physicians & management - are not exceptions to that rule.  The Rule of ACNES is that General Surgeons goof the diagnosis like no other - they don't know what the acronym stands for, they can't find the 10 nerve exit foramen spots on an abdominal wall exam.      
Dr. Stellato can't diagnose, handle, or correctly treat anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment - an extremely common complication of any abdominal procedure, sports injuries to the abdominal wall, sports over-exertions, pregnancy, and anything that stresses or injures the abdominal wall.   Yet he is now a Medical Director.  There are 10 neuromuscular 'foramen,' where the nerve exits anteriorly at an acute angle, and where the nerve is able to be palpated & injured - creating 'trigger points' for inflammation & injury.  But Dr. Stellato never examines these openings/nerve exits - and they are not hard to find - the physical exam is in the paper cited below and the diagrams are cartoons - patients can examine themselves the T-8, T-9,T-10, T-11 and T-12 areas along the lateral border of the rectus muscle.  Suggestion: mark these with a surgical marker for Dr. Stellato and have him ask what's going on.  It's an anatomical diagnosis - no scope required. 
Some patients have this nerve entrapment in an abdominal scar.  These patients can be helped with excising this part of the scar, or removing the retained suture - or the inflammatory tissue/granuloma - from around the nerve.  But not by removing the nerve - a move that Mayo Clinic likes to do because of the $-charge of a neurectomy.  Neurectomy does not treat this, more surgery does not treat this, an injection of a 2% lidocaine does - and the how-to is in the article cited below.  This is a separate procedure, billing-wise, than what caused the original scar - even if you hand the paper to Dr. Stellato.    
The diagnosis of nerve entrapment in a scar is suggested by exacerbation of the pain from pinching the scar, or by moving the scar across the underlying muscle - moves that Dr. Stellato doesn't do - he wants you to schedule time in the OR with Carol - which is a real upper - another scar that can get ACNES.  And the Administration at University Suburban is equally oblivious to this scar-problem that you can charge to treat separately of the surgery that caused the scar - but 2 scars is not the treatment.   Articles on this problem even include the question to ask the patient,""Where exactly is the pain?""  Stellato will not do this, will not ask the questions, will not offer an injection, and there is associated muscle spasm that can then lead to more misdiagnosis, more surgery, and more scars.  Patients are encouraged to bring the article from: Abdominal Cutaneous Nerve Entrapment Syndrom (ACNES):www.thepermanentejournal.org/files/Summer2002/acnes.pdf  And has anyone ever heard Dr. Stellato ask an open-ended question?  He tells you what to do, or asks about your bowel movements.  Where exactly is the pain, would let the patient speak without a rectal.  Communication is not a strong point of Dr. Stellato, Carol, or University Suburban - cash is the only language.  But the article has PRACTICE TIPS - which the patient can then read to Dr. Stellato.      
The South Euclid Police do not examine, or read, anything either - they just let Dr. Stellato and Carol, his office manager, do what they want with patients.  The treatment is a 2% lidocaine injection - which University Suburban doesn't appear to stock - but they could bill for this if they checked with Kaiser Permanente.  
NERVE ENTRAPMENT SYNDROME: The exam and treatment is missing in offices at University Suburban - so Cleveland Kaiser cleans up on this diagnosis.  Certain Kaiser docs see one or two patients with this diagnosis for every 150 patients overall - but Dr. Stellato never sees any.  Certain Family Practitioner Kaiser docs have seen as many as 3 such patients per consultation session in a busy evening clinic with 15 physicians on duty screening abdominal & other pains.  So University Suburban should have at least 3 patients/day with this diagnosis.  
Anterior Cutaneous Nerve Entrapment Syndrome (ACNES) is a clean-up diagnosis (quick diagnosis, Carnett's test is cost free as to radiology staff/machines, easy treatment, and billing can be over $250 with followup for the local Pain Clinic physicians).  Or patients can be so happy that they give you their credit card - instant payments are known with the proper treatment of this problem.   Acute cases are seen in the evenings, but it is a bet that the Urgent Care at University Suburban never sees any ACNES = the most commonly overlooked cause of abdominal pain.  No stats are ever available, from Dr. Stellato, or University Suburban.  Isn't that what Medical Directors do ie stats?
But if Stellato can't handle abdominal wall pain - and the most common cause of it - a problem that he commonly causes with a procedure - then he should get out of abdominal surgery.  It's not the purview of the South Euclid Police to clean up the messes of University Suburban Health Center & Carol.  And no patient deserves this.  It's been around since 1926 as 'intercostal neuralgia,' but this blind spot of Dr. Stellato is a huge bummer of a miss in an academic surgeon otherwise capable and well-qualified - but he's not capable of admitting a mistake, or that he mishandled a patient with this - he wants to beat up on the woman MD who told him about this condition and she was just the messenger.         ",Doctors

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",http://www.ohiosenate.gov/patton,(614) 466-8056,"State Senator Tom Patton (OH) Representative Marlene Anielski are into women MDs doing 'personal favors,' and referrals to 'right' Ohio physicians, for medical licenses & hospital privileges - deficiencies phrased as provisional personality disorders of unspecif Columbus, Ohio","
										Ohio legislators, State Senators & Representatives - male & female - are into OHIO women MDs putting out in sexual, personal habit, and referral ways for their medical licenses - to the 'right' physicians (friends of Medical Board Members).  The almost 'club' nature of the Members of the State Medical Board, where Members keep getting re-nominated & re-appointed ad perpetuam, facilitates this abuse - the friends stay the same.  There are no limits to the terms that can be served by Members of the Ohio State Medical Board - and Governor Kasich thinks this all a joke. 
In Ohio, at the State Medical Board, it is not about a woman physician's patient care in Ohio, it is about who she has slept with, or will agree to sleep with, ie Dr. Carla O'Day (got rid of Streepy & O'Day in a decade or two each) - who was on the State Medical Board 1990-93.  Medical Board Members themselves, in Ohio, often live very questionably vague personal lives, and are not distinguished medical providers - they are tokens of black, third trimester abortion supporters, DOs, and the general mediocre physician prototype in Ohio - the Family Practitioner type from Hobucken.  Ohio does nothing with distinction except build highways, and additional buildings to the Cleveland Clinic downtown Euclid complex - there's the HEART building, the Research building, and coming is the Medical School building.  It's all about cement or tar in Ohio.  
Nothing is distinguished about the State Medical Board of Ohio, except that they vote more suspensions, and disciplines, of physicians than any other State Medical Board.  Ohio does not have worse physicians than any other state - they have the Medical Board from hell.  Ohio has different 'rules' for Medical Board suspensions & disciplines - and they are 'confidential' of course.  Nothing is about state law in Ohio - the Ohio Medical Board can break every state, and procedural, law - and there is no statute of limitatons on this.
Ohio has the most 'strange' excuses for medical license suspensions that have ever been seen, e.g. suspending a woman MD for objecting to the wrong care of herself (supposed to be a patient 'right').  No blood work of certain women MDs is allowed before their licenses are suspended for 'not going along' with the program of missed diagnoses in Ohio - they need to beg & suffer while their fertility and thyroids run out - they aren't allowed to have children Marlene (do you understand that?).  Women MDs, whose medical licenses have been suspended for theoretical/provisional, are not allowed to reproduce - but they can get abortions that Lance Talmadge MD will supervise.  They are not allowed to have children who will commit suicide from not being understood - they don't get the chance.  Children for women MDs are really precious, if the State Medical Board will let you have one - and you can't adopt with a licensure suspension on the CV.     
Thyroid disorders are impairments in Ohio, the women MDs don't get labs or synthroid if the Medical Board so decrees - at least not until they admit the personality disorder diagnosis of the day.  Ditto bone density problems - women MDs are left to fracture & rot by the Cleveland Clinic - who watches the natural history of the disease - Chad Deal & Dr. Licata think it fun to watch the women fracture.  Dr. John Brems will set the shoulder fractures - but not help with the bone problem - out of his comfort zone to to a little bone metabolism care & workup.  Can't talk with a girl long enough to get the picture, but he will email her ob-gyn - need more help than that Dr. Brems.    
Tom Patton, and Marlene Anielski have daughters - so maybe they would like to volunteer their daughters for this gristmill.  You can easily get a fake MD at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine - where they take any college grad with an unusual story or Peace Corp stint, social workers with 5 kids, and RNs with 3 - figuring that these types will diversify medicine (if they can ever make a diagnosis correctly, as they are usually 'light' on the science backgrounds).  Carla O'Day MD was such a wonder-adult MD.  Abbey Abelson MD will defend every psychosis of Dr. O'Day - that a colleague from the class behind her, with bone pains and multiple fractures, is just a psych case - Abby of CCF won't bother with labs - too much trouble for her 'good hair days' - and she's always had the perfect bob hair.  What is Rheumatology for, but to let women fracture for the orthopedics at CCF?  
Medical licensure deficiencies - for women MDs who won't be 'Catholic girls who are easy' - are impairments called 'personality disorders' - paranoia about the personal habits of licensed male physicians (that they might have HPV or worse).  Both Tom Patton & Marlene Anielski have daughters, and would not expect this of their daughters - but they both expect this of women MDs - not to be too particular on the copulating issue - open legs, and mouths, for the male MDs/dentists who have friends and don't bother with consent.  Consent isn't an Ohio thing.  It's all about opening orifices - not anything cerebral, or certifications, or excellences in patient care.  It's all about sex.    
Tom Patton has known of the problems at the State Medical Board of Ohio for at least 4 years.  His parish priest, Fr. Kriege, was told of the sexual abuses going on (like in the Catholic Church in Cleveland in the 1980s) - because the Catholic parishioners are into blaming only priests for this type of behavior - while parishioners, and male MDs, support it within the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Male phsyicians in Ohio can get away with sexual abuse of patients, colleagues, women & probably children (if the parent send the child alone to the office).  Fr. Caddy at St. Francis has Dr. Robert Botti insisting on this sexual stuff from women colleagues - while he married his second wife who watched Dr. Nice hit on their Gates Mills neighbor's kids.  It's all about the neighbors tolerating this stuff in Ohio - not the clergy anymore.    
It's about who does the sexual abuse - the State Medical Board of Ohio gets away with it because everything is 'confidential' - from what 'confidential' complaints get investigated, to what 'confidential' complaints are released to the friend physicians, to who signed those complaints (a convicted felon, or an illegal with no green card, could sign a complaint that would destroy an innocent physician's life - no checking into the qualifications of the signers/authors of physician complaints is ever done), to how long these cases go on, to what the Financial Report end of these cases involve - the cost.  
Who ever heard of a Financial Report from the State Medical Board of Ohio - the coffers are endless?  The investigations go into the dating histories of women MDs - not their patient care.   Kimberly Anderson - the Chief Investigator of Sex Lives of Women MDs - is now the Acting Interim Director of the State Medical Board - so it's all about sex & who a woman MD has dated in these sessions - which are closed for the most part.  One woman MD had to get a NY psychiatrist to discuss her dating history for 3 days in Columbus at Hearing testimony - the Ohio State Medical Board wasted three days of legal & administrative fees on this rot.  Not a patient was mentioned, just that the woman MD did not 'like' her orthopedics.    
It's all 'confidential' - when no other part of state government in Ohio can be this 'confidential.'  The abuses are legendary - cases of innocent physicians go on for 20 years - and are ignored as facts.  The blindness of legislators in Ohio, about the State Medical Board of Ohio, is legendary - like in the Country of the Blind by HG Wells.  Who ever reads the short story Country of the Blind anymore, certainly not Ohio legislators.
Tom Patton is into Transportation and Film Credits - but not into providing protections for women MDs to work, and have a career, without sexual whatevers to various & sundry male colleagues.  And Mrs. Nice knows that her husband - Dr. Nice - does this - requires personal understanding of his women colleagues or he 'breaks' them.  And Tom Patton probably knows who's getting it on the side, and who he can hit up for campaign contributions to hide the dirt.
Maybe if Fr. Bob Kriege can't make Tom Patton get a conscience, maybe some parishioners that toured the Capital in Columbus could step forward and say something about women MDs being allowed to be professional, to get adequate medical care, and to not have medical licenses taken for 'confidential.'  Get to Tom Patton when, and if, he goes to church anymore - make him explain.  Somewhere there has to be a decent human being in Ohio, or maybe not.",Doctors

										Dr. Stellato will come in to patient visits tired, without sleep, without manners - and try to diagnose a difficult situation - and it doesn't work.  But this is not the problem of the woman MD who told him to reschedule and get some sleep - take time off if there are family situations needing his attention.  That's not a police situation - it's a Dr. Stellato poor judgment situation - where he's failed to take responsibility for his own needs - personal & health.   
All physicians are responsible that when they come into a patient room, that they have adequate rest, are not impaired, and that they can focus on the matter at hand - or to reschedule.  And no patient minds this - everyone has had this happen.  
Patients requesting that Dr. Stellato reschedule, should not have the South Euclid Police called on them.  If he had a secretary with a brain, she would be able to handle this - but she blames the patients also - Carol the meddler, the truly stupid, the blamer of patients.  Patients do not 'stand up' Dr. Stellato in general - when patients are ill, they just can't show up for a surgery.  A woman hemorrhaging in her Gynecologist's office can't show up in Wright Surgery Center - but you do have to call her next of kin - and Carol is above this.  
No surgeon can make a good operative, or non-operative, decision without taking care of themselves - that they are happy in their job (and Dr. Stellato is not a happy camper at Wright Surgery Center which is beneath his abilities, achievements, and interests), and that they are taking care of their own health needs.  It's Dr. Stellato's responsibility to find a job that he's happy in, a place for his significant abilties and achievements - it's not Dr. Ponsky's job to find that position for him.
Dr. Stellato should not blame women MDs, or a patient, who tries to suggest that he reschedule given that he does not look well and has a family death situation.  No operative decisions can be made with surgeons who are tired, overworked, just drove all night, and in the middle of handling a parent's funeral.  Administration at University Suburban need to have the flexibility to handle this better - to mandate that Dr. Stellato take the time off - to allow that physicians requiring 'time-off' get it before they maim someone, or unnecessarily surgerize someone, needing just a 2% lidocaine injection and a thinking surgeon. 									",Doctors
State Senator Tom Patton,"  State Senator Tom Patton  Senate Building,1 Capitol Square, 1st Floor 
Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",http://www.ohiosenate.gov/patton,(614) 466-8056,"State Senator Tom Patton Representative Marlene Anielski are sitting on a stack of false physician cases at the State Medical Board in Ohio, one for a woman MD objecting to no casting of a fracture or allowed blood work, know the problem of 'confidential' c Columbus, Ohio","
										Both State Senator Tom Pattton, and newly-elected Representative Marlene Anielski, are aware of the problems for physicians at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  The problems are caused by the fact that anyone, even people that don't know the physician, can file a 'confidential' complaint that is acted on - even if false.  Impairment can be hypothetical, or provisional, in Ohio.  
This provisional can go on for decades, as the case is changed to 'find a case' - there is no statute of limitations in Ohio for physicians.  Ohio has the most physician disciplines in the US because of this, and physicians falsely accused & suspended can never clear their names - you have to admit the Board's case and sometimes the physician can't.  The cost of this - to Ohio taxpayers - is huge.  The loss of physician careers is making physicians flee Ohio when they find out the unheard of mess.  There is no relief in sight as the legislators can't really find out what is going on.  Most legislators don't know medical terminology.  Reforms at the State Medical Board in Ohio, have been needed for decades - thousands of physicians in Texas were harmed by 'confidential' complaints.  
The investigative actions at the State Medical Board, under Kimberly Anderson, who has investigated piles of false complaints that are never verified before being acted on - you can't verify 'confidential' - are huge.  Kimberly Anderson is the 'force' behind the 'Gestapo' techniques of the State Medical Board of Ohio.  
There is no Financial Report at the State Medical Board of Ohio, and neither Senator Patton, or Representative Marlene Anielski, know to ask for one.  Kimberly Anderson is currently the Interim Director of the State Medical Board since October, 2012.  She is the person most responsible for the problems, and just a graduate of Capital University in Columbus.  Ms. Anderson is the minence grise behind the mess in Ohio - the face of the corruption of the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Any new Director of the State Medical Board will have to clean up decades of problems swept under the rug - and currently the Director is her - so nothing is being cleaned up.
The problem is that no legislation is being contemplated to correct the problems - that reform will need that some of the false physician cases are opened for reforms - to show what the problems are.  This was known in 1998 - when some 'innocent' physician cases were offered to be opened for reforms with no damages - the offer was rescinded because Ohio did not want to take responsibility for the physician lives ruined.  No 'non-suit' agreement would have covered the damages of health, career, and life destruction for politics & stats.  It is estimated that the current damages will backrupt Ohio in one month - legitimate damages of physician lives, health, careers and emotional damages.
This was the proble for this policy in NY, TX, and the few remaining states that have this policy.  Rhode Island and Massachusetts don't - their Boards, because of liability, won't investigate anything that does not have a name on it and can be verified.  Anyone can say anything if things are 'confidential.'  There is no problem with any 'getting back,' or any dearth of legitimate complaints, in those states; either the physician has the problem, or doesn't, but false complaints are penalized legally then - someone is responsible for what they say.  
Both Senator Patton, and Representative Anielski have have physicians in their shared Ohio district that have been falsely accused of things at the State Medical Board of Ohio, unable to fight the 'confidential' accusations that are constantly changed to 'find a case,' and can't get medical care or a decent job until the situation is over - because no one knows what they did and other physicians don't want  be 'confidentially' complained about for helping them.  Many of these 'complaints' have nothing to do with patient cae - they allege that the woman MD has a personality disorder as she doesn't 'put out.'  Translation: she doesn't sleep around enough, and doesn't refer to the right physicians.
One case, in particular, where the woman complained 20 years ago of medical neglect - and the symptoms of bone pain (not patient care problems) were found to be due to an untreated thyroid problem - has gone on for 20 years and consumed about $500,000.  The Medical Board hasn't been able to prove any case, but has no policy of dismissing a case and allowing the physician re-entry.  All that the woman physician tried to do was get care-to-function - which is allowed in EVERY other state except Ohio.  This is a precedent case that would never have gotten anywhere in any other state - disciplining a physician for objecting to the wrong care done to themselves.  
Both Tom Patton, and Marlene Anielski, have not complained to get opening of this case so that the situation can be resolved about the woman physician's bone pain being really not 'psychiatric.'  The woman MD has been analyzed 5 times, and 3 national psychiatry experts have recommended that this situation be stopped - before the emotional damage is unrepairable - so Ohio has continued the case.  At Capital Univeristy you don't learn much except how to cheat.  And the woman MD was harassed by her orthopedics - her fractures left uncasted and her arms beaten up.  One orthopedic wanted her to 'understand him because his wife didn't,' and know that he - the orthopedic - could 'make or break her.'
The situation was started to get the orthopedics 'off' missing the metabolic problem - so that the woman MD didn't sue them.  The orthopedics have friends on the State Medical Board to this day - sometimes Medical Board actions are just to get Medical Board 'friends' out of trouble.  Board Members are paid in hospital appointments, job contracts for their groups, hospital privileges, or hospital staff positions.  It's all confidential however.This is not what a Medical Board is supposed to be doing.  The problem is that neither Senator Tom Patton, nor Representative Marlene Anielski, are medical terminology savy and there are no medical mistake laws - for physicians, or the State Medical Board, in Ohio.  So no one can admit a mistake, and the woman MD is dying of neglect of the thyroid condition and the bone problem.  She's had to go out of State for any care, and can't get a decent job in medicine.  Trying at the Cleveland Clinic, she was called a 'bitch to be slapped' (slap-bitch) by the black staff in the OR - the staff that runs the OR and leaves the surgical instruments sets unsterilized in the Heart Center.  The Heart Center is a great idea, but the underling staff controls The Cleveland Clinic and who is hired.    There needs to be an 'emergency' provision at the State Medical Board, to open a case, in the case of physician illness to get a case resolved.  The physician's family have offered to sign a non-suit agreement, but the State has neglected the case - and her State Senator & Representative are not on the case - they are in Columbus for the power & money - not for the job.  
Richard Whitehouse, the previous Executive Director, sat on the case for 8 years - never answering the phone.  Both Senator Patton & Representative Anielski know that the physician has been emotionally, and medically abused, and don't care.  Father Kriege, of St. John Neumann parish in Strongsville, has been asked to speak with Tom Patton (a parishioner), as the situation is similar to the priest abuse of the 1980s - with the Medical Board in Ohio allowing the abuse & the code of silence (and the parish priests having to speak up).   									",Doctors

										Dr Junig, was a anesthesiologist, who stole drugs from his patients, to further his drug addiction.
He was caught out, and had his licence torn away, and then began, a  career, as a drug councillor, via a psychiatric licence, despite, the obvious alarm bells,.
Unfortunately, I have now, had my experience, like many other have with this rogue Dr.
His words, and demeanor are nasty, viscous, and narcissistic. Which should have no place in psychiatry.
His latest venture, is to run a completely biased forum, to further line his pocket, along with selling tapes, to people, to make a profit, of poor drug addicts.
I joined his forum, to work through my own addiction, and have successfully quit opiates, after a 5 year bupe addiction.
It is now my firm belief, that this Man is out of control, and probably needs to be put in front of the Law, again, and have his intentions questioned.
I believe, after spending 2 months on his forum, that his sole intention, is to drum up addicts, that cannot quit, and move them into a paying roll as one of his customers, of tapes, and other BS , this guy sells, under the guise of wanting to help people.
Do we really want a ex -junkie, who stole meds from his patients, telling people that there is little chance of beating opiates, without his help?
He does not seem to be interested in people who can get themsleves off opiates, but rather, is using the forum, as a way to steer more customers into his pratice.
if this is not enough, he is also flooding his forum, with so many adds, with also line his pocket.
Is it ethical for a doctor to make money of drug addicts, I do not think so.
I have read hundreds of his posts, and he just seems, like a nasty old man, Who has an agenda, a mile long.
What is also worse, is that he has total control, over a public forum, and just erases people, that he feels, are letting people, know, the breadth, of his actions,.
He should pay his moderators money, for running his forum, and should most probably, get out of the field of drug addiction.
His over ruling view point, is that 9 out of 10 addicts fail, unless, you acquire his help.
Seems just a bit too dodgy for me.
I was ditched from the forum, without warning, and have had no choice but to come here.
I will contact the American board of psychiatry, and also let them know, what is happening, but i suggest all people, wanting to rid themselves, of bupe, stay away from Dr J lunig.
You have to ask yourself, if he was prepared to steal drugs from his patients to support his habit, what else is this guy capable of.,
He is a nasty man, with a foul temper, and little ability to act in a responsible way,.

Irvine, California United States of America ",www.drakeinstitute.com,(949) 653-2020,"The Drake Institute David Velkoff, MD My experience? They are SCOUNDRELS! Irvine, California","
										Back in 2009 I was struggling at work. Had been diagnosed with ADD just a couple years before that, after graduating from college and working about 20 years. I don't remember how I found out about The Drake Institute. Probably have no one to blame but myself for that part. They appear very diligent in responding to negative criticism, so this post may not be here for long if there is a way for them to remove negative info. 
Why am I writing this now, in 2013? Because I just got a 1099-C from Chase Health Advance claiming the portion of the line of credit that I did NOT use to be cancellation of debt. I didn't want to pay in advance for something I knew nothing about. Pay-as-you-go was not an option offered by Drake. The way it must have been set up by Drake Institute was you pay IN ADVANCE or set up financing through Chase Health Advance. What must happen after that is Chase Health Advance pays the Drake Institute in advance (the ""Advance"" in Chase Health Advance). Then the Drake Institute is out of the picture and the patient is on the hook regardless of whether they continue with the treatment or not. 
Anyway - I went to for an initial assessment. They wired my head up did some testing. I even had the foolishness to bring my preteen daughter with Down syndrome in later for the same process. Worse, I signed up for ""treatment"" that amounted to nothing more than playing a fancy video game that was able to ""learn"" from my choices. Somehow I was then supposed to learn from playing it. 
The price for this ""treatment"" was estimated by Dr. Velkoff - as far as I could tell - by looking at the clothes I was wearing. I kick myself for not walking out the door when he said something like ""the cost of the treatment program will be $3,000"" and then, after looking over the business clothes I had on - ""no, $8,000."" None of which was covered by insurance. 
Worse than that, I brought my daughter in for an initial assessment. Why? Because I got a multi-patient discount! I will explain momentarily why I was such a fool. My daughter may or may not have ADD, I don't know. But I do know that she has Down syndrome. Whatever testing protocol the Drake Institute can point to for justifying the efficacy of its fancy video game, I am confident that protocol did not address individuals with Down syndrome. I would be surprised if it addresses adults with ADD. 
After one, maybe two sessions in 2009 I wised up and wrote a letter stating I was discontinuing my treatment. I didn't see how paying thousands of dollars to play video games would be effective at anything except enriching Dr. Velkoff and the Drake Institute.
After that my problems with attention, memory, personal and work relationships, energy, and sleep continued to worsen. I saw a psychologist and then a psychiatrist. In late 2010 my psychiatrist recommended I get an MRI. I did, and it showed I was on the way to an early stroke due to ""acquired hydrocephalus"", commonly known as water on the brain. I had brain surgery in the spring of 2011 to have a shunt (a drain) installed to reduce the pressure and avoid an early stroke. Dr. Velkoff claims expertise in looking at these neurofeedback evaluations and I have no reason to doubt that. It may even be effective treatment. I don't know yet how the IRS looks at these 1099-Cs for cancellation of debt if it's a line of credit that was never used, but I don't see how that's income to me. 
Bottom line? If you have wads of excess cash to spend on your child with ADD go ahead and spend it at the Drake Institute. Just be aware once you're in, you're in.

										I was a patient of Dr. Donald Robertson for over 20 years. On my last visit he was in a hurry and became very angry with me. He picked up papers that belonged to me and balled them up and tried to hit me on the face with them. Then he stood up and screamed at me and blocked me from leaving the exam room. I am disabled and wear a large back brace and he would not let me leave. After screaming at me and pointing his finger in my face he finally backed up and let me leave the exam room. Then he demanded $180 for the office visit even without doing any exam or writing a bloodwork order like I ask him for. He performed no service but still tried to bill me. Finally he gave me back my Creditcard with no charge. I have seen him treat other patients like this in the past. Many years ago I read in the paper that Donald made sexual advances towards a female patient. I believe her 100% now because I have seen first hand how mean and angry he can get if he does not get his way. I would not refer anyone to his office because he may treat them like he treated me. At this time the Englewood Police are investigating this situation.									",Doctors

										Dr. Stellato is an example of The Peter Principle - rising to one's level of incompetence.  He's a Medical Director at University Suburban Health Center in South Euclid - beloved of the Euclid Police for his calls about patients wanting him to explain - when he is a Chief of General Surgery 'prototype' type who refuses to take the risks & challenges offered to get back to that level, and get himself out of there.  
Dr. Stellato is not a Medical Director in a million-zillion years, even if his secretary Carol has learned how to do BP checks; he hasn't a clue about medical care.  Stellato is where he doesn't belong, irking the hell out of most, and everyone can see it but him.  Dr. Stellato refuses to apologize to the colleagues that he has hurt, he refuses to discuss with the women colleagues he has called the police on, and he refuses to get out of his funk for not seeing that the Chief of General Surgery at University would eventually go to a Cancer Surgeon - as that's where the Hubay Chair belonged in the first place.  There are plenty of other 'Chairs' in Surgery - but you can't sit at University Suburban and get the offer - and you can't blame the person that put the insanity on ripoffreport to get some thought on the problem - 6 months at Suburban tops should have been the detour slump.  
No one wants to blog this, but Stellato can't see the obvious.  And it's a loss to him personally, and to the field of General Surgery generally, that the person doing the Reviews of General Surgery for the Surgery Boards is sitting outside of the circle of the residents taking the Boards.  Down the street playing Medical Director in suburbia - sounds like a Suburgatory re-run.    
Dr. Stellato started the Department of Bariatric Surgery at University Hospitals - but he has no passion for that surgery - and it causes chronic neurological problems & damage only evident years after the fact - a time-bomb of a surgical procedure.  But there's no excuse for not continuing the surgical literature in other regards - in the question of common mass closures that all rupture and then require mesh - which then infects & ruins lives - including the sex lives of all with mesh.  
There is the layered closure problem & practice: a technique that only surgeons (peds, general & plastics) trained prior to 1990 learned how to do well - so repair some of these common mass closures with layered closures, and prove it can be done safely.  That alone would get Dr. Stellato a berth at Mayo Clinic - where they have thousands of these ill-thought-out closures to repair (the Sarr legacy).  
Dr. Michael Rosen in the Hernia Center at Case/University wants to see if Dr. Stellato can do this repair, and has sent him patients needing the layered closure to see the result - but Stellato can't take a challenge, can't schedule these patients - what is he afraid of?  Talking to Dr. Rosen?  If he can repair them, he will be the miracle-go-to-guy to learn layered abdominal closures - a lost art - but part of the art of surgery.  Dr. Rosen can't do these closures.  This is a role that Dr. Ponsky can't play anymore - the guy in the OR - Ponsky sends all his hernia problems to Dr. Rosen.  So Stellato needs to prove he can do better than a Ponsky-turf, and so far he sits and sulks at Suburban - with the Administration coddling him like a baby in his terrible tantrum 2s.
Write the surgical literature article on Chronic Abdominal Wall Pain and Management - can Stellato write this, or can he just do a Surgeon's Odyssey to an MBA?  Different style of writing, different expertise, and a different kind of person is required for the former rather than the later.  A Surgeon who knows about the 'art of surgery' is much to be preferred from the Surgeon who takes a Ulysses-like detour for an MBA to prove he should be the Chief of Surgery - to prove he can sit in a Chair.  There's no relation between an MBA, and being a Surgical Chief, except in Ohio - outside of Ohio that is not a CV-plus.  Odysseys don't necessarily teach someone anything, they are stories, but not paradigms.  
If you don't have to prove yourself, there's no reason for the walkabout; no reason for the shipwrecks, the monsters, the sirens, no reason for Ulysses-Stellato being between Scylla and Charybdis.  The less drama the better in the practice of surgery - and it's not about the money, it's about the skill, the passion, and the compassion.  And this isn't coming down - it's an official challenge to Stellato to get on with living, learning, teaching, and the improving of General Surgery asap.

Bundrick MD - Medicine publishes about how to handle chronic abdominal wall pain without neurectomy but the Surgery Service is allowed to neurectomize patients with consent or discussion per Jill Smith in Legal & the State  Rochester, Minnesota","
										John B. Bundrick publishes how to handle chronic abdominal wall pain for the Internist, but Mayo Clinic does not follow his recommendations from The Mayo Clinic Proceedings.  Surgical services at Mayo Clinics can schedule these patients for 'neuroma' surgeries, and do a neurectomy - which doesn't treat the situation - without consent or discussion.  Until that 'without consent or discussion' problem is solved, or the Medical Board of MN stops the neurectomy procedures, it's not safe to even see Dr. John Bundrick - he's a talking head in every sense.  No compassion, no saving of even other MDs from neurectomies, or getting them to repairs of abdominal wall muscles before they rupture.  
It's estimated that hundreds, to thousands, of neurectomies have been done, by the Surgical Services at the Mayo Clinics, since Dr. Bundrick has been at Mayo Clinic - all while he watched.  They are all billed as 'neuroma' procedures - Dr. Sarr & his services just create neuromas - cut nerves that proliferate - with these procedures.  No one publishes the real stats.  Nothing about their cases differs from case #3 - except that these cases cannot be published.
Surgical Services at Mayo Clinic never check to see the follow-up: the neuromas & the common mass closure ruptures.  You can't sew 3 layers of the abdominal wall together and have a functional result - the layers will try to separate as they contract in different directions - which even an Art Student knows.  Check the knowledge of the art students at Cleveland Institute of Art, which is > the anatomic knowledge of the surgical residents & attendings at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Arizona or Jacksonville.  Dr. Warner Andrew Oldenburg in Jacksonville defends these procedures - anything to go along with the boys without a brain, a thought, or common sense - it's about the money like his marriage - payroll.  He's getting paid to cover it up in Jacksonville - with just how many abdominal nerves has he taken out in his surgical career being the next question?  Mayo Clinic is a neurectomy machine.    
Jill Smith allows this, decrees this from the Legal Department, and refuses to allow the undoing of these procedures.  She hangs up on patients when they call, whitewashes the files on these patients (the 'case is over,' and the case hasn't begun) for the Administration, and is the main reason that this cruel unnecessary procedure has been continued since the 1990s.  Jill Smith is a monster, in that she has no idea what these neurectomy procedures entail - the mutilation, the ruptures of the common mass closures, the chronic pain, the deformities - and the humiliation of having the most stupid intern & student come in the room and fake this with 'extra' exams-under-anesthesia for the women patients - breast, vaginal.  
The surgical under-anesthesia gropings - done by the intern who can't cut, or wield/use a scalpel better than even a US trained Surgical Technologist (who can at least hold one & change the blade), and the student who can't close but is black - and he never had to do Surgical Technology training to know how to load suture onto a hemostat - and he didn't get this skill from his 'roots.'  Surgical skills are learned, and you have to put yourself out there & practice with a few hemostats & suture packs - but the blacks think that they just need the opportunity to make a mess, to lip-synch in the OR.      
The Legal Department is into the mutilations in this situation - a horribly callous, stupid, cruel woman attorney - Jill Smith.  So until John Bundrick solves the Jill Smith problem - patients are advised that Kaiser Permanente handles this problem of chronic abdominal wall pain with 2% lidocaine injections, has a longstanding billing code from the 1970s for this problem, and that Kaiser - not John Bundrick - has put the best literature out there on this problem.  Go to KAISER.
Patients wrongly neurectomized at Mayo Clinic since the late 1990s have been requesting 'undoing' of the Sarr common mass closure deformities - something that Kaiser can't do as they have never seen this nonsense.  The Mayo Clinic doesn't use scopes, they allow the worst students, interns, and attendings to butcher abdominal walls by cutting all 3 fascias and sewing them all together after removing the 'normal' nerve (and they try to say on the operative report that there is some 'foreign material' that never shows on the pathology reports).  Dr. Sarr's glasses need cleaning, and his 3-month interns need glasses & refractions before they cut anything.  God knows from where the Mayo Clinic gets there foreign interns & these stupider-than-stupid residents that can wear a suit - their egomaniac group of interns & residents who will cut anything without a clear thought or reason.  A daVinci can be programmed to do that - and the machine doesn't need a $500 suit.    
Jill Smith needs to stop her neurectomy defending, and to allow that all patients that did not consent to these procedures have them undone at Mayo Clinic expense as soon as possible in 2013 - and Dr. Oldenburg needs to understand that money is not the be-all and end-all and that Mayo Clinic is very stupid about very many all-to-common surgical & medical issues & problems.  Being a talking-head for Mayo Clinic does not make one a good person, or a good surgeon - it makes you a fool that doesn't read the literature.   									",Doctors

										Thomas Stellato MD has been at/with University Hospitals for 40-some years.  As a Chief Resident in Surgery, as a Chief of General Surgery, as Director of Bariatrics Surgery and now as Director of Wright Surgery Center.  In that time he's been heavily favored to be the Chief of Surgery at University - but never quite made the top spot - despite skills, publications, a published book, a Business Masters from Weatherhead, and a repertoire of surgical procedures & endoscopy skills - all of which he doesn't use the right way - to create new ideas in surgery and to train thoughtful surgeons to THINK.  
Problem: he hasn't gotten the goodwill of many women students, residents, and MDs - looking the other way for the boys being boys, molestation of women (verbally, emotionally, physically & medically).  As Chief of Surgery at University Hospitals, he overlooked an orthopedic attending beating a woman MD in his MetroHealth office, a woman MD begging him for help with a surgical problem that's been overlooked, but still was in the literature as being treated with an injection & not a surgical procedure.  
Dr. Stellato got mad that the woman MD stood him up - instead of discussing with her so that she was sure what she was arranging for.  And what does it matter that she blogs this - he's discredited her, made fun of her, angered the family, and sent her to a consult without his office chart notes - where she was abused.  She's a nobody in his world.  But Dr. Stellato just doesn't have the standup to be real, to be involved, to be shaping surgical minds in an ethical professional way.  It's not professional to call the South Euclid Police on a colleague who is asking you to discuss - when her shoulder is broken and she can't defend herself.  That's a bully.  
Administratively Dr. Stellato always sides with the boys, even though women MDs have a right to exist, and to not have their medical licenses put in jeopardy if they don't go along with wrong care - of themselves or patients.  Tom Stellato doesn't have the guy maturity factor/computer chip - where he can do what a Chief at Lenox Hill Hospital did in the 1990s.  Stellato needs to be able to discuss with women students, residents, and MDs - care problems, differentials, options, and to let the women MDs have time to think, to make decisions, to debate - time to bring a woman's approach to a guy's field, to integrate the needs of patients into the surgical options available - not every procedure is for every patient.  And this is posted because Dr. Stellato won't discuss - women aren't worth his time unless they agree with him - and that is boring.
Give-and-take is where Dr. Stellato falls down - and the parents, siblings and business associates, of the women MDs & their families, can't recommend that behavior for a Chief of Service to run a Hospital of programs and problems..  And it's a tragedy that Dr. Stellato can't take things to the next level without calling the South Euclid Police on a colleagues who disagrees about his approach, care, or his plans for a case.  Mothers should not have to enter into discussions with 50 & 60-some year olds, and Carol the secretary is not the answer.
In the 1990s, at Hospitals in NYC (Lenox Hill) there was a problem as harassment of women students, residents & MDs became public knowledge (awareness) - where would the hospitals & Residency Directors draw the line - especially in Surgery Residency Programs.  It's well known that in the 1980s, women residents had to go into the guy's Locker Room for post-surgery discussions & teaching -- for the going over of the case & concepts.  In the 1990s, this was still a practice, even to the point of some surgical guy residents stripping down in front of the women MDs for the show, sport, and to be immature - show the women what they were missing in the flesh.  The Lenox Hill Hospital took several guy residents to court for this - they had to get lawyers - which would not have happened in Ohio at University Hospitals - where the women MDs would have been told to get counseling if they couldn't take the 'stress.'  Dr. Ponsky is a bit more Jewish decent, but Stellato has definitely dropped women patients & friends in any engagement, and been a jerk for the boy factor to support his quest to be Chief of Surgery.  And he got it back when Dr. Ponsky was chosen to be the Chief in 2006 - the guy factor wasn't the crucial vote.
At University Suburban - it is the same atmosphere - from the Administration to Carol - who is not supposed to talk with certain women MDs.  She talks enough to tell you this.
If there is a discussion of a plan, an option, an approach to a medical problem - as the Medical Director at Suburban - Dr. Stellato needs to allow the discussion - so that things are not blogged that don't need to be about surgical cases & people including himself.  
Dr. Stellato needs to allow that people/MDs see his surgical thinking, his approach to problems, and he needs to allow debate, discussion, argument, and contention over controversial medical knowledge, papers, approaches to treatment & care of patients.
One problem is common mass closures, along with neurectomies for abdominal wall nerve inflammations.  Common mass closures are now the rage - to sew all layers of abdominal muscles together in a one-suture-pack glob of tissue that creates a horrible ABDOMINAL WALL DEFORMITY.  Dr. Stellato can't discuss this.  The literature can.
These common mass closures all lead to ruptures after 3-5 years.  And then the repair is difficult because the lines of delineation between the abdominal wall muscles/fascias are blurred.  A layered repair, after a rupture, has the problem of the shortening of the muscles/fascias by this ill-thought-out closure.  And mesh causes infections and thousands are now suing for this use of mesh; women>>men.     
Neurectomies used to be common, but not since 1926 - since before Stellato's time.  Most abdominal nerve problems can be treated conservatively with an injection of 2% lidocaine - which Dr. Stellato has some mental block doing - but he won't discuss this as to the why.  And you hand him the papers, and he mails them back.  Too bad that he didn't read them.But it is the approach that the kingmakers, and rainmakers, take umbrage at - that Dr. Stellato can't discuss, can't smile and hold his own in a debate, can't argue with a woman over an academic surgical issue, can't go over the papers with her from the literature, can't grow up.  If it is an ugly woman, ok - but this isn't an 'ugly' problem; it's a life of choosing that women are second class and not worth his talking to.  ",Doctors

										John Bundrick MD is allowing that colleagues at Mayo Clinic do unnecessary neurectomies on patients without proper Medical Consultation, workup, labs, or Carnett's test - without a trial of conservatively management with an injection.  Dr. Michael Sarr, and the General Surgical Department at Mayo Clinic, is allowed to take patients to surgery without consultations, without Carnett's test, without offering all surgical & non-surgical options - since 1998 at least.  With the Mayo Clinic publishing otherwise.
This has been going on since 1998, and the Medical Board of Minnesota was informed of the problem in 1999.  Recently the Medical Board of MN has been given the articles on this, including Dr. Bundrick's article, and advised that the problem is continuing and that Mayo Clinic needs to 'undo' all of these unnecessary surgeries where muscles were cut and superficial abdominal nerves removed for money.  They are restudying the problem - but in the meantime no patient should be undergoing a neurectomy at ANY Mayo Clinic Hospital.
What the Mayo Clinic publishes, the Mayo Clinic should do.  Certainly the Mayo Clinic should not have been doing this even in 1998.  
But Jill Smith was informed that this procedure needed to be undone in one patient about 2 weeks after it happened in 1998.  That it didn't go along with the surgical literature.  She sat on it for her job as Chief Legal Counsel at Mayo Clinic.
The Mayo Clinic needs to stop neurectomies - a procedure that went out in 1926.  And to repair all patients mutilated with this procedure in the last 20 years.  Dr. Bundrick needs to review any surgical procedure where a neurectomy, or neuroma, is involved - pre-operatively. 									",Doctors

										Dr. Eileen Bastians Negligence with Skin Caused Attempted Suicide of a Young Woman
 
There were many signs that Dr. Eileen Bastian was a negligent, irresponsible and unethical doctor whose only goal was to just make money, but I ignored what I saw and heard and instead trusted her anyway because she seemed nice, and below is how the heartless and greedy Dr. Eileen Bastian caused harm and injury. 
 
How could any doctor be so extremely negligent with a young womans face to the point that she affected the third layer of the skin, including the nerves and muscles on the face and causing so many issues and scars - that eventually lead to an attempted suicide?  
 
How could a doctor be so dishonest and dirty to hide important information and tell lies about the safety of her dangerous procedures and practices, even when specifically asked, assuring her customer the procedures are all safe, yet do so much damage with those same procedures? 
 
How could Dr. [continued below]....
									
										..... Eileen Bastian be so careless and heartless with someones face, let alone a young womans face?  How can a so called doctor have no concern whatsoever about how her unsafe practices can affect someones life?  A young woman who so naively and innocently trusted Dr. Bastian, based on Dr. Bastians promise that all her work was safe.
 
Dr. Eileen Bastian should certainly do some soul searching and ask herself these important questions before she dares to do any type of skin work on anyone else.  However, Dr. Eileen Bastian has proved that she does not have a soul, and therefore is incapable of feeling any remorse or taking responsibility for her extreme negligence and wrongdoing, let alone holding herself responsible or asking herself any questions.
 
How can a doctor lack so much knowledge about skin and have such poorly skilled hands to cause so many scars and damage, yet still allow herself to still work on other peoples faces and continue to put others in harms way?  How can Dr. Eileen Bastian possibly sleep at night, knowing the scope of pain and damage she has caused - physically, emotionally and mentally - being responsible for a young womans attempted suicide?  How can Dr. Bastian continue to practice, knowing that she is capable of doing such tremendous harm to her own customers skin?  Dr. Eileen Bastian does harm both due to her extreme lack of knowledge and skill with skin and also due to her tremendous level of greed and desperate need to lie in order to get the most amount of  business from each single customer.
 
The words negligent and cruel does not even begin to describe how horrible and irresponsibly dangerous Dr. Eileen Bastians unsafe practices on the skin really are.  Dr. Bastian clearly does not care - even one bit - about the oath she made to God to Do No Harm, because she did a tremendous amount of harm to my skin due to her extreme lack of knowledge, aggressive and unsafe practices, unskilled hands and tremendous greed.  And God is going to repay her for every single wrongdoing and harm that she did to my skin.   
 
My skin was very nice and healthy before I went to her, and she told me her procedures would just make it look even better.  She made it sound like the procedures were nothing, and that everything was so simple and safe and just to rejuvenate my already young skin.  I specifically asked her many times about the safety of the many types of procedures she wanted to do on my skin in a very short amount of time, and she assured me that everything was safe.  She lied, because none of them were safe. None of the work that she did was safe at all.
 
I even asked her if she could just work on a few areas, instead of the entire face since I could tell she was being very aggressive with my skin and her entire approach. Her extremely dishonest response was that she couldnt just work on a few areas.  Later, I found out from a real professional that Dr. Bastian could have easily and certainly just worked on a few areas, especially that she did so many different unsafe procedures at the same time.  So why did Dr. Eileen Bastian lie and told me she couldnt just work on a few areas?  One reason and one reason only. Because working on a few areas would mean a lot less money in her dirty pocket than working on the entire face. This is how disgustingly greedy, unethical, irresponsible, dangerous  and dirty Dr. Eileen Bastian really is that she harmed and injured my skin just to make a few extra hundred.  Her procedures were so unnecessary, extremely aggressive and unsafe and it was all to make her as much money as she could get out of me, in a short period of time, without any concern about my safety.  I was so naive and I trusted her and she proved to be the devil himself, so trusting her was the wrong thing to do, because she only caused harm that could have and should have been easily avoided.
 
Dr. Eileen Bastians greed and lies blinded her to the point that she did a tremendous amount of harm and injury instead of making sure that her work on my skin was safe as any responsible doctor would.  Her extreme lack of knowledge about skin and the fact that she actually gets to practice on peoples  skin shows how any desperate emergency doctor, who just wants to escape her job and make more money, can turn into a dangerous wannabe skin specialist/dermatologist  overnight - all out of greed  and desperation to make as much money as possible in a short amount of time - and then negligently harm her own customers without any second thought or concern how her negligence can affect someone.  
 
Dr. Eileen Bastian even has admitted to others the reason she went into the business of skin, was because she could make much more money and work much less.  That explains a lot and why she was so negligent and careless, and why she tried so hard to sell as many of her unsafe procedures as she could, while withholding important information about the dangers of her unsafe procedures and practices.  I asked her numerous times about the safety of all the procedures she was going to do. She looked me in the eye and assured me that everything was safe.  She lied. Not only her practices were not safe, but they were plain dangerous and caused injury and harm down to the third layer of my skin even affecting muscles and nerves.  Obviously, the clear instruction and oath to God to Do No Harm does not mean anything at all to Dr. Eileen Bastian, otherwise she would have never done this to my skin.
 
I had to stop working after what Dr. Bastian did to my skin, and what her negligence did to me physically, emotionally and mentally.  I went from a young healthy woman who worked since a very young age, and who had always been healthy physically, emotionally and mentally to not being able to work, and instead being placed on different anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications just to control the panic attacks and seeing psychiatrists, psychologists and therapists just so I could function from day to day. The only thing Dr. Bastian cared about was her own dirty pocket and how much money she could get out of one person in a short amount of time - which was just plain evil and disgustingly dirty on her part and shes going to pay for all her negligence, dishonesty and greed.  She told me so many lies and did not share any information about the procedures at all, except just saying that they were safe and that was after questions were asked. In fact she withheld information and the doctors I went to afterwards could not believe Dr. Bastians lack of knowledge about skin, her extreme dishonesty and also how very unsafe, aggressive and negligent Dr. Bastians practices were with the skin, especially on someones face.
 
Dr. Eileen Bastian assured me about the safety of her procedures, but her practices were all extremely aggressive and dangerous.  In fact, it turned out that the work she did was only to get more money out of me and they were so very unnecessary and extremely dangerous to do in the first place and anyone with even a small amount of knowledge about skin should have known to not do all the procedures that she did.  I was told by different doctors that Dr. Eileen Bastian should not have done what she did at all and they kept asking me if Dr. Eileen Bastian actually has an actual doctorate degree, because they said it should have been very obvious to any doctor with a degree that her approach and procedures were very aggressive and dangerous and that anyone with even very minimal knowledge of the skin would have known not to do what she did at all. They said she should have known not to do what she did.
 
Dr. Eileen Bastian is not a doctor. Shes a heartless thief who puts other peoples life in danger with no second thought or concern about their safety, just to make some extra money for herself and her family.  Shes so ignorant and unaware that she doesnt realize that type of money that causes harm to someone else wont do any good for her or her family at all.  Dr. Eileen Bastian is such a horrible doctor for skin that she actually affected the nerves and muscles.  What kind of a negligent, unskilled and thoughtless doctor does that to someones face, let alone a young womans face?  Dr. Bastian is so poorly skilled that she really did not know what she was doing at all.  What kind of a heartless, negligent, cruel and careless doctor allows herself cause such injury to someon'e face and is even capable of doing such a terrible thing to a young woman? She even affected and touched areas that she had no business or reason to even work on in the first place, and that anyone with any common sense would not even go near those areas  especially on a young womans face.  The doctors who saw what she did and what areas she had damaged, could not believe her lack of skill, poor work and judgment with skin. This shows her extreme lack of care for her customers well-being and safety, and extreme poor level of knowledge about the skin. Dr. Eileen Bastian is what God warned us from in the Bible; shes a dangerous wolf in sheeps clothing.
 
The doctors I went to afterwards shook their heads when they heard and saw what she did to my skin and found it hard to believe that shes an actual doctor with an actual degree. They thought it was the work of someone with no knowledge about the skin nor any skills with the skin at all, but some said it is not that surprising, because Dr. Bastian is not a skin specialist nor a dermatologist and therefore doesnt know much about skin.  She has no business working on peoples skin and she dares to do it, just because it makes her more money than the actual job she was trained for. Dr. Eileen Bastian is not a human being, let alone a decent human being. There is nothing honest, decent or human about her at all. She has no heart or soul.  Otherwise, she would never do this to anyone, let alone to a young woman.  Her priority is not to protect her customers well-being and safety. Her priority is to make as much money as she can from each person that goes to her, and to sell to them as many procedures as she can, and she will go as far as lying and withholding information and falsely assuring that her work and procedures are safe, all at her customers physical, emotional and mental expense.  Her work and practices are extremely aggressive, unsafe and dangerous, because she doesnt know what shes doing, she doesnt know skin and on top of all that she is the most greedy doctor you could ever find. That combination is what makes her dangerous doctor and thats also why she harmed and injured my skin.
 
I cannot describe the kind of pain and the amount of hurt that Dr. Eileen Bastian has caused by her extreme negligence, not just for me, but also for my family due to what she did to me .   I cannot explain how much Ive cried and what Dr. Bastians negligence and greediness has done to me.  How could I ever put all that into words in a few paragraphs. The damage Dr. Bastian did to my skin was so extensive that I finally could not take it anymore and regardless of how strong I was, I finally attempted suicide.  A young and healthy woman attempted suicide, because Dr. Eileen Bastian was so extremely negligent, heartless, dishonest, unskilled, clueless and careless in her practice. Because Do No Harm is not what Dr. Eileen Bastian takes seriously or cares about at all  otherwise she would have never done this to me with her extremely aggressive and unsafe practices, in addition to her dirty and evil greed.
 
They were able to save me, only by the grace of God,  as they got to me on time and they rushed me to the hospital emergency room and I had to stay in the hospital for days.  I cannot explain what Ive gone through due to Dr. Eileen Bastians extreme negligence.  I do know that Gods justice will be served in this case sooner or later  and God will repay Dr. Eileen Bastian for her wrongdoing.  God will make sure that Dr. Eileen Bastian will pay for every bit of pain, every nervous breakdown and every single tear and hurt that she directly and so unnecessarily has caused in this case.  If she had put my safety first, instead of her own dirty pocket, none of this would have ever happened.
 
Revenge is mine Saith the Lord. I will repay.  And thats why I didnt need to sue Dr. Eileen Bastian. And you can be sure that type of lawsuit and what she did to me would have closed down her business.  I didnt sue her, because I know for a fact that God is a just God.  Dr. Eileen Bastian definitely deserved a big fat lawsuit, and anyone else would have filed a lawsuit against her.  Dr. Eileen Bastian - easily and unarguably -would lose the lawsuit and would owe a tremendous amount of money, after the type of harm and injury she did with her extreme negligence, in addition to all the emotional and mental distress she has caused due to her extremely heartless, carless, greedy and dirty practices.  Not to mention that nobody would ever go near her business again after a lawsuit.  But I chose to let God take care of the injustice that Dr. Eileen Bastian did, because God is a God of justice and He is going to make sure that justice is served in this case.  
 
God always makes sure that justice is served one way or another, sooner or later and in every single case.  What God is going to do to Dr. Eileen Bastian and her life, because of the harm Dr. Bastian did to me, is so much bigger and multiplied than anything a big fat lawsuit could ever do to her. God is a just God, which means God handles and takes care of justice better than anyone else ever would, and God punishes injustice better than any judge ever could.									",Doctors

Bundrick MD publishes about how to handle chronic abdominal wall pain conservatively-which is not what happens at Mayo Clinic where only 1:20 or 1:200 patients get correctly treated and the rest are ghoulishly ne Rochester, Minnesota","
										John B. Bundrick - Mayo Clinic Rochester General Internal Medicine - writes the Clinical Pearls Series for The Mayo Clinic Proceedings - an excellent review series of articles, but the case studies are stereotypical, and the 'management' not what really happens = the generic patient with the no human mistakes scenario (never happens).  
In the January 2011 issue, case #3, Dr. Bundrick details the ""Mayo Clinic treatment"" of chronic abdominal wall pain due to superficial nerve inflammations - a 2% lidocaine trigger point injection & reassurance after a positive Carnett's test.  [What is a Carnett's test being the problem for most Mayo Staff - ask one what Carnett's test is today - and send the answer to the Mayo Clinic Board of Trustees, or the CEO & President of one of the Mayo Clinics - they need to know.  Ask any surgeon and you won't get much of an answer except silence.]  The Legal Department at Mayo Clinic, Jill Beed-Smith, thinks it a Chico's earring design.  
These abdominal wall nerve inflammations are all-to-common sequelae of abdominal laparoscopic procedures, other surgical procedures including appendectomy, vascular (Dr. Warner Andrew Oldenburg misses this in Jacksonville), & ob-gyn (Pfannenstiel incisions & portholes), and sports injuries (football, soccer or treadmill).  Any patient that moves can get an abdominal wall nerve inflammation, and it occurs in peds (in the Peds Surgical Literature): J Pediatr Surg. 2011 Apr;46(4):699-703. doi: 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2010.08.054. Surgery for refractory anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES) in children. Scheltinga MR, Boelens OB, Tjon A Ten WE, Roumen RM.  (Surgery for REFRACTORY being what to note.)  
This diagnostic problem represents the most common cause of abdominal wall pain.  The anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment inflammation syndrome is acronymed out as ACNES for the Google searcher - not that anyone at Mayo Clinic cares.  Dr. Michael Sarr, and other surgeons at the AZ, FL & MN Mayo Clinics, haven't a clue about what a Carnett's test is - it's never on the workups, never on the Rounds talks, and everyone wants to CUT - Medicine is a cutting game at Mayo Clinic.  
This John Bundrick MD article hides a 'dirty' subtext of mismanagement of this problem at Mayo Clinic - a subtext story that The Mayo Clinic Proceedings Editorial Staff is well aware of.  Most abdominal wall pain nerve inflammations don't survive more than 48 hours at Mayo Clinic (never make it to the General Internal Medicine Clinic 'refractory' area) - they are turfed to surgery, and used as a surgical quota procedure for the Surgical Staff & Chiefs.  [You have to have so many procedures/year to remain on Mayo Staff & still lecture, travel, ski, and be a big-hyped deal.]  
You can do a whole menu of these 'neurectomy' procedures, and still be on the last-flight-out of Rochester on Friday to the Bahamas, Mexico, South America, LA, Idaho or Colorado for skiing.  It's a butcher job ghoulish procedure, but pays well as the insurances, and The Medical Board of Minnesota, haven't caught on as to what a 'neurectomy' at Mayo Clinic really means - the soundbite hides the reality.  The Medical Boad of Minnesota should have stopped these neurectomies decades ago.  Except for Dr. Josef Mengele's repopularization of the procedure for inmate torture at Auschwitz, these abdominal wall neurectomies have been considered by most to be unnecessary over-doing-it for the money - since 1926.  Interestingly it's the Jewish surgeons, like Dr. Michael Sarr, who like & popularize this surgery - the main problem being that the surgery does not 'treat' the abdominal nerve inflammation - they make the anatomy & pain worse.  A procedure is ok if it doesn anything for the problem - which neurectomies don't.  Kapeesh?
These abdominal neurectomies are surgeries that guarantee life-long pain problems, and a need for multiple surgical revisions - which the stupid surgeon wouldn't realize - or maybe they do, and don't care.  At least 2-4 more procedures will be needed to correct the abdominal wall deformity left by the Mayo Surgical Staff - the black student who couldn't hold a retractor or close except with spit, the intern who couldn't use a scalpel, and Dr. Sarr still coming awake from last night's wine-and-dine of whoever for the 'glory of the Mayo Clinic.'  No one doesn't drink on before-surgery night at Mayo Clinic.  This is a hierarchy of stupid medical students, uncaring residents, multi-tasking surgeons, and the clueless anesthesia guy/woman - top to bottom vacuum of stupidity.  
What's worse is that John Bundrick MD knows the reality of the situation - that neurectomy makes things worse & does not treat the nerve entrapment - and he hasn't informed Jill Beed-Smith in the Legal Department, or the Board of Trustees at Mayo Clinic of this.  
The trigger-point injection of the nerve serves two purposes: to relieve pain and to reduce herniation of the neurovascular bundle through the fibrous ring - the injection is the only treatment that has a POSSIBILITY of working: The Permanente Journal/ Summer 2002/ Volume 6 No. 3, WV Applegate.  So why would any Mayo Clinic surgeon EVER do a neurectomy?  And this won't be written as an Editorial Comment in The Mayo Clinic Proceedings for obvious reasons - they've hung up on the messenger(s).  Mayo Clinic makes too much money ripping out 'normal' abdominal nerves for the Pathology Department - they don't care about treatments, they care about money.  They don't care that neurectomies don't work - EVER.   Probably only 1 in 20, or 1 in 200 patients make it to the General Internal Medicine Service for a Carnett's test & trigger-point injection treatment - most are siphoned off to be instantly neurectomized by the General Surgery Services.  They are place on the Surgery Schedule as 'neuroma' - the surgery creates a neuroma - and there's no consent form.  And John B. Bundrick MD is responsible for this in 2013 - his 'code of silence,' his looking the other way.  
Neurectomy for this entity went out in 1926, with the publication of Carnett's original article: Carnett JB (1926) Intercostal neuralgia as a cause of abdominal pain and tenderness. J. Surg. Gynecol. Obstet. 42:625-632.  Why the medical insurances are still wanting to pay for this procedure is a true enigma - why would anyone want to pay for a surgery that doesn't work - that the literature has pegged as not working for 87 years?  No one at Mayo Clinic, except perhaps John Bundrick MD, reads the literature that he references.  So hire someone that does read the literature - that appears to be a Human Resources loophole at Mayo Clinic.  The Carnett's chip is cut out when the person is hired for Mayo Clinic.     
Clinical Pearls in Internal Medicine is a Mayo Clinic Proceedings article that probably most of Mayo Clinic anywhere hasn't read - because most staff at Mayo Clinic haven't a clue what a Carnett's test is (before or after 2011).  Neurectomy surgery is much more profitable, and fun for the learning curve of would-be surgeons.  This is a con, dupe, a fraud - that Dr. Bundrick is party to - the General Medicine Services haven't objected, and the number of neurectomies haven't decreased for the last 20 years.  Case #3 is the showcase version, the neurectomy surgery story is much darker.
Abdominal wall neurectomy at Mayo Clinic:  First the exam by the surgeon is succinct, no Carnett's test, and the patient is scheduled for next-day surgery to fill the vacant OR spots (just like Mengele did in Auschwitz to fill the crematoriums & gas chambers with the daily transports - no consent there either).  This is no US/MRI scan done as a prerequisite for surgery, no blood work is really needed (nothing like Dr. Bundrick's case study), and no medical consultation except with a FMG 'girl Friday' of Dr. Sarr's - who clears everything as she's on the phone with her kids & husband, and in-between doing her Board Review studying.  She's a plant - in the literal and real sense.
The Anesthesia Service never formally consults, and they haven't caught on that a trigger-point injection should be on the Surgical Checklist, and would be billable service for them - if they had a brain.  It's like the Yellow Brick Road at Mayo Clinic - going nowhere with staff minus something - the Carnett's chip - and no Wizard of Oz in sight - certainly not Dr. Bundrick. 
The surgery, Dr. Sarr lets a 3-month intern cut her surgical chops on the abdomen, the abdominal muscle fascias are cut to the periteum for the 'peritoneal peak,' and the nerve is removed in the nerve foramen without trying to inject to see if the pain is relieved - the patient is drugged by Anesthesia per Dr. Sarr's instructions - women patients don't get a consent option.  The muscle below the nerve is cut in a coup d'etat for another $100 to the charge.  There isn't a reason in hell for this last 'move.'  The muscle fascias are then closed with a deforming, painful, and mutilating for the abdominal wall muscles, closure: common mass closure.  To save the suture pack counts - it only takes one to sew everything together in a home ec mess of a seam.  Common mass closure on clothing would flunk you in Home Economics 101.  But no Mayo Clinic Surgeon ever really takes a sewing class.  
Common mass closures all rupture within 3-5- years, no one follows them past a day, and then the patient needs mesh as most procedures can't be repaired with an abdominal wall layered closure.  The patient in 1999, objected and asked that Mayo Clinic undo to a layered closure - the Mayo Clinic refused - this would have been possible right after the procedure - before the muscles 'melt' together.   
Jill Beed-Smith Esq. has no intention of authorizing any repairs, any settlements, or any sense - and has stated this over and over to women patients - who never consented - requesting undoing.  Still many of these closures could be repaired, but most surgeons outside of Mayo Clinic don't want to be blamed for the less-than-perfect abdominal wall outcome.  Mayo Clinic removes a nerve unnecessarily, without a trial of conservative medical management, and then does the worst closure ever conceived - a closure that the jury is still out on - an unproved closure except in the short-term.  Mayo Clinic Plastics needs to get on it: there a queue of patients waiting for a layered closure repair.      
Abdominal wall neurectomies at Mayo Clinic are unconsented for procedures - no women would consent in an informed way to this mutilation, no next of kin consents, and no patient is given the chance.  Per Jill Beed-Smith - it doesn't matter that Dr. Michael Sarr & the Surgical Services never got consent, and never discussed the options - this is Mayo Clinic.   
The General Medicine Service (John Bundrick MD), The Legal Department (Chief Counsel: Jill Beed-Smith Esq), The Editorial Staff of The Mayo Clinic Proceedings, and the State Medical Board of Minnesota are aware of the problem - but letting it continue - which is irresponsible, unethical, cruel, crazy, and a tragedy.  Dr. Michael Sarr, Chief of General Surgery, and his intern assistant, were reported to the State Medical Board of Minnesota in 1999 for doing this neurectomy procedure, without consent, on a woman patient (case #1) who never got to Medicine, never had a Carnett's test, and was never offered a trigger-point injection - she sent articles on this abdominal wall pain syndrome problem - and the correct treatment - to Dr. Sarr and was administratively bounced from the Mayo Clinic email system.  She requested a surgical revision of the closure - and was denied.  The neurectomy was done even knowing in 1999, that it was the wrong treatment and would not treat the condition.  It was for the money.  Other patients have requested repairs, revisions, and a change in the policy of Mayo Clinic to keep allowing a deforming procedure that does nothing to treat the problem.  
This neurectomy scam at Mayo Clinic needs to stop.  If the staff can't read about Carnett's on Wikipedia, they surely have access to John Bundrick MD and Mayo Clinic Proceedings - and they all have ipads and tweet pictures of neurectomy scars.									",Doctors

										John Bundrick MD - General Internal Medicine Mayo Rochester - publishes an excellent series in Mayo Clinic Proceedings on Clinical Pearls using case studies in Internal Medicine, Cardiology, Nephrology, etc.  But the problem comes when a physician, or patient, comes to Mayo Clinic with exactly the same symptoms and is mistreated - for whatever reason and tries to quote the Mayo Clinic Proceedings or the general medical, or surgical, literature and is mistreated.  
Physicians send patients to Mayo Clinic, and parents send familiy members, to get the treatments outlined in The Mayo Clinic Proceedings - treatments that are on the Boards of Internal Medicine or Surgery.  Dr. Sarr - Chief of General Surgery and a national fixture on the General Surgery lecture circuit - never learned about ACNES & Carnett's test - but the problem comes in that he mistreated probably hundreds to thousands of patients with this problem in the last 20-30 years, and tried to sue one for defamation, when she tried to tell him about Carnett's test.  And when you try to bring him the literature, say time-out for thought - he presses on to fill his surgery schedule.  It's all about the money - and the glory of Mayo Clinic.  Why don't Mayo Clinic surgeons know what Carnett's test is - it's in all the Family Practice literature & reviews - Reviews that Mayo Clinic writes.  
Such a problem happens with the chronic abdominal wall pain problem, case no 3, Mayo Clinic Proceedings January 2011.  There a are a number of patients who came to Mayo Clinic in the last 20 years, and were mistreated because the first physician they saw at Mayo Clinic was not Dr. Bundrick, or any physician with a brain and ability to talk to a professional patient questioning about other options, nerve injections, anesthesia consult.  The Mayo Clinic Proceedings knows about the patients who didn't get that treatment - that something 'else' needs to be published.  
None of the residents, interns or students at Mayo appear to read The Mayo Clinic Proceedings or attend Dr. Bundrick's talks.  And many of the Staff don't - but there is no excuse for the Chiefs of Surgery at Mayo Clinic who manage chronic abdominal wall pain DAILY & HOURLY to not know about Carnett's test - and when a woman MD objects they put her under an anesthesia that she did not consent to, neurectomize her - multilate, make things worse - and she never consented - she just wasn't Dr. Bundrick.  She wasn't a GUY - so she was a JOKE - only the men take the men seriously at Mayo Clinic.  
There's no excuse for a 3-month intern operating on a MD patient who had more Surgery training than 3 months also - Dr. Sarr should do the procedures, or think about the procedures, with MD patients.  But he's a jerk, and Jill Beed-Smith hates women MDs and likes them cut up - in shreds - unrecognizeable tissue when those Mayo interns get through.  
What are these neurectomy patients to do? and who will repair the deformities, the long-standing nerve problems (removing the nerve makes this worse = in the literature since 1926), the skin atrophy, the muscle damage?  That needs to go in a Comment in The Mayo Clinic Proceedings.  These neurectomies were done by 3-month interns while Dr. Sarr was socializing, or drinking, or doing whatever he does to mismanage & mistreat.  These interns didn't have a clue about Carnett's test - so what were they doing in the OR besides taking up space?
Jill Smith Esq likes women to be multilated and damaged - it what she does - she allows that the Dr. Sarr & his Surgery Service operate without consent on women patients.  The problem with the mistreatment of women patients starts in the Legal Department - where they hang up, refuse to undo the procedure, and just behave like in high school.  Mean girls.  Is Jill Beed-Smith even into high school behaviors - hanging up on another girl is really grade school or kindergarten. 
The General Surgery Service, at all the Mayo Clinics, will see a good proportion of these abdominal wall pain patients - and without labs, workup, Carnett's test, or reassurance - schedule a surgery - where they do whatever they want to the patient ie grope (breasts, vaginas UA), scare, bring in useless students to TWEET.  The woman is put under anesthesia so that she can't identify the source of pain - she's assaulted without consent.  To do anything to a woman patient without consent is ASSAULT - touching, cutting, taking nerves out, cutting muscles, putting an airway in.  There has to be CONSENT - and you should not have to say it 20 times. 
This is malpractice - as the treatment is as John Bundrick MD describes - since 1926, not since 2011 or before.   And this problem, and the correct treatment, has been in the Surgery literature since 1926 - not the Medicine - the SURGERY Journals.  Surgeons at all the Mayo Clinics have huge staff, huge libraries, and are supposed to know how to diagnose and treat the MOST COMMON CAUSE OF ABDOMINAL WALL PAIN.  They are supposed to read, discuss, and be ethical, decent human beings.  And the interns don't know ETHICAL, or CONFIDENTIAL (FACEBOOK is where the surgery pictures show up), so that a MD patient is a Chief of Surgery case - to make the diagnosis correctly and not for the woman patient to choose an intern, resident.  MD patients are to be handled by the staff - every touch - not the smelly residents.    
There's no excuse for Mayo Clinic to cut the nerves out of women patients with common mass closures that rupture after 3-5 years.  Cut the nerves out of Warner Oldenburg - he won't consent either, but that doesn't matter.  The Legal Department has been asked that Dr. Sarr's associates - not Dr. Sarr - undo all these unnecessary neurectomy procedures at Mayo Clinic expense - 15+ years ago.  This should have been arranged long before 2011 or 2013.  
Jill Beed-Smith has no plans to undo.  So John Bundrick you are a farce - what's in case 3 is not REALLY what happens at Mayo Clinic - and Mayo Clinic doesn't really care - what really happens is that the nerves are removed with a butcher surgery - not even scopes as that is too much effort for Dr. Sarr - won't make his cocktails or his next flight out.   Many women patients get neurectomized to humiliate them, see them naked, and to mutilate them for their parents - Dr. Mengele stuff - Jewish surgeons like Dr. Sarr getting back.  The parents questioning Dr. Sarr are just sad - Dr. Sarr will tell them that he IS Mayo Clinic.  And the women patients come to Mayo Clinic just for consultations - not the knives - he knew that he should not be scheduling a surgery without givine her time for informed consent.  Informed consent takes at least 24 hours.  But many Mayo Clinic MDs know only how to mistreat women - how to rush things. 
Women patients who are going to be put under anesthesia - a family member needs to be present.  And when you say this to Dr. Sarr, he will put you under anesthesia without allowing a chance for the familiy to come - or without talking with the family - he destroys, mutilates, and neurectomizes normal nerves.  And you ask for local or another time - Dr. Sarr lies.   There isn't a lie that Dr. Bundrick, Dr. Sarr, The Mayo Clinic Proceedings, or Jill Beed-Smith can't tell.  They blame you for their mistakes, when you tried to question, tried to insist, even sent them the articles on Carnett's test.  The procedures need to be repaired - all muscles and nerves - at Mayo Clinic expense - those Plastic Surgeons who can't recognize ACNES.   
Dr. Michael Sarr mistreats this problem daily - and has for 20 years.  The Mayo Clinic Legal Department, The Mayo Clinic Proceedings, and the Medical Board of MN know about the problem - no one has stopped the out-of-date neurectomy procedurs in the last 20 years.  Dr. Bundrick needs to publish about the mistreatment of these cases that go on at Mayo Clinic - how many got surgery, what were the complications, and what are these patients to do with the chronic abdominal wall pain?  The neurectomy only  makes things worse - what all the articles say.
Just no one reads those articles at Mayo Clinic - certainly not Jill Beed-Smith - she's into sex with her new husband.
Somehow special surgical clearances are arranged for these mostly women patients, so that they don't see anyone on the General Medicine Service - Dr. Sarr has a special FMG woman who has her mind on her kids, her Boards, her husband, and her special Mont Blanc pen.  Guys would punch Dr. Sarr out if he cut the muscles up.  
Jill Beed-Smith will cover up - that Dr. Sarr can do anything he wants to women patients without consent, without their parents consent, and the symptoms are the same as described in case #3.  The mutilation of women patients = the mission of Mayo Clinic.  The women protest and are attempted to be sued by Dr. Sarr.  
More money & time is spent with lawyers than was ever spent on the woman patient's care at Mayo Clinic - that is the problem.  Dr. Bundrick you need to mention that Dr. Sarr cuts many of the abdominal pain women up - mercilessly - and what will the next chronic abdominal wall pain patient to come to Mayo Clinic get: the injection or the scalpel of a 3-month disaster of an intern.  You should at least check that the surgical interns can cut a cadaver's skin (or cut a dog in the dog labs) before you unleash them on women patients.  Dr. Sarr is a mutilation surgeon - no one has seen worse incisions, subcu closures, and decisions.  The common mass closures all rupture, and the nerve was not to be removed.  Where the surgical checklist?  
The Mayo Clinic needs to admit the error(s), and repair every woman patient that they mistreated with an unnecessary neurectomy - they need to pay for the nerve they removed without consent = $500,000/nerve would stop the misdiagnosis and mistreatment.  The treatment hasn't changed, it is just that no one on the Surgery Service reads or consults - since 1926 apparently.  The Mayo Clinic Proceedings knows that case #3 treatment is rare at Mayo - most patients are misdiagnosed & mistreated badly.  
The Mayo Clinic Proceedings needs to publish what the neurectomy patients should do.  Whether the Surgery Service is still doing this ghoulish procedure - neurectomies went out in 1926 - not 1998, not 2011.  And how many neurectomies were done 1990-2013?    
Patients, and physicians, do not want to come to Mayo Clinic for substandard care that the Surgery Service does because Dr. Michael Sarr is not thinking, not in the room, doesn't do the workup, or doesn't talk with Dr. John Bundrick.  Why can't a woman physician get the care in case #3, with some reassurance.  Where is the teamwork? 
One woman MD was attempted to be sued by Dr. Sarr for defaming him that the treatment was not a neurectomy of a normal nerve.  Neurectomies went out probably before WWII.  And certainly before you do a procedure with any removal(s), you have to have patient - or next of kin - consent.  Even for a physician patient.  CONSENT.
Perhaps Dr. Warner Andrew Oldenburg can get his normal abdominal nerves removed (Vascular Surgery Jacksonville Mayo Clinic) - like he goes along with having done to his Medical School classmates for no reason?  The get-back has gone too far.  Perhaps Dr. Sarr's daughter would like her abdominal nerves removed, or his RN wife?  It's a procedure done to women, but you couldn't get away doing it to a black woman or Oprah.      
This procedure would have been stopped long ago if it had been done to a Mayo Clinic staff, faculty or family member.  But the Mayo Clinic should not be doing care that is not able to be published, or care that they would not do on themselves, care that contradicts the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, and certainly not care without a proper workup & consultation with the Medical Service (which takes more than 24 hours).  That Dr. Sarr would not routinely do a Carnett's test - why is he Chief of Surgery?  The woman MD who he tried to sue just tried to tell him exactly what Dr. Bundrick published.  Why isn't that woman MD on Mayo Clinic Staff - she at least reads the Mayo Clinic literature.  Next time treat her correctly and offer her a job - let her keep her nerves & abdomina wall intact.  
Some apologies are in order, some repairs by the Plastic Servce at Mayo, and some resignings if Staff do not read the Mayo Clinic Proceedings.  
Will patients coming to Mayo Clinic get their abdominal nerves removed, or an injection and reassurance?  The Mayo Clinic Proceedings needs to publish a retraction about case #3 - that's not what happens, and to advise what the patients who got neurectomies without consent should do.  Jill Beed-Smith knows that these patients should have been offered repairs years ago.  That needs to be in The Mayo Clinic Proceedings - the mistakes of Mayo Clinic and how they handle them. 									",Doctors

										It's all well and good that the Mayo Clinic publishes eloquent Clinical Pearls in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings - but that is not how many of the cases are really managed.
There is one particular disagreement between the Surgery Services & the General Medical Services about the treatment of chronic abdominal wall pain due to inflamed abdominal nerves.  The Surgery Service, with no literature to back up this approach, takes women to surgery and does neurectomies, and General Medical Service does a workup, Carnett's test & an injection.  
Jill Beed-Smith defends the Surgery Service doing any multilations, neurectomies, and closures that they want - for the money.  But the patients are caught in the cross-fire, some with abdominal procedures that they did not consent to - or ever want.  Procedures that Mayo Clinic has refused to undo.  Dr. Sarr will even sue the patients for defamation if they challenge his approach - which is not the same as that in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings to say the least.  Dr. Sarr's approach could not be published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, but that didn't stop him from inflicting it on patients.  . 
Patients have the 'right' to know all the options, and the most common & 'tried out' procedure or paradigm.  In this case, Dr. Bundrick wins.  And they have a right to challenge any procedure that will be deforming, involve removal of anything, and not improve the pain - Dr. Sarr's approach.
The dilemma has been reported to the Minnesota Medical Board for resolution - because patients on Surgery cannot continue getting neurectomies for no reason.  
But it behooves everyone to remember that patients get caught in these ego battles, in these surgeries without a purpose, and do not do well.  
Someone at Mayo Clinic should resolve this situation, and offer all women patients who have asked for a repair, a repair at Mayo Clinic's cost.  Mayo can't publish the case studies of the women patients that they removed nerves from - they would be laughed at, ridiculed, and cast in the light of female mutilators.  So surely there are surgeons at Mayo Clinic who would repair?  
No one asked Dr. Sarr to do neurectomies for inflamed abdominal nerves.  The literature has been clear since 1926, so why the neurectomies for the last 20 years? 									",Doctors

										Dr. Thomas Stellato terrorized medical students in the 1970s at University Hospitals - calling them names 'Scottie Dog,' or just screaming at a student/resident when he didn't get his way - which was every day.  But this has carried into 2013, where he is the Medical Director at University Suburban Green Road Medical Center - Director of Wright Surgery Center.  
In the 1990s, as Chief of General Surgery, at University Hospitals, Dr. Stellato was almost kind at times - but only if you contributed to his career.
Consulting him in the 1998, things became surgery or go away.  In fact Dr. Stellato can't diagnose abdominal wall pain - that he causes - and treat with an injection of 2% lidocaine.  He doesn't know Carnett's test, and doesn't try to properly treat abdominal wall pain before scheduling for surgeries.  He's the Medical Director who knows nothing medical, and does nothing medical.  
He will get rid of you, or call the South Euclid Police.  Carol, his secretary, does nothing secretarial.  
Dr. Stellato should be able to diagnose superficial abdominal wall pain, and either refer or inject the inflamed nerves.  Dr. Stellato should be able to repair an abdominal wall closure in layers - and teach this - instead of the common mass closure.  Stats show that the common mass closure all rupture.  Which is scary for a woman patient - to have her abdominal wall rupturing because of guy suturing.  Common mass closure closes all 3 layers of the abdominal wall in one messy gob that doesn't have any tension strength.   
Could Dr. Stellato get a heart at 64?  Or even just read the articles dropped at his office that detail the nonsurgical approaches?  Michael Rosen MD has given him a challenge - to repair an abdominal wall closure that Mayo Clinic botched.",Doctors

										Women legislators in the Ohio House in 2013 are wearing red jackets for women's heart disease - wonderful - there IS a problem with the misdiagnosis of heart disease, and everything else, with women patients in Ohio.  Thyroid disease is misdiagnosed & mistreated - what color jacket is that - green maybe or yellow?  Osteoporosis & vitamin D deficiency is missed - that's another color - purple or orange maybe?  The guys won't order bone density tests causing osteopenia - what jacket color is that - brown or full metal?  Every possible Crayola color has a disease that is missed on women patients in Ohio - where Medicine is not for women.  And we are talking about the 120 colors box - there are at least 120 medical problems, diagnoses of women, mismanaged in Ohio.  The Crayola tragedy.
Maybe it should be the Rainbow Coalition of jackets for the women State Representatives in the 130th Assembly?  But it won't solve the problems, the missed diagnoses, the heart disease rx'd with stents that clot in women, the thyroiditis that goes to cancer, the lives & careers of women MDs wasted fighting a corrupt Medical Board for their medical licenses.  
One false medical license suspension case has gone on for 20 years - that woman's case is in Representative Anielski's district - and she knows nothing about the Ohio State Medical Board - per her Legislative Aide Hallie - who seems competent, but just not on the right page.  How long will it take Hallie to get the message?  Representative Anielski knew nothing about her son's problems either - and that didn't end well.  But there are other tragedies that go with the State Representatives office in the 6th District - and they will require some intuition, some insight, some epiphanies, and some intelligence to solve.  We are all sorry about your son Representative Anielski, but women MDs that might have been able to help did not have a medical license -- how many women MDs in the 6th District have their medical licenses suspended for making too much of bad care -- more than 1 for sure.  Your son needed the 'right' physician, and didn't find that person - but I'm sure his MD was a guy.   
Check with Tom Patton's office - he didn't graduate from Cleveland State and knows no medical terminology - but he's gotten the message that there is something 'wrong' at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  But it's all 'confidential.'  So no one is able to impeach the State Medical Board, get a Financial Report from the Board, or understand the Medical Board decisions & stats - and Governor Kasich is well aware of what is going on, and he's letting it continue.  It would cost too much to rehabilitate the women MDs alone, re-entry is not an objective - they are disposable.  But other states could use them if these women MDs could be given their Ohio licenses to resign, and the complaints for other states to make a decision on.  No state, except Ohio, takes women MD's licenses for Dr. Nice.  Dr. Nice not 'getting it on the side' is not the concern of Rhode Island, Georgia, Alaska or Wyoming.  You are wasting careers in medicine that other states need & would pay Ohio for - make a business of it - sell the physician careers instead of the turnpikes & interstates.    
The problem is that women MD/DOs in Ohio aren't getting to the Cardiology Fellowships - or any Fellowships - aren't included in the EKG reading groups at their hospitals, and are getting their medical licenses suspended in ever-increasing numbers for 'confidential' complaints that have nothing to do with their patient care - confidential complaints where the males ganged up.  Males MDs have nothing better to do in Ohio - they aren't doing patient care.  No one knows what these complaints are really about - but jealousy, money & sex are a big part.  Representative Anielski is apparently not going to sit at coffee and hear this just yet - being newly elected.  The 'confidential complaints are phrased as personality disorders; wrong personality for Ohio male MDs basically. And since their wives also have the 'wrong personality' to 'understand' these guys - this is not a case for medical license suspension or discipline. 
With these false Medical Board complaints - Ohio is an undisputed #1 - and the Medical Board has no money because of this mismanagement.  Physician dues in Ohio are supposed to increase this year, and spiral upward.  At the State Medical Board in Ohio, the complaints have no statutes of limitation, no rules of evidence, can be signed by MDs who don't even know the woman MD, and the cases can go on for decades - unless the woman MD conveniently commits suicide - which she is encouraged to do by her peers who will not help her with medical care.  
Money is not option for Ohio - going after women MDs is in the budget.  Cases against women MDs typically run to $500,000 state costs/case - as the women MDs are usually innocent, and can't lie well enough to get their licenses back and end things quickly.  The case workers, the State Reps & Senators, all tell you to lie to get back to doing the 'good' care that you were doing before.  So what was the case about?  
There are estimated to be hundreds, to thousands, of false cases of physician licensure, suspension or discipline, in the last 20 years in Ohio - more than any other state or several states combined.  And we don't have the worst MDs in the country in Ohio - we just have enough women MDs to inflate the numbers.  Women are disciplined for not going along, not doing the casual sex or favors, for not referring enough surgeries to the men, and for existing - it's not about their patient care.  
Women MDs, whose licenses are falsely suspended, can't get medical care in Ohio until they admit the Medical Board's case - and when the State Medical Board has no case - or keeps looking for a new case every year or so, when the last 'case' doesn't pan out and can't be dismissed - that's a long time; 20 years in one case.  20 years loss of a physician's life - no other state suspends a medical license for 20 years - MDs are working in other states before that (no matter the charge).  
In Ohio that is a long time for no blood work, no fracture care, no gyn care - and forget the obstetrics.  Women MDs, who have their licenses falsely suspended, can't get pregnant, can't have a child - they are 'sterilized' by the process that never ends at the Medical Board - the process to prove that women MDs/DOs don't have what what it takes and can be the tokens for the Ohio stats.
And what it takes to measure up - sex with colleagues, the right referrals, and to cover for the boys.  The women MDs don't get chance to have a child who might commit suicide from the threats - they just get trashed - left to hemorrhage out with no ob-gyn care.  The one woman hemorrhaged out in NYC at Columbia-Presbyterian, after 5 years of no ob-gyn care allowed - she was sterilzed by neglect of care with several ob-gyns on the State Medical Board of Ohio.  The Medical Board of Ohio refused to allow her to get medical consultation & care.   
Women MDs get their medical licenses suspended usually in their 30s - when they are the most desireable for casual sex with colleagues, when they are trying to get married and have a token child or two, and when they are healthwise most vulnerable to the problems that neglect of their general health during residency caused.  Residency training is not healthy for women MDs - the food is bad, the hours play all sorts of games with hormones, and the harassments eat into any self-confidence remaining from Ohio Medical Schools.
Women MDs start fracturing in their 30s (all that bad food in residency & the hours which played havoc with estradiol & FSH levels), have early breast cancers, are all vitamin D deficient if anyone bothers to check, and women MDs are just worn out with male harassments by the time they are through training.  Even moreso than women DOs, women MDs are targeted for abuse - there are no harassment provisions that the Ohio State Medical Board enforces.  
So the women MDs get 'sick' in their 30s, are medically mistreated or given ultimatums for sex with certain more powerful males for the care, they try to get married in their 30s, but they aren't allowed decent health care before their licenses are taken.  Women MDs do not deserve blood work in Ohio, are not allowed care-to-function, and are just part of the #1 Medical Board's 'reign of terror' because they can't fight back without knowing the complaint or having money - and most are heavily mortgaged by the student loans.  When they complaint, the woman MD's complaint is made public against state laws, so that the males (the boys) can countercomplain - and the countercomplaint is 'confidential' and can be perpetually changed for the life of the woman MD.  It's a pre-fixed kangaroo court that is outside of Ohio courts except that the Ohio Court of Appeals can temporarily throw out a case, but it gets remanded to the Ohio State Medical Board and recycled.
Ohio is #1 for suspensions & disciplines of physicians in the nation - per 1000 physicians licensed - and the women are more suspended than the men because they can't fight confidential complaints where the subtext is sex, or the resolution of the complaint means admitting a psychiatric diagnosis that the woman MD has no criteria for.  And the State Representative Offices can get the 'confidential' complaints - but they won't.  Has Representative Anielski any thoughts - or is suicide the only answer - like for her son?  Certainly no one is helping the women MDs falsely accused by the State Medical Borad of Ohio - just as no one helped her son.  And she's clueless on both accounts.
Apparently Representative Marlene Anielski thinks that women MDs will commit suicide, to cover the mistakes of the Ohio Medical Board, like her son to cover problems at St. Ignatius & home.  And some of the falsely suspended women MDs have been watched for suicide - because their lives, their chance at a family, their childbearing years - are all taken for sport - to make an example of them - that you do what Dr. Nice says.  To make the woman MD a poster child for 'sleeping with Dr. Nice.'  To this day, Dr. Nice can get any Ohio women MDs license taken so that she will never practice medicine again - in Ohio - or anywhere else.  Tim Nice is not on the State Medical Board, but he has 'friends' there that will lie, cheat, and kill for him.  Representative Anielski's office admits that she knows nothing about what goes on at the State Medical Board of Ohio - the women Representatives don't, but the men do - Budish, Patton - the friends of Dr. Nice know what is going on.  
Red jackets are not the answer - cancelling coffee is not the answer.  Secret files at the Medical Board for Dr. Nice - where he gets to 'hit on' the woman MD, and then leave her fractures uncasted when she says 'No' - are not the answer.  The Catholic parish priests involved - Fr James Caddy & Fr Bob Kriege - know about it - but they are following the same code of silence as they did for diocesan abuse - wait until the woman commits suicide and extol her in eulogies.  
Women MDs are 'hit on' for sexual favors, and women MDs in Ohio can't do a thing about it - except - accept it with aequanimitas - which just makes the abuse worse.  Coffee is not going to fix this mess, but it might be a start - but only if Representative Anielski finds the time - and she won't - as she didn't for her son.  Her son wandered into a park in despair, and if only in his name, an end to the abuse of women MDs needs to start.  One almost wants to commit suicide when you can't get fractures casted, can't get appropriate blood work or treatments, can't have a child, can't get ob-gyn care, and can't get anyone to listen - but then you are Catholic and that means you have to watch your body mistreated, your mind wasted, and your life lost.    									",Doctors

Bundrick MD publishes Clinical Pearls in General Internal Medicine yet in on the 'take' for every case of chronic abdominal wall pain that Dr. Sarr takes to surgery to rip apart the muscles & remove the normal ne Rochester, Minnesota","
										Dr. Bundrick publishes Clinical Pearls in Internal Medicine Series in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, and runs this segment of the American College of Physicians Meetings.  Yet he looks the other way for the Mayo Clinic General Surgery service misdiagnosing, mistreating and causing deformities of the abdominal wall especially in women patients.  
Hundreds of cases of this - which he never discusses.  The stats are in the Mayo Clinic surgical files under 'neuroma.'  The abdominal nerves are removed and sent to Pathology - and never get to the General Internal Medicine Service for injection or reassurance - they are cut up.  Dr. Bundrick has been told of cases - and never reviews them for Mayo Clinic Proceedings.  The patients undergo unnecessary NEURECTOMIES - without any medical pre-treatment, labs or workup.  Usually these neurectomies have to be treated on Medicine - at least at every other hospital, clinic, and office outside of Mayo Clinic.  The Surgery Services at Mayo Clinic do not do Carnett's test - they find an open spot in tomorrow's surgical cases - an empty OR. 
The Legal Department covers it all up.  Surgeons at Mayo Clinic are allowed to do procedures on women patients without consent or discussion - there's no patient consent involved in these neurectomies.  Dr. Bundrick knows this - has been given patient files to check - and says nothing.  
This has been going on for at least 15-20 years - even though the correct treatment has been known in the Surgical literature since 1926.  Dr. Michael Sarr has a whole list of 'neurectomy' procedures - he can do anything you want to abdominal wall nerves - and Dr. Bundrick knows this. Dr. Bundrick knows women professionals that this has been done to - he has their charts but won't publish the cases in Mayo Clinic Proceedings - he needs to publish a case wrongly surgerized - and the Legal battles that ensue where Dr. Sarr tries to sue the women for defamation of character.  There are at least 10 superficial abdominal nerves accessible to the General Surgeon -- some of them get into trouble with the laparoscopy hernia repairs, others get removed by the General Surgery Service for chronic abdominal wall pain.  Dr. Bundrick has done NOTHING to stop this.  
Women patients coming to Mayo Clinic are quickly sent to surgery where all abdominal muscles are 'cut,' and the normal nerves removed - Jill Beed-Smith in Legal covers this up.  Dr. Sarr can't 'feel' a swollen nerve in a nerve foramen and inject directly before he removes the nerve - he feels the cash.  The patients are put under anesthesia that they don't consent to - have no anesthesia consult for.  Physician parents call upset and are lied to.
The women patients, don't consent, the procedure is never discussed - it's called a 'neuroma.'  Check Dr. Sarr's surgical records & cases over the last 15 years - probably hundreds of patients (female>male) have been 'butchered' this way.  No one reads the Clinical Pearls in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings except the patients who come home butchered - not the Mayo Clinic physicians.  These cases are never injected, Carnett's maneuver is never done or on the chart, and no one cares - it's all for the money.  Examine some of those abdominal walls - even after multiple plastic surgeries they are painful.
Women patients have asked for repair of this - and written to Dr. Bundrick - and nothing has been done.  The muscles need to be repaired in layers, and Mayo Clinic needs to compensate monetarily for all normal nerves removed.  And the charts say 'normal' nerves on the Pathology Reports.  Someone needs to ask Dr. Bundrick about this at the American College of Physician Meetings.
Dr. Michael Sarr, Dr. Andrew Oldenburg - all the surgeons at Mayo Clinic facilities in AZ, FL and MN - are doing this for chronic abdominal wall pain or adding it to vascular & other procedures.  It's a con - and all the vascular surgeons defend Dr. Sarr's butcher jobs on women patients - for the interns & students to learn from.  Dr. Sarr brings in 3-month interns and black medical students who can't sew, cut or hold instruments - it's a brutal procedure that even the Anesthesiology Service then can't charge for - but Dr. Sarr charges for this.  In other words, after these procedures, everyone gets a conscience except Dr. Michael Sarr - he still bills even though the other surgeons tell him not to.  Surgeons outside of Mayo Clinic have taken him to task, but no one internally at Mayo Clinic.  
Yet Dr. Bundrick publishes about the one case: This case is classic for chronic abdominal wall pain, an entity first described by the British surgeon J. B. Carnett in 1926. He described the maneuver whereby the tender spot is located and then patients are asked to raise either their legs or torso (thus tensing the abdominal muscles). If the pain does not decrease (and especially if it increases) during the maneuver, then it is very unlikely to be from a visceral source and may reliably be localized to the abdominal wall muscles. False-positive Carnett maneuvers occur infrequently (<5% or so), almost always in the setting of acute appendicitis (due to irritation of the adjacent parietal peritoneum). Chronic abdominal wall pain is typically described by the patient as being constant in nature and may worsen slightly after eating (abdominal distention) or more commonly after a bowel movement (from straining of the abdominal muscles). Obesity and depression are common comorbid conditions, as are fibromyalgia and other painful conditions.
However, NO ONE gets past the surgeons to the General Medical Service for this - except the 'token' patient in the case study.  The Plastics Service refers these cases to Dr. Michael Sarr - not Medicine - and they are 'surgerized' - the nerves are removed and can't ever be injected.  Yet Dr. Bundrick advises:  With a conservative approach, about 50% of patients will improve over several months of follow-up. Trigger point injections provide relief in about two-thirds of patients. In all cases, the diagnosis helps to provide reassurance, while avoiding unnecessary expense, testing, and confusion.
There's no reassurance by Dr. Michael Sarr - his students & residents - they cut creating all kinds of unnecessary expenses, testing, confusion and chronic pain.  The pain is worse after the neurectomy - which causes skin atrophy.  The cut muscles go into spasms, and rip apart with the common mass closure.  Dr. Bundrick never sees these cases, even after the neurectomy - even if the patients write to him.  
Dr. Bundrick has been in a unique position to stop the unnecessary surgeries, and to orchestrate repair procedures for those women unnecessarily traumatically surgerized -  yet he has done nothing except promote himself.  There's no reassurance after the fact, when you read Dr. Bundrick's article and then send it to Jill Beed-Smith in Legal at Mayo Clinic Rochester - she hangs up on you and 'doctors' the case in the computer - so you can't recognize what happened.  Stupid secretaries, and assistants, are left defending that the 'case is closed.'  
Dr. Sarr will cut every abdominal muscle, and cut out the nerve that Dr. Bundrick advises to inject with 2% lidocaine, and will close with a common mass closure deformity.  Dr. Sarr then creates a neuroma - a cut nerve that proliferates and enlarges causing pain.  Common mass closures all rupture after 3-5 years, and then the patient has to come back for mesh - which many women are allergic to.  It's a take, a hoax, and Dr. Bundrick is in on this as all Mayo physicians do 'teamwork.'  It's not one surgery, but a sequence of surgeries.  Women patients don't the options, they are gotten NAKED for abuse.  And women that question are really butchered - multiple plastic surgeries will be required as in one case.
How much does Dr. Bundrick get/woman patient stripped naked and cut apart?  Probably 20% of the $1500-$2000 surgeon's fee for the job.  Women say 'No muscles, No nerves,' and everything is cut.  The incisions are horrible - 3-month intern efforts.  And Dr. Bundrick knows about the take - cases have been referred to him after the fact and he says NOTHING.  Their files are sent to him - with Dr. Sarr's signature and redos of operative reports trying to justify.  Someone should cut up Dr. Bundrick's abdominal wall and remove a few anterior cutaneous nerves for fun.   									",Doctors

										John Bundrick MD has published Clinical Pearls in Internal Medicine in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, advocating Carnett maneuvers & 2% lidocaine injections for abdominal wall pain diagnosis.  Yet the Surgeons of Mayo Clinic - Jacksonville & Rochester - will not do this this.  They take women patients to surgery and tear up their abdominal walls removing 'neuromas.'  This is not ok.  The following is the discussion for Dr. Bundrick's case from Mayo Clinic Proceedings:
 
This case is classic for chronic abdominal wall pain, an entity first described by the British surgeon J. B. Carnett in 1926. He described the maneuver whereby the tender spot is located and then patients are asked to raise either their legs or torso (thus tensing the abdominal muscles). If the pain does not decrease (and especially if it increases) during the maneuver, then it is very unlikely to be from a visceral source and may reliably be localized to the abdominal wall muscles.False-positive Carnett maneuvers occur infrequently (<5% or so), almost always in the setting of acute appendicitis (due to irritation of the adjacent parietal peritoneum). Chronic abdominal wall pain is typically described by the patient as being constant in nature and may worsen slightly after eating (abdominal distention) or more commonly after a bowel movement (from straining of the abdominal muscles). Obesity and depression are common comorbid conditions, as are fibromyalgia and other painful conditions.
The Carnett maneuver is not only useful in diagnosis but is also helpful in educating and reassuring patients as to the true source of their pain. Local heat or ice treatments, sometimes accompanied by gentle stretching of the abdominal muscles, have been tried with variable success. With a conservative approach, about 50% of patients will improve over several months of follow-up. Trigger point injections provide relief in about two-thirds of patients. In all cases, the diagnosis helps to provide reassurance, while avoiding unnecessary expense, testing, and confusion.
In this case, the pain is too constant and prolonged to represent biliary colic, and the elevated ALT is compatible with fatty liver. The features are not compatible with gastroesophageal reflux, and upper endoscopy did not show any gastritis or ulceration, making it unlikely that a trial of a proton pump inhibitor would be of benefit. The patient does not have atrial fibrillation and is far too young to have (and does not have the pattern to suggest) symptomatic atherosclerosis (the most common conditions associated with mesenteric ischemia).
Cases where the Mayo surgeons have removed nerves, and ripped muscles apart, have asked Mayo Clinic for repair.  The surgeons will cut all the layers of abdominal muscles and remove the nerve - leaving brutal deformities. Dr. Michael Sarr, Dr. Andrew Oldenburg, and others go along with this, refuse to repair the butcheries, or even consider a Mayo Medical consult before the surgery - they rush women to surgery and cut everything up.  When they can't find anything - as they forgot the Carnett's test - they remove normal nerves for pathology.  
Dr. Sarr many times can't get paid for this - and continues to do this with The Legal Department's approval ie Jill Beed-Smith oks this multilation of women patients.  Dr. Sarr, and probably Dr. Oldenburg, can do procedures to women patients without consent or discussion.  You can add neurectomies to appendectomies, vascular procedures - anything.  Mayo Clinic has no 'plan' to conserve abdominal wall nerves.  Whatever Dr. Bundrick publishes - that's not what happens at Mayo Clinic.  
Why are Mayo Clinic physicians unable to work together?  All women patients unnecessarily surgerized for money, need to undergo repairs at Mayo Clinic expense.  It's always the women as Mayo surgeons want them naked and to humiliate them.  
The surgeons leave common mass closure deformities which all rupture by 3-5 years - this allows Mayo Clinic surgeons to do another surgery procedure with mesh - and further deform women patients for money.  All while Dr. Bundrick publishes that his is not what happens at Mayo Clinic.  When has he last done Rounds with Dr. Sarr, or checked Dr. Sarr's operative log of cases.  There's piles of neurectomies, neuromas, and not a Carnett's test on the record. 									",Doctors

There is no external Review of cases at the State Medical Board of Ohio, or none that Tom Patton will order, and the Ohio Court of Appeals can't get the files to hear the cases.  The Executive Directors of the State Medical Board of Ohio are the most immature, jerky lawyers on the planet -  they have no ability to do a FINANCIAL REPORT, or job experience outside of going after physicians for nonsense.  Where has Richard Whitehouse Esq been hired since he resigned?  Can he get a job after putting so many physicians out-of-a-job for nothing more than saying 'No' to Dr. Nice.    
The Interim Director Kimberly Anderson, has run some of the most expensive, abusive, and personally vindictive evaluations on physicians ever imagined - dating histories are discussed in physician cases - do women have enough male experience to have medical licenses?  If the experiences mean sex, how can a woman keep a medical license in Ohio - the men are just unappealingly awful?  Currently there is no Executive Director - no one wants the job to clean up the mess.
Tom Patton attended Cleveland State - no one says that he graduated.  And if you speak with him only briefly, it's obvious that he has no grip on Medical anything - the date from hell in college.  Yet he is District 24's go-to-guy.  Can't even handle a woman MD for coffee.    
Women MDs are especially targeted by the present Ohio State Medical Board - for nothing more than objecting to the wrong care done to themselves, ie care that should not be going on anywhere.  The 'confidential' physician complaint system allows huge abuses.  But you can only get Tom Patton on the phone for 10 minutes, and then the 'burner' phone is dead-ended.  What is Tom Patton afraid of?  That he might learn something?  Can he even talk with a woman MD?  It's like an episode of television, without the entertainment value.

										University Hospitals Suburban Green Road are involved in a general hoax of abdominal wall pain neurectomies - where nerves become inflamed after abdominal wall procedures or sports injuries, overuse of abdominal wall muscles, etc.  The nerve becomes inflammed and is removed - now through an endoscope.  
General hoax to remove the anterior abdominal wall nerves, which Dr. Stellato should long ago have said & done something about this, as some of his surgeries have led to this problem and he just then 'calls the South Euclid Police to remove, or threaten, the patient.'  It's treated with an injection of 2% lidocaine, not neurectomy. Kaiser Hospitals/Clinics have written the papers on this problem, and have all the codes for the correct treatment.  One wonders what Dr. Stellato is being paid to not say anything, per each unnecessary neurectomy with common mass closure deformity.
Mayo Clinic takes the nerves out and uses a common mass closure technique to close.  This 'technique' is also used to close all portholes from endoscopic procedures.  These common mass closures leave abdominal wall deformities that all rupture after 3-5 years.  This leads to a mesh repair procedure = more business for Dr. Michale Rosen and company in the UH Hernia Center.  It's an unending sequence of a farce of surgeries for nothing, with Dr. Stellato refusing to develop a layered repair procedure in at least select patients.  This would led to a Surgical Chair given the scope of the problem, the scope of the endoscopic procedure problems.  
Thomas Stellato MD, Medical Director, is a former Chief of General Surgery at University Hospitals.  He has known of the problem - that Mayo Clinic and other places will unnecessarily remove abdominal nerves, do unnecessary procedures & closures for resident practice - and he has said nothing.  At Mayo Clinic you can get this 'neurectomy' tacked onto your general bill; they don't have to have patient consent or discuss.  At University Green Road Dr. Stellato should have set up a program to (1) provide correct diagnosis, (2) provide correct non-surgical treatment, and (3) repair any procedures for unnecessary neurectomy.  
Dr. Michael Rosen, UH Hernia Center, knows of the problem, and has sent cases back to Dr. Stellato for repairs.  Dr. Rosen, internationally known for hernia surgeries, can also tack this procedure onto his bills - and has not said anything about condemning it.  He doesn't like Dr. Michael Sarr at Mayo Clinic, but does nothing to stop his frauds.  But he has looked to Dr. Stellato for repair advice as a more senior surgeon experienced in layered abdominal wall repairs - and none has been given although patients have requested the repair.
University Green Suburban needs to have Dr. Stellato set up a program for anterior abdominal cutaneous nerve surgery repairs, and to stop the unnecessary neurectomizing of abdominal nerves for Mayo Clinic building funds.",Doctors

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",http://www.ohiosenate.gov/patton,(614) 466-8056,"Ohio State Legislature - 130th General Assembly State Senator Tom Patton - District 24 sitting on hundreds of false licensure suspensions & disciplines of Ohio physicians with no patient complaints, lists of innocent physicians, women MDs ordered to serial psychiatric evaluations to fin Columbus, Ohio","
										Senator Tom Patton, and other Legislators of the 130th General Assembly, are sitting on hundreds of false licensure suspensions & disciplines of Ohio-trained physicians with no patient complaints.  These false physician disciplines are known at every other State Medical Board - where the physician specialties are needed, but the other State Medical Boards can't the real files to license the physicians by endorsement, or in spite of Ohio actions.  Georgia wants some of these physicians to work in rural areas - but Tom Patton can't speak to the Georgia Medical Board.
Speakers of the Ohio House have admitted the problem starting with Larry Householder.  Husted and Budish sat on the problem to preserve their personal legacies - Householder just called it, but said that reforms would bankrupt Ohio and paralyze Columbus with legitimate legal actions & sanctions for Ohio Administrative frauds.  Householder didn't say that the false disciplines & suspensions were not true - his office admitted the problem that had a huge scope and price tag to fix.  Ohio is the only state that takes medical licenses for 20 years for objecting to admittedly 'bad' care - care that shouldn't be going on in Ohio is sanctioned in Ohio.  There is no re-entry plan for these physicians.      These physicians lose their careers, and are unable to get adequate health care until they admit the Medical Board's case.  These physicians just didn't go along with false medical charging, wrong surgeries, unnecessary orthopedic fractures, referrals to 'right' physicians, or personal favors for privileges & hospital appointments.  The problem: most legislators don't understand things medical or what goes on at the State Medical Board of Ohio - they are worse naive than women physicians about the requirements for licensure renewals in Ohio (refer to the 'right' physicians, personal favors for the 'right' physicians, and lie to get your license returned).  The State Medical Board of Ohio gives 'points,' and favors (immunity to investigation), to physicians withholding medical care - so don't get pregnant and lose your medical license in Ohio.  There's no blood work allowed for women physicians who are ordered to serial psychiatric evaluations, by state experts at state expense, to 'find a case' for decades.  
This goes on in no other state.  All other states allow care-to-function before any licensure actions or investigations.  Tom Patton knows of one woman MD in his district who hasn't gotten a complete set of blood work in 20 years - because it would show the missed diagnosis that is millions of dollars in damages.  So he sits on the 'pot' in his office, pretending the fairytale - like 'Once Upon A Time.'  Tom Patton's daughters probably get their blood work, because you need this blood work to sustain a pregnancy, but his cop son & the woman physician didn't.  
With someone dying of a cardiac event on the job at 30 - there's something missing on the job physical - where was bystander CPR?  Does Tom Patton have a clue?  Or is he just content with online obituaries after 30 years of helping his son grow-up?  Parents of women MDs in Ohio are upset, because they see the fraud even if Tom Patton doesn't.  Parent-to-parent there is a problem.  
The current Interim Director of the State Medical Board has been involved in these expensive & emotionally damaging serial psychiatric evaluations of women MDs, as part of investigations that go nowhere for 20 years - Kimberly Anderson Esq.  She's a serial psychiatric evaluation abuser.
A worse choice for Interim Director can't be found.  In Ohio the Medical Board knows your sex life, and dating history, as well as e-harmony.  It's used in the bargain equation.  Personal letters to orthopedics begging for care, and expressing disinterest in anything sexual with the orthopedics (who are married), are published to embarrass.  That a woman MD would have to spell things out this way is embarrassing.  She tried, and her parents tried, to spell things out to the orthopedics in multiple meetings - that consent was needed.    
Tom Patton, and other legislators, have access to the lists of probably 'innocent' physicians from the Tom Dilling and Richard Whitehouse eras - the past 2 Executive Directors of the State Medical Board of Ohio made such lists.  Getting transparency, or the fraud stopped, will need an outside Executive Director of the State Medical Board of Ohio - and they know this.  The lists have not been acted on or published - and taxpayers have a right to those lists as their taxes put those physicians on that innocent list.  Tom Patton didn't pay for the lists, and Governor Kasich surely didn't. 
The problem is the sexual & medical abuse of particularly women MDs falsely accused of 'personality' problems for not going along with fraud in patient care & in diagnosis.  The hospital staffs know of it, but physicians can't come forward with 'confidential' complaint systems - physician witnesses, for the falsely accused MD, will have 'confidential' complaints filed against them.  And this isn't Thailand.  Tom Patton knows of medical care abuses - his son was given a 'Pass' on a police physical where he should have been 'flunked.'  Tom Patton's wife is dead for years = medical care of women in Ohio.  Why continue this legacy with bad physicians, fraud complaints, and no improvements in medical care in Ohio?  Does Tom Patton have more that he would like to lose to the system?
Provisional suspensions allow that Ohio physicians lose their licenses without due process, without anyone checking the facts, without truth.  There is no statute of limitations, no rules of evidence, and no dismissal of false cases - they are just continued onto the next millennium.  The Ohio State Medical Board pays no damages for mistakes, false cases, destroyed careers, and the emotional damages lead to near suicides, or deaths, of physicians before their cases are resolved.  
Tom Patton needs to do better than sit in his office and serve as Vice Chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee - there's no road problem in Ohio - the turnpikes have no competition with any high-speed-rail system plan.  Parents of college students still have to drive to all Ohio Universities - Ohio short-sightedly rejected the funding to put Ohio on a par with Asian countries.  Maybe Tom Patton has an opinion on high-speed rail in Ohio, but it's not out there.  Keeping jobs in Ohio means being able to transport the talent to the job.  No one has money to move in this economy.  Maybe he needs a pair of Hilary Clinton glasses to see things 'perfectly clearly'?  
Ohio would have the money for high-speed rail if it wasn't in debt for false cases & investigations at the Ohio State Medical Board.  This is a tragedy of huge proportions as the taxpayers of Ohio paid to educate most of these physicians in part.  It's the American-educated physicians that get caught in this game, not the FMGs. 									",Doctors
St. Francis of Assisi Church Gates Mills,"  St. Francis of Assisi Church Gates Mills  6850 Mayfield Road 
Gates Mills, Ohio United States of America ",www.stfrancisgm.org/,(440) 461-0066 Parish,"St. Francis of Assisi Church Gates Mills Fr. James Caddy needs to tell the truth about a prominent MD parishioner lying to destroy the career of a woman MD who reported his neighbor Dr. Nice for abuse, harassments, and orthopedic negligences 20 years ago -  Gates Mills, Ohio","
										Sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church have documented the covering up of priest abuses, but these same types of scandals have been covered up at the State Medical Board of Ohio for the last 20 years - with the clergy knowing the gossip, the lies, and the sex.  Most often these inter-MD, or MD-patient abuses, involve a male MD in a position of power, and a female MD, adult patient or child, in a position of dependence.  The dependence is for hospital privileges, or medical care, but the dynamics are skewed to the personal needs of the male MD.  
Priests know about the hospital abuses as they staff the chaplain offices - at Hillcrest, Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals, etc.  And priests more than Protestant 'clergy,' would seem to be more sensitive to the issue, and more willing to report that sex scandals are not exclusive to the Catholic Church - but they aren't.  The clergy should be coming forward if only to point out that sex abuse is not exclusively patented by the Catholic Church - it goes on everywhere and the silence is everywhere - including Catholic parishes.  
At hospitals in Cleveland: Catholics do it to each other (the Rounds after Rounds), non-Catholic staff expect the Catholic MDs to go along with abuses of patients and cover the mistakes - medical & social.  But the priests are in a position to report abuses that put women & children, under medical or orthopedic care, in jeopardy - medical, physical, or emotional danger - for any period of time.  Fr. Caddy has such information, and needs to act on it, and to have a policy about it.  Abuse is never ok, no matter the mistakes, the money or the power grid involved.    
The Catholic clergy/parish priests are in a position in Cleveland to report the sex abuse problems, but not within their own ranks this time.  Most of these confidential abuses that the priests know of, are not confessional confidences - they are known freely within the parish & community - but not at the Medical Board in Columbus - where the powerful win. 
These abuses involve so-called Catholic male MDs lying about Catholic women MDs - for money, hospital privileges, or to cover up malpractice abuses & negligences.  But whether the sex abuse is within the ranks of the priesthood, or known about within the ranks of the priesthood, there is still the burden of truth and to protect the innocent - whether there is an adult or child involved.  The 'victim' always has less power, and will be put in danger until the abuse stops.  It's the 11th Commandment, keep your neighbor safe.  
St. Francis of Assisi is literally next door to Hillcrest Hospital, and the priests staff the hospital chaplain's office.  So they know of the problems, and who gets suspended from the Hospital Staff and for what.  But they mostly don't do anything to be witnesses to the truth in medical environments - they don't care that a woman MD is in danger morally, medically & physically being outside of medicine because of a pile of Dr. Botti lies.  
This woman has labels in public records that put her in continual danger from other professionals, dentists, etc. -  especially as she is lied about as 'seductive,' a personality disorder, and yet had no patient complaints.  It is rare that a MD with no patient complaints would have any kind of psychiatric disorder - they usually have a personality that the patients like.  But Dr. Botti lies led to this woman being evaluated 4 times for refusing Dr. Nice - 4 times for refusing to go along with bad care & negligences at Hillcrest Hospital.   
Sexual abuse - whether the victim is a woman MD on a hospital staff, or a child - is still wrong, no matter the victim - if the abuser has the power and money to donate to cover it.  There is always a burden of TRUTH for the onlooker.  The St. Francis parish school kids need to see that their Pastor tells the truth as much as he admonishes them to tell it - confession isn't just for the white lies of second graders.  
Currently Father Caddy is working on concealing a scandal - where he needs to tell the truth.  Fr. Caddy didn't created the scandal, but he let it continue, and placed the woman MD in continual danger from threats, bad medical care, colleague abuse, and lack of a decent job and income.  The woman MD deserved none of it.  What Dr. Botti didn't like was that she took it to a Hospital psychologist to document the problem - to get help for herself from physicians on staff thinking that the world is their prey - for the culture of medicine that victimizes the naive, the different, the women, the childlike, the idealistic, and the believing.  Having faith, you are most likely to be disappointed in medicine, and told that you should have seen it coming.   
Sex scandals are always caused by an imbalance of power, privilege, and naivete - with usually watchers letting things happen for whatever reason - it's a good show.  Even in the Catholic Church scandals, more than the priests were looking the other way - the laity looked the other way as long as it wasn't their children involved.  
MDs knew of the abuses and said nothing in the Cleveland area, or said something and Bishop Pilla did nothing.  But knowledge of abuse, means that the awareness has an onus - that you have to stop the abuse.  And granted most of us never auditioned for that difficult role, but we have to play it as best we can.    
It's abuse to not cast a fracture, to have someone come to a medical office where there is no cast material (for sport & games), and to imply that Catholic girls should be 'easy.'  Granted this was 20 years ago, but the joke still plays well.  Dr. Nice would invite this woman to his polo games, his parties, his office, to see his antique car collection, and the excuse was orthopedic care or a patient that he had her consult on - and everyone at Hillcrest knew the ruse, but this MD was new on staff.  Dr. Nice had a wife and 2 kids, then 3 kids - but he never grew up.
Dr. Botti, and present Mrs. Botti, knew the game being played and said nothing to stop things or inform the woman MD and her father - also a long-time St. Francis parishioner.  This was a dangerous situation 20 years ago for this woman MD, and remains so.  Her father was on staff and therefore could be counted on to be 'silent' for his privileges & medical license.  He eventually resigned, but his uptake on the situation was slow.  And Dr. Botti covered it up - for a price - he's living part-time in FL with a Gates Mills house with an oil well - he's done well for himself.  
Fr. James Caddy is currently hiding things for the blackmail of a regular parish Sunday collection - and he shouldn't be doing this.  No money from the Botti's is untainted - there were other abuses of residents that Dr. Botti participated in at University Hospitals - it wasn't a time of ethics, but that is a poor excuse.  The best resident often did not get the Cardiology Fellowship position - some just looked more handsome than Dr. Botti. 
It would be a better example for all the school kids if Fr. Caddy told the truth, and parents had something to reassure them - that no matter who was doing the abusing or bad behaviors - that Fr. Caddy would tell the truth before 20 years later.  Granted Fr. Caddy was not at St. Francis Parish when this situation started at Hillcrest, but he has known of this situation for quite awhile and done nothing.  And the woman MD remains in danger, has no medical license, and did nothing wrong to patients - she didn't play the Hillcrest game - she has no life and Fr. Caddy says nothing.  Dr. Botti shouldn't be in Florida living off the benefits of saying nothing, and signing a 'confidential' complaint that his present wife tries to justify as just part of the plan.    
Dr. Botti, as Chief of Internal Medicine, was in the position to stop the abuses & harassments and chose not to - and he knew about Dr. Nice's 'past.'  It's always fun to watch a take, but this was a professional arena where patient care was involved.  All that Dr. Botti had to say was to threaten Dr. Nice to leave the woman MD alone, or he would have to report things - instead Dr. Botti reported the woman MD, and told her father that she 'didn't deserve to practice medicine' because she wouldn't 'hide' things.  The woman MD tried to get help from a Hillcrest psychologist - who told her, as she probably told Dr. Botti, that Dr. Nice was 'pathological.'  Geauge Hospital had kicked him off the Active Staff prior to 1990 - but it was hushed up.  
Practicing medicine in Ohio means covering up for the boys when they goof, or 'hit on' the help = Dr. Botti's definition of what it means to be a physician.  And Dr. Botti should be giving a lecture every year to the St. Francis school kids about the medical profession, and medical ethics.  This coverup is very bad example for the parish of St. Francis - barely recovered from the Diocesan Church Scandals and payouts.  
The parish priests can be persuaded to let sexual & other abuses go on where women parishioners are the target - for a price.  Dr. Botti should be Lance Armstronging his way to some character, and instead he's playing being an actor for the Gates Mills Players - again bad example for the families in the parish, for the kids - to see this kind of frivolous behavior in an 80-year old with a tremendous education and capacity to still make a difference in a volunteer sense.     
Parish priests in the Cleveland diocese are not involved except as witnesses to these abuses, but they still need to tell the truth about parallel sexual abuses in the medical profession destroying women physician careers in Ohio - abuses within their parish where the parish watches looking for guidance.  It's a pattern that they should recognize.  
20 years ago there were no rules about male behaviors towards women physicians, certain physicians had active wandering attentions, and were walking infidelity cases waiting to prey on the next nurse, or woman MD, who they saw out the Medical Office Building at Hillcrest.  Dr. Nice was such a guy, but he could command a roster of defender 'friend' physicians to complain about the woman physician - a complaint that remains 'confidential' so Mrs. Botti wants things hush-hush.  
The woman physician said 'No,' tried to get help from a Hillcrest psychologist, and was suspended from her Hillcrest hospital privileges after complaining of a situation that she didn't ask for, want, and tried to get out of.  Dr. Nice had a wife & family in Gates Mills, and was the neighbor of present-day Mrs. Botti - who Dr. Botti was in the process of marrying 20 years ago.  These people get second marriages, their victims get none - best method of birth control is to remarry those with malignant stupidity.  
Dr. Botti wanted to fit in with the Gates Mills crowd, and played along with the peer pressure like a teenager - no backbone.     
St. Francis of Assisi has a number of physicians on the parish roster, but the scandal is Dr. Botti hiding the secular problems that closely parallel the church scandals.  In both cases the priests need to tell the truth - even if the abuse is not within their ranks - and get Dr. Botti to tell the truth.  Dr. Botti didn't know the medical facts of the case, but he defended a neighbor for the entrance fee into the Gates Mills Hunt Club crowd.   
The woman MD has been placed in a dangerous position where she is threatened if she tells the truth, but meanwhile she is without a job in her profession, abused in any medical setting and not allowed to get proper medical care for her health needs - all of which Fr. Caddy knows.    									",Doctors

										Governor Kasich, and Senator Tom Patton, both know that there are serious longstanding problems at the State Medical Board in Ohio.  And that Kimberly Anderson, responsible for some of the most abusive physician investigations in the nation ever (wasting hundreds of thousands $ yearly), should not be the Interim Director of the State Medical Board of Ohio.  That's a conflict of interest if anyone in Columbus is interested in reforms at the State Medical Board of Ohio - you don't put the cause of the problem in charge of the State Medical Board - even for a day.  
The Ohio State Medical Board has the most false physician disciplines & actions in the US.  Ohio is the #1 Board for disciplinary actions that are not reasons for discipline.  We have huge numbers of ethical, good character, lawyers in Ohio - just pick one.  Take a Judge temporarily off of the Ohio State Court of Appeals.  Take an Ohio State Law School Faculty person for a rotation at the Medical Board - but don't pick some 'greenstick ' lawyer fresh from Stateside Capital University Law School who can't get a job at a law firm - Ms. Anderson.  
The Executive Director of the State Medical Board needs to be an experienced Administrative Law attorney, or just an experienced attorney, who has had another job before the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Find someone at Reminger & Reminger, or Mr. Tom Hunter who has been adversarially facing a ridiculous Medical Board for decades now and practices down the street from 77 South High.  Find an attorney who has defended against the State Medical Board of Ohio - an attorney who knows the problems and the constant changing of the rules.  If the Medical Board loses a motion, they change the law - and this happens every day.  The laws at the State Medical Board of Ohio mutate faster than the HIV virus.       
Ohio is the #1 Medical Board with faked disciplines, admitted cheating on documents & expert testimonies (payed for by taxpayers), and the only State Medical Board that takes physician licenses without allowing them to get proper medical care-to-function for simple problems - to cover that Board Members, or their 'friends,' goofed on the care to the point of being negligent.  Board Members can direct cases where their own care fell below standards - Carla O'Day MD did this in the 1990s; cases where they harassed & abused the physician who finally complained.  Carla O'Day MD takes her medical standard disagreements to court.  
Mistreatment of women MDs medically, emotionally, sexually, and physically (one was beaten up in an orthopedic's office at MetroHealth in 1992) is rampant in Ohio.  It's not domestic abuse that is the problem, it is medical office & hospital staff abuse - which no one asks about.  
This is 'stuff' that would result in a Dishonorable Discharge from all 3 Armed Forces.  That the Ohio Legislators let this go on, means that they also do these things - which doesn't speak well for Ohio.  The culture of the Ohio State Medical Board needs to change - you shouldn't be assaulting or threatening to 'kill' the woman MD whose fractures you miscasted, whose bone problem you missed.  
Reporting male bad behaviors - like what the Air Force in Texas suddenly has an epidemic of - male MDs with no 'character' - is one cause of disciplinary action for a woman MD in Ohio.  This has led to further male abuses; not improved the situation.  There is overdrinking at just about every Medical Staff Meeting, CME, and hospital party - which can directly lead to misconduct.  Physicians go from drinking at the Medical Staff Meeting to the hospital floors or surgery areas - and they should be RoboCoped home. 
Many cases at the State Medical Board - no stats on this are available - have been going on for over a decade, as the Ohio State Medical Board has no statute of limitations, or policies to dismiss a case after so much cheating is admitted by the Board.  After the Board admitted cheating in two Hearings, one case is still going on.  
The falsely accused physicians are not allowed proper medical care, or even blood work.  The Medical Board instead questions that they are just 'exaggerating' symptoms of the missed diagnosis?  And the blood work vanishes, or is not allowed before a suspension for 'hypothetical' provisional reasons - women MDs don't deserve, or need, bloodwork in Ohio per the last two Executive Directors of the Medical Board.  And once suspended, the Board does not take back their action for 'provisional' reasons that don't exist; they just try to find more hypothetical excuses to drag cases along.  It's a perpetual La-La land in Columbus; straight out of a Taylor Swift song - everyday is a fairytale in Columbus.  
Women MDs have thyroid symptoms, and the Medical Board says that they are just 'exaggerating.' One woman MD was not allowed treatment of a thyroiditis for 10 years - no TSH was allowed to be done in Ohio - this 'abuse' can lead to thyroid cancer or lymphoma.  The State Medical Board of Ohio doesn't care - she was supposed to 'change her story' about the male MD who was leaving her fractures uncasted while giving her inappropriate attentions in other ways - not with a cast or casting materials.  This speaks poorly of Senator Patton - with 5 daughters; that he would allow other people's daughters to be abused for the sake of reforms long overdue - reforms that he would have to be neglectful & myopic not to see.
The false suspensions destroy careers, bankrupt the physicians (who already have lifetime student loans), and have led to an empty coffer at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Now the Medical Board wants to raise dues.  
The false suspensions lead to loss of health insurance for the physicians - many of whom are innocent - and the Medical Board encourages other Ohio practitioners to also abuse them by withholding medical/orthopedic & gyn care.  This is to get the physician to admit the false case that the State Medical Board can't prove.  
Mr. Tom Dilling used to call physicians and threaten what would be done to them, and their family members,  if they did not admit the case.  You can't have a child while under the 'cloud' of the State Medical Board - they will go after the child and NOT allow prenatal care of pregnant women MDs.  Lance Talmadge MD will recommend a third-trimester abortion for the woman MD - and she'll have to go along if she wants her license back.  Why an amicus brief third trimester abortion ob-gyn, who teaches and publishes how to do it, should be on the State Medical Board of Ohio for over a decade is another question.  Can't we find a regular ob-gyn?  Even someone who just does first trimester abortions?  Partial-birth abortions are not something that should be ok in Ohio.    
The Cleveland Clinic has known about one case, and withheld treatment of both the thyroid & bone conditions - for fun - for years.  They are protecting the Board Member who ran the case, and the male physician who liked his Catholic girls on the 'easy' side.   Floyd Loop MD even tried to get an intermediate 'manager' Cleveland Clinic type to say that the woman MD just asked for it - how with two wrist fractures could she have been seductive?    
This has to stop.  There needs to be a recognition of the problems & reforms.									",Doctors

In any case, The stinking and excessive blood was a sign to me that something was wrong.  This round of Botox lasted me 6 weeks so I went back in and told him something wasn't right.  He said there was nothing he could do as far as an arch for my brows.  I told him my other doctor's where I used to live never had a problem.  Again, he said there was nothing he could do.  I paid him $400.00 for 45 units when I asked for 40.  When I told him what I wanted he said I needed more.  Apparently he pushes ""more"" of whatever it is he is doing on all his patients.  I have heard this from more than a few people.  I want my $400.00 back bc the product did not hold up, bc Dr. Lee waters down his product.  I have contacted the BBB, The Medical Board of Denver, Allergan (the makers of Botox) as well as doing a Yelp review.  I have since been to 2 other doctors in the Denver area for consultations but have yet to move forward.  My credit card company will not refund my $400.00 bc they don't deal w medical issues.  Expert Laser Clinic has yet to give me a refund either.  Another negative about this doctor is him telling me about his other patients and the amount of work they've had done.  These are people I know he is telling me about and makes for an extremely uncomfortable visit.  It also makes me think he may not be aware of HIPAA laws.  http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/summary/index.html
I am also in the middle of finding out if he is licensed here in CO because he resides in Carlsbad CA and commutes weekly.  Do not trust this doctor.  He's a scam and will over inject with watered down products!!!									",Doctors

It has long been known that the State of Ohio has more prosecutions per 1000 licensed physicians than any other state, for reasons that no other state would even consider prosecuting or waste a minute of Board time on.  Many of these investigations, and prosecutions, have been known to have been 'false' - with the Medical Board cheating as bad as Lance Armstrong - or worse.  
The cost of these false investigations, many of which the current Interim Director is responsible for, has been exorbitant.  The current Interim Director of the State Medical Board of Ohio, Kimberly Anderson, is the former Chief of Physician Investigations.  So the 'most abusive person in Columbus' is now running the State Medical Board of Ohio - and Senator Tom Patton knows this - and has done nothing to get someone better appointed and Ms Anderson 'resigned.'  Ms. Anderson should never have been appointed Interim Director.  
No apologies have been given by Governor Kasich, Tom Patton, or the State Medical Board for the long-term abuses - no Oprah interviews.  The criteria for these investigations is always 'confidential,' and there is no point system.  Cases can go to the top of the list for political reasons, or because a Board Member is involved and has to destroy the physician telling the truth about the Board Member.  
In cases where women MDs report molestation & harassments by male MDs, even beatings in medical offices, the woman MD is punished.  Tom Patton has one case in his district that he knows about, and has done nothing to stop the abuse - the woman MD is still getting abused by friends of the orthopedics who did the initial abusing.  
The woman MD has her parish priests defending her, and the priests have noted the parallels with the Catholic Church scandals - but the Medical Board, and State Legislature, are now hiding the abusers - which are male physicians in Tom Patton's district.  Can the priests now complain to the civil courts about male physicians abusing women MDs in Ohio?  Would be a breath of fresh air.
There are male MDs offering licenses for favors, beating women MDs in their offices if they won't 'change their story.'  One woman MD had her arms beaten & bruised in a Cleveland Metro orthopedic's office - nothing was done; she was reported to deserve the beating as she was trying to 'rebreak her wrists.'  And someone believed that line - including the Chiefs of Orthopedics at University - Victor Goldberg MD & Randy Marcus MD. 
 
Ohio is the #1 abusive Medical Board in the US.  They have disciplinary cases where physicians have had their medical licenses suspended for objecting to the wrong medical/orthopedic care of themselves - where the Board admits that the care was admittedly bad & negligent, but that the physician should not have complained.  
Medical licenses are taken to order the woman physicians to serial psychiatric evaluations by Board experts.  These are done with Rorschach tests that never have the answers recorded, and diagnoses that don't exist.  Note: Rorschach tests have long been known to be reliable for nothing; a waste of time & money.  But the Ohio Medical Board plays the 'Rorschach game.'
The Medical Board gets away with this because the legislators, and their offices, do not know medical terminology, or the criteria for these diagnoses.  The Medical Board serial psychiatric evaluations are paid for by the State of Ohio, the experts are paid to lie for the State.  Physicians have to get their own out-of-state experts; these cost $50,000-$100,000/evaluation to refute the Medical Board.  The burden of proof is on the physician.  The State Legislators, for the most part, are duped by the medical terminology - including Senator Patton.
Women MDs have not been allowed even one set of blood work before their medical licenses have been suspended indefinitely for supposedly 'exaggerating' that diagnoses were missed on them by friend-of- the-Board male physicians.  There is no due process, and no physician right to treatment before an impairment determination; no 'care-to-function.  Senator Patton is allowed care-to-function.    
Thyroid diagnoses are especially missed as the Medical Board does not allow women MDs to get blood work before taking their licenses; the Medical Board of Ohio does not allow 'care-to-function.'  
One woman was not allowed thyroid function tests; her thyroiditis was left untreated for 10 years (which means a cancer risk for her for life), while the Medical Board ordered her to 4 psychiatric evaluations for 'exaggerating' thyroid symptoms.  Her case is still ongoing, and every year is a prosecutorial stat; for the last 20 years.  The stats are never looked at - the same stats repeat over and over.  
Mr. Dilling and Mr. Whitehouse - the last two Executive Directors - did not believe that women MDs deserved medical care or medical lab testing - just a new right Ohio psychiatrist.  Four psychiatric evaluations were done on one woman MD before she got blood work in another state; no physician would help her in Ohio.  Physicians accused by the State Medical Board of Ohio have a problem getting medical care, and get negligent care even by The Cleveland Clinic.  Dr. Tony Licata has refused to treat the bone problem of one woman MD falsely accused, because The Cleveland Clinic was involved in the misdiagnosis.  The Cleveland Clinic does not admit their mistakes.  There are no medical mistake laws in Ohio.  Dr. Tom Stellato refused to treat the same woman, claiming that she 'stood him up' - she wasn't on a date with Dr. Stellato, it was a complication of his care.  Both physicians need to stop this mistreatment - the woman MD was innocent.     
The Ohio State Legislature has known of the humongous number of false medical license actions for about 15 years now.  Speaker Larry Householder, considered a crook by many, even admitted the problem in 2003, but that the Legislature would do nothing because of the scope of the problem.
The number of false Medical Board actions was so huge, even in 2003, that opening only the currently active 'confidential' files would trigger a paralysis of Columbus legal systems, and a bankruptcy of the State of Ohio - because of the number and size of the legal damages & liabilities involved - the number of justified cases that would be filed in an estimated one month's time.  
At this point in 2013 the number of false Medical Board action cases, and legal damages, has at least doubled or tripled in Ohio.  So Columbus legal systems would be paralyzed within a week with the filing of legal damages by falsely accused physicians - for justified liability & reputational damage reasons.  The Medical Board should repay the physicians the costs of the false case, and the loss of income for the number of years that the case went on.  In many cases the damage to each physician is several million to double-digit millions in one unjust case - Senator Patton is sitting on that case.    
Any action by the State Medical Board of Ohio costs from $100,000-$300,000 to defend - which most physicians don't have.  When the Board takes your license first based on 'hypothetical' reasons, the insurances won't pay the investigation costs.  Physicians with student loans quickly run out of cash, and can't always settle with the Medical Board by signing a pile of punitive lies.  The number of physicians involved is probably thousands/42,000.  Tom Patton could get the list and publish the stats, but so far has chosen to ignore the problem.   
The Executive Director of the State Medical Board until 2005, Tom Dilling, had a list of these probably 'innocent' physicians, and would try to make deals or threaten some before his resignation in 2005.  Executive Director Dilling would threaten the falsely accused physicians to admit the Board's case, or such-and-such would be done to their families to make them pay.   
Governor Taft finally got rid of him after this happened one too many times.  But Tom Patton can get that 'Dilling' list and he hasn't made any attempt to (1) get it, (2) have the Medical Board be externally reviewed for those cases from 1998 (which will be a huge State cost because of the lies, fabrications, and length of time of these cases 1998-2013), or (3) get these physicians cleared and back to work with no-fault agreements.  
Tom Dilling has the list, and it needs to be published before any rate increase by the Ohio State Medical Board.  Then the Rick Whitehouse list of false actions needs to be published - how much has the State of Ohio wasted on frivolous investigations over the last 15 years?  Tom Dilling, 
Rick Whitehouse, Kimberly Anderson and Members of the Medical Board should have to pay damages & fines.  The estimate is >$8.5 million; there is no surplus at the State Medical Board because of these false cases and legal actions - and the State of Ohio will have to pay damages on some of these cases eventually.  The State of Ohio, and Senator Tom Patton, are sitting on a time bomb.    
Mr. Whitehouse, who resigned in October 2012, has long known of the false suspension list, and just not answered the phone for 8 years to any of these physician's lawyers.  Governor Kasich has known of the possibility that hundreds to thousands of physicians have had their medical licenses suspended over the last 20 years unjustly, from the first day of his Governorship.  The state stats are very wrong, and everyone in Columbus knows this - including Senator Tom Patton who makes a promise of being able to spot-a-con.  Senator Tom Patton just can't admit-a-con; can't get even the women MDs reporting real molestations back to work in another area of the state.  What would his daughters think?  He'd do something if one of his daughters was similarly molested.  
This is well-acknowledged problem - of Lance Armstrong type behaviors - by the State Medical Board of Ohio - hiding gross abuses of physician due process, and leaving many physicians unable to get even medical care while the investigative process continues.  There are never any admitted false cases at the State Medical Board of Ohio, and every other State Medical Board knows from looking at some of these physician files that there are really probably thousands of false cases needing external review, and an entire new Medical Board needs to be appointed.  Lance Talmadge MD, and Anita Steinbergh DO, need to resign - they have perpetuated many of these false cases with unreasonable demands of the physicians involved.
Other Medical Boards would have been impeached, but this is not possible with the 'confidential' complaint system in Ohio - where the complaints can be changed, and no one can get at what is really going on at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Tom Patton knows of the problem, and his office is 'sitting on the pot' on it - he's getting heavier and the list is growing longer by the day.  
 
There have been hundreds of false cases since the early 1990s when the physician 'confidential' complaint system was put into practice.  Many physicians can never get the complaint against themselves, but certain 'friend' physicians are handed their complaints against Ohio state law so that they can defend themselves - often by countercomplaints of other physicians who then can't defend themselves.  The Ohio State Medical Board breaks Ohio law every day in giving verbatim complaints to 'friend' physicians for 'favors' of appointments, contract jobs, and hospital privileges.  Carla O'Day MD collected millions in ER contract jobs for her Rocky River ER group that way, before she resigned under a 'cloud' in 1993.  The practice still continues.  No one can trace the paybacks. 
These false State Medical Board cases then continue for decades.  One case, involving a constituent of Tom Patton, has continued for 2 decades and cost the State of Ohio > $500,000.  The woman MD had no patient complaints, she complained of molestation & harassment by a colleague male MD who left her fractures to 'ripen,' wanted her to 'understand' him, and who threatened her license if she did not lie about what happened.  Despite 2 decades, 2 Hearings, and 3 national experts standing up for her - she still does not have her medical license returned.  Tom Patton's office is sitting on the situation; because he does not know medical terminology the Board can pull anything on him with a medical term.
PA is 29th (or AVERAGE for Physician Prosecutions) and spends only $7 million a year.  Pennsylvania has amassed a $30 million surplus at their State Medical Board.  The PA Board is so flush that 50,000 licensed physicians are getting a pass this year on license fees, they pay every other year.",Doctors

The common mass closure that Mayo does rupture after 3 years - probably all of them.  This leads to a mesh repair.  But none of this is needed because the neurectomies are not needed.  All that is needed is a 2% lidocaine injection & getting to the right physician.

										Hello,
I would like to report a Pain Management Doctor where I was treated for several years and then left him unfortunately only based on his very own personal reasons, mood swings, a bipolar disorder, his own depression, his own personal drug habits as a result of divorce and also the way he clearly treats most of his patients which I will try to explain here in a few brief but all honest words thus as a result many drugs in pill form end up on our streets and is killing people daily in Philadelphia PA.
He often complained and openly admitted to me that due to his very recent divorce that he himself often takes his very own narcotics by a method of writing various strong narcotic prescription scripts to his very own employees or their immediate family members and his personal close friends as well as many others in order to have them filled and takes the medicine himself and also sells it privately on the side for extra cash to many close friends or people that he entrusts including pro sport players some of even the Eagles football team and many other famous people. 
He often discharges people at a drop of a dime and finds any means possible to do so, for no valid or medical reason including falsifying and making false urine or blood work test results just to cut them off, while he has turned them into a drug addict on very high doses of many strong narcotics in very high amounts with no prior notice nor any legitimate reasons or any referrals given and just cuts them off at will, he simply does not care at all.
He often openly brags about that he has the power to discharge any patient for any reason he wishes by any means necessary at any given point with no prior notice nor any other doctor provided nor any relief of the addict he had made out of his patients and frequently does so by any means he desires to do so.
Everyone in the neighborhood knows of all this very well and of his methods as well as many drug addicts and pills on the streets come directly from this doctor. He will do as he wish at any given time as so he openly says when he feels trust in a patient after some time. 
His name is Dr. Stuart Kauffman and is now located on Bustleton Avenue Philadelphia PA 19115 called the Total Pain and Body Management as he changes his office locations and his staff as well as his many patients frequently including forging many documents and all lab tests or any paperwork as is needed just to avoid the law or to get rid off any patient he wishes for no reason or for personal non medical reasons, he even laughs about it openly and talks about it with his preferred patients. 
Many have even protested his illegal doings in his office with signs in front of his building for the many lives he destroys every day. 
I wish to remain totally anonymous about all this & him but this is the absolute truth and are clear facts of this licensed drug dealer who destroys peoples lives each and every day. He will gladly sign any paperwork prepared for him by patients and staff alike and will do just as he wishes at any given point to do as is best for himself just to get the high amounts of cash he needs and to avoid the law. 
He often openly said that there is much more money to be made on the street privately than from sitting behind his desk all day and just writing scripts. 
Please stop this bipolar madman drug dealer. 
Several of his in office patients or indirect private so called patients have already died as a result of his doings and many more to follow.
Hope that something very soon will be done about all this.

Beverly Hills, California United States of America ",,310-860-0800,"Dr. Robert E. Levine  This Doctor Needs To Take Surgery Classes Beverly Hills, California","
										Dr. Levine's surgery betrayed my trust.  He removed a strip of eyelashes that was embedded at the end junction of my eyes that was causing needle-like pain.  However, after 2 attempts, he never successfully got the lids at the end junction to meet.  There is now a gap with exposed red tissue that looks weird and throbbing pain, even worse than there was before surgery.
Since I was undergoing this necessary surgery, we agreed on some minor cosmetic improvements. These, too, were a disaster.  Without advising me, Dr. Levine had a 2"" cut made in my abdomen and he removed fat strips and placed them under my eyes.  I had no unusual under-eye hollows, but I now have 2 different sized pillowy fat pouches under each eye -- worse than what people pay a plastic surgeon to remove!  Thus, I emerged with a new deformity.  Worse yet, they are difficult to remove since after 3 weeks they have integrated with a patient's own blood supply and tissues.
It made no sense for Dr. Levine to place fat strips under my eyes.  First off, there was a stem cell fat graft surgeon who joined him in this surgery so he should have used minute amounts of liposuctioned fat for the delicate under-eye area.  Fat strips are used for creating volume for places like re-shaping abs or the buttocks.  In addition, the deep depression=like holes at the end of my eyes where possibly fat strips could have been used, were entirely ignored.
I also emerged with other complications and problems following his surgery.  My right pupil is larger and does not dilate.  The shape and size of my eyes are less symmetrical.  The right eyebrow ended up higher, as did the space between the eye and the eyebrow. His surgery was a disaster, but, even worse, my eyes cannot tolerate more surgeries. I paid Dr. Levine $10,000 and ended up with more pain, more problems, and absolutely more aesthetically deformed.   									",Doctors

										Dr. Aronowitz did not perform most of the procedures I paid him $18,000 to perform.  Those few he did perform were done sloppily and carelessly.  Even more egregious than his failure to perform, however, was his Operating Room Report, which was a cover-up that he delayed releasing, filled with totally false statements in an effort to absolve himself of any responsibility.
Dr. Aronowitz was recruited by an ophthalmic surgeon to join him in a dual surgery on me.  He was chosen specifically for his expertise in autologous stem cell fat injections.  Dr. Aronowitz's failure to do one of two major procedures left my opthalmic surgeon so empathetic at my disappointment, that he offered to perform it himself, even though it was not within his area of expertise. Other areas I had paid for were  not done at all, or done incompletely or carelessly. My ophthalmic surgeon even noticed that one earlobe was longer than the other, and I showed him how the ear deformity was still there because Dr. Aronowitz had not re-attached that ear to my face.
Even though both the ophthalmic surgeon and Dr. Aronowitz's staff were aware of my disappointment and despair duringg the first few days following the surgeries, Dr. Aronowitz's final touch was to deny all accountability.  He witheld my Operating Room Report and I didn't get it until 3 months later, when my lawyer finally called.  In his Operating Room Report, listed under ""Procedures,"" half of it is devoted to false statements about my mental state.  Every sentence in it is an easily disprovable lie.  He even claimed he'd spoken to my psychologist. Aside from the ""Blame the victim"" defense, my mental state is totally irrelevant to the fact that he did not perform all the procedures I paid for and those few he did do, were incomplete or careless. 
The other curious fact about my Operating Room Report from Dr. Aronowitz is that it listed the operation as concerned with ""Scar removal.""  Scar removal was never discussed and except for one ear, all the charges I paid for were for autologoous stem cell fat addition to areas of my face.  Indeed, that is why he was invited to participate by my ophthalmic surgeont, and autologous stem cell fat addition is his claim to fame.  A lot of his PR is focused on the breast he created for Suzanne Somers using autologous stem cell fat. 
I received my ophthalmic surgeon's Operating Room Report immediately.  Like all other Operating Room Reports, it begins with ""Procedures,"" and then simply lists the exact  procedures.  It is definitely a red flag that I made about 6 requests for my Operating Room Report to Dr. Aronowitz's office, but could not get it until my lawyer finally called.  I can only assume that it was witheld to give Dr. Aronowitz time to revise it in order to falsely discredit my emotional state and to re-write the very reason for my surgery.  
Dr. Arronowitz is all about money and ""The Sell,"" not about the patient.  The only time he spent time with me was on the first appointment.  Even then, he did not touch or examine any areas of my face where he was going to inject fat.  The appointment was about explaining the procedure.  Follow-ups were generally with others or 5 minute ""Between surgery"" appointments with him.  On one, he even used the crazy-making act of trying to convince me that the surgery had been about scar revision, not autologous fat!  
I can only conclude that Dr. Aronowitz does not really care about addressing the needs of a non-star patient --  nor does he care about performing all the procedures a patient pays for.  In addition, he lacks the integrity to be accountable or responsible and will intentionally attempt to cover-up his non-performance.  
I  think very little of him as a plastic surgeon.  I think even less as a decent ethical human being.  ",Doctors

I told him that I wasn't busy the upcoming week-end and I made plans to meet out for dinner. I got my meds too! After I had gone out and met him for dinner I felt like trash because he kept making remarks about my body or what size by breasts were and it got very uncomfortable. I finally told him I had to leave because I was supposed to take my father to have a test done. I left feeling like a piece of meat. On my last visit I told him it was unethical for me to go out with him because he was my doctor. He told me no one has to know. I said I couldn't do it.That was the last time I went back to him because when I turned his advances down he also turned me down for my prescriptions. He is a REAL CREEP! My girlfriend said I should turn him into the State Board for being sexually harassing and unethical. I was so tired of this person who calls himself a doctor that all I wanted to do was find a new physician and stay far away from him. After about a week he kept calling my cell phone and leaving me messages and I kept deleting them. His last message was nasty but that was the last time I ever heard from him again.

										I was just about to check my email when instead something told me to GOOGLE Dr. Oswald Williams. I'm not surprised at the references to his unprofessional sexual behavior. I used to work for him sometime in the last 2 years. I would often see him gawking at a pretty girl or woman and he never seemed to want the Medical Assistant in the room with him and the patient. Usually after the exam the patient came out of the room with a look of bewilderment. Yes, I new that look all to well. I had overheard a conversation with him and a patient one time when I was by the door. He surely asked questions to the patient as to the situation she was in at the time like being married, single or whatever. Then if it seemed OK he would go in for the kill and say ""we should go out to dinner sometime"". He would talk about all the money he had especially trying to impress her by adding that he had a Porsche. [continued below]....
									
										..... I'm not sure which patients did or didn't go out with him but I definitely knew he had a thing for his new babies mama. After the birth he did the right thing by paying for the care of the baby and whatever the mom needed. I think he wanted to keep it low profile  and buy off the mom for her anonymity. His relationships with women basically came from his office patients or maybe a rep or two. I eventually couldn't work for a man who called himself a doctor and did more sexual harassment then examinations and care-taking of the patient. Oh yeah, he was good at giving out large doses of Narcotics like Percocet, Vics, Benzos, opiates, you name it. But it was only if you showed an interest in him dating you or taking you to bed. I made the best decision by pursuing another job and the physicians I work for now are very professional.

										..... If you shy away and don't give him an answer either way that you are interested, he will write you your medications. If you do not call him or ignore his advances, he will definitely not write the prescriptions that you need for your ailments. He has written numerous prescriptions for opiates, narcotics, benzodiazapines etc. He has mood swings so if you catch him on a bad day then you won't get your meds. If you catch him on a good day and let him make advances towards you, you can get the prescriptions that you have asked for. This doctor is always late when it comes to appointments. If you think your getting the 1st appointment of the day (hold on) because he is usually 2 hours late and he offers no apologies or explanations just his mouth with food hanging from it. He is incompetent when it comes to documenting the notes on your patient file. I have been there over 5 times and he still doesn't have my medications written right as of yet. He goes through staff like candy. He can't keep anyone competent and the competent ones eventually leave because of his unethical ways. Make sure you get a receipt if you pay by cash or else his incompetent billing staff will send you bills for services that were already paid for and they will argue with you that you still owe it no matter what. Apparently, there was a scam going on in his office on Saturdays and some of his staff were seeing patients, charging them and never documenting their ailments or that visit. Those staff were eventually found out and fired. He then hired a retired RN nurse to come into his office and to help get it back into a professional order.

He visits that office once a month in order for Rebecca to write out prescriptions under his name. He is always late there also. He is so overbooked with patients because he only comes to this office once a month that your wait time is a minimum of at least a 2 hour wait. Most of the time inbetween he hides in his office and takes personal calls from pharmaceutical reps who will offer him favors, freebies or whatever makes him happy. There is no professionalism at this office because he acts unprofessional and his clothes are always tattered and disarrayed. He has been so unprofessional and sexually harrassing in the way that he acts that he got his pharmaceutical sales rep pregnant and now he has another child from another baby mama.

EDitors UPDATE: Positive rating and recognition has been given to  Dr. Jay Calvert, MD, Professional Corporation / Roxbury Clinic and Surgery Center  for its commitment to excellence in customer service.

Dr. Calvert feels the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program is an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to customer service and he is glad that there is a program that can address these concerns that have been voiced on the Internet.The information provided in this report is based on comments made by Dr. Jay Calvert during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Roxbury Clinic and Surgery Center.

At Roxbury Clinic and Surgery Center, they work to treat each patient equally and we aim to please all of our patients. Safety is their number one concern in taking care of patients and secondly is that they obtain satisfactory results. It is their goal that each patient has a great experience from the time they make an appointment until the time they are done healing from their procedures. Communication between staff is very important to ensure the quality of patient care. 
Each patient comes into the office for a consultation to discuss their concerns. The area of concerned is examined and a treatment plan is formulated if possible and medically advisable. The patient then will meet with the patient coordinator to schedule the surgery and will be given a price quote. The patient is welcome to come back to meet with the doctor during my office hours if they still may have questions that are unanswered or any other concerns.
The treatment plan is advised at the time of the first consultation. If a treatment plan is not made at the first visit because of need for further information then the patient is asked to come back for a second consultation once all information has been obtained or the patient is referred out to another surgeon. Each patient is assessed and consulted prior to obtaining any treatments or services to ensure they are fully aware of their course of treatment. At the time prior to the procedure (usually the pre-op appointment), the patient will fill out informed consents and is advised to ask any questions that they may have regarding the procedure. All risks and complications are discussed with the patient at this visit as well.
In a scenario that the doctor would not advise a procedure be done on a patient, Dr. Calvert stats that he would discuss with them their goals for the procedures, look at alternatives, and try to help direct them to either a better solution for their concerns. If they are still unable to come to a resolution, the doctor would refer them to someone for more information if he did not feel comfortable doing it for them. Dr. Calvert would communicate that in his hands that it probably wont give them what they want and he would refer them to someone for another opinion who may be able to address their concerns.
After treatment, the office makes sure to place frequent follow up calls (video calls if the patient is from out of town), frequent postop visits to the office, and having competent staff that can handle any issues that may arise with patients.  They also send each patient a post-operative questionnaire that specifically addresses their care and service. The patient has multiple opportunities to voice concerns as the office is heavily staffed with nurses and/or PAs. It is not uncommon for patients to feel more comfortable addressing their concerns with the PA or nurse and therefore it is their goal to make sure that the patients concerns are addressed and proper action is taken.
Since the office has been a part of Ripoff Report, they make sure all patients are well informed and educated which begins at the very first phone call or email that they may receive from a potential new patient. They also have clarified our consent forms and policy and procedure materials that are given to every patient. Patient complaints are taken very seriously and are dealt with immediately. No matter what the complaint may be the office will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible or come up with a solution that is agreeable between all parties.
Furthermore, the office has discovered that better patient selection is key in prevention of complaints. There are many patients that have had multiple procedures from other surgeons, that makes Dr. Calvert am very careful to assess whether or not further surgery is advisable for that patient. They also have heavier screening for body dysmorphic disorder and major depression that has allowed them to save patients the frustration of having further surgery and not being satisfied with the results.
As stated above  something that needs to be repeated to those seeking any kind of plastic Surgery .. The company states that they are committed to doing whatever it takes to make the patient happy because they have always worked tirelessly to revise surgery when necessary. In knowing that plastic surgery is not perfect, they always let patients know that there is a 10% chance of revision rate on any plastic surgery procedure. They do not charge for the revision operation, but the patient does pay anesthesia fees. This is standard practice in plastic surgery industry. Dr. Calvert feels the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program is an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to customer service and he is glad that there is a program that can address these concerns that have been voiced on the Internet.

Dr. Jay Calvert - Roxbury Surgical Associates, Inc. Of Beverly Hills Scam! The office charges you thousands, and they""ll also bill your insurance a HUGE fee (   which they'll collect) but the the surgeon and clinic refuse to repay the patient , as they promised! Scam!  Beverly Hills, CaliforniaHaving Dr. Calvert perform my surgery was the WORST MISTAKE that I've
ever made in my life. I'm still in pain years later and my cosmetic
result was horrible. I had to have another surgeon correct Dr.
Calvert's mess, which cost me a huge amount of money and much physical
and psychological pain. Dr. Calvert and his staff will tell you what
you want to hear before surgery, then you'll be left in the dust if you
have any problems afterward that may need revised. Before surgery he
told me that he would be calling me a lot after my surgery to check on
me. He didn't even call me once! He is not a compassionate surgeon. All
he cares about is money. I paid him a HUGE amount of money, plus he
billed my insurance for an outrageously exorbitant amount (which he
collected  ), and then he refused to repay me when my insurance company paid him, as he promised he would. This was HUGE SCAM. This is insurance fraud at it's worse! If you care about yourself, then please choose another
surgeon. I don't trust him or his scams. One day, he will get caught. I hope he's enjoying his new home in Beverly Hills and Newport Beach on my and other patients money and his insurance scam money. Thank you

										I recently received a Demand Letter from Brown Hand Center. When I reviewed my records I found that I had gone to the Brown Hand Center in Austin, Texas for a *Free Consultation* in the Spring of 2010. 
The consultation itself was very memorable. The office staff were incompetent and I felt that the Doctor was hustling me to make a surgical commitment. When I asked about the costs repeatedly, no one in the office could answer my simple question.
With no one able to answer and a general bad feeling on my part I left the office after telling them not to solicit me and I would not be back.
Within weeks I saw another Hand Surgeon who recommended that I wear a pair of orthopaedic gloves for a week and repeat as needed to resolve my hand and wrist aching. Problem solved with no surgery necessary.
As for the Demand Letter, I have addressed it with a voice mail to Frank A, Director of Reimbursement for the Brown Hand Center. He has yet to show me any financial commitment made on my part, but has the nerve to DEMAND that I pay some amount they claim I agreed to in writing.									",Doctors

										I paid $18,000 to Dr. Joel Aronowitz.  He either did not perform all the procedures I paid for or and those he did perform, were done carelessly and sloppily.  He did not spend time examining the areas to be treated.  He failed to tell me to gain weight so there would be enough fat for the stem cell fat procedures.
It took me 3 months to get the ""Before"" and ""After"" photos his own staff took.  No one can tell the difference between the two sets.  My lawyer had to call to finally compel him to release his Operating Room Report.  The Operating Room Report even misstated some of the facts. such as stating I had ear deformities on both ears, when there was only a deformity on one ear.  Even his Operating Room Report is careless.  Either that, or he wrote it so long after the surgery he couldn't remember as his own pre-surgical notes and observations were inadequate and non-specific.
Additionally, every sentence in his Operating Room Report is a lie.  Dr. Aronowitz tried to blame my mental state for his non-performance. Contrary to his report, I was not ""distraught,"" but was happily optimistic at this surgery my other doctor had arranged.  Every statement he made can be easily disproved by both his own staff and the people in my life.  It takes a lot of chutzpah to make such outrageous claims that he'd even spoken with my psychiatrist when she told me she didn't know his name and had never spoken to him.
This ""Blame the victim,"" mentality is not only morally reprehensinsible, it is irrelevant.  Procedures not performed or performed carelessly are just that, but Dr. Aronowitz could not bring himself to be honest and take responsibility.  That is a double betrayal! 									",Doctors

South Euclid, Ohio United States of America ",www.ushchealth.com/contact_us.html,(216)382-9492,"University Suburban Health Center Medical Director - Thomas Stellato MD do not understand the problem of anterior abdominal nerve entrapments occurring after surgery or sports injuries - about 463,000 results ,0.46 seconds, on Google if you query, Carnett's test gets abou South Euclid, Ohio","
										The newest 'hot' diagnosis on the block is abdominal Anterior Cutaneous Nerve Entrapment Syndrome (or ACNES as the acronym goes) - on the web, in the office, on the soccer field.  The diagnostic test for it - Carnett's test - gets only about 4,750 results (in 0.15 seconds) if you GOOGLE.  Images for Carnett's test get about 10,800 results (0.44 seconds) if you GOOGLE - so patients are aware of the diagnosis, and want it made correctly - at Mayo Clinic or University Suburban Medical Center.  And they see the pictures, images, of how to do the test on the web if they look.
No Suburban Green Road Medical Center (in Cleveland or anywhere else), or Medical Director, can afford not to handle this well and daily - the diagnosis is there in every waiting room that sees abdominal wall pain.  Physicians, or professionals, presenting with it are not exaggerating or 'standing a surgeon up,' they are trying to get the right diagnosis and avoid unnecessary surgery IF THAT IS POSSIBLE in a world that overuses SURGERY.  Stellato wants to say 3 words and CUT, and that's not always the ANSWER.  This is a diagnosis that is misinterpreted, misdiagnosed and misunderstood - and unnecessarily taken to surgery and made a mess of - a diagnosis that every Medical Director needs to do right or be able to repair.  
And if the surgeon did the incision that caused this, the patient will go to the surgeon instead of the Family Practitioner, if they get hit in sports the patients will show in the Sports Medicine Office.  But University Suburban Medical Center can designate a Family Practitioner, Internist or Pain Expert to work with Dr. Stellato - so that patients don't have to get stuck trying to get this across to Carol - who doesn't get the problem AT ALL - the words Carnett's test or ACNES will not come spontaneously from Carol.  This problem can occur in ANY surgical incision, at any LATE DATE - it usually does not occur immediately after surgery.
The injecting for it is a Kaiser code number for reimbursement - no one is making this diagnosis up - it's too painful.  The 2% lidocaine injection is therapeutic & diagnostic, and pays without an argument.  Dr. Stellato should quit being mad at the woman MD who tried to say to him that she had it, and realize that it is just amazingly common; it's rather too popular to be missed if you are in the Medical Center business.  Problems always have GIFTS per Richard Bach in Illusions.
If you GOOGLE anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment you get only about 463,000 results (0.42 seconds).  That's a lot of business out the door if you alienate every woman that has this, needs an injection, and some understanding, after a positive Carnett's test - and you have to do a Carnett's test for well-localized abdominal wall pain - before putting it on the Wright Surgery Schedule or cutting all the abdominal muscles and making a common mass closure mess.  
Doing unnecessary surgery, arguing, is not cost effective.  It's the diagnosis of the day in an ambulatory care center.  Coming in tired doesn't cut it.  Blaming the woman MD that left the articles doesn't cut it, maturity does.  No one wants the wrong diagnosis, or an unnecessary surgery that requires endless repairs; neurectomies are not the answer - at Mayo Clinic or Green Road University Hospitals.
Surgery for refractory ACNES gets about 2,220,000 results (0.51 seconds) - it's an up-and-coming diagnosis in the surgical repair repertoire - a diagnosis that has been in the Surgical Literature since 1926, but overlooked.  And it's overlooked because, almost everyone who has written about abdominal wall pain overlooks the diagnosis - including Dr. Stellato in his publications.  
Wrong surgeries for this condition need repair.  Wrong or right - the diagnosis is a no-brainer money-maker.  Dr. Stellato should have been recognizing it for the last 20 years.  It's not a Carol diagnosis however; no BP required.  But it is an interdisciplinary medical problem, and Pain Management Offices can get huge business from this diagnosis correctly made.  But it is painful, and only complete relief of pain by the anesthetic agent establishes the diagnosis - not another surgery, not Advil.  
University Suburban Medical Center, and it's Medical Director, need to develop a way to handle nerve entrapments - it's also a common sports injury (for the guys) after cracked ribs, abdominal impact in football.  Tim Tebow's probably got it, but no one is diagnosing - and you can meet some Cleveland Browns this way if anyone's interested.      ",Doctors

										John Bundrick MD has published the following case in Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2011): CASE 3: A 26-year-old woman presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain of 18 months' duration that began after an episode of self-limited viral gastroenteritis. She describes it as a sharp, burning discomfort that is well localized and continuous.  This is a case of well-localized abdominal wall pain, with no symptoms of an acute abdomen - where the MD reader is supposed to get that you diagnose non-acute abdominal wall pain with a simple no-brainer maneuver, and thereby reassure the patient without scaring them into an unnecessary procedure.  But this is not what really goes on at Mayo Clinic - where patients get railroaded to surgery before John Bundrick ever knows they are there - the surgical option to ACNES = anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome. [continued below]....
									
										.....  This surgical option should have been 'gone' at the latest in 1972 if any surgeon at Mayo Clinic read the surgical literature.  The discussion: This case is classic for chronic abdominal wall pain, an entity first described by the British surgeon J. B. Carnett in 1926 = anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES). Carnett described the maneuver whereby the tender spot is located and then patients are asked to raise either their legs or torso (thus tensing the abdominal muscles).  Crunch maneuver in jock lingo. If the pain does not decrease (and especially if it increases) during the maneuver, then it is very unlikely to be from a visceral source and may reliably be localized to the abdominal wall muscles. False-positive Carnett maneuvers occur infrequently (<5% or so), almost always in the setting of acute appendicitis (due to irritation of the adjacent parietal peritoneum). Chronic abdominal wall pain is typically described by the patient as being constant in nature and may worsen slightly after eating (abdominal distention). In reality, the Mayo surgeons don't take that much of a history - just you need to pick a resident - and there's no reassurance - just the 'scare' that they need to cut you open because they 'are' Mayo Clinic = the Mayo delusional disorder.  And Sarr tells parents that he 'IS' the Mayo Clinic.The Carnett maneuver is not only useful in diagnosis, but is also helpful in educating and reassuring patients as to the true source of their pain and therapeutic- it reduces herniation of the neurovascular bundle (prevents the pseudoneuroma). But the surgeons at Mayo Clinic don't do the Carnett maneuver; while Dr. Bundrick is educating the world, he has not educated his own staff - and patients are paying dearly with obsolete neurectomy procedures 'for the money.'  Surgically-speaking, no alternatives are offered, not even Bundrick consultations.  And the Mayo Clinic has been told to stop this for at least 15 years - the Legal Counsel Jill Beed-Smith defends neurectomies with deforming mass closures - she hasn't heard of the Carnett maneuver.  There's no reassurance if you get near a Mayo surgeon such as Dr. Sarr - he takes muscles & nerves and leaves no prisoners - he's not reassuring or gentle.But the Mayo Clinic advises per John: Local heat or ice treatments, sometimes accompanied by gentle stretching of the abdominal muscles, have been tried with variable success. With a conservative approach, about 50% of patients will improve over several months of follow-up. Trigger point injections provide relief in about two-thirds of patients. In all cases, the diagnosis helps to provide reassurance, while avoiding unnecessary expense, testing, and confusion.  The emphasis is on 'gentle,' and no one has seen this kinder gentler Mayo Clinic.In this case, the pain is too constant and prolonged to represent biliary colic, and the elevated ALT is compatible with fatty liver.  Earth to John: Most don't get an ALT before surgery, especially the women. The features are not compatible with gastroesophageal reflux, and upper endoscopy did not show any gastritis or ulceration, making it unlikely that a trial of a proton pump inhibitor would be of benefit. The patient does not have atrial fibrillation and is far too young to have (and does not have the pattern to suggest) symptomatic atherosclerosis (the most common conditions associated with mesenteric ischemia).  So you don't have to call Warner Andrew Oldenburg MD. Clinical Pearl: The Carnett maneuver can be very useful in both diagnosing chronic abdominal wall pain and reassuring patients who receive that diagnosis.  Clinical Paradox: the Surgical Service at Mayo Clinic does not use this maneuver - so it can't be useful.The problem is that Mayo Clinic staff are not doing the Carnett maneuver - and don't read John Bundrick - but they are probably reading 'GONE GIRL.'  Mayo Clinic is still railroading women patients into PAINFUL next day neurectomy surgeries - before John Bundrick can do a consult.  The Surgical Services at Mayo Clinic don't do Carnett's and pooh-pooh this maneuver, injections, and anything but surgery.  The patients don't consent and get the neurectomy - the Mayo signature deformity.  Dr. Sarr has a complete 'menu' of neurectomies.These neurectomies are being done without consent or discussion - the patient will think that it's scar tissue, or retained appendectomy suture materials, pressing on nerves - the surgeons get in and find a swollen nerve and pretend this is 'foreign material.'  The OR Reports are enlightening reading as to the rationalizations of non-thinking surgeons.  And the surgeon will have been told to 'not touch the nerve.'  No injections of any anesthetic agent are offered on the surgical service until the patient is scheduled - then they are injected with an unconsented IV drug so that they don't walk - as they realize what Dr. Sarr really intends.  It's like out of Robin Cook 'Coma,' where the woman MD gets an unnecessary appendectomy - it's not one bit assuring.    But the worst of it - is the using of these patients to practice Mayo signature COMMON MASS CLOSURES.  Common mass closures are where the surgeons cuts all the abdominal muscles, and the nerves are above one of the muscles, to sew them all together with one suture pack - it's a guy challenge like chasing a whiskey with a beer - the 'whiskey' being the nerve removal, and the 'beer' being the common mass closure = the Mayo surgical 'cocktail.'John Bundrick needs to put into practice what he preaches - it's not a woman MDs job to be telling the Mayo Clinic to stop this for the last 15 years - sending Dr. Sarr articles about Carnett's and requesting that all common mass closure deformities are undone, and that Mayo stop the incidental accidental neurectomies.  Jill Beed-Smith has continued to whitewash neurectomies - the Surgical Services call abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES) = 'neuroma;' they can't tell this entity from a 'neuroma' from a previous surgery.  So please enlighten your own staff John Bundrick MD - not to touch the nerves.But the real problem is the doing of common mass closures - which further deform and irritate the abdominal wall muscles and other nerves - causing more ACNES.  They have to be undone, and no one wants to undo Dr. Sarr's common mass closures - because they don't understand why they were done in the first place, ie why he cuts the transversus - or any of the muscles - as Mayo Clinic has endoscopes and intraoperative ultrasounds literally littering the ORs in Rochester.  And Mayo Clinic should have OR 'help' able to use them - not 3-month wonder interns and black medical students imported from God-only-knows-where.  But you also have to have a SURGICAL CONSENT to operate on ACNES.  And you have to tell Dr. Sarr that if the pain goes away with a 2% lidocaine injection, then it was not a 'neuroma.'  Mayo Clinic has John Bundrick but the neurectomies haven't stopped; there are probably some scheduled for today's OR - under 'neuroma.'  Check the schedule.   Removing abdominal nerves is painful, not reassuring, and causes skin atrophy and loss of sensation in areas of the body where people like to exercise their 50 SHADES options.  The common mass closure is so deforming, and painful, that you have to wear loose clothing - it takes all the swimming suit options.  It makes you ashamed of your body, ashamed that you fell for this 'take,' and ashamed to be a woman - where guys would try this.  Where is the Renaissance man?  John Bundrick MD -- you are not correctly managing ACNES at Mayo Clinic.  You need to undo all the common mass closure deformities done for obsolete neurectomies because your Surgical Service can't tell a 'neuroma' from an entrapped nerve, and can't do a Carnett's test - and you need to keep these patients out of the OR by correct triage.  Plastics can't be turfing ACNES to Dr. Sarr.  This wouldn't be so bad except that it occurs so commonly.  Carnett, in the early 20th century, claimed to have seen three patients per week with this diagnosis, and as many as three per day in consultations sessions - the problem is that when Dr. Sarr sees these patients, he schedules them for his suddenly available OR slot and painfully deforms them with an obsolete procedure - they are not urgent procedures - or procedures to 'get in' before the next flight out.  This 'practice' should have gone out in the early 20th century - and still is going on in the early 21st century at Mayo Clinic.  Dr. Bundrick looks the other way for this quota procedure, while an objecting woman MD gets served 'defamation' suit papers from Dr. Sarr & Mayo Clinic.  Dr. Bundrick doesn't answer his mail, nor arrange for the Surgical Services to stop the butchery - Sarr charges about $1000 to remove a nerve and practice a common mass closure.  And the sadistic surgical resident staff love the practice - they don't know a Carnett's test from a Kocher maneuver.When a patient is seen for abdominal pain without other clinically significant symptoms, ACNES should be high on the list of likely diagnoses - the nurses should be able to triage this at Mayo.  But a woman patient shouldn't have to diagnose herself, inject herself - or deal with the ignorant Sarrisms.  Complete relief of the pain by the anesthetic agent establishes the diagnosis and is therapeutic - doesn't deform the abdominal wall further to create more ACNES.  Almost everyone who has written about abdominal wall pain overlooks the diagnosis . . . but that does not excuse the ignorance or the anachronistic surgical behaviors at Mayo continuing long past the early 20th century.  This wouldn't be on ripoff if John Bundrick would answer his mail, and assure that no women is in the Rochester St. Mary's OR this morning for a neurectomy with common mass closure. ",Doctors

										The Mayo Clinic is performing unnecessary neurectomies, for fictional 'neuromas,' when women present with symptoms of classic chronic abdominal wall pain - which was recently (2011) written up in The Mayo Clinic Proceedings by Dr. John Bundrick as a non-surgical problem requiring some medical judgment - not a scalpel.  Dr. Bundrick's article - Concise Review for Clinicians: Clinical Pearls in General Internal Medicine - comes complete with all the workup & tests that are supposed to be classic Mayo Clinic & ordered for this condition.  But that's not what happens on the Surgery Service.  If you show up at Mayo Clinic with chronic abdominal wall pain in a quarter-size area with a trigger point (classic presentation) - you will get quite another treatment - especially if the insurance card looks 'good to go.'  You won't even get weighed before the OR schedule is brought up - for the glory of Mayo Clinic and all that furniture.  BMI isn't relevant.  The Rochester Plastics Service can't recognize ACNES = abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome.  They turf to Sarr - without the guy that you had the appointment with even entering the room.  And no MAYO CLINIC staff member seems ready to really listen, try an injection, and try not to cut.  This ACNES is a Kaiser diagnosis - where they have a code - but not a Mayo Clinic diagnosis apparently - just a write-up - no code is given by Dr. Bundrick - who doesn't even discuss the surgery or the wrong surgery for this clinical pearl diagnosis.  Dr. Sarr doesn't get 'clinical pearls,' they don't translate as surgical fees.  Chronic abdominal wall pain due to nerve entrapment is a common problem in old incisions - occurring after the first post-op visit, sometimes after the first year - and it occurs after sports over-exertion or injuries to the abdominal wall.  It's a NFL problem - but Mayo Clinic sees it only as a get the girl naked problem - trash Dr. Oldenburg's competition; she can do better on a test, we can show her who's boss and deform her for life.  Not enough pin-ups in the guy's locker areas?  Not enough gropes for the male black medical students, or the visiting students who have to get a 'cut' in?  No brains?Instead of getting a Carnett's test, when you have insurance, you get the Sarr assault treatment - scheduled for the OR slot that he just found open - because he flies in and out of Rochester too much for any real patient care or diagnosis.  Despite the MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS, you don't get an injection, a thoughtful differential, a complete blood count (CBC), a good exam, OR ANYTHING ELSE IN THE ARTICLE - just a command to 'pick a resident' - and you say 'NO' and 'NO MUSCLES, NO NERVES,' 'NO RESIDENT' - but Dr. Sarr does not hear.   You don't get to pick a-e; that was just for the publication, for the PR to get 'suckers' to Mayo Clinic.Jill Beed-Smith, the Chief Legal Counsel, does not read the Mayo Clinic Proceedings - she can justify deforming a woman's abdomen - no problem - this case is now resolved, and not resolved.  The 'neuroma' surgeries have not stopped - which is the real problem - that the residents, interns, and students are supposed to read on the computers what Dr. Sarr really does for chronic abdominal wall pain - the f. option.   Even if you have friends at Mayo Clinic from Medical School, they do not help with proper triage, workup, or care - they are self-serving.  It's all for the money - all to cut - all to see a girl naked and drugged out - that's the only thing that produces an endorphin 'high' in Rochester.  Dr. Sarr will then pick the worst resident, the worst medical student, and the worst anesthesia guy that he never sent the patient to get a consult with.  You couldn't meet this guy with a coffee cup in hand, but are supposed to meet him naked with a sheet.  The anesthesia people at Mayo Clinic are so desperate that they don't mind the omission of a consult - they just write what Dr. Sarr tells them to - without really talking to the patient - or they come when you have no clothing and no contacts on to say something unintelligible - so you can't see how ugly they are, how jerky, how nerdy, and won't understand the plan to walk out.  It's a horrible ruse, a horrible 'take,' and a horrible con - no one checks that there is no consent - no discussion - and no plan except to CUT.  The Nursing Supervisor should stop these cases, but she won't because it is Dr. Sarr - who has special clearances, special powers, and special surgeries.  You will be in lifelong pain after Dr. Sarr removes your abdominal nerves, and very emotionally & physically scarred up - he hates women - the epitomie of misogynistic.  Dr. Oldenburg thinks this funny - he's getting back for that one test you did better than he did on - after which he decided to marry the girl from college who would never challenge him.  But this is still SICK.  Boys being boys.  And the workup, the diagnosis - it's published - all you have to do is read and follow the d. = Carnett's test option.  Warner Andrew Oldenburg MD should help when a classmate comes to MAYO CLINIC; at the very least mention of his, and other physician names, should trigger more careful care, differential, and workup - at the very least the workup that is in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings.  But it doesn't - it triggers more aggressive behaviors.  Warner Oldenburg should be coming to weddings, not trying to help undo unwanted Mayo Clinic procedures and gaffes - a classmate getting endless plastic surgeries to undo cutting all her abdominal muscles for 'fun.'  There's competition, and there's insanity - common mass closure treatment for abdominal wall nerve entrapment is insanity.  It's like shooting up your competition - couldn't do better on a test - then cut out the nerves of your fellow students - surgery is accredited harm at Mayo Clinic.  The nerves are for?  The Pathology resident to practice dictating 'normal?'  But then you 'undo' that procedure the next day, or the next OR schedule - you don't try to cover it up with legal suing of the patient for defamations, or canceling the email of the patient administratively.  Sarr may sign off, but the common mass closure deformity needs to be undone by that Plastic guy that turfed to Sarr.  Patients come expecting the Bundrick 'clinical pearls' workup, and get the one road to the OR.  Dr. Bundrick needs to write how to undo not doing a Carnett's test - but at the very least option (F) should be removed from the Mayo Clinic real list.  There's one list published, and one on Sarr's desk.    QUESTION from the Mayo Clinic Proceedings does not even mention the option of surgery: Which one of the following approaches would be most likely to yield a diagnosis?a. Performing a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan;b. Initiating an empiric trial of omeprazole;c. Checking for Murphy sign;d. Performing the Carnett maneuver;e. Performing a mesenteric arterial Doppler study[f. Undergoing an urgent 'neurectomy' without Carnetts test, lab results, injection or anesthesia consult (Dr. Sarr has an available OR).  This is added by Dr. Sarr.]  In real-time, the Mayo Clinic skips to option f.  With the same abdominal wall physical exam findings.  Dr. Bundrick, despite the mantra of 'teamwork' is never called to consult - and the secretaries all claim that 'MAYO TEAMWORK' on the phone.  Dr. Sarr will do a procedure and butcher a woman's abdominal muscles, cutting even the transversus muscle to demonstrate an unneeded 'common mass closure.'  And the insensate Legal Counsel will defend this, Dr. Bundrick won't say a word, Andrew Oldenburg MD will not get an invite to any wedding, and the woman will spend years trying to get this unconsented for procedure undone.  Transversus muscles should never be cut - and you don't cut nerve that are inflamed - you will just spread the inflamation.  Sounds like something from the Diary of a Wimpy Kid - just without the humor: The Ugly Truth - Sarr Rules. The Mayo Clinic never sees these patients post-op; Dr. Sarr will tell you to write him a note.  And the fraud goes on - the Mayo Clinic has been asked to 'undo' these procedures - even without being able to bring back the 'normal' nerves that went to pay for the pricey furniture and plants in the Mayo Clinic offices.  Everytime they change the pointsettas, you know that you are going to have to pay for that.  The Mayo Clinic needs to undo and repair all these neurectomies.  Dr. Bundrick needs to evaluate all these women and follow the results - and it's probably all women.   Dr. Bundrick needs to publish what really goes on at Mayo Clinic - what he really 'looks the other way for.'  Dr. Oldenburg needs to stand up for his classmates not being neurectomized for 'the money.'  Then a few more weddings might happen.  In the meantime, Dr. Bundrick needs to remove from the computer records, the cases that Dr. Sarr did neurectomies on - so that residents won't try this, or medical students claim 'HONORS' for this procedure.  Honors should go to the resident, student, anesthesiologist, or nurse who remembers the Carnett's test before the patient is given IV drugs so as not to object.",Doctors

Dr. Obeng went on to state, “We are in a business where we strive for perfection. We let the patient know that when we put up the drawing board, we don't always get what we aim to get because there are so many factors that come into play. The way I do the surgery, the way your body accepts the surgery, swelling, inflammation, genetics, the way you take care of yourself... so many things, so many variables. We let the patients know this: that we are going to go for perfection, but we're probably not going to get it, we're going to get really close. If the patient is not happy and I am not happy, we will think about doing another surgery but we will wait an adequate amount of time to makes sure their body has adjusted to the surgery. We have a revision policy so if after the body has healed and we both aren’t satisfied, we will do a second surgery for free. They only have to pay for the anesthesia and renting the operating room. Our revision rate is very, very low.”

When asked to address the complaints made on Ripoff Report, Dr. Obeng stated that he believes those complaints to have been made by a previous employee who is unhappy about being let go. Dr. Obeng stated, “The complaints on RipOffReport.com are not from patients, they are all from one man who used to work for me and is trying to sabotage me. He was someone who didn't have the integrity that I wanted, therefore, I fired him and he has been trying to get back at me for that so he has been making these complaints on RipOffReport.Com.”

When Dr. Obeng first moved to California, he worked for Lifestyle Fit while he was building his practice. He worked as a surgeon for them, but eventually had to leave after his practice was established.

Dr. Michael Obeng is the director of Miko Plastic Surgery and the Founder and President of Restore Worldwide. Worldwide is a program that he started in 2007 in Ohio. The program is aimed to go around the world and do plastic surgeries for free for people that really need them; where it will restore their confidence and allow them to have a better life. Most patients are people with deformities in underdeveloped countries. They take volunteers and no one gets paid. Last year alone they did $500,000 worth of surgeries for free.

Most of Restore Worldwide donations are made from clients and they also host fundraisers. Next year, Dr. Obeng hopes to donate 5% of Miko Plastic Surgery’s earnings towards that organization.

Dr. Obeng and his staff think it is good to be apart of Ripoff Reports Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program. They think it is helpful to have a place where consumers can go to see what type of business someone does and that there are people who monitor it. MiKO Plastic Surgery / Who They Are & What They Do For Patients 

Internationally renowned and recognized by colleagues for his great courage to tackle some of the most difficult of surgeries, superior poise, intelligence and experience, Dr. Michael K. Obeng is honored as, “the Surgeon’s Surgeon.”

Michael K. Obeng, MD, F.A.C.S. is Harvard trained, board certified and has been named among “America’s Top Plastic Surgeon’s” by the Consumer’s Research Council of America in 2011. Dr. Obeng is among the rare, and very few surgeons in the world to successfully reattach a limb and he is an expert in complex reconstructive surgery, hand and micro neurovascular surgery. His clientele comprises of royalty and celebrities, but most importantly, his pride and joy, comes from taking care of some of the world’s most unfortunate children and women with congenital and accidental deformities.

Dr. Obeng’s most recent award was received on November 11, 2013 where he was honored by the NAACP and received their prestigious Humanitarian Award for his work with R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Worldwide Nationally and Internationally. He specializes in cosmetic surgery of the aging face, neck, breast, body, trunk, extremities and genitalia. Dr. Obeng is among the rare, few surgeons in the world to successfully reattach a limb, and he is an expert in complex reconstructive surgery, hand, and micro neuro vascular surgery.

Currently on staff at the prestigious Cedars Sinai Hospital, in Los Angeles, California and the former Chief of Plastic Surgery at St. Elizabeth Health Center – Dr. Obeng brings years of experience and innovative ways of solving complex cosmetic and reconstructive surgical dilemmas. His clientele comprises of royalty and celebrities, but also includes some of the world’s most unfortunate patients.

Born into poverty in Ghana, Africa, Dr. Obeng persevered over unimaginable obstacles, and adversities whilst still striving against all odds to arrive at this culmination of professional and personal success. His deep compassion and care for patients derives from these humble beginnings, and he takes pride in treating each patient like family. Dr. Obeng travels to third world countries to donate his surgical services through R.E.S.T.O.R.E., a charitable organization that he founded in 2008. The charity provides free reconstructive surgery to abused and battered women and children, and people with congenital and accidental deformities. He also advocates for the underprivileged in the U.S., educating them about the post-reconstructive surgery options that are available after breast cancer treatment.

Dr. Obeng is one of the most sought after surgeons in the world. His surgical successes, cosmetic and reconstructive expertise, and charitable work through R.E.S.T.O.R.E. are often featured on local television news stations such as ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, Huffington Post, CNN, iReport, Telemundo, USA Today, the LA Confidential and in many local, national and international publications.

He has garnered many prestigious awards, including his most recent recognition by the NAACP for his Humanitarian efforts. Las year he was honored by his alma mater, MidWestern State University, for outstanding Alumnus in the College of Sciences and Humanities. Other awards include, the honor of a research grant from the National Institute of Health (NIH), and the coveted Herman B. Barnett award in Surgery and Anesthesia.

When he is not speaking on plastic surgery, he can be found around the nation giving his award-winning motivational speech, ""Perseverance."" Dr. Obeng has been dubbed by his colleagues as, ""the Surgeon's Surgeon."" This stems from the fact that he is not afraid to take on the most difficult of surgical challenges and cases which he humbly and honorably accepts with gratitude anytime he gets an opportunity.

MiKO Plastic Surgery / Statements from Medical Director Dr. Michael K. Obeng  ""Be very careful who you do business with. There are lots of people who claim to be plastic surgeons and they are not. The sad thing is, in medicine, anyone with a medical license can legally practice any medicine they want but if they do not have privileges to do surgery in a hospital, you should never sign up to have surgery by any person and always make sure your plastic surgeon is Board Certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.""

~ Molly Seals, Senior Vice President, Human Resources Service & Program Delivery - Catholic Health Partners, Youngstown, Ohio

“His main concern is to do the best he can for that patient and that’s why he is so busy because his patients bring so many patients.”  
~ Dr. Rashi Abdu, Retired Surgeon and Professor Emeritus, Northeast Ohio Medical University ""I can certainly understand why Dr. Obeng has been selected to be one of the top 5 recognized, when he was brought to this panel that has contributed so much, I am sure it was for his clinical skills,  which are outstanding, but beyond that, Dr. Obeng’s character really is what makes him the whole package…he is kind, generous, sincere and he’s done so much to give back, not just in the community but also in his homeland and I think it’s really the person he is on the inside that makes him the ideal candidate for this award.”

In order to provide the best customer service for patients, Miko Plastic Surgery believes that it is important to treat them the way they would want to be treated. Dr. Michael Obeng is the Medical Director at Miko Plastic surgery and he takes the time to get to know each patient personally. He provides them with his cell phone number so that they can reach him any time they need to.

After surgery, their office follows up with patients frequently. They contact patients the night after surgery, and the day following surgery to ensure that there is no bleeding or fluid collection. 90% of patients are seen within 72 hours after surgery. Dr. Obeng and his staff educate their patients about how to take care of themselves after surgery. If a patient forgets, or has questions, the staff makes themselves available to assist them.

When a patient comes to Miko Plastic Surgery they are provided with an intake form to fill out. This form is a questionnaire about the patient and why they are there. Once they are done, the patient is placed into a consultation room. Then, Dr. Obeng will consult and examine them. They go over the intake form and Dr. Obeng gets to know them as a patient and as a person. He takes pride in learning about his patients as individuals. After the examination, they will discuss any concerns the patient may have. They determine what their goals are and if they are realistic or not before moving forward with a procedure.

During the onsite interview Dr. Obeng was asked to describe their pretreatment process: “Once they decide to move forward with surgery, we pick dates. After we figure out the dates we do a pre-op and we go over the surgery and consent information. We go over what the surgery entails, the risks, the benefits, and your realistic outcome. Photos are taken that day and they are sent to the lab to determine whether they are okay to have surgery. Two weeks before surgery we go over everything again and then the day before surgery we give them a call to make sure that if they have any questions we answer them. Then the day of surgery they will come in we go over everything again we will mark them, meet and greet them with our whole team that will be in the surgery, go over the consent form one more time. Once everyone is in the surgery room we do something called a ""time op"" where everybody goes over what they are going to do during the surgery, and then we begin.”

To ensure patients needs and concerns are met, Dr. Obeng explained, “Patients come in and tell me what they want to have done. If I feel like they don't need it done, or that is it's going to make them look deformed of disproportional to their body, then I will refuse them no matter how much money they offer me. Patient selection is key. We ask the patients to tell us in their own words what is going to happen to make sure that we are all on the same page. I would not do a procedure if I did not agree with it.”

										 Dr. Michael K. Obeng Miko Plastic Surgery He is a (((REDACTED))) Beverly Hills Beverly Hills, California NOTICE: About the Report below.  Ripoff Report (((REDACTED))) the offending words because we found what was posted to be false. If the posting was true, there would have been a police Report. The claims were ridiculous. Ripoff Report was not sent any evidence for the claims the author of the Report below made – this could be a client that had buyer’s remorse or could be a competitor. AS a matter of policy, when a business joins the Corporate Advocacy, Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program, .. Ripoff Report emailed everyone that filed a complaint so MiKO Plastic Surgery could make things right with them, .. as our program calls for our members to err on the side of the customer. The customer never responded to our request so the member business could make things right with them.. It is our opinion, the Report is bogus.

I went to the Beverly Hills location on LaCienega and Wilshire. The consultants were nice and great. They brought Dr. Obeng to be my surgeon. As soon as the consultant left the room, this CROOK tried to steal me!! He said he has an office in Beverly Hills and he could do my surgery there cheaper!! Hey don't get me wrong, I love to save money or get more for my money; but when an African American Guy tried to cheat his own people and boss; how can I trust him. He is a doctor? where are his ethics? I tell You; I hated the experience! I ran out as soon as I could!! What a JERK!  Ripoff Report Verified™ REVIEW:

Dr. Obeng went on to state, “We are in a business where we strive for perfection. We let the patient know that when we put up the drawing board, we don't always get what we aim to get because there are so many factors that come into play. The way I do the surgery, the way your body accepts the surgery, swelling, inflammation, genetics, the way you take care of yourself... so many things, so many variables. We let the patients know this: that we are going to go for perfection, but we're probably not going to get it, we're going to get really close. If the patient is not happy and I am not happy, we will think about doing another surgery but we will wait an adequate amount of time to makes sure their body has adjusted to the surgery. We have a revision policy so if after the body has healed and we both aren’t satisfied, we will do a second surgery for free. They only have to pay for the anesthesia and renting the operating room. Our revision rate is very, very low.”

When asked to address the complaints made on Ripoff Report, Dr. Obeng stated that he believes those complaints to have been made by a previous employee who is unhappy about being let go. Dr. Obeng stated, “The complaints on RipOffReport.com are not from patients, they are all from one man who used to work for me and is trying to sabotage me. He was someone who didn't have the integrity that I wanted, therefore, I fired him and he has been trying to get back at me for that so he has been making these complaints on RipOffReport.Com.”

When Dr. Obeng first moved to California, he worked for Lifestyle Fit while he was building his practice. He worked as a surgeon for them, but eventually had to leave after his practice was established.

Dr. Michael Obeng is the director of Miko Plastic Surgery and the Founder and President of Restore Worldwide. Worldwide is a program that he started in 2007 in Ohio. The program is aimed to go around the world and do plastic surgeries for free for people that really need them; where it will restore their confidence and allow them to have a better life. Most patients are people with deformities in underdeveloped countries. They take volunteers and no one gets paid. Last year alone they did $500,000 worth of surgeries for free.

Most of Restore Worldwide donations are made from clients and they also host fundraisers. Next year, Dr. Obeng hopes to donate 5% of Miko Plastic Surgery’s earnings towards that organization.

MiKO Plastic Surgery / Statements from Medical Director Dr. Michael K. Obeng  ""Be very careful who you do business with. There are lots of people who claim to be plastic surgeons and they are not. The sad thing is, in medicine, anyone with a medical license can legally practice any medicine they want but if they do not have privileges to do surgery in a hospital, you should never sign up to have surgery by any person and always make sure your plastic surgeon is Board Certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery."" 

~ Dr. Michael K. Obeng MiKO Plastic Surgery / Statements from Colleague  "" “He is an individual that is very passionate in those things that he believes very much in spreading hope, healing and re constructive opportunities for individuals.”  
~ Molly Seals, Senior Vice President, Human Resources Service & Program Delivery - Catholic Health Partners, Youngstown, Ohio

“His main concern is to do the best he can for that patient and that’s why he is so busy because his patients bring so many patients.”  
~ Dr. Rashi Abdu, Retired Surgeon and Professor Emeritus, Northeast Ohio Medical University ""I can certainly understand why Dr. Obeng has been selected to be one of the top 5 recognized, when he was brought to this panel that has contributed so much, I am sure it was for his clinical skills,  which are outstanding, but beyond that, Dr. Obeng’s character really is what makes him the whole package…he is kind, generous, sincere and he’s done so much to give back, not just in the community but also in his homeland and I think it’s really the person he is on the inside that makes him the ideal candidate for this award.”  
~ Genie Aubel, President, St. Elizabeth Boardman Health Center, Boardman, Ohio

“People feel he is easy to work with and he understands everyone’s walls, he is someone that you can tell everyone enjoys working with him because when he walks into the room, you can tell because everyone lights up with smiles and comfort around him!”  
~ Molly Seals, Senior Vice President, Human Resources Service & Program Delivery - Catholic Health Partners, Youngstown, OhioMiKO Plastic Surgery / Patient Care

In order to provide the best customer service for patients, Miko Plastic Surgery believes that it is important to treat them the way they would want to be treated. Dr. Michael Obeng is the Medical Director at Miko Plastic surgery and he takes the time to get to know each patient personally. He provides them with his cell phone number so that they can reach him any time they need to.

After surgery, their office follows up with patients frequently. They contact patients the night after surgery, and the day following surgery to ensure that there is no bleeding or fluid collection. 90% of patients are seen within 72 hours after surgery. Dr. Obeng and his staff educate their patients about how to take care of themselves after surgery. If a patient forgets, or has questions, the staff makes themselves available to assist them.

When a patient comes to Miko Plastic Surgery they are provided with an intake form to fill out. This form is a questionnaire about the patient and why they are there. Once they are done, the patient is placed into a consultation room. Then, Dr. Obeng will consult and examine them. They go over the intake form and Dr. Obeng gets to know them as a patient and as a person. He takes pride in learning about his patients as individuals. After the examination, they will discuss any concerns the patient may have. They determine what their goals are and if they are realistic or not before moving forward with a procedure.

During the onsite interview Dr. Obeng was asked to describe their pretreatment process: “Once they decide to move forward with surgery, we pick dates. After we figure out the dates we do a pre-op and we go over the surgery and consent information. We go over what the surgery entails, the risks, the benefits, and your realistic outcome. Photos are taken that day and they are sent to the lab to determine whether they are okay to have surgery. Two weeks before surgery we go over everything again and then the day before surgery we give them a call to make sure that if they have any questions we answer them. Then the day of surgery they will come in we go over everything again we will mark them, meet and greet them with our whole team that will be in the surgery, go over the consent form one more time. Once everyone is in the surgery room we do something called a ""time op"" where everybody goes over what they are going to do during the surgery, and then we begin.”

To ensure patients needs and concerns are met, Dr. Obeng explained, “Patients come in and tell me what they want to have done. If I feel like they don't need it done, or that is it's going to make them look deformed of disproportional to their body, then I will refuse them no matter how much money they offer me. Patient selection is key. We ask the patients to tell us in their own words what is going to happen to make sure that we are all on the same page. I would not do a procedure if I did not agree with it.”

In order to provide the best customer service for patients, Miko Plastic Surgery believes that it is important to treat them the way they would want to be treated. Dr. Michael Obeng is the Medical Director at Miko Plastic surgery and he takes the time to get to know each patient personally. He provides them with his cell phone number so that they can reach him any time they need to.

After surgery, their office follows up with patients frequently. They contact patients the night after surgery, and the day following surgery to ensure that there is no bleeding or fluid collection. 90% of patients are seen within 72 hours after surgery. Dr. Obeng and his staff educate their patients about how to take care of themselves after surgery. If a patient forgets, or has questions, the staff makes themselves available to assist them.

When a patient comes to Miko Plastic Surgery they are provided with an intake form to fill out. This form is a questionnaire about the patient and why they are there. Once they are done, the patient is placed into a consultation room. Then, Dr. Obeng will consult and examine them. They go over the intake form and Dr. Obeng gets to know them as a patient and as a person. He takes pride in learning about his patients as individuals. After the examination, they will discuss any concerns the patient may have. They determine what their goals are and if they are realistic or not before moving forward with a procedure.

During the onsite interview Dr. Obeng was asked to describe their pretreatment process: “Once they decide to move forward with surgery, we pick dates. After we figure out the dates we do a pre-op and we go over the surgery and consent information. We go over what the surgery entails, the risks, the benefits, and your realistic outcome. Photos are taken that day and they are sent to the lab to determine whether they are okay to have surgery. Two weeks before surgery we go over everything again and then the day before surgery we give them a call to make sure that if they have any questions we answer them. Then the day of surgery they will come in we go over everything again we will mark them, meet and greet them with our whole team that will be in the surgery, go over the consent form one more time. Once everyone is in the surgery room we do something called a ""time op"" where everybody goes over what they are going to do during the surgery, and then we begin.”

To ensure patients needs and concerns are met, Dr. Obeng explained, “Patients come in and tell me what they want to have done. If I feel like they don't need it done, or that is it's going to make them look deformed of disproportional to their body, then I will refuse them no matter how much money they offer me. Patient selection is key. We ask the patients to tell us in their own words what is going to happen to make sure that we are all on the same page. I would not do a procedure if I did not agree with it.”

Dr. Obeng’s cosmetic surgery expertise is requested by patients from all around the world.  Apart from local celebrities in Beverly Hills, routinely patients from around the U.S. and even international royalty comes to see Dr. Obeng from Miami, the Northeast (DC, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York) as well as South America, Iran, India and even discerning patients from Africa and Japan.

--------------------------------------------
										 Miko Plastic Surgery, Dr. Micahel K. Obeng and Veronica Obeng RESTORE non-Profit (((REDACTED WORDS PROVEN TO BE FALSE)))Beverly Hills, California NOTICE: About the Report below. Ripoff Report (((REDACTED))) the offending words because we found what was posted to be false. If the posting was true, there would have been a government investigation. The claims were ridiculous. Ripoff Report was not sent any evidence for the claims the author of the Report below made. AS a matter of policy, when a business joins the Corporate Advocacy, Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program, Ripoff Report emails everyone that filed a complaint so the member business can make things right with their customer, .. as Ripoff Report’s Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program calls for our members to err on the side of the customer. The customer never responded to our request so the member business could make things right with them, whatever their problem was, if any. This could also be a personal thing .. It is our opinion, the Report filed below is bogus. If the doctor was that bad, Ripoff Report would have many more negative Reports about Dr Michael Obeng. This Doctor and his fourth wife who has two children from two unknown men and now just gave birth to their first child together came to Beverly Hills to find fame and fortune at the expense of others. He has developed a nonprofit entity called RESTORE and has his public relations people promote him as a philanthropic person. (((REDACTED ridiculous and false text. Ripoff Report is leaving the rest of the text togive you an idea on how ridiculous this Report is. )))    This image of a ""nice guy"" is just a front to get people to help him for free, give him money and give him things. In fact right in front of me he admitted to friends that he had taken a thousand dollar donation to his charity and bought himself some things with it! He also admitted that he stole surgical supplies from a local hospitals to do surgery in his own clinic; he called it an ""early Christmas bonus""!! He also admitted that he was stealing patients from his morning job at ""Lifestyle Lift"" in Beverly Hills to bring them into his own office in Beverly Hills. Well, just be aware. Let's stop these swindlers and criminals who come to Los Angeles to steal, cheat, betray and get rich at our expense. Please let the authorities know so that he does get investigated! once a criminal and a cheat, always a criminal and a cheat! I would never recommend a penny of donation to his charity. Do not volunteer to work for him or to help him. Stay away from his office and his knife! We can't trust a criminal like Dr. Michael K. Obeng.  Ripoff Report Verified™ REVIEW:

Dr. Obeng went on to state, “We are in a business where we strive for perfection. We let the patient know that when we put up the drawing board, we don't always get what we aim to get because there are so many factors that come into play. The way I do the surgery, the way your body accepts the surgery, swelling, inflammation, genetics, the way you take care of yourself... so many things, so many variables. We let the patients know this: that we are going to go for perfection, but we're probably not going to get it, we're going to get really close. If the patient is not happy and I am not happy, we will think about doing another surgery but we will wait an adequate amount of time to makes sure their body has adjusted to the surgery. We have a revision policy so if after the body has healed and we both aren’t satisfied, we will do a second surgery for free. They only have to pay for the anesthesia and renting the operating room. Our revision rate is very, very low.”

When asked to address the complaints made on Ripoff Report, Dr. Obeng stated that he believes those complaints to have been made by a previous employee who is unhappy about being let go. Dr. Obeng stated, “The complaints on RipOffReport.com are not from patients, they are all from one man who used to work for me and is trying to sabotage me. He was someone who didn't have the integrity that I wanted, therefore, I fired him and he has been trying to get back at me for that so he has been making these complaints on RipOffReport.Com.”

When Dr. Obeng first moved to California, he worked for Lifestyle Fit while he was building his practice. He worked as a surgeon for them, but eventually had to leave after his practice was established.

Dr. Michael Obeng is the director of Miko Plastic Surgery and the Founder and President of Restore Worldwide. Worldwide is a program that he started in 2007 in Ohio. The program is aimed to go around the world and do plastic surgeries for free for people that really need them; where it will restore their confidence and allow them to have a better life. Most patients are people with deformities in underdeveloped countries. They take volunteers and no one gets paid. Last year alone they did $500,000 worth of surgeries for free.

Most of Restore Worldwide donations are made from clients and they also host fundraisers. Next year, Dr. Obeng hopes to donate 5% of Miko Plastic Surgery’s earnings towards that organization.

Dr. Obeng and his staff think it is good to be apart of Ripoff Reports Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program. They think it is helpful to have a place where consumers can go to see what type of business someone does and that there are people who monitor it.

He was someone who didn't have the integrity that I wanted, therefore, I fired him and he has been trying to get back at me for that so he has been making these complaints on RipOffReport.Com.”

When Dr. Obeng first moved to California, he worked for Lifestyle Fit while he was building his practice. He worked as a surgeon for them, but eventually had to leave after his practice was established.

Dr. Michael Obeng is the director of Miko Plastic Surgery and the Founder and President of Restore Worldwide. Worldwide is a program that he started in 2007 in Ohio. The program is aimed to go around the world and do plastic surgeries for free for people that really need them; where it will restore their confidence and allow them to have a better life. Most patients are people with deformities in underdeveloped countries. They take volunteers and no one gets paid. Last year alone they did $500,000 worth of surgeries for free.

Most of Restore Worldwide donations are made from clients and they also host fundraisers. Next year, Dr. Obeng hopes to donate 5% of Miko Plastic Surgery’s earnings towards that organization.

Dr. Obeng and his staff think it is good to be apart of Ripoff Reports Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program. They think it is helpful to have a place where consumers can go to see what type of business someone does and that there are people who monitor it.

The sad thing is, in medicine, anyone with a medical license can legally practice any medicine they want but if they do not have privileges to do surgery in a hospital, you should never sign up to have surgery by any person and always make sure your plastic surgeon is Board Certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.""

In order to provide the best customer service for patients, Miko Plastic Surgery believes that it is important to treat them the way they would want to be treated. Dr. Michael Obeng is the Medical Director at Miko Plastic surgery and he takes the time to get to know each patient personally. He provides them with his cell phone number so that they can reach him any time they need to.

After surgery, their office follows up with patients frequently. They contact patients the night after surgery, and the day following surgery to ensure that there is no bleeding or fluid collection. 90% of patients are seen within 72 hours after surgery. Dr. Obeng and his staff educate their patients about how to take care of themselves after surgery. If a patient forgets, or has questions, the staff makes themselves available to assist them.

When a patient comes to Miko Plastic Surgery they are provided with an intake form to fill out. This form is a questionnaire about the patient and why they are there. Once they are done, the patient is placed into a consultation room. Then, Dr. Obeng will consult and examine them. They go over the intake form and Dr. Obeng gets to know them as a patient and as a person. He takes pride in learning about his patients as individuals. After the examination, they will discuss any concerns the patient may have. They determine what their goals are and if they are realistic or not before moving forward with a procedure.

During the onsite interview Dr. Obeng was asked to describe their pretreatment process: “Once they decide to move forward with surgery, we pick dates. After we figure out the dates we do a pre-op and we go over the surgery and consent information. We go over what the surgery entails, the risks, the benefits, and your realistic outcome. Photos are taken that day and they are sent to the lab to determine whether they are okay to have surgery. Two weeks before surgery we go over everything again and then the day before surgery we give them a call to make sure that if they have any questions we answer them. Then the day of surgery they will come in we go over everything again we will mark them, meet and greet them with our whole team that will be in the surgery, go over the consent form one more time. Once everyone is in the surgery room we do something called a ""time op"" where everybody goes over what they are going to do during the surgery, and then we begin.”

To ensure patients needs and concerns are met, Dr. Obeng explained, “Patients come in and tell me what they want to have done. If I feel like they don't need it done, or that is it's going to make them look deformed of disproportional to their body, then I will refuse them no matter how much money they offer me. Patient selection is key. We ask the patients to tell us in their own words what is going to happen to make sure that we are all on the same page. I would not do a procedure if I did not agree with it.”

Dr. Obeng’s cosmetic surgery expertise is requested by patients from all around the world.  Apart from local celebrities in Beverly Hills, routinely patients from around the U.S. and even international royalty comes to see Dr. Obeng from Miami, the Northeast (DC, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York) as well as South America, Iran, India and even discerning patients from Africa and Japan.

Ripoff Report (((REDACTED))) the offending words because we found what was posted to be false. If the posting was true, there would have been a police Report. The claims were ridiculous. Ripoff Report was not sent any evidence for the claims the author of the Report below made – this could be a client that had buyer’s remorse or could be a competitor. AS a matter of policy, when a business joins the Corporate Advocacy, Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program, ..

Obeng just moved to Beverly Hills recently hoping to make a famous name for himself by cheating and defrauding the public. His not for profit R.E.S.T.O.R.E is simply a front. He is raising money through public donations to this not for profit entity and the funnels it into his own private acccount or spends it for his own personal needs! That is not just unethical and unacceptable; but it is also criminal. He has hired PR firms to use this not for profit entity as a front to paint the picture of a philanthropic person. The fact that he is an African Black man who has come to the USA and become a doctor and now he has a nonprofit is the angel! but what a scum-bag!! To raise funds for a nonprofit and the use it for personal gain and to use a front to gain publicity when this guy is cheating the public is an outrage. Be careful! please do not fall for this story! the guy is a swindler and a criminal in a holey outfit! Do not donate any money to his non-profit! Please if you know how to inform the authorities, please help protect the public by demanding a forensic accounting and an IRS investigation of the funds he has stolen and used for his personal expenses!

Dr. Obeng went on to state, “We are in a business where we strive for perfection. We let the patient know that when we put up the drawing board, we don't always get what we aim to get because there are so many factors that come into play. The way I do the surgery, the way your body accepts the surgery, swelling, inflammation, genetics, the way you take care of yourself... so many things, so many variables. We let the patients know this: that we are going to go for perfection, but we're probably not going to get it, we're going to get really close. If the patient is not happy and I am not happy, we will think about doing another surgery but we will wait an adequate amount of time to makes sure their body has adjusted to the surgery. We have a revision policy so if after the body has healed and we both aren’t satisfied, we will do a second surgery for free. They only have to pay for the anesthesia and renting the operating room. Our revision rate is very, very low.”

When asked to address the complaints made on Ripoff Report, Dr. Obeng stated that he believes those complaints to have been made by a previous employee who is unhappy about being let go.

Daytona Beach, Florida United States of America ",,386 255 4596,"Dr Mark Gillespy Gillespy Orthopedic Beware! Leg falls off after Hip Replacement! Daytona Money Man Dr Mark Gillespy! Malpractice. Daytona Beach, Florida"," Attention! Anyone considering having Orthopedic Surgery in Daytona Beach by DR Mark Gillespy. Dr Gillespy performed a Total Hip Replacement on me in June of 2011. He broadcast the surgery live on the internet and fielded questions from viewers while performing the surgery. He used my surgery a way to sell his services and it was broadcast live and then placed on the Hospitals website 24/7 for a year for people who wanted to give him 50K to do a 45 surgery on them...Here is the problem. DR MARK GILLESPY, the well known, often consulted, son of Thurman Gillespy and member of the prominent Gillespy Orthopedic Surgeon family in Daytona, is nothing more than a cash hound who did my surgery, got his money and vanished out of contact when MY LEG/HIP FELL OFF OF MY BODY while walking at home. I had complained to him after 8 months that I was having pain in my right thing, and he said "" dont worry about it"". By August this year, I began to have these episodes of random Hip Disclocation while just walking or caring for my children. If you have never had a hip dispaced, here is how it goes.1- You feel a sudden shift in your hip, which immediatley places you in a paralytic state on the side that is dislocated.2-You stop, drop, and stay on the ground, wherever you are, as you cannot move.3-You experience excruciating pain in your hip and leg, that I can only say is almost surreal and feels as if your leg was yanked off of your body like a Turkey leg is from a turkey.4-Call ambulance if near a phone, or ask for someone with you ( pray that someone is there) to call 911.5-Wait for ambulance.6-Ambulance staff lifts you carefully onto a stretcher, and roll you into the ambulance.7- Arrive at hospital, wait your turn while still in unreal pain, with your hip hangin off, and be put inot a room to wait for doctor.8- See doctor, explain what is happening, wait for them to sadate you, then have a few large people get on top of you and shove your leg back into the socket.9-Get questioned by the doctor, as you awake as to why my doctor has not addressed this failed hip replacment to begin with. I respond "" I dont know"".10-Sent home on crutches/ total process, about 5 hours.Sound bad? Well fasten your seat belt. MY DOCTOR, DOCTOR MARK GILLESPY of Daytona Beach, not only knew about the 1st and 2nd dislocations, but as I continued to have 8 more, yes 8 more dislocations in the next 8 weeks, he actually told the ER doctors NOT to treat me! I requested to see him after the 1st dislocation and was told it would be 3 weeks. So, I just kept having dislocations after dislocations, going by ambulance to the ER, until about the 8th time, I realized that DR MARK GILLESPY had indeed screwed up my surgery somehow, as I was beginning to get hints from the ER docs that this was NOT normal, that HE should have fixed it after the 1st dislocation. I insisted on seeing DOCTOR MARK as he is known, and got in. As I walked in his office, he stated ""'here is trouble"" and turned his back on me, instructing the nurse to put me in a room. He came in later and asked what the problem was. As I mentioned my 8 hip dislocations since he did his debut internet surgery on me, he interrupted me with a stack of ER reports and said "" I know, I have been following your ER trips""..?????????So I asked why the hell he has not done anything about this, he said ""there is nothing wrong"". You just happened to be a "" CHRONIC DISLOCATOR"".... ( I guess that is like a chronic ""cancer getter"" - one who is not worthy of treatment......When I asked if that was  medical term, he changed the subject and said he had nothing more to offer me accept a 20 minute sedated manipulation of my hip, outpatient, so he could feel around the area. I politely suggested that my 8 dislocations may require more than a glorified massage, like umm, how about you get off your lazy ass doctor and check me in the hospital and fix what you did wrong. He stated I did not need additional surgery, I discharged him as my doctor. I had 2 more dislocations in the week following  my visit with him. After 20 calls, I found a competent Orlando Surgeon who reviewed my records and agreed to help me. I met with him recently, he took one X-RAY and within 30 minutes he had it up on a screen, totally and clearly showed me what was wrong. The cup placement/angle of the new hip installed by Dr Gillespy was facing the wrong way. The cup was facing down, allowing ball in the cup to dislocate with almost no pressure. He immediatley suggested revision surgery to replace the cup and place it at the appropriate angle. I am schedule this month. To my great surprise, he then pointed to my other hip, and asked me if DOCTOR GILLESPY had mentioned to me that my blood disease (avascular necrosis) had now spread to my other hip???? I said NO! I was taken aback as Dr Gillespy had followed ny ER trips, looked at the XRAYS as he told me at my last and final visit, yet did not even tell me my other hip was being attacked by this disease. Thats called not revealing a known diagnoses, and one which can result in a permenant disability. Then, the competent new surgeon informed me I need surgery on my left hip at the same time my right is revised, to try and salvage it!Now thanks to DR MARK GILLESPY's incredible EGO, I will have been unable to work and provide for my family for 2 years. I have 3 children. Dr Gillespy knew what was wrong, refused to admit he screwed up, or tell me I had the disease in my other hip, and allowed me to go in pain and knowing my hip would continue to dislocate and my other hip would deteriorate and be destroyed if not treated, and he couldnt care less about it. I called the Hospital and told them I was the guy on Dr Gillespy's debut Hip Replacement internet Q & A session/surgery, and it totally failed. I requested that I be able to comment on the site about my results, or that they quit selling his services, and take the video off of their website. They took the video off within 1 week. Now, I have lost a couple years of work, suffered unreal pain in my 10 hospital trips and dislocations, and DR MARK GILLESPY continues to sell his 50k/ 1 hour Total Hip Replacements. He needs to lose his license and maybe go to jail. That is inhumane treatment and follow up, failure to tell me about a disease, telling ER docs to leave me crippled, etc..the list goes on. PLEASE DO NOT TRUST DR MARK GILLESPY. I have to try and recover my lost wages and all of what I lost simply because he would not admit he made a mistake. Sad.",Doctors

										.....  Dr. Sarr doesn't have to do a Carnett's test, get a second opinion, or even try a 2% lidocaine injection - and if the pain & swelling went away with the injection, then the swelling was not another retained prolene suture.  The injection is diagnostic and therapeutic, and Dr. Sarr never offers, options, injections, or the truth to patients - he wants to cut in the most brutal & deforming way.  You don't get back to anyone that contacts you regarding this abuse.   You've been watching this go on, and watching one woman MD take the 'fall' for objecting, and done nothing.  You need to review all of Dr. Sarr's cases for the last 15 years, and allow that any patient requesting be allowed undoing of the chronically painful and deforming common mass closure.  Why would you look the other way for this?  If you cut the transversus muscle it weakens bladder, child-bearing and the back muscles.   Neurectomies cause the affected sensory area to lose sensation, to atrophy, to have frequent skin breakdowns, and all the one-finger nerve pain needed was an injection with 2% lidocaine.  The common mass closure causes all muscles cut to atrophy, lose muscular strength, and to be deformed and painful - it causes painful severe muscle spasms of 3 muscles contracting in different directions.Dr. Sarr does not get consent or discuss these procedures, and Mayo Clinic Legal says this is OK.  How is this OK?  Even for women MDs, he doesn't not get consent, and just cuts.  Rule #1 of Surgical Training is not to cut into ANYTHING that you have not scanned or workup - it can be a tumor, it can be benign, it can be infected, it can be a parasite - you scan, workup, and then cut after getting patient consent.  Where did informed consent go at Mayo Clinic?",Doctors

										Dr. Michael Sarr (Chief General Surgery Mayo Clinic) has been unnecessarily doing abdominal wall surgeries for 'neurectomies' for the last 15 years at Mayo Clinic - painful abdominal nerve removal surgeries where he cuts the nerve out - for a benign condition of abdominal nerve entrapment syndrome (=ACNES).  Dr. John B. Bundrick hasn't said a word, and he's on YOUTUBE.    These NEURECTOMIES are also very deforming, uncosmetic, and unaesthetic procedures.  Abdominal nerve entrapment happens commonly in old incisions or after vigorous sports exertions.  One resident at Cleveland Clinic showed up in the ER with it, after he exercised too vigorously on his newly bought abdominal exercise machine.  And he was almost operated on.   Dr. Michael Sarr, however, does these procedures without patient consent, or teamwork medical consultation - quickie clearance. [continued below]....
									
										.....  It's a semi-urgent case for Dr. Sarr - to get to the OR before Dr. Bundrick sees the patient - which is like high school or junior high guys.  This NERVE ENTRAPMENT can happen in any old incision - even Pfannenstiel, umbilical hernia repairs, other hernia repairs, etc., or just spontaneously in children as they grow with growth spurts - Peds surgeons see it and try not do do surgery hopefully.  Sometimes Dr. Sarr justifies with saying that he saw some 'foreign material' - but it never shows up on Pathology, and he brings in only the worst 'help' - none of which will disagree with him.  Dr. Sarr's 'help:' 3-month interns and black medical students from God-only-knows-where stinking of cologne to cover the lack of showers.  No one introduces themselves by name, and no one admits the problem.Dr. Sarr admits that he doesn't have patient consent, or discuss, before he does these procedures - surgeon's prerogative at Mayo Clinic.  Sarr rushes patients to surgery saying that he has to be out of town by the weekend - a PAN AM SURGEON - and he suddenly will have an open OR spot.  PATIENTS ARE WARNED NOT TO SIGN UP FOR ANY SUDDENLY AVAILABLE OR SPOT AT MAYO CLINIC - THE SURGEON HAS PROBLEMS.  Dr. Sarr does this to get his required surgeries/year, as he does too much traveling to do any real patient care, workups; no time to check with Dr. Bundrick or for formal Anesthesia Clearances.  There's not even a formal Anesthesia Consult at times - and Legal doesn't care at Mayo Clinic - neither do the Board of Trustees.  The Mayo Anesthesia Department goes along with this - which is even more disturbing - as one of the treatments for refractory ACNES - before surgery - is a nerve block.  So Anesthesia doesn't get to examine and object, or offer an alternative option.  Anesthesia does whatever anesthesia Dr. Sarr wants, even if you say 'local,' 'no airway,' and isn't there something 'else' going on - what's the rush?  No patient gets a list of their other treatment options, or a choice of anything except maybe to lobby for the best intern or resident, or is told the complications of a neurectomy.  Informed consent doesn't happen, there isn't even CONSENT - which is disturbing to family members, who post-surgery, try to figure out what happened.  There are retained suture problems in old incisions, but you stop before the muscles or nerves in that Surgery - that's all one woman agreed to.  Dr. Sarr never sees these patients post-op; he takes them off his patient list - there is no post-op visit.  Then Jill Smith puts in the computer that things are resolved - for John Bundrick MD's secretaries to read.      John Bundrick MD never reviews these situations to see what is going on - John Bundrick MD doesn't know what is going on - there is no teamwork between Dr. Sarr and Dr. Bundrick at Mayo Clinic.  Jill Smith Esq in Legal backs Dr. Sarr up and whitewashes - Mayo Clinic does not have to obtain informed consent, or any consent, for a procedure.  This has been going on for at least 15 years - when one woman MD objected.  The morbidity, or complications, of the common mass closure alone are terrible.  And at least one patient has requested that this closure be undone - this closure is being used without any data on long-term followup or the pathology of long-term followup.  They don't undo these closures and publish the results, and patients requested the undoing of these closures en mass in the 1980s at some medical centers.  They were commonly undone at Rhode Island Hospital in RI.  Dr. Sarr doesn't read the literature, even his own it appears - he's a talking-head.  Common mass closures were thrown out in the 1980s for the sequelae of chronic pain and terrible abdominal wall deformities - the patients objected, and the surgeons had to stop doing this closure.  It's done to save a suture pack or two, to get a quickie closure in an emergency surgery with an unstable patient, or to allow four-handed medical students, interns & residents practice - while the patient is under general anesthesia of course, or the patient would have gotten up and walked.  The common mass closure was a 'bad penny' that came back in the 1990s, resurrected by surgeons who needed a paper or two on their curriculum vitae - calling some of these surgeon authors is an experience.  Common mass closure came back when surgeons stopped following their patients post-op; now the internists see the chronic problems & the pain goes to Pain Clinics - but it's all as unnecessary as the nerve removal was.  The unnecessary neurectomies, and the complications of the common mass closures, are the 'elephant in the room' at Mayo Clinic, in their literature, and at their conferences.  John Bundrick MD tells the world how Mayo Clinic treats abdominal wall pain, and Mayo Clinic does not do what John Bundrick publishes in THE MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS.  The literature on this common mass closure has very bad stats, no long-term followup - and the serious complications occur after 3 years - after the followup stops.  Most of the patients are male - not women or children.  It's the worst of the surgical 'literature.'      Complications that you NEVER SEE ON A MAYO OPERATIVE CONSENT, IF YOU SEE AN OPERATIVE CONSENT: Neurectomies leave patients with skin atrophy over the area of sensory loss, loss of sensation, and horrible 'dead' feelings in areas of the abdominal wall - Dr. Sarr does not see post-op to document any of this.  No one does a neurological exam post-op.The muscles that are cut will experience some atrophy, anywhere from 20-50% loss of strength and function, and the whole mess is a chronic pain problem.  Serious morbidity and complications of an unnecessary neurectomy done as Dr. Sarr does them.  And no one, even John Bundrick MD, who publishes the way to do the correct diagnosis and treatment in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, says a word.   These neurectomies are serious and dangerous 'overtreatment' of a very common problem.  It sounds esoteric, but Anterior Cutaneous Nerve Entrapment Syndrome - ACNES - is the most common cause of abdominal pain - and it is the most misdiagnosed and mistreated as none of the major surgical texts mention it.  WHEN A PATIENT IS SEEN FOR ABDOMINAL PAIN WITHOUT OTHER CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT SYMPTOMS, ACNES SHOULD BE HIGH ON THE LIST OF LIKELY DIAGNOSES - ON THE CLINICAL CHART.  But not for Dr. Sarr - Chief of General Surgery.Cope's Diagnosis of the Acute Abdomen does not have a word on this syndrome - but then an 80-some year old surgeon keeps re-editing, and even the illustrations are out-of-date & tacky, but the book gets 5 amazon stars from would-be surgeon readers that just don't know any better.    One woman MD told Dr. Sarr straight-out 'no nerves, no muscles' and it didn't work - and Dr. Sarr admits that he has no consent to do these procedures, or cut into muscles and nerves without more medical investigation and workup.  Dr. Sarr then closes with a common mass closure, for intern and medical student practice, a closure requiring that he cut all abdominal muscles, and sew them all together creating a deformity that women patients don't want - and they didn't want their nerves removed without a trial of injection therapy that works for most patients.    This is just doing surgery for the money.  Where the intern & medical student don't object to the lack of consent on the chart.  There isn't a training hospital that doesn't do this incentive: Honors for procedures.  The still-ambulatory children on the Peds Floors, after the guy medical students leave, go into hiding or want to be transporting like in C.S. Lewis.  And just for the record Warner Andrew Oldenburg MD (Vascular Surgery Mayo Clinic), women classmates of yours missed Honors for refusing to put classmates, and other patients, out without consent for a procedure, or for refusing to do an examination on a classmate for Rounds.  It's a common practice to get cases at Medical Schools - which the interns, residents & students go along with - they don't look for the signed consent or anesthesia consults.  No one stopped ANY of Dr. Sarr's procedures missing consents or consults.  Warner Andrew (that IS your name) while you were getting 'special' treatment to get to Mayo Clinic, and didn't object to anything even to marriage on demand, your women colleagues were silently enduring criticism, censure, and demotions of grades for saying 'No' to putting patients out without consent for procedures or exams.  Ultimatums should never be given: for marriage or surgery - the relationship and the procedure is wrong.  Our male classmates at CWRU School of Medicine simply did not care to see the suffering, to have compassion, to pause to think or say 'No.'  You can do anything to a patient without consent if you knock them out - neurectomy even.  The men, students to attending, regard patient care as their 'divine right' - despite informed consent.    Dr. John B. Bundrick needs to review all these Sarr Mayo cases for the last 15 years - to determine what 'repairs' can be done and why the procedures were even done in the first place - without all the options being offered the patient or physician-patient.  Andy/Warner you need to learn to help your women classmates when they need a 'friend' - we never gave you ultimatums - we said 'good luck.'  The correct treatment of this entity has been in the Surgery literature since 1972 - the anatomy of the problem.  Common mass closure can be undone, and this should be offered to all patients.  At least the deformity should be repaired.   ",Doctors

										.....  The Ohio House knows that the Medical Board falsely suspended hundreds of physician 'false positive' cases.  In 2003, it was estimated by then-Speaker Larry Householder's staff, that opening the 'confidential' complaints in the unresolved cases of physicians suspended for 'provisional' - some for nothing legal - would bankrupt and paralyze Columbus - the just legal filings and damages that would happen.  So the modus operandi is to let the statute of limitations expire on these cases, and never license the physicians again.  All that Mr. Whitehouse talks about is the 'statute of limitations.'   The Medical Board of Ohio, in the last 20 years, has acted to suspend hundreds of physicians on unverified 'confidential' complaints - and Texas can tell Ohio the problems with 'confidential' physician complaints - as they've been sued successfully for this problem, and lost.  The Texas Medical Board had a woman MD President until recently, whose husband was filing false 'confidential' physician complaints on her 'competition' for years until discovered - a number of physician lives were ruined, as it's very hard to get your credentials, reputation, and practices back after a medical suspension - even a false medical suspension.   No one knows the extent of the problem in Ohio, but in the 1990s Carla O'Day MD was having the medical licenses suspended of former classmates from Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine - classmates who did better than her and went to class.  Governor John Kasich has known about the stacks of false physician cases since before he took office - every other Governor, and State Medical Board, knows about the problems at the Ohio State Medical Board - as does Benton Taylor who won't answer his phone anymore.  Members of the New York State Medical Board knew that nothing could be depended upon that the State Medical Board of Ohio had acted on - when reviewing cases for New York licensure. In the 1990s medical license in Ohio were taken even for the physician objecting to the wrong care being done to the physician themselves - you could not question your own care without losing your hospital privileges and medical license for the personality disorder of not going along with admittedly 'bad care' = where you were supposed to be 'silent' for the problem.  Dr. Anita Steinbergh has been responsible for keep these cases going for most of her 20 years on the Medical Board.  Many of the cases had no patient complaints - they were political cases from the getgo.  Medical mistakes were seen as something that the physician had to 'lie about,' change their story about, or lose their license = the Ohio way of handling medical mistakes and errors.  Women physicians were not allowed to object to their fractures being treated by orthopedics who did not have the Board Certification to treat these fractures, orthopedics who Blue Cross/Blue Shield would not reimburse were touted as MDs that the woman MD had to refer to in order to keep or get her license back.  Re-licensure in Ohio comes with referral obligations to 'right' physicians.In 1998, the Medical Board admitted the problem to some of the physicians involved, promising to open their cases for 'reforms' if they would agree to 'no damages.'  The physicians agreed, and the offer was taken back before the revews got started - probably because the damages & liability of the State - after admittedly cheating multiple times in some of these cases - was something that the State would be liable for - no matter that the physicians signed legal non-suit agreements.  The statute of limitations is gone in these cases - and there has still been no reivew or dismissals.  Most of the physicians just wanted their reputation back and 'clearance' - to leave Ohio.  So these 1998 stacks were continued to the present 2012 - none are resolved apparently - Mr. Dilling has the list of physicians given this offer.Tom Dilling would get on the phone from 1998-2005 and threaten the physicians that they would submit, admit the case, or never practice again - even after the State had admitted 'cheating' in the Hearings on the case.  The State Court of Appeals told the Medical Board to solve one case in a 'different way' after throwing it out - that it was a physician-physician disagreement about bad care where the woman physician was ganged up on after enduring a bad orthopedic experience.Governor Kasich you need to open the 'confidential' complaints in all unresolved cases at the State Medical Board with no patient complaints - where the physicians were already offered the 1998 'offer' - and were as the Board put it 'probably innocent.'  What's your excuse?  Secretary of Commerce offer - where you will have worse fraud to handle?  ",Doctors

										This is for Warner Andrew Oldenburg MD about physicians caring for physicians, colleagues, classmates.  In Medical School - which I couldn't discuss with him because he got married and never was around after that - I got into 'big' trouble for refusing to work up a classmate to present him on Medicine Rounds.  And, I asked, but J. refused and gave me the reasons, reasons which the attending did not understand, but which I did.  So I flunked those 3 weeks on Medicine [which Dr. Oldenburg will get a 'kick' out of] simply because of this disagreement about a classmate's right to privacy, but I still got my Internal Medicine Boards on the first try.  In the present of 2012, I expect that medical students, interns and residents do not try to do care on an MD patient if that MD patient so requests, because, when you get to that point - you might request that same courtesy - not wanting your medical information in public domain when you seek any medical care - and it happens. [continued below]....
									
										.....  Things suddenly show up on Facebook with pictures.  Physicians don't present with easy cases, or they wouldn't present.  My MD father told me of his appendectomy as an intern at University Hospitals - he was awake and the fellow intern's comments, about his appendix size & other things, almost had him off the table.  My father doesn't have a photographic memory, but he can repeat every word to this day.   Physicians, from your Medical School class, or physicians from anywhere, come to Mayo Clinic for second opinions and 'quiet' care - so that details of an illness are not in their practice communities, so that their blood work and test results aren't all over the hospitals in town.  So that they can get a diagnosis or health check without being taken advantage of - not for TEACHING PURPOSES, or multiple student breast EUA, intubation practice, pelvic exam practice, or other resident experiences.  Physicians know too much about the process, and what can go wrong during these 'practices.'  Caring for a physician patient - who has a body of knowledge - tests physician skills in a different way, and often physician-patients turn out to have 'zebras,' or uncommon presentations of the very common things - which confuses everyone.  Rule #1 is never to take a physician's case at face-value; an abdominal swelling is never a retained prolene suture or neuroma.  Taking everything off for an unnecessary procedure as a physician-patient, because the attending didn't do the Carnett's test - is pathologic, cruel, misogynistic, immature, and 'boys being boys' - like an airport strip-search.    The Washington Hospital Center Physician published an article with guidelines for caring for a physician-patient in January 2003: (1) apply the same standards of care; (2) remain objective, (3) involve physician-patients in decision-making, (4) arrange consultations with other specialists for second opinions, and (5) be supportive as physician-patients are as scared, or more, than average patients.        Resident first experiences - the do one - should not be on physician-patients.  And mistakes done in those contexts need to be repaired at Mayo Clinic expense - by the attending.  Medical students, surgical interns & residents can't diagnose abdominal pain well, or at all.  And they can't cut, sew even common mass closures, close incisions without dog-ears, or sometimes even stand up in the OR - they are employees, but physicians-in-training.  Medical students, interns & residents are not to be doing the medical care for MDs, DOs, their Medical School classmates, or their Residency/Fellowship job competition.  This is unethical.  This is to protect all from unnecessary suits, malpractice filings, negligence because of distractions, Medical Board complaints, conflicts of interest & bias.  For instance, I wouldn't pretend to ever care for Warner Oldenburg's wife - that would be uncomfortable.  And if a medical student, intern or resident has a pressing desire to be 'in' on a case, they need to obtain the permission of the physician-patient.  'Ask and you shall receive' or get another veto, but learned how to communicate.          Physicians come to Mayo Clinic for expert care by experts - not to be teaching cases - not to have to file Medical Board complaints about receiving care that they never consented to by an intern that didn't have the experience for the case.  3-month surgical interns should be taking a crash course in Surgical Technology - so that they know that the instrument set was sterilized, the suture types & where the packets are kept for set-ups, how the blade is applied on the scalpel, etc.  They still don't know which OR to show up in let alone the instruments, the steps of the procedure, or the diagnosis of the case - they are learning & not experts.  They should not be doing the case, the incision or the closure - that's why they have a Mayo scissors.  Attendings should dictate the OR reports on physician-patients, having multiple 'revisions' on a physician-patient is not a good thing.    Physicians expect that a physician, not student MD, will speak to them to take a history, physical & order the appropriate tests - not do a 'fudge job' and start reminiscing about the 'glories of Mayo Clinic.'  Physicians expect that the day of the procedure, the surgeon will speak to them, or their family member getting the surgery or procedure - not be drinking coffee, gossiping, or coming off last night's dinner party drinks.  No one should be drinking before procedures - that means the Chief of Surgery, the Vascular Surgeons, the students, interns & residents.  Nothing is more disturbing than to hear that the physician, or surgeon, was at a dinner party last night - because everyone drinks at those parties.  Surgeons need to be in an alcohol-free zone to care for a physician-patient because we have all seen physicians try to work, or call in, after too much to drink - when they should have excused themselves.    It's an insult to have to keep saying, 'No residents, no interns, no students.'  Physicians are not teaching cases, and neither are their families - because you can then write a horrible recommendation for a 3-month intern, first day on the clerkship medical student, or even the Fellow new on service.  And informed consent applies for physicians - you don't suddenly decide to remove a swollen nerve without the proper scan, intraoperative ultrasound, blood work, consultation, and the 2% injection to diagnose & treat anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment.  The physician will not understand.When care is provided by students, interns & residents who haven't got the experience of even the physicians that the physician has consulted at home - things get unreliable.  Physician-patients have to depend that their physicians are reliable.  Professional courtesy to physicians HAS TO INCLUDE that Mayo Clinic attending staff provide the physician's care.  No physician comes to Mayo Clinic for the medical students, interns, or resident staff - and having to walk out of consultations, or have multiple redos of simple procedures, fracture care, or surgeries, is not ok.  No physician can afford this, and it's not proper to have care from someone with less clinical experience than the physician seeking care at Mayo - that should be the litmus test as to who gets into the exam room.  And visiting MDs do not belong in MD cases - no one wants to share their care with the world.Warner Andy Oldenburg MD - your classmates from Medical School expect that when we seek consultation at Mayo Clinic we will get the real 'deal,' not be misdiagnosed so that someone can get a surgery to fill a suddenly 'open' OR slot without the proper scans or consultations, and that there will be follow up exams and the proper blood work before any procedure or guessed diagnosis.  Not everything that looks 'neuroma,' is 'neuroma.'  And you don't operate on neuromas.  Physicians can't do all the care for themselves - and would like to close their own incisions, but a medical student with no experience is a nightmare - and you know this.  And if we didn't have to have that procedure in the first place, because the Chief didn't read his copy of Surgery, or his 2011 issue of The Mayo Clinic Proceedings, we might never speak to you again.  Health is too precious to waste a minute of it with someone who isn't reliable.    ",Doctors

										Governor Kasich campaigned in 2010 to 'fix' the catch-22s at the State Medical Board of Ohio - and not by appearing on MEET THE PRESS - where they always ask him the wrong questions.  Prior to that, from 1990-2010, the State Medical Board of Ohio took hundreds of physician medical licenses, based on 'confidential' complaints & provisional misinformation (anyone can misinform about a physician in Ohio ie someone who doesn't know the physician, or has never met the physician).  There's no checking on the credentials of complainants that sign 'confidential' physician complaints in Ohio.  Physicians don't have to have patient care complaints either, or fulfill any legal definition of why their medical license should be taken in Ohio.  Medical licenses are taken on a 'provisional' impairment basis, like a 'provisional personality disorder' (where you don't have to have criteria for the disorder), at drunken orgy sessions of the Medical Board where they just get angry that a woman MD has disagreed with their male 'friend.'  The Ohio State Medical Board never returns these licenses after the 'confidential' - which no one really knows or knew, was never proven - because no one really knows that there never was a case.  They just don't answer their phone - which Governor Kasich allows.  When you call the Ohio Medical Board - they are still 'looking for a case' -  or they don't pick up their phone for the last 7 years and so many months - which they are allowed to do legally in Ohio.  In 2003, there were estimated to be hundreds of false cases of physician discipline in stacks at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Every other State Medical Board, and their respective Members, knows that this fraud is going on in Ohio - that for the last 20 years medical licenses have been taken for some pretty strange & bizarre things.  Every other Governor knows - even Romney.The Speaker of the Ohio House in 2003, Larry Householder, was not going to put through a Bill to allow physicians to get their 'confidential' complaints in these past cases - as it was estimated that the damages would bankrupt Ohio within a month - there were that MANY false cases of licensure suspension & discipline on the basis of misinformation & false testimony - cases that were known to be obviously 'false.'  Judge Grendell was supposed to help one woman MD, but he wouldn't even call the Ohio Speaker's office - the woman MD had to, and be told why there would be no Bill for physicians to get their 'confidential' complaints in Ohio - EVER.  Even the most corrupt of Ohio Speakers recognized fraud and 'disaster' when he saw it.  The 'confidential' physician complaint process has been a disaster in Ohio - and every other state - because there is no statute of limitations in Ohio, and no way to rehabilitate these physicians and pay any damages for career loss, reputation loss, and emotional trauma - and get them back to work.  Jobs is what Kasich talks about, but not physician jobs - he is not going to get the falsely suspended physicians back to work -  no matter what the stupidity of what they were accused of.  Matt Lynch posters say 'more jobs,' but he is not going to write a Bill for physicians in his district to get their confidential complaints - so that the physician can solve the problems before they spiral out of control.  Patient care mistakes can be undone if the physician knows about the problem, or misunderstanding, as soon as possible.  And patients will file a complaint before they will try to discuss.In the woman physician's case, the Medical Board admitted that the orthopedic care that she got was 'boys being boys' care, but that she hadn't handled the bad care and bad behaviors well.  In Ohio, women physicians are graded on how well they handle malpractice done to themselves and their patients - that they lie about it well, change their story.  There are no medical mistakes laws in Ohio that mandate no-fault referral in these botched care cases - 'the boys' haven't found a way to make it legal, just a way to make the state pay for their malpractice - the conspiracy of silence.     The Ohio State Medical Board does not have to dismiss a case, even no-fault after so many years; they just don't answer their phone.  When you call the Governor's office, they tell you that 'he is not going to do anything.'  [November, 2012]  Governor Kasich can't allow anything to damage his chances of a Romney Cabinet appointment, and admitting that the State Medical Board of Ohio has continued to take physician licenses, 'provisionally' on the basis of unverified 'confidential' - as you can't verify confidential - and never had to dismiss any of the false cases - is pretty large-scale professional career fraud.  Governor Romney would be disturbed at this.  This didn't go on in Massachusetts under Governor Romney.  This would disturb the 'balance' of any Kasich budget.       The State Medical Board of Ohio has no procedural policy to 'get a physician' back, after they have taken their license for a period of time without a case, no law about liability damages per physician as in other states.  The Medical Board just says that you have to sign/admit the case, or never get your medical license back - even if the 'case' doesn't exist as in the case of the woman accused of a psychiatric diagnosis that had never been heard of before 1995.  The Ohio Medical Board attorneys harass the physician to ADMIT the case that doesn't exist, or never get their license back - even when the case is obvious fraud.  And the one woman physician has the added condition that she refer to the orthopedic who left her fractures to 'ripen.'  As every other state has found, there are DAMAGES when you, without evidence, falsely suspend a physician license on the pretense of discipline based on a 'confidential' complaint.  That's why most states DO NOT DO CONFIDENTIAL PHYSICIAN COMPLAINTS, eg Rhode Island, Massachusetts - the brainpower states won't let this nonsense go on.  And you have to have a statute of limitations that is at the longest 7 years - not 20.  Ohio Medical Board experts in the past have blatantly 'cheated' during Hearing testimony and been paid for this with state funds - one case the Board manufactured Rorschach test answers and a psychiatric diagnosis that didn't exist - paying both experts with taxpayer monies.  So if the woman MD admitted the diagnosis that didn't exist, she was still supposed to get psychiatric treatment - as the Medical Board Members didn't know that the diagnosis didn't exist - 1995-6.  The Medical Board Members just paid for false testimony, but never admitted that it was wrong.  Physicians in Ohio have to get out-of-state experts to expose the fraud at huge expense.  Paying for one expert, a woman MD's family had to put out about $50,000 - and the Medical Board still would not give her license back.          Prior to 1990, the State Medical Board had to have evidence, and a proven case - or multiple VERIFIED patient complaints - to take a medical license.  After 1990, everything could be 'provisional,' based on hearsay, based on complaints from colleagues that the physician had to disagree with because they were out-of-date.  This went on also in Texas, and New York, until recently.  Both states have done reforms of procedural policy at their respective State Medical Boards -- after being sued successfully.  You can no longer file an 'anonymous' physician complaint in Texas, but you can in Ohio.   One case in Ohio illustrates this mess, and the lack of any procedural policy to dismiss ANY false case at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Unlike any other crime, or anything, there is no statute of limitations with the State Medical Board - they just change the 'confidential.'  And Governor Kasich does not get this.The case:  In the 1990s, one woman physician in Ohio complained that a certain orthopedic at a hospital in Ohio was leaving fractures to 'ripen to excrescence' as a way of getting surgeries - any casts were applied without stockingette padding - again to get a surgery after the cast had to be removed for swelling, infection & skin breakdown - this orthopedic turned out to have a lot of surgical infections.  This is unethical torture, and should have been stopped by the hospital, but it wasn't as things went outpatient at the time - and he had a wife on the Hospital Board - whose monied family runs a Capital Management Company in Columbus.  So the lack of casting of a wrist fracture went on for almost 3 weeks while the male orthopedic partied, drank, played polo and shopped for polo ponies - physically he was around the Cleveland area, and the hospital, watching the woman's fracture collapse saying 'nothing to do.'  At one point he got on the phone drunk (MALE physicians can drunk-dial in Ohio - it's just 'boys being boys'), and talked about the woman MD not liking his 'personal habits,' but he wasn't going to refer her.  And you can eventually get someone to refer, or believe you, but it took 3 weeks in this situation.  The x-ray was clearly a fracture from the start, but the orthopedic was playing with her as she hadn't referred enough patients, etc.  The woman had to herself supply the initial splint, and order the initial x-rays.  This orthopedic had also been kicked out of another Community Hospital previously - for the same neglect of normal care - he's now at Euclid Meridia Hospital.  Other orthopedics on staff at two hospitals would not interfere as the orthopedic had 'friends' on the State Medical Board of Ohio - he didn't have to cast, refer, send records, or consult.  The complaint was that the woman MD could not get her records, was not allowed to be referred - the orthopedic told anyone that asked that the woman MD did not 'deserve' care - and the comments and harassments continued after the woman MD finally got the fracture casted by another orthopedic.  The complications went on for over a year.  The Mayo Clinic had to help save the hand, and this speaks badly for Ohio orthopedic care - care that the State Medical Board allows 'friends' to do.  Salvage orthopedic care from Ohio has to go to the Mayo Clinic - the problems are so bad.  In Ohio there are 'pill-mill' and 'cast-free' physicians - Governor Kasich has only gone after the pill-mill.  The woman MD first called the Medical Board, asking that one of the 'friend' Board Members help her - that didn't work.  One Member friend, Carla O'Day MD, was supposed to cover this up by seeing the woman MD in the hospital ER - but the woman MD got transferred down to University Orthopedics.  The Medical Board was aware that the male orthopedic would do bad care, let him do the bad care, and would not stop it preventively - and tried to cover it up by having a Board Member see the problem and diagnose the woman as 'crazy' from the getgo.    After the woman MD complained nothing happened for a year until she again tried to get her records and the orthopedics to sign-off.  The second Ohio orthopedic had done an 'experimental' cast, making a bad situation worse.  Then the woman MDs medical license was taken for a 'personality disorder' - that she would complain about another more senior male MD.  Translation: so that she wouldn't sue the orthopedics - not that she could.  Now the problem is that Mr. Whitehouse at the State Medical Board is worried about his statute of limitations - but even he admits that it is long gone - but he's not going to pay damages for false processing of a case.  That would make Governor Kasich blame him for the problem.  The Governor needs to admit the problem, and that it was the Governors before him that looked the other way for the fraud.  The woman MD was only trying to get an official 'sign-off' from the orthopedics, and any records - to get them to the consultants helping her with the complications of the nocast and the experimental casting.  The woman MD's records only showed up at the State Medical Board years later. This case has gone on for 20 years, with 5 ordered psychiatric evaluations of the woman MD, two of which the Medical Board has admitted 'cheating' on.  The woman MD has taken every psychiatric test, and every test in the pipeline, and scored 'normal' - it is all on file at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in NYC.  The Medical Board's answer in 2003, was to order a sixth psychiatric evaluation on the woman MD - she had to send a bank check for $5000 and submit to two days with Dr. Phillip Resnick at University Hospitals in Cleveland.  The woman MD had to refuse this as the complaint is still 'confidential' - no evaluation is legal without the complaint.  And maybe she doesn't need a 6th psychiatric evaluation - this is abuse & sexual harassment at this point.  Abuse which Dr. Resnick - who should know better - has agreed to participate in.  There is never any informed consent with these evaluations either.  The experts just agree to give the Ohio Medical Board the diagnosis that they want - as they have done twice before and been paid for.The Ohio Court of Appeals threw the case out in 1993, but the Medical Board restarted it as they had no way to dismiss the case without fault in 1993 - no policy in their by-laws.  Every other state has a policy to dismiss a false case at their State Medical Boards - but those procedures all involve paying damages to the physician falsely accused - and Ohio doesn't want to do that.  But they don't even want to do no-fault dismissals, and let the physicians get a loan to retake their Boards and re-credential.  The problem: Governor Kasich doesn't GET that there is no STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Standards change, training changes, but fractures are still casted in 2012.  Ohio does not want to pay for the mistakes of Medical Board Members that let their 'friends' do bad care.  Carla O'Day MD resigned from the Medical Board rather than get investigated, but Dr. Anita Steinbergh and Dr. Lance Talmadge are still there.  Both knew about this orthopedic, and have let him continue doing bad care without a refresher course, or continuing education to improve his practices, or evidence that his orthopedic results & complication rate have improved.  This is handled by a 3rd nonpunishable pathway at many Medical Boards ie Minnesota.But unless you have a statute of limitations, there is no way to end FALSE cases at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  The last Executive Director, Tom Dilling, admitted that this woman's case was probably false, that she was most likely innocent given the lapses of due process, the rather obvious lies, and the admitted cheating by the Medical Board experts.  But that was in 1998.  In 1998, there was an offer that her case would be 'opened for reforms' - that she would not get any damages - but that she could get her license back.  The woman agreed, but the offer was taken back as no one at the Medical Board wants to be blamed for this mess.  Mr. Whitehouse wants to run for Attorney General, or something like that - and he can only have convictions, not innocent cases collecting damages.  This needs Governor Kasich's attention before any Romney offer, or someone is going to inform the Senate Committee that has to approve his appointment that he has been sitting on gross fraud at the State Medical Board for the last two years.  It's not just one case, it apparently is stacks of cases of such a number that justified legal damages would bankrupt Ohio, and the legal proceedings would paralyze Columbus within a month of a House Bill releasing 'confidential' complaints to the physicians involved in unresolved Medical Board cases.  Many physicians would accept no-fault dismissals to get out of Ohio - physician jobs in Ohio leaving.  ",Doctors

										Mayo Clinic surgeons have a problem diagnosing, and correctly treating, the most common cause of abdominal wall pain = ACNES = abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome.  This is a benign condition, where the nerve becomes 'entrapped,' or swollen, in anatomic sites where the nerve changes direction.It commonly - the pain - occurs post-surgery in all abdominal incisions (including Pfannenstiel for childbirth), after extreme muscle exertion or sports, and can occur in children as well as elderly patients.  Bariatric surgeons should get educated on this.  So if it is wrongly diagnosed, the very young, and the very old, can lose abdominal sensory nerves unnecessarily to Surgical Pathology - as has been happening all too commonly at Mayo Clinic for the last 15 years - as Dr. [continued below]....
									
										..... Michael Sarr hasn't gotten the message about this syndrome.  The Mayo Clinic Rochester misses this diagnosis all the time on the surgical service, trying to sell neurectomies, procedures, and get cases for students & residents - who when brought into the OR will just keep cutting as they have no idea what this 'syndrome' is - ask a Mayo medical student, intern, resident, or surgical attending about ACNES.  None of them know how to do a Carnett's test, know the sensitivity, specificity or false positive & false negative rate of the test (common stats), or how to do the physical examination for this - the patient can usually put one finger on the exact source of pain.  No surgeon at Mayo Clinic examines the neuromuscular foramen of the abdominal wall - they just go schedule a surgical slot and do unnecessary pelvics on women patients - and the nerves are not in the vagina.  They don't even know the number of these anterior nerve foramen - or location - or where to find a diagram (Google).  No surgeon does a Carnett's test at Mayo Clinic, University Hospitals of Cleveland, or The Cleveland Clinic - they just cut.   This condition has been recognized since 1926, and since 1972 a Family Practitioner - Dr. William V. Applegate - has put articles in SURGERY & other Journals (The Permanente Journal/Summer 2002/Volume 6 No. 3), hoping that surgeons will READ, RECOGNIZE, and not unnecessary REMOVE (the 3 R's) abdominal nerves with horrible incisions and closures.  ACNES is never discussed on Rounds at Mayo Clinic, University Hospitals of Cleveland, or even Cleveland Clinic - 3 bastions of male ignorance, ego, and brainlessness.  And no surgeon ever does the recommended treatment for ACNES - that would mean losing an opportunity to cut unnecessarily.  Almost all surgical literature, books & journal articles overlook ACNES in their differentials - it's not in William Silen's classic or any of the texts of General Surgery (Schwartz).  Abdominal wall pain is thus too often misdiagnosed as intra-abdominal pain, and the cause is right under the surgical fingertips - fingertips that haven't got a brain - and need the Wizard of Oz.      Dr. Michael Sarr, a Chief of General Surgery at Mayo Rochester, doesn't know how to recognize this condition, and commonly rushes to the OR - he's always got a canceled slot - with a pre-op diagnosis of 'neuroma' having not done a Carnett's test or considered this diagnosis - especially in women - where he doesn't bother to scan, consult with Ob-Gyn or Medicine.  Sarr can't discuss or do a good exam, he talks in circles about the 'glory of Mayo Clinic' while scheduling the unnecessary surgery.  You consent to a 5 minute 'look,' and he has a major procedure instrument set on the table - it's on his OR card. Since 1998, Dr. Sarr been informed that he does this, with no change in how patients are evaluated for surgery at Mayo - Sarr unnecessarily neurectomizes these patients and then closes with a butcher job common mass closure.  MDs get neurectomized without Carnett's test - with no consent.  Dr. John Bundrick describes Carnett's test in Mayo Clinic Proceedings as 95% sensitive (false positive tests occur <5%).  Dr. Sarr Does not read Mayo Clinic Proceedings:  Dr. Bundrick's article can be found at (even non-medical people can access this) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3012636/pdf/mayoclinproc_86_1_011.pdf.Carnett's test is basically having the patient do an abdominal 'crunch' maneuver with the examiner pushing on the tender spot - an increase in pain with tensing of the muscles is diagnostic for abdominal wall pain - patients can try this at home with a friend/family member.  Or have the patient raise their legs with pressure on the trigger point.  If you inject with 2% lidocaine, and the pain is relieved, the diagnosis is made.  Really HARD test to do.  Apparently it's hard for surgeons to do the proper administration of local anesthetic agent, 2% lidocaine, into the area of the nerve aponeurotic opening - you have to know your anatomy.  Ask a medical student/resident at Mayo Clinic the locations of the anterior abdominal wall neuromuscular foramen - there are 10 spots to be examined - they haven't had their cappuccino or latte yet.  The injection is therapeutic to reduction herniation of the nerve (which surgery can't do), and diagnostic if it relieves the pain (this sorts the nerve pain from pain/swelling of a retained suture).  Michael Rosen MD - the US hernia expert - doesn't have a clue about Carnett's test or injection treatment - it's not in his glossy picture ATLAS OF ABDOMINAL WALL RECONSTRUCTION.  Surgeons buy these huge expensive ATLASES, and carry them around to develop musculature, but don't read simple articles or learn patient exam neuromuscular foramen anatomy.  Why examine a patient when you can cut?  HONORS on Surgical Clerkships always go to the medical student who does the most cutting, not the medical student who brings the articles on ACNES or make the right diagnoses for the patient - this needs to change starting at Mayo Clinic.  Any medical student who lets an operation continue that the patient did not consent to, should be FLUNKED their surgery clerkship.  No one at Mayo Clinic STOPS Dr. Sarr's unconsented for surgeries - not the OR NURSE, not the SURGICAL TECHNOLOGIST, not the ANESTHESIA GUY, and CERTAINLY not the RESIDENT or MEDICAL STUDENT.   Nerve entrapments will have associated muscle spasms - which can be very painful - and the injection helps relieve this.  Dr. Sarr's common mass closure just worsens these muscle spasms if the patients are operated on - and he never sees the patient post-op to check the sensory loss.  The operations for ACNES worsen everything except Mayo Clinic RECEIVABLES.       Common mass closure is a butcher closure that leaves the wound muscles/fascia under horrible tension, with horrible unusual deformity & sensory loss, and sets up a lifetime of pain and muscle spasms (worse than leaving the nerve entrapment alone).  One woman MD has requested a take-downs of these nonconsenting procedures for 15 years now - with no answer.  Chief Legal Counsel, Jill Beed-Smith has no plan for Mayo Clinic to do this - she hasn't had her neurectomy yet.  Please someone, schedule her.  In the 1980s, all the common mass closures of surgical incisions were taken down at patient request - they may have less dehiscence (usually no better than layered closures), but at the price of terrible abdominal wall deformities and chronic pain.  Common mass closure was a bad idea in the 1980s, and an even worse idea in the 1990s.  Dr. Sarr has resurrected this horrible closure, and routinely closes his unnecessary neurectomies with it - a Frankensurgeon.  Dr. Sarr has the support of the Legal Department at Mayo Clinic in doing unnecessary neurectomies on patients = more procedures.  Jill Beed-Smith.Women physicians contacting Dr. Sarr have their emails removed Administratively, so that they can't contact him.  Dr. Sarr will attempt to sue patients & physicians, for the defamation that he removed their nerves without a Carnett's test (truth), or without even considering the diagnosis of ACNES, or an anesthesia consult for an injection.  Patients don't consent to these neurectomies, don't get anesthesia consults, and get 'knocked out' so that they don't object in the OR.  Patients just ask for an exploration & closure to make a decision - Sarr continues and removes the nerve - he won't inject even intra-operatively, and wait 5 minutes to see if the pain is relieved.  And the residents are clueless with scalpel in hand, while the medical students are texting & twittering.  Dr. Sarr admits that he has no consent for these 'neurectomy' procedures - Mayo Clinic does not have to get patient consent - and informed consent never happens.  Dr. Bundrick on the Medicine Service publishes the correct treatment of ACNES in Mayo Clinic Proceedings - but Dr. Sarr will not send the patients to him, or consult.  Contact Dr. Bundrick, and he doesn't reply or help (Dear John Letters go nowhere) - he just publishes the right treatment and has videos on youtube - his secretaries talk about the fact that they do 'teamwork.'  No one at Mayo Clinic knows the definition of 'teamwork.'  Dr. Sarr does not work with Dr. Bundrick + Dr. Bundrick does not work with Dr. Sarr = Teamwork.    Dr. Bundrick needs to help educate the Surgical Service, and help all patients unnecessarily neurectomized obtain repairs of their abdominal wall and the undoing of all the over-the-top common mass closures.  This was unnecessary if Mayo Clinic physicians did any kind of 'teamwork.'  Women physicians who have been attempted to be sued for trying to 'educate' Dr. Sarr, should be apologized to - how to do ACNES correctly has been in the Surgical literature for the last 40 years - to treat with a 2% injection and this should be on Dr. Sarr's OR card - STOP THE GUY IF NEUROMA IS ON THE PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS. 									",Doctors

										Governor Kasich knew that there were probably hundreds of false cases at the State Medical Board of Ohio from before he took office, with no procedural way to dismiss these cases and get the physicians back to work.  He campaigned to fix this.  As soon as the Medical Board admits they cheated, and paid experts to cheat, they stop answering their phones.  In one situation, cases run-through by Carla O'Day MD in the 1990s, patients are calling the physicians suspended through her testimony and wanting help - from harm she has caused them.  Help that these physicians can't give until their cases are resolved.  Carla O'Day MD is now the Director of Emergency Services at St. Vincent in Cleveland - she got rid of her competition by having their medical licenses taken for things that aren't reasons to take a medical license.  Physician licenses were taken in the 1990s for looking at someone the wrong way, for disagreeing with admittedly wrong care, for 'making too much of bad care' (reporting it).  Physician licenses were taken without allowing them 'care-to-function' if they had an illness, no fractures casted, no blood work, no cast padding or Physical Therapy.   Carla O'Day MD put through cases at the Medical Board of physicians who were her competition.  Physicians who had gone to Case Western Reserve Medical School with her, and had no patient complaints.  Patients are now calling suspended physicians, trying to get help about her.  She has had two failed marriages, and accuses everyone of a 'personality disorder' - ruining countless lives.Governor Kasich needs to get a review panel for the problems at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Governor Romney never caused physicians with no patient complaints false suspensions based on cheating.  The Medical Board will admit they cheated, and then not answer their phone for 8 years.  The Medical Board has no policy from the Governor to get physicians back to work - to dismiss the stacks of false cases even with no-fault.  ",Doctors

										John Kasich as a political soothsayer is a bit of a stretch.  Yet Governor John Kasich is who NBC's Meet the Press turned to as a RELIABLE political 'seer' recently (10/28/2012) - to predict Governor Romney's 'success' in the Buckeye State.  Governor Romney, as a political seer, is a bit like the witches in Macbeth - a theatrical device - but not very reliable except in the context of Shakespeare.  Nothing about Kasich is reliably predictable - Kasich pledged/promised, and campaigned TWO YEARS AGO to 'fix' the problem of the widespread abuses at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Two years into his Administration, he has done nothing but go after a handful of so termed 'pill-mill physicians' - who are hardly the problem in Ohio medicine - just the manifestation of the problem of the pain of 'bad orthopedic' results. [continued below]....
									
										.....  Wrist fractures are badly handled in Ohio - all over the state - and this led to one woman physician's medical license suspension for reporting this problem after having experienced how things are done in Ohio - which is unlike in any other state.  That's just one of the fraud cases at the State Medical Board wasting taxpayer monies for nothing.  With all the misused Medical Board 'investigation' monies, and case worker staff, Governor Kasich could have paid for the Ohio high-speed rail system without a penny from any 'Obama' incentive monies from the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009 - ten times over it is estimated.  Ohio could really use that rail system to just help parents send their kids to Ohio colleges, visit them easily, and get them home easily (for Ohio State Football games if nothing else) - it would help parenting in Ohio, and help Ohio kids stay in Ohio for higher education.  Not everyone lives within driving distance of Columbus, or has the option of a Governor's mansion for free overnight stays.  There are currently stacks of investigations of Ohio physicians with no patient complaints; complaints by colleagues for all the wrong reasons - jealousy from Medical School, competition, ex-spouse or formerly dated, to get out of paying the physician insurance monies, alimony - you name the excuse, it has been used in those states with 'confidential' physician complaint systems.  Not every Medical Board Member can see through this haze of complaints that can't be verified in any normal way.  This ruins lives in the meantime, and the ordering of a 6th-10th psychiatric evaluation - so that Philip Resnick MD can straighten out the 'psychiatry' of what is going on - is ridiculous.  Put Dr. Resnick on the State Medical Board to help the screening, the channeling, and the costs - but don't make physicians pay him for evaluations because no one on the Board has a clue about what is going on in a case.      In 2012, Ohio still has the largest pile of unresolved false physician disciplines in the US, an admitted problem by the Speaker of the Ohio House as far back as 2003 - Householder's office admitted the problem, and that settling the liability in those cases (as of 2003) would bankrupt Ohio in one month as the injustices were estimated to be so severe & the liability so real. The abuses by the Ohio Medical Board, and the Governors who just did photo-ops instead of their job, are at this point not even statistically collectable - it's all confidential.  Governor Kasich has continued the tradition of not interfering in things Ohio, in order to get appointed to a national job - but Romney never did this as Governor.  Romney has always made the health of his wife his decision-maker for seeking higher office.  Governor Kasich is so obviously angling for a larger political job, and Ohioans wish him well, but until he gets that 'promotion' could he please review all the false cases at the State Medical Board of Ohio?  Or set up a panel to do so with a timetable.If you call Governor Kasich's office, they tell you that he 'won't review the situation,' and if you keep calling they will 'notify the Authorities.'  The Governor is 'The Authority' in Ohio - and ending those cases - it is estimated - would put at least >100 more physicians back to work immediately - as well as their office support staffs.  100 x 4 = 400 jobs, 100 x 10 = 1000 jobs.  The medical licenses have been taken for things as non-patient oriented as the physician objecting to admittedly wrong care on themselves (the MD doing the care was a Medical Board 'friend'), and the physician asking to get their medical records out of someone's office - an MD who didn't have to refer, consult, send records, or do any billable work (orthopedics who don't cast fractures and ask you to 'change your story about them, as they have friends on the Medical Board').  It's all 'once upon a time' in Ohio, including Governor Kasich's unreliable handling of this situation.  Governor Romney needs a more reliable clairvoyant than Governor Kasich - judging from his own reliability in keeping campaign promises.  And all that Governor Kasich has to do is appoint someone like a retired Appeals Court Judge & MD panel to review the situations as to evidence - no laypersons who can't reliably evaluate physician decisions or problems.  All Governor Kasich has to do is think for a moment about a list of 'campaign supporters' that haven't gotten an appointment yet - good lawyers & physicians are on that donor list - including a stack of Cleveland Clinic physicians.  The 'confidential' physician complaint system in Ohio doesn't allow that the State Medical Board even reliably 'check the evidence' before making suspension decisions.  In one case the blood work on the physician, which would have proved that her bone pains were not 'exaggerated,' was NEVER done - a handwritten consult assessment of 'normal' was relied on at a time that the lab ranges on these tests were 'off' in Ohio.  The lab ranges were not corrected until 2002.     Julianne Margulies has a quote that ""Life is precious and you shouldn't waste a minute of it with someone who isn't reliable.""  At this point 'isn't reliable' includes Governor Kasich.  And the Medical Board could use a Good Wife quote as a way of handling situations:  'flyswatter instead of bazooka.' 									",Doctors

										Governor Kasich campaigned in 2009-10 that he would 'reform' the practices of the State Medical Board of Ohio - and it was total 'bull' on his part - total political talking-head-speak.  In 2012, Governor Kasich laughs in the background in his office when a woman MD calls on the phone - a woman MD whose license has been unjustly suspended for not going along with 'the boys.'  'The boys' being a euphemism for 'disaster.'  Governor Kasich doesn't have time to review, or order a review of this physician's admittedly 'wrong' case (the Medical Board has admitted to her lawyer that she is probably innocent - in 1998) - even though it's a taxpayer waste of money, the woman MD had no patient complaints, and when the blood work was finally ordered after 5 psychiatric evaluations - lo and behold, it showed the problem causing the bone fractures & bone pains.  It was a no-brainer commonest thyroiditis that there is and ever was (a thyroiditis that commonly affects women MDs, women runners, and women RNs = Hashimotos) - a commonest thyroiditis that the State Medical Board of Ohio couldn't recognize if it hit them in the face.  Commonest thyroiditis that a first-year medical student is supposed to 'get' on a test.  It was Endocrinology 101 that the Medical Board Members missed - they were drunk - after dinner drinks - paid for by the State of Ohio.The Medical Board of Ohio could not be bothered to do ONE complete set of blood work on the woman MD before 4 psychiatric evaluations - 2 that were paid for by Ohio taxpayers and cheated on.  These 2 evaluations, the Ohio taxpayers should ask for a refund of the monies on - from Mr. Whitehouse for continuing the false case and Governor Kasich for going along. The Ohio Medical Board could not be bothered to wait for the Mayo Clinic to finish their consultation and do all the blood work, before they acted in a drunken Emergency Session in 1992 - to suspend the woman physician's medical license for the 'impairment' of disagreeing about her own shoddy medical & orthopedic 'care.'  Care that she wouldn't/couldn't accept for ANY other patient of hers, she had to accept for herself or lose her medical license.  The Medical Board of Ohio does not allow blood work on women physicians - they don't 'deserve' it.  There's no due process at the State Medical Board of Ohio, and no checking on labs supposedly done through physician offices even at University Suburban Green Road in Cleveland, Ohio.  When the blood work doesn't come back, 'normal' is handwritten on consult sheets.  Beware of anything handwritten in Ohio, and anything typed - it has been edited.  Then the orthopedics without Boards described the woman MD in private testimony as just crazy - 'crazy' that she might want to SEE the blood work printout sheet from the lab - to make sure that the blood got to the lab - to check the evidence in a legal sense - to check on what was billed, or not billed, to BC/BS.  Patients in Ohio need to check on this, Governor Kasich needs to check on this - but oops - he's door-to-door for Romney and doesn't have time to do his job as Governor - to check that 'cases' at the State Medical Board of Ohio really are 'cases' and not just PR stunts.This woman MD - during 20 years of Ohio Medical Board investigations - every chart that she wrote on has been read and corrected for grammar - has never had one complete set of blood work, and her bone condition remains untreated.  But the State Medical Board wants a 6th psychiatric evaluation by a new right Ohio psychiatrist to cover things up - Dr. Phillip Resnick of course.  Dr. Resnick needs an instant infusion of $5000 to read the letters that the woman MD has written objecting to this mess - to no blood work - to fracture care by physicians who turned out not to have their respective orthopedic Boards.  There are no threats, just that the woman MD does not agree with this - as she was trained not to agree with this - as any physician in the US is trained not to agree with this.The State Medical Board needs reforms before the Governor visits one more house for Romney.  ",Doctors

										I would not recommend optometrist Kelvin L. Garner,  currently working at JC Penney in Lewisville, Texas  to anyone.   He used to work at the Target store at Park and the North Dallas Tollway in Plano but Target terminated their contract with him.  
While he still worked at the Target store, I booked an appointment for an eye exam with Kelvin L. Garner himself for 1:00 pm.  When I arrived there, I signed in and found out that Kelvin had already booked someone else for 1:00 pm.  I saw the appointment book and a name was written down for the 1:00 pm slot.  
He had no receptionist and so was doubling as the receptionist.  He gave me a form to complete and said he would be done with his other 1:00 pm patient in 10 minutes.  I completed the form and waited another 30 minutes until he was done right at 1:30 pm.  
I was not happy that he had double-booked as because of this I had to wait 30 minutes.  When he did the eye exam, he rushed through it and was not thorough at all.  On my right eye, when I was reading the bottom lines on the chart, he did not switch the charts back and forth to find the smallest line that was the clearest.  He asked me if I could read one of the bottom lines, and I could but it was blurry.  He then said that was good enough but didnt switch to another chart to find a line that was more clear.
During the exam, he kept going out to answer the phone and to speak with another person that had arrived for an exam.  I felt he should have had waited until he was done with my exam to handle these other people as this caused me to have to sit there in the exam chair and wait for him.  He really should have had a receptionist but I think he was trying to save money by trying to be the receptionist himself.
At the end of the exam, he dialated my eyes and told me to come back in 25 minutes at which time he would finish the exam. I walked over to the Optical Dept. at Target and looked at some glasses.  After 25 minutes, I went back to his office and he was doing an exam on the other person.   As there was no receptionist, I had to holler out to him that I was back and that I would be next door at the Target store.  I asked him to please call me on my cell phone when he was done.  He said he would.
I went out to my car to sit and wait.  Thirty minutes later, still no call from Kelvin.  I called his office and he did not answer.   I then called the Target store and spoke to the manager named Jennifer and told her I had not heard back from Kelvin.  She said she would check on him and get back with me.  
I waited another 30 minutes and did not hear back from her.  I called the Target Optical again and a lady named Julia sd she would go over and see if Kelvin was done.  The Optical Department manager then called me and said that Kelvin was still in his office and that I should come back now and wait for him.  
She said that he had already brought my prescription over to her and she had it right there.   I could not understand him doing this as he had not yet finished my exam.  She explained that he was not an employee of the company and she could not tell him what to do.  She said she had walked over to speak with him and could not get any information from him.  
It was going on about 4 pm now (three hours since my  1:00 appointment). I went back to Kelvins office and he was just finishing with another patient. I went back to the exam chair again and he checked my eyes.
I told him I did not think my right eye was check correctly as he did not switch the lines so I could see the clearest line.  He said that my right eye had 20/20 vision and I know this is incorrect as I have always had corrected lenses for both eyes..  He refused to re-test my right eye as he said he had other patients waiting for him.
I got up to leave and he walked with me up to the front and said I owe him a $10 co-pay.  I told him I was not going to pay the $10 as I did not get a proper exam as my right eye was not tested properly.  He said that if did not pay him the $10, he was not going to release my prescription.  I told him I didnt care as the prescription was not correct anyway and that I would go to another eye doctor.
After I said this, he walked very quickly back to the Target optical department where he had left my prescription.  He snatched the prescription off a counter and went back to his office.  I complained to the Target Optical Dept about what he had just done but they basically said he since was not a Target employee,  there was nothing they could do.  He is contracted with them.
In trying to set-up an exam with a different optometrist, I found that Kelvin L. Garner had already turned in the bill for his examto my insurance company.  I  would have to wait another year before they would pay for another exam.  
I called  my insurance company, EyeMed, to complain. They verified that he had already filed a claim with them  and was paid (even though he never gave me a prescription).  This was clearly insurance fraud.  They spoke with Kelvin L. Garner and he refused to release his claim even though he did not provide me with a prescription!
I complained to the Target store manager and was told they had numerous complaints against him for the same type of actions.  They were nice enough to give me gift card to cover the $50 that Kelvin Garner had fraudulently filed the insurance claim for.  
I filed a complaint with the Texas Optometry Board against him.  Also, on checking the Texas Optometry Boards website, I found that Kelvin graduated from an optometry school in Puerto Rico, not one in the United States.  Later, I found out that Target had terminated their contract with him and that JC Pennys at Vista Ridge Mall in Lewisville had hired him, apparently not knowing about his past.
 
I went to see another optometrist and she took her time and did a thorough exam.  She also found that I had a stigmatism in one eye that Kelvin never even checked for.   Dealing with optometrist Kelvin L.

										In Ohio things in government are little better than in Putin's Russia - where women members of the punk-rock group Pussy Riot were recently sentenced to harsh prison camps in Mordovia & Perm for singing a song about women needing options in Russia & invoking the Virgin Mary's help - 'Join our protest, Holy Virgin.'  Not one threat in the song.  This is a punk-rocker 'prayer' to the Virgin Mary that women in Ohio can sympathize with, if not sing along with.  Even under President Obama, things at the State Medical Board of Ohio are very KGBish -with each Medical Board Member 'patriarch' getting paid his/her stash for lying and fixing complaints.  The Medical Board of Ohio admittedly cheats - fixes Rorschach tests & invents psychiatric diagnoses that don't exist - and so what?   Physician complaints in Ohio can be changed until a case is found - and only male MDs get a copy of their complaints in a Kasich-sexist state. [continued below]....
									
										.....  One unresolved 'case' has gone on for 20 years WITHOUT A CASE AGAINST THE WOMAN MD.  If falsely accused in Ohio, you are told to send a $5000 bank check payable to The State Medical Board of Ohio - the money involved in these false physician cases is total fraud.  Where is the money going?  The taxpayer monies and the physician monies?  Does Governor Kasich even know what amounts physicians are being told to render to the State Medical Board on a weekend notice?    Putin is only the chorus line in Russia - and the problem is no dialogue - in Russia or in Ohio.  And rocker lyrics, are just rocker lyrics - words set to music to entertain.  But even in translation, the problem is communication - looking at problems as opportunities.  There is a quote from Richard Bach's Illusions -There is no such thing as a problem without a gift for you in its hands.  You seek problems because you need their gifts.  Taylor Swift lyrics - which Governor Kasich is so fond of - are statements about her past dates, trashing relationships that are 'never ever getting back together.'  Yet he doesn't have a clue that some women-male MD physician-relationships are 'never ever getting back together' - and you can't make them by taking the woman MD's medical license for not 'liking' Dr. Nice.      Should meeting with the young women of Pussy Riot be such a chore for Vladimir Putin, should meeting a bright Mensa IQ Ohio physician graduate of CWRU School of Medicine be a two-year problem for Governor Kasich?  Usually meeting young women is a perk of the politician job - someone with colorful clothing.     Neither state-controlled religion, nor state-controlled medicine, works.  Women's medical care in Ohio - and psychiatric misdiagnosis of the woman MD dissenters - when a woman MD has a colleague-colleague disagreement about medical care options - is just pure KGB.  Ohio is not Boston, or New York, with regard to women's medical care and this has to evolve - change - with standards allowed to improve and not being held to the medieval benchmark.  In Ohio, women's wrist fractures should not be left to 'ripen to excrescence' so that the orthopedic can get some sadistic gratification 'high' - from watching the 'natural history of the disease' - and then doing an otherwise unnecessary surgery.  It took the one women MD a year to heal from this 'care' - care which the State Medical Board admitted was 'boys being boys' care, but allowed without censure or reprimand.  In Russia, religion should be helping families and women to have a dignity of being - Putin is supposed to be about reform - but the Orthodox Church is a state-player.      Vladimir Putin somehow can't put it in his schedule to meet with these rocker women, even though Obama loves the 'rocker' types for his campaign stops - Springsteen & The Foo Fighters.  Kid Rock is a Romney favorite and his song, Born Free, is a Romney anthem.  So maybe Putin just needs to get with his 'rocker groove' in 2012 - that rock is part of politics, and patriarchs need to integrate into pop culture.    Countless headlines were recently generated when Vice-Presidential candidate Paul Ryan declared notoriously left-wing rockers Rage Against The Machine among his personal favorites.  It wasnt long before RATM guitarist Tom Morello took Ryan to task for his choice with a scathing op-ed piece in Rolling Stone, stating, Paul Ryan is the embodiment of the machine our music rages against.  Pussy Riot is hardly RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE.Despite the lyrics of Born Free, Romney-keynoter Governor John Kasich can't meet with women MDs in Ohio and discuss the care problems for women practitioners within an abusive state system of 'confidential' physician complaints - as totalitarian a system as the Russian KGB.  The male MDs in Ohio just threaten that you 'will never practice medicine again' if you don't lie about the mistakes, change your story.  The Pussy Riot women hardly look glass-cage 'threatening,' and the woman in Ohio was 5'2"".  The lyrics of Born Free read:You can knock me down and watch me bleed,But you can't keep no chains on meI was born freeI was born freeI was born freeBorn free.And do the lyrics of VP Ryan's favorite rocker group - Rage Against the Machine's Freedom - differ much from the Pussy Rock poetry?  Maybe Putin is just not up on his rocker lyrics?ComeBring it on, bring it on nowSolo, I'm a soloist on a solo listAll live, never on a floppy diskInka, inka, bottle of inkPaintings  of rebellionDrawn up by the  thoughts I think. . .Your anger is a  giftGovernor Kasich only meets & greets in Bob Evans restaurants - and women MDs don't hang out there.  In Russia the sentences are for 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred,' in Ohio for the 'impairment' of noticing medical mistakes and 'making too much of admittedly bad care.'  In neither case are the laws being upheld - the law of free speech and the law of giving a patient all the options & doing the best care, which even the woman MD-patient needs to consent to for 'informed consent.'  Is there any truth in the accusations in either case: is 'hooliganism' singing a rock song in a church, or is physician 'impairment' reporting bad care done to women MDs?  And how are things going to improve with no dialogue - with the withholding of careers and medical care to women?  And if the woman MD in question gets 'cleared,' she'd like to spend some time working in the prisons of Perm & Moldavia in the women's medical clinics there.  This is a wish that Vladmir Putin can grant.  The Russian women Pussy Riot band members are sentenced to poor hygiene, poor food, and poor to nonexistent medical care - which will just provide more objectionable lyrics about how bad things are in Russia.  The woman MD in Ohio was not allowed medical care-to-function - just a new right Ohio psychiatrist trained in Russian 'techniques' of breaking dissenters.     The Governor & the President Putin: How are things going to improve in Russia, or Ohio, if the Governor and the Russian President, just sentence women to unproductive lives for free speech - for trying to discuss, or sing, the problems?  The woman MD in Ohio wrote out the problems, dressed appropriately, and just tried to discuss with her orthopedics before being beaten up in one office at MetroHealth Cleveland OH - where she trained as a resident and was known as a very good physician - before the bruises.  Maybe if Governor Kasich behaved better than threatening to 'call the authorities' if you call his office about the stacks of false physician disciplines at the Medical Board of Ohio, then maybe Vladimir Putin would 'get the message' from the rocker 'protest poetry.'  Both need a lesson in rocker lyrics, and women MD 'speak.'  You don't diagram the sentences - both 'songs' had serious purpose.In both cases women are being abused as examples.'  In Ohio to get women MDs to go along with inadequate & negligent treatment of women's medical problems, in Russia to get girls to agree to the lack of opportunity & options for women except for love and babies - which are good things but not the whole of life by any means.  Governor Kasich maybe if you behaved better Putin would, and vice versa maybe if President Putin was a 'gentleman' about being criticized in rocker-speak, then maybe Governor Kasich would be understanding about women-MD-speak.  It's sad that both seem to be missing a computer 'chip' - and neither are getting the translated message.  Punk-rocker prayer, and women MD letters, are pure protest poetry - not causes for martyrdom - just two different musical genres chanting a need for change.    									",Doctors

										Medical care in Ohio was so bad for women in the 1990s, that 3 psychiatrists agreed in one woman physician's case at the State Medical Board of Ohio - that even they 'would have lied to get out of the liability for the bad fracture care.'  That the woman MD wasn't lying about care that she could just not 'aequanimitas' away.  That the Medical Board records were LIES - which the State Medical Board of Ohio refuses to admit - even though Blue Cross/Blue Shield would not pay one of the orthopedics for anything his records were so suspect.  THREE (3) psychiatrists can't usually agree about anything.  The Medical Board of Ohio admits  - in one woman MD's case of licensure suspension - that they paid two psychiatrists to lie/cheat: one confabulated a Rorschach test, and the other made up a diagnosis that didn't exist. [continued below]....
									
										.....  Paid fraud, witness tampering 101.  The Medical Board of Ohio admits this and won't dismiss the case for their 'cheating.'  Just like Putin would do in Russia.  The first psychiatrist, who 'fixed' the Rorschach, was trained in Russian psychiatric dissident techniques - why he was picked by the State Medical Board of Ohio to go after a woman MD objecting to Ohio orthopedic care - or lack of it.  Nothing is a discussion in Ohio.  [Patriarch Whitehouse believes in Kasich Better to believe in God instead.  The prayers of the Virgin cant replace Board-meetingsMary, Mother of God, is with us in protest!]Most of the stacks of false cases at the Ohio Medical Board didn't happen during Governor Kasich's time - but he has continued the problematic suspensions of these medical licenses for nonsense - Pussy Riot type objections to paternalistic bad care.  Governor Kasich tells you on the phone that he will 'contact the authorities' if you call him about the Medical Board problems - just like Putin would.  Many orthopedics in Ohio, after finishing training, don't keep up - and won't refer.  Yes, women MDs can 'refer themselves' to some extent, but not when the Cleveland Orthopedic Society decrees otherwise - the boys get together monthly and decide who 'deserves' care, and who doesn't.  Every orthopedic in the Cleveland area belongs to the SAME Orthopedic Society.  Putin, however, would never have taken the medical license of a woman MD wanting proper fracture care to get 'back to work' and 'continue to work.'  But the Governors of Ohio think this 'criminal' and an 'impairment' - for 20 years of time wasted of a MD career - where the woman MD had a Fellowship at St. Louis University that she was not allowed to take.  It was a Bone Metabolism Fellowship, so that she could educate the boys in Ohio - the Fellowship Director realized the problem in Ohio after giving a lecture at MetroHealth.  It's not just the Ohio Medical Board screwed up, it's the Governor's lack of direction for the State Medical Board of Ohio that is the problem.  Anything goes at the State Medical Board of Ohio, any kind of medical or orthopedic care -  just not 'pill mill.'   The fracture casts in Ohio were put on without cast padding (orthopedics 'cheap' on stockingette padding - don't use it), without x-rays, and without the right angulation or fracture reduction - the woman MD was supposed to make do in silence until she lost her hands and nerve/tendon function.  There are videos all over the web, and regular CASTING WORKSHOPS for everyone from INTERNISTS to PAs, to teach cast application.  One needs a MD only to do casting badly.  Do any Medical Board Members in Ohio ever attend these casting workshops?   The Ohio hospital didn't have the fracture reduction 'finger traps,' or the techniques on site - no staff member knew how to properly use 'finger trap reduction' and collect for the CPT codes.  Being able to code didn't make the hospital work.  All that the one orthopedic knew how to do was place a piece of pizza in the microwave at Hillcrest Hospital, and check his own 'grip strength.'  The Medical Board of Ohio accused the woman 'Pussy MD' of 'making too much of admittedly bad care.'  The woman physician reported the care to the Medical Board of Ohio for an improvement in the standards and triage at the Community Hospital in the Cleveland area - after months of attempting to get her own medical records & stop the harassments that she 'say nothing' or 'things would happen.'  After awhile you have to take threats seriously - that something WILL HAPPEN.The woman physician was not attacking 'traditions' or standards of care, in a church or on the wards - she just wanted the textbook standard - not the Hillcrest 'special.'  Wrist fractures don't heal well, or without angulation, unless properly casted with cast materials that don't cause skin breakdown.  An x-ray has to be done before and after the casting - and the woman MD, getting her fracture casted, should not have to order it.  Certain orthopedic offices in Cleveland were ordering x-rays for the wrong fracture types - because the staff had no medical training.  Wrist fractures (distal radial) were getting x-rays for 'boxer's fracture' (metacarpal).  Though connected - they are not the same fracture.  There needed to be non-punitive improvements - but punishing, or attacking the woman MD, didn't bring any improvements in care in Cleveland as to Hand Fractures.  Indiana has a special HAND CLINIC in Indianapolis IN - and it works - well - as to improving outcomes in hand and upper extremity fracture care.  Cleveland was supposed to get such a HAND CLINIC 20 years ago - but this woman MD's case led to a whitewash of the problems of hand fracture care in Cleveland OH.  This is being put on ripoff because Governor Kasich can't discuss anything with a woman MD - just the diners at Bob Evans - why the problem at the Medical Board in Ohio, ie it will take more than a 'big breakfast' mentality to fix.   In Ohio we don't need Putin, we have Governor Kasich - who has continued cases at the State Medical Board that are over 10-15 years old - where the Medical Board is still 'looking for a case' - cases where there were no patient complaints.  Women physicians are ordered to 6 or more 'goes' to find a case, psychiatric fishing expeditions worthy only of the worst far-flung Russian prison camps.  Dr. Phillip Resnick has agreed to do a 6th psychiatric evaluation on one woman MD if she suddenly magically ' abracadabras' a $5000 bank check - after years of not being able to work in medicine - her long gone medical insurance won't cover this.  Where would he suggest the woman MD get the money?  This woman had no patient complaints, and was not allowed proper blood work for bone pains & fractures before the Ohio Medical Board took her medical license.  A basic vitamin D level was only allowed to be ordered 12 years after her medical license was suspended - and it was - no surprise - LOW.  The woman MD has a family history of vitamin D absorption problems.    Women MDs in Ohio either (1) don't need blood work (just a new right Ohio psychiatrist), or (2) should order it themselves.  That's a quote from the last Executive Director of the State Medical Board of Ohio - under whose direction a stack of false cases were continued into the 2000s - Tom Dilling.   Revised lyrics to VMPPA (courtesy Pussy Riot):Virgin Mary, Mother of God, give the Ohio Medical Board sight - ?ut the Board's false cases away, Allow women physicians get back to workCaring for patients - All now crawl and bow to the power of the Medical Board.The phantom of liberty is in heaven, Women physicians working in labs washing glassware Instead of Ohio patient clinics,The Executive Director, their chief saint,Leads protester physicians to ordered 'goes' without endIn order not to offend His Holiness Governor Kasich -Women must give birth and make love to their orthopedics!Total misuse of their education and physician-training.

										Governor Kasich knew, in taking office as Governor of Ohio, that there were SERIOUS problems at the State Medical Board of Ohio with abuse of administrative privilege(s), changing rules in mid-case, collecting sexual & dating histories on women MDs for laughs (they take days of testimony on this in Columbus at taxpayer expense - to embarrass the women MD into a false settlement - that the Board will only stop if they sign a pile of lies), ordering of sequential psychiatric 'evaluations' on women MDs who disagreed with bad orthopedic care practices, threats to women physicians to admit the Medical Board's case (whatever the 'case of the day' was), misuse of experts to testify falsely and make up diagnoses on physicians - diagnoses that didn't exist, but that the Medical Board would require treatment of or publish on their website.  The Medical Board of Ohio is able to publish total fabrications, false diagnoses, and results of tests that they cheated on (from drug to Rorschach to personality testing) - on their website. [continued below]....
									
										.....  Confidential physician complaints are never verified for facts, or that the signers knew the physician.  Nothing is true on that website except that Mr. Whitehouse exists, that Dr. Nice thinks that women MDs are there to supply needs that his wife 'doesn't understand,' and that Carla O'Day MD has problems with other women MDs because she skipped so much class in Medical School and then was appointed to the State Medical Board of Ohio - when if the Governor had checked with the Medical School Deans, he would have found out that it wasn't such a good idea to have Carla O'Day MD on the Medical Board.  But then who checks with Medical School Deans?   Lance Talmadge MD has been a big 'pusher' on these evaluations, and after the 5th one - they are emotionally damaging per US psychiatric experts.  One of the US top experts on personality disorders from Columbia-Presbyterian in New York City, told the Medical Board - IN COLUMBUS IN 1995 - to stop doing these 'serial evaluations' on women MDs - because the EMOTIONAL DAMAGE would be so severe that even a US expert psychiatrist would not be able to 'repair' it - an expert co-author of the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Psychiatry would not be able to undo the Ohio personality damage to women MDs serially evaluated for years.  But the Medical Board of Ohio does not have a Plan B.Dr. Talmadge - being an Obstetrics & Gynecology person specializing in 3rd trimester abortions - of course ignored that warning.  Some cases at the Medical Board of Ohio are into >5 psychiatric evaluations on physicians with no patient complaints & counting - to try to 'find a case' after 20 years of abusing the physician for sport - for no reason.  Dr. Nice's patient charts are never investigated, but women MDs have every chart pulled - for nothing to be found.  Dr. Talmadge at one point was writing letters even when he wasn't confirmed to stay on the Medical Board.  In the 1990s, the Ohio State Medical Board paid a series of experts to falsely testify in one case, with the experts straight-out telling the physician that they would testify falsely, and be able to collect money for this.  Just like Dr. Nice can 'break' a woman MD so that she never practices medicine again - ANYWHERE.  The Ohio State Medical Board pays for the diagnosis that they want - not for the facts.  And then they want MD physicians to pay for a 6th, 7th or 8th evaluation until they get the 'right' psychiatrist to justify what they did.  New right Ohio psychiatrists are a dime-a-dozen; the Ohio State Medical Board can always find another, and another.  But the physicians at that point don't have a job, and all medical insurances are gone in the confusion.  Physicians need to keep their jobs UNTIL the Medical Board finds a legitimate case - not have licenses suspended when there is no threat to patient care and an office of patients - that will then go back to Dr. Nice for more abuse & bad orthopedic results?  One woman MD had to supply his office with a stethoscope for BPs, sign for all his drug samples, babysit his patients when he partied for lunch, and it was her license taken that she would not do more for free?  The physician had no patient complaints, but had disagreed with wrong care of fractures and no workup being allowed.  The orthopedics were playing polo, partying, doing Beer Rounds appearances, testifying falsely but not able to order even physical therapy for the woman MD - her father had to do that.  When male Ohio MDs can't order physical therapy, but can testify before the Medical Board for hours about a woman MD being 'crazy' that she expects them to do their MD jobs, there is a problem.  Governor Kasich YOU are the Authority that has to pick up the phone: The Governor has failed to do anything responsible - and threatens to call 'the authorities' when you call his office - with him being THE AUTHORITY - when you call that the Medical Board won't answer their phones.  Mr. Whitehouse hasn't answered his phone in about 8 years, and Benton Taylor has phone number for you to 'leave a message' and he'll 'get back' - sometime in the next decade.  And WHO IS BENTON TAYLOR?  AND WHAT ARE HIS QUALIFICATIONS?  Is he being sent to an introductory beginner course on Medical Board Management? Or just learning to answer the phone and maybe remember a case?     While Governor Kasich is not responsible for the false actions of the State Medical Board of Ohio over the years previous to his Administration - and even the Ohio Speaker's Office admits the serious fake discipline problem of Ohio physicians - Governor Kasich is responsible for handling the problem and getting the physicians back to work.  Governor Kasich is responsible for BEING THE AUTHORITY - not calling some 'authority' in.  The problem is so bad, and has gone on so many years, that the just settlements to the physician's falsely accused would bankrupt Columbus & Ohio government overnight.  MR. WHITEHOUSE is responsible for continuing false cases through 2 administrations, and having an office that is never responsible for anything.  Most physicians would settle for 'clearance' and getting back to work - but then you have to get the Medical Board office on the phone to have a resolution, meeting, or discussion.  While physicians are supposed to DISCUSS, Mr. Whitehouse can't be bothered - just send the woman MD to psychiatric evaluation 6 or 7 - whichever one that it is. 
Governor Kasich's office says that he 'will not review' these past cases,' 'will not do anything' about them, and he'll call in 'the authorities' if you ask about no one at The State Medical Board of Ohio ever doing anything but taking physician licenses without a case.  No reasons are given, just that Governor Kasich is a jerk, can't do his job, and can't even speak with a woman who has more degrees that he'll ever get.  Could someone please tell him that he is the 'AUTHORITY?'  And how does he not have the ability to speak with a wronged woman MD when he could speak with diners at Bob Evans during his gubernatorial campaign?  Maybe the woman MD needs to hang out at BOB EVANS.  Asking to speak with Governor Kasich on the phone, when you hear his laugh in the background - he has time to joke and play games - is a Taylor Swift song writing moment. ",Doctors

By always putting his patients first, Dr. Hornsby maintains his clinics as a successful enterprise both now and for many years to come.Another top executive of the company told us that Dr. Hornsby's personal business philosophy is based on the premise that ""strives to add value in its services as they understand that a successful business model is based on value-added services, and patient care. Florida Men's Medical Clinic's mission statement says it all: ""Our goal is to provide our patients the best quality, value and professional excellence in the industry.""  Some of the other things Ripoff Report learned in the course of its investigation: Typical patient feedback reads:  Florida Men's Medical Clinic did for me what no other doctor or medication could. They were always private, professional and courteous, but most important of all, as an eighty-seven year old man they gave me my sex life back. They most definitely deliver on their guarantee.""At the Florida Mens Clinic they state that they take great care of patients by explaining to each patient what procedure they are about to go through step by step through vitals, to seeing the doctor, all the way through discharging the patient. One common theme with all new patients is a sense of nervousness about coming to the Mens Clinic. They indicated that at first a large part of the assessment is done by being a good listener and understanding where the patient is in life with regard to the issues at hand. The staff works to comfort the new patients with explanations as to the commonality of the patients problems with current and past patients and how the Mens Clinic helps them with their issues.  However, at the very beginning of the assessment process they make sure that the potential patient does not have any issues that automatically would eliminate them as patients, such as taking nitrates for heart conditions etc. The doctor examines every patient to make sure they are healthy enough to use their treatments. If not they simply explain to the patient that unfortunately they cannot help them and advise them of their options, or refer them to another doctor if needed. The clinics selective treatment plans are based off of all the data they collect during the initial patient visit. They start with basic vitals, doctor physical, H&P questionnaire, and ultrasound. From this data they choose a dose of Vasodilators to be tested on the patient in office. The clinic uses the results of that test to choose a final dose for the patients. Generally, there are just two treatment plans for most of their patients. 1. The first option is to take medications orally and second option is the applicator.  The clinic indicated that the majority of the patients are there because Viagra or Cialas have not worked, or the side effects were unacceptable. Therefore, the vast majority of the patients will be prescribed medications via the applicator (self-injections).  The process involves working with the patient through an analysis to determine the proper custom blend for each patient.  The clinic believes that ultimate goal was for their patients to no longer need the medication.  As soon as it is determined that the applicator is the best option for the patient a trial dose is blended and applied right there in the exam room. At this point the patient should see the positive results of the application. If not another trial dose is blended.The education process begins as soon as the patient enters the exam room. The doctor patiently, but directly, addresses the full spectrum of treatment and as previously mentioned, gleans valuable medical history from the patient.  Full disclosure of family and personal medical history is essential to getting the proper medication to the patient. At the same time, it is important to reassure the patient that the procedures and the medications are time and trial tested with thousands of satisfied and very happy customers. During the initial doctor visit the patient is trained on the method of use and outcome of the medicine on multiple occasions, first by the doctor, then again by the discharge planner, and finally with hands on more in-depth training by a medical technician. According to the clinic, Communication is key. We do our utmost to explain in full detail all that is involved so that the patient is confident and positive as we approach treatment.If a patient were to come to the clinic with a concern that they were unable to address, they would refer him to another source. If the patient were asking about a service they provided that the doctor did not think he was healthy enough for or right for, they would explain the reasons why he cannot receive this treatment and give him his other options.In the event that trial doses are just not having the desired effect, the patient is asked to come back to the office for some additional training with the applicator. This is not common, but it does occur according to the clinic. Essentially the patient gets the instructional side of the treatment again.  At no time does the patient that comes back for this kind of help ever gets charged extra. In fact, if the trial doses do not work, then new trial doses are blended. If the blends at first were to appear to be working and then are not productive, a new blend is ordered at no additional cost. Finally, Joe explained that each patient is given a 24 hour 7 days a week emergency phone number to call if there are any issues that arise after hours. Additionally, each patient is provided with an emergency packet with medicines that may be needed to counteract the blended dosages.The clinic follows up with patients to make sure their medications are working and if they need any adjusting.  Other follow ups include, after hours treatment for emergencies. During the follow up conversations with the patient it is discerned if the dosage is just right for several different variables. It is at this point that the dosage is either accepted or tweaked for the patient.  This is the custom blending referred to in advertisements and in doctor patient conversations.  At this point if needed a second trial dosage can be made or a prescription can be written for a 30 day supply. This is a patient driven decision and the clinic stated, We are very accommodating with regard to second or third trial dosages if needed. If the clinic has a patient complaint, they first have the office manager speak with the patient in order to find out what exactly is the issue. Then we try to make the patient happy. If they are unable to resolve the issue, they would then forward it to their corporate office for further action. The managers at the corporate office would review the chart and call the patient directly.  If the customer is not excluded for health reasons, there really is not a reason that the patient should not have a positive experience. Consequently, they address all complaints immediately.  In most cases problems are resolved quickly and at no additional charge to a customer. If a customer is not satisfied that patient will not incur any additional costs as they go through the resolution process. If this means that the customer will get free doses or multiple adjustments to doses, so be it, according to the clinic and We go to extremes to insure customer satisfaction. However, they state that once in a while they will get the odd patient that cannot be made happy no matter what you do for them. In these odd cases the patient is referred to Eric Ellis and he makes the final decisions as to the case. It always works out in favor of the patient the clinic states. Finally, it was indicated that the clinic is open for a number of hours each day for visitation by current patients that may be having issues of any kind. The clinic is open from 8am to 10am and after 3pm to see patients that are experiencing problems with the medications or any other issues. The clinic stated that most, if not all, issues are resolved during their normal business hours.   With regard to a time for resolution, it really is a matter of coming back into the clinic and getting an adjusted dosage if that is the problem.Florida and Georgia Mens clinic  states that they really have not changed the way they approach customer complaints because they have always treated them with the utmost importance. At the first sign of an unhappy customer they do everything they can do for the customer to ensure satisfaction.  The entire staff is customer oriented and the one and only objective is customer satisfaction.The Mens Clinic states that the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program is a great opportunity for them to be able to help their patients with their unresolved problems. It allows them to hear the issues if they were not brought to their attention. They state that they appreciate the change to learn and grow with Ripoff Report, and to help prove their great reputation with patients.Florida Men's Medical Clinic also takes employee satisfaction seriously as well.   Employee feedback and surveys reveal comments such as this:  ""Florida Men's Medical Clinic provides a very positive environment to work.  Opportunities for suggestions and improvements are encouraged.  Dr. Hornsby is truly concerned about our contribution to the company and providing growth opportunities for us.  He takes the time to listen and communicate with employees and patients.""  Rip-off Report was pleased to learn that Dr. Hornsby's past and current approach to business is focused on its pledge to total commitment towards patient and employee satisfaction.Florida Men's Medical Clinic recognizes that complaints posted on Ripoff Report (whether true or not) are issues that need to be addressed, not ignored.  If handled correctly, complaints can be valuable learning opportunities. With the feedback generated by Rip-off Reports Investigation, Florida Men's Medical Clinic has made organizational changes allowing its patients and employees a more streamlined approach to problem resolution and a commitment to a great client experience.In summary, after our investigation, which included discussions with Dr. Hornsby and staff, Ripoff Report is convinced that Florida Men's Medical Clinic is committed to quality delivery of services resulting in total patient satisfaction.Read more about why consumers should feel confident when doing business with a member of Ripoff Report's Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.

Dean to do what he wants him to.  Ailment Wellness mostly a pain management clinic and Amir Pakpour is nothing more then a legalized drug dealer.  
The truth is that Cenegenics is the leader in the anti-aging industry lead by dr. Life who wrote the book on it.  There is a location in almost every major city.  I would not trust ailment  wellness because dr. Dean has only been practicing anti-aging as well as hCg for less then a year.  In other words he really doesn't know the long term outcome as Cenegenics would know.  Furthermore,Amir Pakpour tells people he is a doctor I have a few of my friends that he lead them to believe he was the dr.  He is not he barely made it out of high school.  I was disappointed with the service and shocked by the outrages lies and claims Amir Pakpour makes on behalf of Ailment Wellness.  Stay away from this clinc so much of what has been said and done seems to be a fraud.   I finally found a better doctor that charges much less then Amir does.  1200 for six weeks hCg vs 380 for six weeks at Shapefast in Bowie Md.
I went to Ailment Wellness for hCg and two of my friends went all of us were treated the same way.  Amir Pakpour will take your money and he as well as dr. Dean could careless about the outcome in the six week treatment.  
doc and service was bad.  Amir and the doc take your money and never follows up on the hcg weight loss treatment.  Poor customer service. He did the same thing to two other people.  He is not professional.  Don't go.  Not worth it.  Google hCg and Bowie or Gaithersburg you will get better service.  ",Doctors

On a side note, she has had her medical license suspended before and she is banned from operating in all hospitals on Staten Island. That's why she sends people to Brooklyn for surgeries. BEWARE.

										The Mayo Clinic says one thing in journal articles, Mayo Clinic Proceedings, and does entirely different in practice.  One situation of this is abdominal wall nerve pain from nerve entrapments/injuries - the Surgical Service will do neurectomies without a workup or consent - the Medical Service proclaims that it will do a Carnett's test and follow.  This can occur commonly in athletes, adolescents, and women - and the misdiagnosis and wrong surgeries are life destroying - you can't do it and Mayo Clinic does not take this responsibility seriously.  Dr. Michael Sarr will cut anything out, with or without consent - and that is WRONG.

										.....  Dr. Sarr & his Department threaten that they can't operate unless you do it tomorrow, and these nerve syndromes take months to resolve - but they should not be operated on as the nerve inflammation only spreads to the rest of the abdominal muscles.  You question and question, he says that this is not the way that Mayo does it.  Dr. Sarr promises one thing, and then gets too much wine or whatever at night and forgets what he promised - Sarr spends the day drinking coffee watching the patient be mutilated by a 3-month woman intern who should never be in a surgical case that is a re-do.  A woman intern who was told not to do ANY PART OF THE PROCEDURE - but she's aggressive & without a conscience.  Sarr comes in after the procedure foggy-brained lying his head off - he can tell lies, change charts, and do any negligence in the surgical book - and get away with it.  Sarr doesn't bother to see the patient before surgery, lies that he removed a 'neuroma,' and then you stink like the medical student's cologne for being groped under an anesthesia that you said 'No' to.  Groped by a black student - who should not have been in the room as he did not know the case - at Mayo Clinic.  Black students don't have to know the case.  Anesthesia puts you under without an anesthesia consult - Dr. Sarr has arranged this.  The nursing staff doesn't look that there is no consent - and lets the procedure happen.  The anesthesia guy comes after you that he will 'watch' you - watch you be mutilated with no consent, no ethics, no checklist, and no discussion.  Sarr does not have to discuss - neither do the nurses or anesthesia.  They want you to sign without glasses, contacts or clothes - which is unethical and against any hospital policy anywhere.  Sarr then will try to collect for this, but the Mayo Clinic can't get paid for the OR time, the path or lab work, the anesthesia - but Sarr will try to get the $ - despite being told to 'stand down.'  Dr. Sarr needs to return all insurance monies for these procedures, and Mayo Clinic needs to see that he does.  The patient is still mutilated even with Mayo recognizing that a mistake was made.The reason that you say 'No' to anesthesia, is that otherwise the surgeon - a sober one - can't recognize or localize the source(s) of pain before cutting (to mark) or intra-operatively - to know what to do - if the pain is over the neural foramen, you close and treat conservatively - you think.  A first rule of SURGERY is that you NEVER cut into any swelling that you have not tried to study first. Sarr just rips everything apart as he doesn't mark anything, brings in 'help' who have never seen the patient, and he cuts everything 'normal.'  No Carnett's required.  The 'help' at Mayo is not required to know the case, to read the record, to stop the procedure if there is no consent.  Honors is for a student that does those things - a student who stops a procedure with no consent - not for a student who harms a patient.  There is a specific exam for this cutaneous nerve entrapment that is in the article by William Applegate MD from The Permanente Journal/Summer2002.  This article pdf can be found at xnet.kp.org/permanentejournal/sum02/acnes.pdf - for Mayo students willing to read.  Dr. Applegate gives a simple diagram that can be copied and put into any chart - which is what the intern should be doing - not cutting when she can't cut.  Dr. Sarr doesn't read, or think that he has to do the exam - he talks about the 'glory of Mayo Clinic' and you will argue with him for an hour and he'll get to do what he wants - which is criminal. You think that you've gotten through to him, and he's on another planet.Dr. Sarr fools around when he sees you as a patient, does not do a good exam because he 'is the Mayo Clinic,' and plays with the boys - the medical students & residents.  He's a Sandusky with a twist.  You agree to a 5-minute procedure without anesthesia, and he orders you knocked out (like assault), and does a procedure WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT - and says that he can do this.   Dr. Bundrick you know this goes on, the Chief Counsel Jill Beed-Smith says that Dr. Sarr can do this.  And no thinking physician can send any patients with abdominal wall pain problems to Mayo Clinic until there is an end to this nonsense - your real case studies do not read like your article.  No woman patient is ever that well treated - they are abused.  All the woman patients unnecessarily surgerized have to have the common mass closure repaired, and will sue you for referring to Mayo Clinic.  Jill Beed-Smith has no plans to arrange that the women patients who had neurectomies of 'normal' nerves get their abdominal walls repaired.  Jill Beed-Smith needs for Dr. Sarr to do this to her - you need it done to yourself to get the experience.     Not the Chief of Plastic Surgery, nor Dr. Michael Sarr, from 1998 or onwards to present, feel that they have to do a Carnett's test and trial of a 2% lidocaine injection - no follow-up will be tolerated on the surgical service - Sarr & his goons have to cut - tomorrow and the push it.  And they are disrespectful to the professional patient asking for a workup or a second opinion, or time to make a decision or to see someone on Medicine.  Sarr has a 'special' clearance FMG woman - who will clear anything for him at any notice.  Nothing goes through the regular Medicine clearance and workup.    This Carnett's test is a test that is rarely false-positive, < 5% of the time, and there is no excuse for Mayo publishing this and then not doing this when a woman MD comes as a patient.  There is NO EXCUSE FOR MAYO CLINIC REMOVING NORMAL NERVES that are just swollen because of use, trauma, prior surgery, or some inflammation of prolene.  Carnett's test - tensing abdominal muscles with a crunch maneuver while pressure is applied to the pain trigger zone.  It's a really hard maneuver, but the surgeons pooh-pooh it.  Dr. Sarr can't do it, can't say 'Carnett's.'When Sarr then goofs, the women MD is canceled from Mayo email by the administrator, she is attempted to be sued for defamation of Sarr's character, and she will have to have multiple surgeries to correct the deformity.  None of this was Mayo Clinic behavior or necessary.  You will have to assure people that Dr. Sarr's maneuver is gone.  There will be no post-op visits after Dr. Sarr's brief visit post-op.  He has to hide these patients - and the Mayo Clinic covers up.The common mass closure will get infected, be painful, and have to be repaired as it does not work - Sarr doesn't care, and Bundrick doesn't care - all for the money ($)
When you go to Mayo Clinic as a physician-patient, you feel that you will get the equivalent of a CME course - that the diagnostic workup will be the best in the world and what Mayo teaches - not just to get a surgery.  MD patients request that the Mayo attending take care of them, this has to be honored because MDs can write bad recommendations about interns, residents & medical student staff if mistakes happen - the lowest person on the totem poll is blamed for being in the room when they were requested specifically NOT TO BE THERE and NOT TO DO THE PROCEDURE.  And what is the problem that a Mayo intern, or student, would force themselves on a woman-MD patient?  This is assault when it has been requested that they 'stand down.'  Things are complicated with an MD-patient; if they could fix themselves, they would have.  Dr. Michael Sarr would promise the world (any surgery that you want, he'll do, and he tells you this).  Sarr will promise not to do any unnecessary surgery, and the Mayo 'promise,' has to mean something - and then just lie his head off after bringing in students, interns, & residents that don't know the case, after not doing the workup, after removing 'normal' abdominal nerves and lying that these were looking like foreign bodies, and after putting back prolene sutures in a prolene allergic woman MD.  The Dr. Sarr experience at Mayo is a nightmare, and the OR reports are fiction, but the Medicine service claims that you should get the workup of a Carnett's test and trial of conservative treatment - it doesn't happen is the fact.  It probably never happens, and Dr. Bundrick knows this.  The medical OR record will have to be revised several times, the intern did not know prolene from PDF suture, and there will be no end to the surgical complications of Sarr negligence.  And the woman MD said 'NO.'  The Mayo Surgical Staff does not turf back to Medicine for anterior abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES) - they try to operate and wreck the abdominal walls of even women MDs - barely in their 40s and mutilated for life - their parents & family feel terrible.  Then Dr. Sarr will not see these patients even once post-op - he lies that he does the closures and they are such bad closures that they require multiple plastic surgery procedures to repair.  
Dr. Sarr operated on one woman in 1998 - without a repeat scan, with no Carnett's, not doing a thyroid panel and some of the nerve inflammation was untreated thyroid, not bringing in a plastic surgeon, and saying that he couldn't recognize her transversus muscle and had to cut it up.  Dr. Sarr can't recognize the different layers of abdominal muscles - he rips them apart & destroys them - the destroyer. The closure Sarr uses is a common mass closure deformity - this closure was only done in the 1980s in abdominal emergency surgeries - when the surgeon could not take the time to close properly.  Dr. Bundrick knows this goes on, and that his own colleagues are the worst offenders of not using the Mayo clinical pearls. The suffering has been immense when a woman MD gets a neurectomy of an otherwise normal nerve, because Dr. Sarr couldn't do even an intra-operative exam of the neural foramen.  Dr. Sarr, to get surgeries, would threaten that he couldn't do them except tomorrow, would not do the scan, would promise not to do unnecessary muscle dissections - and then just lie about everything.  The procedures were done without the patient consent.  And the parents & families feel horrible.  You never harm one person in surgery - you harm the family.Dr. Bundrick - some women MDs that might have been writing for Mayo Clin Proc are still - after years - dealing with complications of letting Dr. Sarr near them.  Even if you promised to use the Carnett's test - no one would believe anyone at Mayo Clinic - because Jill Beed-Smith would let them do otherwise.  And getting a letter from Dr. Sarr's lawyer that he's going to sue you for defamation, when he admits that he had no consent to do the procedure, is a bit Kafkaesque - for regular patients or MD-patients.  It's bizarre behavior that no one has time for.  You need to solve the problems at Mayo Clinic before telling the world how to do things the Mayo way.

										University Suburban is a collection of offices for the elite of University Hospitals of Cleveland Surgeons, none of whom can diagnose ACNES = abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome.  The most common cause of abdominal wall pain is NERVE ENTRAPMENT AT THE LATERAL BORDER OF THE RECTUS MUSCLE.  There is a physical exam for this, but none of the surgeons at Suburban do it or consider the diagnosis.If you try to leave the article for Thomas Stellato MD - the Medical Director - the guy who makes up the Board Questions for the Boards of General Surgery and the Review Materials, he calls the South Euclid Police Department without reading the article.  Stellato can't be bothered - and that's been the problem with communicating with him for a long time.  The best article on this commonly misdiagnosed cause of abdominal wall pain is at http://xnet.kp.org/permanentejournal/sum02/acnes.pdf, or just google ACNES.  If patients keep handing it to Dr. Stellato, maybe he'll read it and get the message (as in the Jason Mraz song).  As the Medical Director, he's responsible for educating the rest of the staff as to common problems that get misdiagnosed.Dr. Stellato will try to schedule surgeries for this, and surgeries to remove old prolene sutures, without doing the physical exam for the neuromuscular foramen - from T8 to T-12/L-1 levels.  Even when he's in the incision directly, he does not check these areas - and abdominal pain can be multifactorial & complicated.  All surgeons should be familiar with the exact location of each abdominal neuromuscular foramen.  No excuses - the diagram in the article can be copied and included in the surgical chart.  It should be part of a surgical checklist.There are 5 commonly affected foramen on each side of the lateral rectus muscle, and the patient will usually point to the site of pain with one finger, on one side of the abdominal wall rectus muscle border.  Each time a patient's abdomen is examined for any reason, the examiner should feel for the anterior openings of each neuromuscular foramen - for herniation, pain, or swelling of the anterior cutaneous nerve branches as it exits the aponeurotic opening on each side.  The article by Dr. Applegate on the web has a great picture diagram, which patients can use to tell the surgeon where the pain is.  Take it to your local surgeon if you think that this is what you have - and from adolescents to geriatrics, it is a commonly misassessed cause of abdominal pain in Cleveland at University Hospitals.  Abdominal wall pain is often wrongly attributed to intra-abdominal disorders, and this leads to unnecessary consultation, testing and even abdominal surgery - all of which can be avoided if the INITIAL examiner make the right diagnosis.  The T-11 foramen is affected after appendectomy, the T12-L1 foramen is affected sometimes after Pfannenstiel incisions for C-sections.  Bariatric surgeries can probably cause entrapments at multiple levels.  But all surgeons should be familiar with the diagnosis and the exam - to save patients unnecessary surgeries.  If Dr. Stellato is doing a re-opening of an old incision, he should be able to examine the adjacent foramina for nerve compression/pain directly (keeping the patient under local anesthesia & seeing the pain response) - which would have saved at least one patient more surgery and his anger/frustration.  This is not Carol's fault, but Carol doesn't answer her phone when a MD patient wants to discuss this possibility with Dr. Stellato.  Mayo Clinic doesn't do any better, and Dr. Michael Rosen at University Hospitals (the hernia guy) also hasn't got a clue.  The problem is in the resident & staff teaching at University Hospitals.  Dr. Jeffrey Ponsky has the article, and the residents don't have a clue.  Medical Students this is a way to get Honors.Patients who got unnecessary surgeries should be seen by the Plastics Department at University FREE - to undo the common mass closures and defects from the mistaken assessment of this very common problem - it wasn't the patient's fault nor the responsibility of the South Euclid Police Department to threaten patient's wrongly surgerized.  Surgeons will see it first if there is an old incision, and they must be familiar with the physical exam and the recommended treatment - an injection of 2% lidocaine and not a surgical slot.  Abdominal wall pain is a common cause of office visits, and wrong surgeries.  The University Surgeons need to get on the problem - starting with Dr. Thomas Stellato.  It needs to be on the General Surgery Boards and included in the oral questions - as a common cause of abdominal pain without other clinically significant symptoms.     									",Doctors

										The State Medical Board takes women MD licenses in Ohio when they object to the wrong orthopedic care, by someone not trained or certified in that care - orthopedics that Blue Cross/Blue Shield won't pay/reimburse for the care.  IF BC/BS WON'T REIMBURSE FOR CARE, THERE IS A REASON.  tIt's not a psychiatric disorder of the patients, or the woman MD - it's an insurance 'thing.'When MD/DOs apply to be reimbursed by medical insurances, the physicians are approved for certain care services, and not others.  Like orthopedics can't deliver babies in Ohio, dermatologists can't do breast lumpectomies, and hip-and-knee orthopedics are not really supposed to do wrist fractures in metropolitan areas with a pile of Hand Certified orthopedics.  They have to refer, or if they want to do wrist fractures - move to a rural area and do general orthopedics.  All physicians are supposed, and expected, to REFER - when the care is outside of their daily experiences and purview - by the MEDICAL INSURANCES, their respective hospitals & practices.  Malpractice insurance does not cover for hip-and-knee orthopedics to be doing procedures that they don't do so many of per year - serious wrist fractures.  Women MDs don't set these rules.  But Dr. Timothy Nice is special, women MDs are supposed to get his wrist fracture disasters covered by BC/BS - when BC/BS refuses.  How?  But taking a woman MDs medical license for this nonsense, when MDs are needed in other states, even if Obamacare is repealed, is a tragedy.  Women MDs can't control the insurance company or their malpractice insurance stipulations.  Women MDs have to be healthy, be able to function fully (both hands), and have appropriate and timely care for all illnesses and injuries - or their malpractice insurance gets canceled.    No one can make BC/BS pay for a care provider's services when that care provider is not certified in that field, or approved to do that care for serious fractures.  Fractures occurring with out trauma, are PATHOLOGICAL fractures - in every State - it's not a situation where Ohio can change the definition of 'pathological fractures.'  Malignancy, and other SERIOUS disorders, have to be ruled out by tertiary care experts - that's the flow chart on pathological fractures.  It's not something that Dr. Phillip Resnick can say is psychiatric, or malingering.  It's a national standard of care.  So involving Dr. Resnick is something HE can't get paid for, is equally STUPID.  That he would agree to any of this, is just not good judgment.   The Medical Board, under Richard Whitehouse Esq, can suspended the woman MDs license for 20 years - as Ohio has done in one case - and subject that woman MD to 7 psychiatric evaluations - and that won't make the Blue Cross or insurance carrier PAY or cover that ridiculous care.  Dr. Nice wrist fracture care is not Dr. Lacey wrist fracture care; Dr. Lacey is certified in Hand Surgery (UH Cleveland).  Even women MDs have to go where their insurance coverage pays, and where the certification is.  Dr. Nice care of wrist fractures did not get reimbursed in 1990-2.  Dr. Keith care of 'experimental' fracture casting did not get reimbursed in 1990-2.  20 psychiatric evaluations won't make wrist fracture care by orthopedics that DON'T DO WRIST FRACTURE CARE, or are not CERTIFIED in Hand Surgery, reimbursable.  IT HAS TO DO WITH MONEY.  And it won't make the woman MD admit that she has bipolar, or any other psychiatric diagnosis, because she objected to wrong care by the wrong orthopedic.  Hip-and-knee specialized orthopedics are supposed to do HIP-AND-KNEE in the Cleveland area.  It's not a pill-mill thing.  It just wastes everyone's time as Dr. Nice, and other hip-and-knee surgeons, do not stock the cast materials for wrist fractures - their staff does not know how to follow them, or what x-rays to order.  Discussing every date that the woman MD ever had in her life, wrecking her life, won't make her have a psychiatric disorder that she doesn't want wrist fracture care by Dr. Nice, Dr. Kieth, or any other orthopedic NOT trained and/or certified in HAND SURGERY.  Dr. Michael Keith (MetroHealth, Cleveland) wanted to do HAND TRANSPLANTS - that's what University Hospitals/MetroHealth hired him to do in 1990-2.  Dr. Keith should have mainly done HAND TRANSPLANTS as that's what Blue Cross/Blue Shield had him on the records for; hand trauma - not wrist fractures with no fall.  The State Medical Board of Ohio blaming the woman MD, who fired both orthopedics multiple times, is not ok.  The woman MD doesn't have the psychiatric disorder - the orthopedics do for trying care that they won't get reimbursed for, or are not doing regularly.  Even private pilots have to do so many touch-and-goes/month to maintain pilot certifications.  You have to fly to continue to fly, you have to do wrist fractures regularly to continue to do them.  Except in Ohio apparently.  No amount of new right Ohio psychiatrists can undo a wrist fracture wrongly casted or console the patient who gets this SHAM CARE.  Governor Kasich is only obsessed with pill-mill physicians, and not the general BAD CARE that goes on in Ohio.It had to do with what the woman MDs insurance would pay for - in the basic gestalt of things.  And medical insurance won't pay for Dr. Nice to cast a wrist fracture on the 5th day after it ripens to excrescence.  They might have paid for a cast within 48 hours, but the 5th day sounds like fraud.  Medical insurance won't pay for Dr. Nice to then trim the cast, that was sloppy because he was on his way to a drinking party, while he has a hangover from the party, on the 6th day, and never see the fracture again.  That isn't CARE recognized by any medical insurance carrier - even if the State Medical Board of Ohio wants to call this 'care.'  The Medical Board wants the woman MD to lie about what her insurance won't cover - care that didn't occur.  That's not a reason to take a medical license, suspend a medical license, or order 7 psychiatric evaluations of the woman MD who has to work and can't have her fractures 'ripening.'  THE WOMAN MD CAN SIGN NOT TO SUE, AS SHE OFFERED MULTIPLE TIMES, BUT SHE CAN'T SAY THAT SHE DOESN'T NEED CARE.  MEDICAL MISTAKES STILL NEED CARE, AND THE CONSULTANTS NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED - NOT A PILE OF LIES.  Governor Kasich needs to do something about the false suspensions of women MDs for objecting to wrong care by the wrong person - who the insurance company won't reimburse in a million years - and get back to improving basic medical care in Ohio.  And you can't do that if you suspend every Internal Medicine Board Certified woman MD who objects to getting care by someone not able to do the care, ie Dr. Nice doing wrist fractures.  If the insurance won't reimburse, that physician is not on record to do that care or those procedures.  Enough is enough with the psychiatric evaluations of women MDs to lie about this type of fraud, and the false medical license suspensions based on provisional whatever to cover it up. 									",Doctors

										Women MDs in OHIO are unable to get appropriate medical care for even the simplest of problems - thyroid, fractures, etc.  The Ohio Medical Board is in the business of being the malpractice insurer for their 'friends' - suspending women MD licenses when the guys/girls goof.  University Hospitals of Cleveland Endocrinologists don't have to do thyroid panels, thyroid antibodies, women's hormone tests, or vitamin D levels before medical license are taken for women MDs with multiple fracture syndromes - and the orthopedics don't notice.  Ohio orthopedics can't treat fractures - but the problem was the endocrinologist that told the orthopedics that it was just the woman MD's 'problem with men' - sans testing.  Then there are the 'home' labs in offices where the blood is drawn & processed wrong, despite the lab in the building - this happens frequently at University Suburban Green Road Medical Center in Cleveland.Women MDs are not allowed care-to-function before their medical license is taken - for objecting to lack of fracture care, simple blood work, physical therapy, getting their medical records to consultants - it doesn't happen and the charts turn up at the Medical Board highly edited with piles of fabrications.  Charts turning up two years later at the State Medical Board offices, charts where the care could not be reimbursed because of irregularities.  These charts are then used to take the woman MD's license because she 'made too much' of the fraud.  No woman with two fractures is 'seductive' unless the orthopedic is having hallucinations and not on meds (Hillcrest Hospital orthopedics, Cleveland Clinic Hospital).The fabrications are so bad regarding these cases of taking licenses for objecting to wrong care, that the insurer Blue Cross/Blue Shield can't pay for the alleged care.  The woman MD is supposed to admit that some kind of care happened - with no blood work, no cast.  Women MDs are not told what lie will work, just subjected to 6 or more psychiatric evaluations for 'making too much' of care that the Board is supposed to regulated, standardize, and improve.  To get through Medical School anywhere, women students are highly psychiatrically tested and evaluated to start - several evaluations before they get through Medical School sometimes - evaluations for noticing the problems on the wards & clinics.  Problems are not discussed, they are just mistakes made over and over as Ohio has no medical mistake laws.  So the Medical Board gets mad at women MDs for handling the mistakes the wrong way.  Well, what is the 'right' way Mr. Whitehouse, Governor Kasich?  No one has said anything for the last 8 years.  In Ohio you can't get thyroid function tests more than a T4 before your medical license is suspended for provisional - 'provisional' what is the question?  Provisional has no definition in Ohio, and if you call the Medical Board you get Benton Taylor - who hasn't got a clue what 'provisional' means - and it changes daily.  Every Ohio psychiatrist from Dr. Phillip Resnick, to his residents, go along with this for the money - they don't do the thyroid testing first and refer to the endocrinologist.  It's not a psychiatric condition to try to insist on the standard of care - which is casting for a wrist fracture - which is a thyroid panel for tiredness & weight gain, thyroid gland swelling - ie TSH, thyroid antibodies, T3 depending on the lab.  A thyroid panel is NEVER a T4 - as was used to take one woman MD's license in Ohio - and this could only happen in Ohio where the Board Members don't know what is 'abnormal' for a thyroid problem result, and that you have to order at least a TSH before you say that the woman MD is malingering.  If you have a normal T4, you are just exaggerating - and this is 2012.   Many thyroid problems have a normal T4, including many cases of hypothyroidism - but the TSH is elevated and there are thyroid antibodies.  Many women get post-partum thyroiditis.  About 26% or more of women (Christine Northrup, MD) have hypothyroidism as they head into their late 30s and early 40s.  Thyroid is not a disease of men; most residency physicals & blood work do not include thyroid panel testing so it is missed in women residents - and that's a crime because these women then don't feel well and have huge responsibilities.  The males are usually 90+% euthyroid in residency programs, medical schools.  But all are vitamin D deficient as the semester goes into December in Medical Schools in Boston, Cleveland and Seattle.     Governor Kasich is obsessed with pill-mill physicians - and how many of those are there in Ohio?  It's an orphan disease, a 'zebra' in medical communities, and disciplining that crowd - when the Columbus powers that be have allowed these pill-mills for decades - is not going to improve the general quality of medical care in any state.   The number of physicians that screw up thyroid function testing is probably more than 90% of the physicians licensed in Ohio - including ALL OF THE PRESENT OHIO BOARD MEMBERS that allowed that normal T4 be all that woman MD was allowed - until Georgetown Medical Center had to do the profile.  But they have no way to handle that Medical Board mistake under Governor Kasich - except say that the woman MD's personality made them not think, drink when they voted, or not look into the facts.   Women MDs need to get all the appropriate women's labs before Medical Board Members vote their medical license suspended for making too much of no care, or care by orthopedics not Certified in Hand Orthopedics, or care that just didn't happen as written on the edited typed medical records.  And Dr. Resnick checking for malingering 20 years later - is not appropriate.  Expert consultations should be the best, the most appropriate, and not have conflicts of interest - done in the first year otherwise the symptoms are from the neglect & the abuse.  There also needs to be a statute of limitations.  But missing thyroid disorders, and taking women MD licenses before the lab work comes back, while having Board Meetings with liquor closets - is a bit hypocritical.  The woman MD at least knew she needed the tests, the Board Members didn't have a clue.",Doctors

										Ohio has the most false MD disciplines/complaints of any state at any time in the history of State Medical Boards - and for the last 20 years (1992-2012).  The Ohio legislators, and Speakers of the Ohio House, admit this - but they won't do anything about it as the justified liability - the damages due the falsely accused good physicians - would bankrupt Ohio if the files were opened.  Secretary of State Husted knows about this.  Speaker Householder's office admitted this in 2003.  Strickland knew about it. 
Physician complaints are 'confidential' for women MDs only - that law is broken daily for the men who get their complaints - otherwise the 'case' never ends until you admit what the State Medical Board wants you to - and that changes daily.  There's no way to fight a 'confidential' complaint that can be constantly changed to 'find a case' for 20 years; there's no way to go about things in the 'right' way as the evidence is confidential, changed, and morphed.  Women on the Medical Board 'arrange' this for the boys, ie Anita Steinbergh DO.  Any guy can get their complaint (Dr. Nice), just not women MDs.  Maybe with a sex change?  Women MDs are supposed to have Oslerian 'aequanimitas' and cover for the boys - boys being boys care in Ohio.  The women MDs suspended just objected to the medical errors & wrong care - admittedly bad mistake care - on themselves.  In Ohio women MDs can't object to the wrong care being done to them (on their bodies), without their consent - male ego is the only requirement; what the guys want to do to women, they get to do.  Probably the 'pill mill' MDs aren't the physicians doing the 'pill-mill' - they just ran out of blackmail money.  Any, and all, evidence is 'fixed' in Ohio - no due process required, no verification of hearsay.    Women MDs have their medical licenses pulled in Ohio for 'faked' provisional diagnoses after they object to wrong care of themselves or patients - prosecutorial misconduct of the lowest kind as no rules of evidence are allowed at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  The prosecution is in bed with the BAD MDs/DOs.  Improper relationships between Board Members, and the physicians who actually do the bad care, go on all the time.  It's all 'confidential.'  No one can come forward to say anything.The Medical Board Members in Ohio get their 'friend' physicians out of medical care mistakes by making up that someone else 'made them do it,' ie the woman MD who got the bad care asking that Dr. Nice refer.  Dr. Nice won't refer, consult, and attempts care that he has no training or ability to do - to this day.  With Tim Nice, you have to 'feel sorry' for his wife, then admit that you were so 'seductive' that he could not do fracture care or call in a referral.  Tim Nice is short, paunchy (potbellied), balding, and mean - couldn't inspire seduction with a date rape drug.  The improper relationship was Anita Steinbergh DO, Dr. Carla O'Day & Dr. Tim Nice.  Lance Talmadge MD somehow knows Dr. Nice - but they don't abstain from any votes.  Medical Board Members have professional, business & personal relationships with the physician actually doing the wrong care - all the time.  'Friends' of Board Members get preferential treatment, their files, and are protected - for decades if necessary.  Goes on all the time; no conflicts of interest at the State Medical Board of Ohio are ever investigated.  No medical mistake laws required in Ohio, no apology laws needed - you just hire a Medical Board Member to fix things, contribute to a Gubernatorial campaign.The Board-approved psychiatrists know the Board Members, and the physicians who really goofed - their colleagues.  Rorschach inkblots are faked, diagnoses made up that don't exist, and sequential psychiatric evaluations ordered like waterboarding - until the emotional trauma gets too much to bear.  Women MDs are just the victims - have to get those experimental procedures/casts tried on them - and then are falsely disciplined when the bad care doesn't work.  Women MDs don't do the bad care, just can't live with it being done to them - the deformities, the pain, the loss of career & family - all for some jerky guy's ego.   When problems at Ohio hospitals happen, and they do all the time, fracture care is withheld on woman MDs who won't go along with medical misconduct.  No one knows the 'right' lies, but you either tell them or get a false psychiatric diagnosis.  In 1995, the Medical Board had a psychiatrist that would make up diagnoses for women MDs to get treated for - diagnoses that still don't exist or have criteria.  The Ohio Medical Board has a unique diagnosis for women MDs, and new right Ohio psychiatrists that will do the therapy - no DSM needed.  It's not about patient care; it's about who you know.Women MD fractures are left uncasted to collapse while the orthopedics play polo, party, won't answer their phones, do casts without padding, or fake 'satisfactory' x-rays - no fracture reductions - they can't do them in Ohio - they don't know how.  You can buy the cast padding materials for the guys, they still won't use them or refer when they don't have them in the office.  Dr. Lacey at University Hospitals in Cleveland is not available until the fracture collapses.  But Dr. Michael Keith will try experimental casts until you have no hand or tendons left for him to experiment on - he won't call Dr. Lacey.Women MDs are told to lie, to not mention, to make 'light' or they will never practice medicine again anywhere - cases/license suspensions are arranged, bought and paid for.  Surgeries needed, but then the fractures are so bad that no orthopedic surgery will then work - fractures ripen to unfixable excrescence deformity.Blood work is not allowed woman MDs, no medical care.  The State Medical Board of Ohio does not believe in blood work for women MDs - they don't deserve it.  Even The Cleveland Clinic is 'in' on the withholding - one woman MD has fractured 5 bones - medieval 'rack' not needed.  The CCF doesn't need the money, so one woman MD has had her bone condition refused treatment by Chad Deal, Abby Abelson, and Dr. Licata - for 20 years.  Vitamin D level wasn't ordered until 2003, Dr. Chad Deal was just going to lie for the Medical Board - whatever lie that the Medical Board wanted.  The CCFers want the favors of the Medical Board, and Dr. Brems needs more shoulder fractures.  If you withhold thyroid treatment for Hashimotos - bones weaken to osteoporosis & fractures - natural history of the disease left untreated - and it's painful.  The Medical Board doesn't allow thyroid function tests on women - and no one in Ohio can do a thyroid exam - just a psychiatric exam.  Threats, and serial psychiatric evaluations, are used until the women MDs admit the Medical Board's case.  Nothing is about the woman MD's patient care - there were no patient complaints, no drugs, and the alcohol - she couldn't open the bottle with two wrist fractures.  Fractured woman MD has had 6 evaluations without a case, so she needs a 7th & is told to submit a $5000 bank check to the Medical Board - asap please.  This is Governor Kasich now - the enlightened one.  Women MDs falsely accused can't get hired as no one knows what is going on, 20 years and no statute of limitations - no one has heard of this.  The correct evaluation, and treatment of the thyroid condition, should have been done before the medical license was taken (before the bones were broken) - so her malpractice and medical insurance could have paid.  Medical Board psychiatrist will get paid when he gets the 'right' diagnosis that the Medical Board wants - it's arranged so that the woman MD will fracture until she admits the Board's case = the Ohio 'racking.' Governor Kasich is into anything he can do to get false cases at the State Medical Board.  No review of false cases, no statute of limitations, no evidence needed.  The Democrats started this in 1990, but the Republicans have made it a legacy.  ",Doctors

										Physician complaints at the State Medical Board of Ohio are 'confidential' - leading to huge expenditures in investigations of false cases, where just verification of the signers & events would throw the cases out.  This wastes physician careers, taxpayer monies, and is fraud.One case has been going on at the State Medical Board of Ohio for 20 years, Mr. Whitehouse won't answer the phone about it.  The woman MD lost her medical license for 'making too much [reporting] bad care' - care that the Ohio Medical Board admitted was bad, but that the woman MD needed their 'help' to handle it.  The Medical Board refused to do anything about the bad care - to warn the physician to improve the care so that it was billable care.The woman MD only asked that the orthopedics sign off & refer - not for psychiatry help - she knew the care was bad & that she deserved 'real' care that BC/BS would reimburse.  At the time, physician courtesy for care was gone.  The one orthopedic would not sign off and send his care summary - care that couldn't be billed and was not standard fracture care in any sense - a cast for 5 days.  It was a case of a 'neighbor' trying to do care that the neighbor orthopedic did not do; hip-and-knee guy tries to do wrist fracture for whatever reason.  But the fact is that Blue Cross/Blue Shield would not pay for the care from the one orthopedic - would not admit that the orthopedic did billable care worth one cent - in any legal sense.  So the woman MD was correct that the care was not 'standard' or 'normal,' not 'care' in a Medical Board sense.  In asking for the Medical Board's help to get her records, that the orthopedics sign-off, and that the derogatory comments stop - the woman MD was not asking for anything abnormal as the orthopedics refused to discuss & transfer the care - care that wasn't billable 'care.'  In fact her complaint to the Medical Board of Ohio was not investigated - it was just given to the orthopedic so that he could counter-complain -- again about care that he supposedly did that the BC/BS did not recognize as 'care.'  The orthopedic appears to have been exaggerating - not the woman MD - but the orthopedic had 'friends' on the State Medical Board of Ohio.  So this case has gone on without resolution for 20 years and several Governors, including Governor Kasich - who promised to reform these practices of fraudulent investigations of physicians for 'confidential' complaints.The State Medical Board of Ohio yearly spends tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars investigating physicians that have no complaints, physicians that bring bad care situations to the Board's attention for some standard-setting.  The care in this case was not orthopedic care as is recognized in any other state where BC/BS does reimbursements.  Dr. Resnick has been asked to psychiatrically evaluated this woman MD - with no patient complaints - for the 7th time for 2 days - which no medical insurance will reimburse.  It's hard to say whether Dr. Phillip Resnick has a hallucination, or that the Board has 20 years of hallucinations about this orthopedic care in question.  This fraud not a reason to take the woman MD's medical license for 20 years, 2 Hearings, and one Court of Appeals judgment (where the Ohio Court of Appeals tried to throw the case out, but the Medical Board restarted it).  The woman's medical license needs to be returned, and the costs of her getting re-credentialed paid by the State of Ohio - as in every other state that does this nonsense to increase the stats of 'bad' physicians.Complaints about physicians need to be checked as to whether the complaint was about a physician complaining about bogus care practices - which are frauds that physicians should be reporting and have to report in every other State but Ohio.

										Orthopedics in Ohio get a free ticket to abuse women patients: they can cast whenever they want, without cast padding so that the cast eats through the skin and they get a procedure (or flesh-eating bacteria), they can cast without training for that fracture (hip-and-knee guys can do wrist fractures - outside their area of expertise - and botch them), and the Members of the State Medical Board go along because it is their 'friends' doing this bad care.  So when you complain, the complaint goes to the orthopedic for him & his neighbors to counter-complain - AGAINST STATE LAW.  But who cares about the State Medical Board of Ohio breaking State Law?  Certainly not Governor Kasich - he only goes after 'pill mills.'  When the woman MD doesn't like the orthopedic eating pizza while caring for her fracture, not casting in the correct alignment, with the correct reduction or materials, then she gets ordered to multiple serial psychiatric evaluations to 'find a case' against her.  The hospital in question - Meridia Hillcrest - did not have the correct equipment in the ER to reduce this fracture.  The orthopedic would cast in the ER because he did so few hand and upper extremity fracture that he did not STOCK THE CASTING MATERIALS IN HIS OFFICE - too lazy.  This is done to women MDs with NO PATIENT COMPLAINTS. Outpatient care is ok, but not if the MD can't stock the materials to do the care, have the right equipment to set the fracture, or the 'right' help.  Wrist fractures in the past REQUIRED at least over-night hospitalization - the reductions often slip-out and have to be re-reduced.  The 'help' in most Ohio physician offices is untrained, and worse than in any law office (where you have to have extensive computer skills).  This goes for University Suburban Green Road office also - where the 'help' are not trained medical assistants or anything close.  Ponsky, Stellato, and Lacey don't have 'good' help - they botch what the physicians don't.      One case at the Medical Board has gone on for 20 years, 7 ordered evaluations without a 'case,' and over $500,000 spent in a 'fishing expedition' - without changing the ADMITTEDLY BAD ORTHOPEDIC PRACTICES AND CARE IN OHIO.  There are some fractures that STILL NEED OVERNIGHT CARE because of extensive bleeding, angulation, or the bone problems of the patient.  There were no vital signs ever taken on the woman MD except at Mayo Clinic.    Governor Kasich thinks this is 'funny' too - just like his Medical Board, ie to order a woman MD to evaluations and discuss her dating history, sexual preferences, and why she didn't like Dr. Nice.  She didn't 'like' Dr. Nice because he was supposed to do orthopedics, not a flirtation - he was married with 2 children like Rupert Sanders and in the POSITION OF POWER.  Dr. Nice's wife - who works for Howard Hanna and puts on her resume that she married an orthopedic - went along.  The woman MD never 'touched' Dr. Nice - he was bald, fat, paunchy, and short = the prototype of every Ohio orthopedic includes one or more of the 3 attributes.  
The hip-and-knee guy should have referred the fracture to one of the hand orthopedics - but the woman MD did not 'deserve' care if she did not like his care.  Who's kidding who that this guy is a bit PATHOLOGIC and needs some attitude readjustment?  Orthopedics don't have to be TEAM PLAYERS, but women MDs do.    
The woman MDs of Ohio deserve better; a Governor who cares, and is at least AWARE of what is going on at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Ohio taxpayers should not be funding this abuse of women MDs for 20 years or more.  This is not the job of Brad Reynolds in Constituent Affairs - he hasn't a clue.
The problem is gross abuse of power by male practitioners, and globally poor care of women patients by male physicians who then expect the Medical Board to 'mop up' their orthopedic mistakes by suspending the woman MD's license - so that she can get Board ordered therapy by a 'right' Ohio physician to accept the bad orthopedic care in Ohio.  All cases not having patient complaints, and going on over 2 years at the State Medical Board of Ohio, need EXTERNAL REVIEW.  There is no statute of limitations at the Ohio State Medical Board - false cases can go on without ever getting dismissed - and the funding is NEVER QUESTIONED. 
The lies that Drs. Nice & Keith put on the chart should have been recognized by a second grader, or at least a fifth grader, but definitely by the Members of the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Accepting just any complaint, not matter how blatant the lies & misstatements, is not ok for an ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD.  There's supposed to be some maturity of judgement in Members of a State Medical Board.  Then the Ohio Medical Board only approves psychiatric experts that will tell them what they want to hear - no matter how much cheating or fabrication of diagnoses.  That's not psychiatry, and the inability of a hip-and-knee guy to correctly assess, or set, a wrist fracture is just common sense.  Dr. Nice was asked to call the Hand Orthopedic Department of the Cleveland Clinic as he had trained there - he refused because the woman MD did not deserve this care and he didn't HAVE TO CALL - she had to refer herself with HIS temporary cast on?   ",Doctors

										Woman MDs in Ohio get used as 'example' patients - in either the good way or the bad way.  We get care done to ourselves that isn't 'good' to make an example that someone can do a procedure - even if he, or she, can't do the care.  During residency a woman MD starting up in practice wanted me to come to her as a patient - the problem was 'for what?'  
Dr. Nice wants sentinel cases that show patients that he can care for this problem, or what will happen if you object to his care - the Dr. Kralik example.  It's horrible both ways; women MDs should not provide practice experience for male MDs seeking verification that they can, or can't, do a procedure or care for a certain fracture.  
While Dr. Nice can do hips or knees, he should never go near a wrist fracture.  The Medical Board of Ohio needs to provide practice guidelines so that physicians don't go beyond their area of expertise.  That means that criminal forensic psychiatrists also do not do the evaluations of women MDs for the 7th time after Dr. Nice goofs on their care.  That is not a psychiatric case, and Dr. Resnick - who allowed these abuses to go on in the Cleveland area without a whimper - needs to tell the truth as much as Dr. Botti - who allowed this at Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield Heights, Ohio.  Governor Kasich doesn't know enough about the area to say that this group of physicians can solve their own problems - they can't and need practice rules that physicians stay within their areas of expertise with women MD care.That woman MD needs the help of the best orthopedics in Ohio, and the best endocrinologist ASAP.  Governor Kasich you need to interfere and arrange that the woman MD in question gets seen by the best Ohio State has to offer, and that those medical & orthopedic recommendations - not psychiatric - get sent to the State Medical Board of Ohio. Today September 14, 2012, it's already almost too late.  This woman MD example for Dr. Nice is dying of neglect of her bone condition, from a neglected thyroid condition - a condition neglected so that Dr. Nice could say that he didn't have to do care as she didn't deserve care - the Medical Board of Ohio was going to let her die of neglect anyways - because they goofed after being provided wrong information.  Cleveland is not going to solve a Cleveland MD problem.  And the woman MD in question needs immediate endocrine care or she will die.  
Physicians that rarely do things, that aren't Board Certified yet, try to do something to a woman MD to make an 'example.'  This is discussed in the book Complications: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science by Atul Gawande - where newly-minted practitioners want to care for his ill child - and he has to insist that the care be done by the experts on staff - not the resident who just finished.  
Women MD's care in Ohio should not be done by the Dr. Nices - who even after 10 years in practice haven't got a clue that the woman MD needs blood work, and a workup, as she has something rare and 'zebra.'  Women MDs, if they couldn't diagnose themselves, have something rare - and physicians usually do present with rare problems because they would fix it themselves otherwise.  This woman MD had a rare bone problem, still has, but she wasn't impaired, just mistreated.  By Nice, by Keith, by the Medical Board, and by the suggestion that this bad care was her psychiatric problem.  
Women MDs, in Ohio, are examples of all kinds of never to be repeated medical, or orthopedic, care in Ohio - and they have to shut up or lose their medical licenses.  It's ok to take a woman's medical license instead of a guys - because the woman is not the main family provider - or is she in 2012?  This is allowed by Governor Kasich and his lackey - Richard Whitehouse - the experimentation on women MDs.  Dr. Keith - at MetroHealth - does it and gets away with it - and it doesn't work, ie all things experimental are just experimental.  
For one procedure in Cleveland I heard that 10 physicians on both sides of town 'did it' to a woman MD; it's similar to psychiatric 'goes' on women MDs at the State Medical Board.  The only other paradigm for this is the under-anesthesia pelvic story - where women get up to 10 or more pelvics when 'put out' for an appendicitis or ovarian problem - it's a dirty secret.  
The woman patient will wake up unable to walk from the pelvics - which are brutal when the woman patient can't object to the pain being caused.  It's like being a prostitute for a night - and no one will explain to the woman patient why she is 'so sore.'  It's a dirty secret, but one that Kasich and his Medical Board continue to allow.  Unconsented for pelvics are the paradigm for unconsented for fracture care by Dr. Nice in Ohio, and unconsented for anesthesia in Surgery at University Hospitals of Cleveland - which leads to unconsented for psychiatric 'goes' - where the Medical Board has to know how many times the woman MD did it and with who - how promiscuous she is or isn't.  Why should Dr. Resnick care - that's not why the orthopedics goofed her fractures.  Happens all the time in Ohio in 2012.  Romney agrees apparently.   
But that was nothing like Dr. Nice wrist fracture care - care that didn't exist or was horrible even in simulation.  Then Nice (who isn't 'nice') lied about it to the State Medical Board, so that the woman MDs license was taken for objecting - in excruciating nightmarish detail the lies go on in his records.  Dr. Nice does not know how to do wrist fracture care - which way to angle the cast, to put stockingette on the fracture skin, to check an x-ray of the fracture (his office staff will order the x-rays for a 'Boxer' fracture for a wrist fracture as he does not hired trained help or even medically knowledgeable help).  And the Medical Board of Ohio will review none of his cases for mistakes - he is above investigation or reprimand. 
If you don't like Dr. Nice care - you 'don't deserve care.'  He will also let the fracture ripen to excrescence; it will be bloody swollen to non-recognizable shape before he casts and his office will watch and laugh about it.  Dr. Nice does not do enough wrist fracture to stock wrist fracture casting materials - BC/BS knows this but NOT the State Medical Board of Ohio.   
The Medical Board of Ohio pretends to protect patients, but only ensures the abuse of women MDs - even though everyone in town - just not Columbus - knew that Dr. Nice could not do wrist fractures.  His care leaves seasoned ER docs 'speechless,' even though the same woman MD will say that his 'wife and daughter are ok.'  The problem is Dr. Nice care - which has to be stopped.Governor Kasich you know the case and need to order an investigative review of what really happened.  The woman MD has been 20 years without a license and is dying of abuses, beatings, and no care of the thyroid problem that caused the fractures - she calls your office many days, many times, since before you took office, and you know this and don't hear.  
There have to be medical mistake laws to temper the mistakes, and male MDs in Ohio need to stop blaming the women MDs when they have a 'bad day' or make a bad decision - they need to refer immediately without blame.  40-some states have 'medical mistake laws.'  Most legislators in Ohio don't know the term - for sure none appointed to the 98th House district.  
The Dr. Nice care of wrist fracture in NE Ohio - Cleveland needs to stop.  Euclid Meridia Hospital needs to restrict Dr. Nice to care that he can demonstrate to do reasonably well.  The blaming of women MDs about the care needs to stop.  The woman whose license has been taken for 20 years does not have a psychiatric disorder - she just objected to Dr. Nice trying to do care of her wrist fractures when even her BC/BS insurance would not go along. 									",Doctors

It's all a joke and piles of lies in Columbus.  They've analyzed the woman MD six times to try to 'find a case.'  This has never before been done - the emotional damage can only be guessed at.  Nothing better to do in Ohio, and the psychiatrists should not have had a license - the experts for the Board admittedly cheated because they had to collect a paycheck.  These MDs cheat on evaluations for the State Medical Board of Ohio - 3 of them should have sanctions - but the Ohio Medical Board paid them for lying.  They just were just not 'pill mill' MDs - but they still were part of the Medical Board fraud. [continued below]....
									
										..... The Medical Board of Ohio only pays experts who tell them what they want to hear - experts who falsify Rorschach tests and make up diagnoses that don't exist.  Anything can be changed at the Ohio State Medical Board and everything, including who profits, is 'confidential.'  BC/BS knew the difference, and would not pay Dr. Nice for virtual care, but not the Members of the State Medical Board that paid for the fraud, or debated the fraud for 20 years.  Business as usual in Ohio.    The Kasich, and previous Administrations, have wasted over $500,000 of taxpayer monies - to screw a Case graduate woman MD who passed her Internal Medicine Boards on the first try - because the boys in Ohio can't do that.  Because Governor Kasich could not do that.  But right now the waste is a Republican 'thing.'  For the last 2 years. 
Her fractures were left uncasted for 3 weeks while the woman MD tried to work, and begged for care from the boys.  The boys in Ohio like woman MDs to beg - promise free office space & staff, free equipment, referrals, and anything else personal.  It's an ebay auction.  With two wrist fractures however, his woman MD wasn't very seductive or able to provide the 'personals.' 
Her letters begging for help, that the fracture was still uncasted, were dissected and laughed at as a personality disorder - letters begging for care and that she didn't touch the orthopedic that made the excuse that she was too 'seductive' to be casted correctly or in a timely manner - she didn't 'deserve' care as she wasn't a 'Catholic girl who was easy.'  She didn't 'make nice,' as the Dixie Chicks put it.  She didn't put out in the way that she was supposed to at Hillcrest, or in Ohio apparently.  Two wrist fractures swollen to 'excrescence' is not very seductive - but it is cruelty and preying on a patient in the worst way.  
Why would she want a married orthopedic who was balding, short, paunchy, and crude?  She didn't need to marry an inadequate MD to get her MD.  Someone who's picture isn't on the web as it would disprove all this rot - the Medical Board Members have never met with Dr. Nice - too busy screwing the woman who he threatened to 'make or break.'  Destroying this woman MD with no patient complaints has been a full-time Ohio Medical Board 'mission.'  Why is the question?  And who is Benton Taylor?  Who is the only guy that answers the phone at the office of Richard Whitehouse Esq?  No one in Governor Kasich's office knows.  Call and ask (614)466-3555. But BC/BS wouldn't pay a cent to Dr. Nice for his non-cast for 3 weeks - the 'seduction' excuse didn't fly with them, just with the Medical Board of Ohio.  However, friends of Dr. Nice on the Medical Board are still insisting that the woman MD lie about the bad care to get her medical license back.  What lie should she tell?  But there was no care - it was such 'bad' care that one of the NY psychiatric experts - who co-authored the DSM, but who's Findings were not accepted by the State Medical Board of Ohio -  told her that he would have lied to get out of the care - the care had no excuse.  It should have resulted in warnings for the two orthopedics - to improve their care in their offices, and their respective hospitals and medical centers = University Green Road in South Euclid. 
Her supervisor at Hillcrest Hospital (Chief of Internal Medicine at the time), Dr. Robert Botti, did nothing when other physicians came to him that the woman MD couldn't stand up with the pain - it was a good joke.  He is a regular church-goer at St. Francis Parish in Gates Mills, Ohio where his wife Betty reads from the pulpit - however he never accepted all that 'bull' about being a good Samaritan or neighbor.  Leave the woman on the floor at Hillcrest Hospital was his motto.  He's now got Betty, known to her high school class as 'Betty the Body.'  That's all Dr. Botti thinks of women - a mindless body
It's a game to disable the woman MD - to put her in her place in Ohio.  No blood work is done or allowed for this woman MD in Ohio, just an endocrine consult saying that she doesn't get along with men.  Dr. Lafferty was mildly cognitively impaired at the time probably - but gospel.  Dr. Lafferty couldn't order even a vitamin D level, and her family history is of a vitamin D absorption problem - her siblings.  But Dr. Lafferty didn't take a history, he got obsessed trying to prove that 25 years earlier she had anorexia - anorexia that was never diagnosed.  The food was bad at her all girls Catholic boarding school.  The woman MDs thyroid condition, and her bone problem, are still untreated 20 years later; the Medical Board wants her to admit that she has some psychiatric disorder that she has no criteria for.  Bipolar will do - without the symptoms.  In Ohio, a gifted MD means that the woman MD has a psychiatric disorder - she's just manic instead of dedicated.  Anything to discredit merit and IQ ability.  Every psychiatric test in the book, and in the 'pipeline,' is on file for her at Columbia-Presbyterian in NYC - it's all 'normal.'  Dr. Resnick won't accept that - he wants to bully her personally for 2 days - without allowing her treatment of her thyroid or bone condition - he's a 74-year old internationally known monster.  Later it would come out that she had thyroiditis causing the fractures with no trauma - but MDs in Ohio can't treat thyroiditis.  Dr. Lafferty wouldn't know a swollen thyroid if it hit him in the face, and Dr. Resnick thinks that thyroiditis doesn't need treatment - he's an internationally known forensic expert for the state.  No one has a grain of common sense or any ability to see innocence being abused; abuse of woman is accepted in Ohio.  Not ONE MD in Ohio has offered to help her.  It was a joke that she was just 'unlucky,' a joke for the orthopedics who skipped class the day that they talked about this in Medical School - Dr. Nice of Euclid Meridia and Dr. Keith of MetroHealth.  This posting won't produce ONE physician willing to help her - that's the bet.  Anyone willing to help her, could find her.  The mistreatment of woman MDs in Ohio, to get false disciplinary suspensions for objecting to bad care, is what is going on in Ohio at the State Medical Board - the 'reign of terror' of Mr. Rick Whitehouse.  No one has ever heard of these suspensions, and it isn't Ohio law - it's a Kasich law, and Mr. Whitehouse's belt that needs the notches.  Mr. Whitehouse is running for? 
Governor Kasich is running Ohio, and running Romney out of the Presidential race.  Everyone deserves adequate medical care and a job - fair treatment at their licensure Boards, and time to heal before any impairment labels are applied.  Nurses with this fracture are mandated 5 weeks off - until fully healed and finished physical therapy.The blood work wasn't done, the consultation at Mayo Clinic wasn't finished, and the physical therapy had not finished.  There were no patient complaints - it was to 'save' Dr. Nice and not improve the care, and attitudes, about woman at the hospitals in Ohio - that was why her license was taken.  And it was a rare cause of fractures - that he would have gotten out of missing the diagnosis of - but not missing the casting of.   
This woman MD has now been 'disciplined' for 20 years.  But then the joke is that every legislative woman takes her daily testosterone so as not to help other women.  Reforms are needed, and the Medical Board knew this in 1998-9 when they briefly offered to 'open her case' for reforms - one of a stack of probably false cases that the incoming Executive Director of the State Medical Board - Mr. Tom Dilling - was embarrassed by - for 5 minutes.  The offer was accepted and then rescinded - she needed another psychiatric 'go' by a new 'right' Ohio psychiatrist - while she continued to fracture from the neglect of any medical care.  International law would not allow this, but Ohio law does.
This woman MD needs a good academic endocrinologist, but there are NONE in Ohio, and NONE with any courage, fairness, or compassion.  None one in 20 years has given her their card, or extended a hand to help clear her and get her back to work.  At Cleveland Clinic in town - Chad Deal MD won't help her (warning to his patients: he will write whatever the 'boys' tell him to on the chart), Dr. Abby Abelson is waiting for the woman MD to fracture her hip, and Dr. Licata is happy to retire and look the other way - he refused to treat her bone condition from 2007-2012 - couldn't be bothered, too much trouble. 
Not one endocrinologist in Ohio knows how to order a TSH, or treat low density bone from the neglect of a thyroid disorder.  This is not a psychiatric condition Dr. Resnick - DSM to Dr. Resnick.  NOT ONE MD in Ohio has a brain, or a heart - which is just terribly sad on top of the idiots at the Ohio Medical Board of cheating, fraud, and daily corruptions - where everything is 'confidential' and changed to 'find a case.'  
If you see her on the street, maybe help her.  She's out there and without a job or license - because the State Medical Board of Ohio wants her put in her place - whatever that is.  She passed every test, and made it through Medical School, only to be ruined by not being allowed 'care-to-function.' 									",Doctors

										Boys will be boys in Columbus.  The Ohio Medical Board admittedly CHEATS on cases - in one instance they falsified a Rorschach inkblot test to get a woman MD's license provisionally suspended - they never recorded the answers, but said that the test was 'abnormal' as she had to disagree with an orthopedic doing the wrong care, ordering the wrong x-ray, and not referring.Medical mistakes are a fact of life, and patients & their families have to continually watch the care.  But when a woman MD watches her care, and objects to a male MD, the Medical Board takes her medical license for a personality disorder - not going along.




The Medical Board of Ohio admittedly cheats - Governor Kasich has no way to review these cases and when you call the Medical Board you get Benton Taylor.  Who is Benton Taylor is as profound a question as 'Who is John Galt' - no one in Governor Kasich's office knows who he is.  But Benton Taylor is manning the State Medical Board.




The Medical Board routinely cheats on psychiatric evaluations of physicians - evaluations not because patients have complained, but the physician's competition complained.  The Medical Board of Ohio will order Rorschach inkblot tests at bizarre locations and pronounce them 'abnormal.'  Well they gave this test to a bunch of people applying for something (bank account, job), and most were abnormal - a completely unreliable test is used in Ohio to 'provisionally' take medical licenses.  It's not accepted in any courtroom, but it is provisional 'evidence' - when cheated on - at the State Medical Board of Ohio.




The Medical Board will also order serial psychiatric evaluations on women physicians - who won't go along with boys being boys care - and pronounce them abnormal with fabricated diagnoses and evidence.  Nothing is unchangeable at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  They make up criteria and make up diagnoses - but they don't allow women physicians to get blood work.




Governor Kasich is making Romney look bad in Ohio - because it's all about corruption, fraud, faking things and CHEATING.  Because there is no statute of limitations in Ohio, the Medical Board keeps cheating.  They admit they cheat and that they will do it again until you 'admit' their case.      ",Doctors

										The State Medical Board of Ohio admittedly CHEATS on cases, but so what - even when the physicians are innocent, there is no statute of limitations or process to admit false cases and end the harassment.  Some cases are just that the physician objected to the wrong care being done to themselves - fractures of physicians left to ripen to excrescence - but the physician needs therapy to 'handle' bad care allowed by Ohio?  When her BC/BS would not pay the orthopedic one cent for that care?  That's not a diagnosis that any medical insurance will pay for, or pay to evaluate someone 7 times for.  It's not all about 'pill mill' physicians, it's about 'right' care.

										.....  But that's who you are supposed to talk to at the State Medical Board of Ohio - no picture, no CV, and he doesn't know what you are talking about.  
In 1998-9, the State Medical Board admitted that they had a STACK of probably false physician disciplines fueled by the HYSTERIA of the 1990s to 'find bad MDs.'  One of these, a woman MD, with no patient complaints, had her license taken for objecting to admittedly the wrong care - care that her BC/BS would not cover as it was a hip-and-knee surgeon trying to do wrist fracture care - out of his comfort zone or ability zone.  The woman MD objected, but this Dr. Nice had 'friends' on the Medical Board and could 'make or break her.'  And he 'broke' the woman MD.  
This woman MD practiced above average Internal Medicine for Ohio - a state where many of the Internal Medicine physicians can't pass their Boards on numerous tries.  This woman MD passed on her first try - her picture is attached.  The Medical Board insists that she has some impairment - they can diagnose from her picture apparently?  This has gotten this woman MD 'beaten up' at airports, because someone calls that she is a 'threat'?  Who is the question?  
The Medical Board of Ohio has admitted to cheating on at least TWO of her taxpayer paid-for evaluations, but so what?  The pill mill physicians should get the evidence rechecked, because THE OHIO STATE MEDICAL BOARD CHEATS.  In this one case, the Medical Board fabricated a Rorschach inkblot test, and invented a psychiatric diagnosis that doesn't exist.  But so what?  
The Ohio Medical Board needs reforms, and someone needs to get Mr. Whitehouse on the phone.  Physicians in Ohio can't keep speaking to Benton Taylor.  And Brad Reynolds is another fictional character.   ",Doctors

The Governor's policies at the Ohio State Medical Board reflect the Republican party at this time - and the reflection is one of fraud, corruption, and state-sponsored waste - wasting time on cases with no patient errors, just that the physician had to disagree with a colleague who was admittedly wrong. 
Governor John Kasich campaigned to reform the State Medical Board of Ohio, and so far - there are no reforms - just more of the same - with Benton Taylor answering the phone.  Benton Taylor is the voice of Richard Whitehouse & Governor Kasich.

Before Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Dilling would threaten physicians on the phone to 'admit the Board's case or never practice again' = the court of justice at the Medical Board was what Mr. Dilling wanted to be true, no matter the evidence.

										My name is William Jordan; I came to your office on 10/30/06 to make an appointment for a colonoscopy. My appointment was at 2:30pm and you were able to see me right away. We discussed, preparing the night before the procedure and arranging for a ride home after the procedure. You took my blood pressure, listened to my lungs and felt around my pelvic area. We decided on a week from that coming Wednesday to have the procedure done.  That part of the visit was just as I expected, less than 10 minutes. You turned me over to your assistant, Michel, (who was so arrogant and rude I almost walked out) what I didnt expect was to be charged $462.00 for a short visit like that. I guess that Michel could see I thought that was excessive and told me if I gave him CASH not a check he would give me a 40% discount. Even though I thought it was a rip-off I assumed that amount would be taken off the final bill and I agreed. I went to the bank and made a withdrawal (My receipt says 3:05 my point is; the appointment was at 2:30 and after the check-up by you, the interview by Michael and driving to the bank was 35 minutes in total). On my way back to your office I got a call that I was needed at my job. After I went to fix the problem at my work (about 4:30) I called your office to tell Michel I would drop the cash off first thing in the morning on my way to work. He said he checked with the bookkeeper and if I didnt get there today the deal was off (what deal?) and the bill would be $462.00 in the morning. I told him there was no way I could make it there till morning; he said he would bill me for $462.00 and if I did not pay it he said he would report me to the credit bureau. (Very rude and arrogant as he was the whole time).
I spoke with some friends and business associates, 2 of them are doctors. They feel like I do, that that was not a Level 5 consultation (it was less than 10 minutes with you) even though Michel was trying to strong arm me for one. Also I found it very unsettling that it was so important for me to drop what I was doing and drive all the way across town to drop off $300.00 in CASH at 5:00pm or the bill would be $462.00 at 9:00am. 
I originally called your office to make an appointment to have a colonoscopy done. I was told that the Doctor has to meet me before they could make the appointment for the procedure. I explained that I just left Dr. Boross office where I had a complete check up and I am very healthy. I gave her my age, height and weight and the fact I am very healthy I thought that a consult would be a waste of time and money. 
My partner just had the procedure done by Dr. Rakov. He also met the Doctor before the procedure. The Doctor explained the preparation to him and did the same basic checkup. There was no bill that day, if there was a charge it was added to the final bill for the procedure. That is what I had expected. 
After the terrible time I had ar your office I had the procedure done by Dr. Rakov in December of 2006. I called his office explained that I just had a complete check up and I was healthy. We set a date, we met in the hospital and the procedure was done that afternoon. He billed my insurance company and I have not had to pay a penny out of pocket. That is what I had expected.

										Richard Whitehouse is going along with past 'confidential' complaints about physicians from orthopedics who were fired from the care of that physician - one for drunkenness on the phone, one for an experimental cast that didn't work.  Any physician who really drinks is never 'caught' by the State Medical Board of Ohio - just the physicians that notice the drinking.  Both orthopedics in the one case, were told quietly to refer and refused - because of the lack of a procedure to handle unanticipated bad results/care at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  The lack of a no-fault sign-off form to transfer medical care which the State Medical Board of Ohio will accept.
The physician suspended objected to the wrong care, which the Medical Board allowed, and then the Board had her license suspended for 'making too much of bad care' of herself - quote from Anita Steinbergh DO.  This is only ONE of a stack of false cases from the Ohio State Medical Board in the 1990s - there's a STACK of false suspensions.  Why should the woman MD be on suspension for objecting to the wrong care, wrong diagnosis, wrong treatment and refusals of the wrong physicians to refer - she had to handle that better? 
This is not a reason to suspend a medical license - she deserved an explanation of why the State Medical Board of Ohio allows fractures to ripen to excrescence, hip-and-knee orthopedics to attempt care of serious wrist fractures with complications (when the BC/BS won't pay for this in Cleveland, Ohio), and why a 'confidential' complaint by the neighbors, colleagues, and business associates of Dr. Nice got so far.  Dr. Nice & Mrs. Nice are allowed to run the State Medical Board of Ohio apparently - his power and her money - and they still are.
The orthopedics that testified to the Medical Board were 'fired' multiple times from the care for cause - drunk comments on the phone for Dr. Nice, unanticipated complications of an experimental cast for Dr. Keith - now the Hand Chief at MetroHealth?  But the real problem is that Richard Whitehouse Esq will not get on the phone and discuss the issues and resolve things - the woman MD had no patient complaints and had to get appropriate care so that she could care for patients safely - that means being healthy.  That means blood work - and the woman MD does not look 'crazy.'  
This case has gone on for 20 years, 6 evaluations, 2 hearings, and the State Court of Appeals tried to throw it out in 1993 - 3 objective judges tried to stop this case as have 3 nationally-known psychiatric experts.  The State Medical Board has wasted over $500,000 and Mr. Whitehouse won't try to resolve things fairly - it wasn't a patient safety situation, the woman MD was not in a safe situation regarding her orthopedic care.  The State of Ohio is required to protect women MD-patients, just like any other patient - from wrong unsafe care, situations of neglect, and no blood work.  The Medical Board Members took her medical license without allowing the Mayo Clinic to finish the workup and blood work - they don't believe in blood work - and there were not any drugs involved.  But the pain meds didn't have to be prescribed if the fracture workup was done to ascertain the cause of the fractures.  The woman MD did not merit any blood work as she was just 'unlucky,' and didn't 'deserve' care.
The woman MD CAN'T refer to the one male orthopedic preferentially, as a condition of re-licensure, who got on the phone DRUNK to her so that she had to fire him from her care and office referrals.  He will get on the phone with other patients drunk.
But this has been a mandatory condition of the State Medical Board of Ohio, ie refer to Dr. Nice.  So that the patients can get mad when she sends a knee replacement and he wants to fillet the patient's arm from wrist to elbow (not a upper extremity orthopedic), or he sends them appliances in the mail that they did not ask for, agree to or want.  There was a line of patient families with complaints about Dr. Nice to my office - and that was only one office in the Hillcrest Building.  The Ohio State Medical Board has 'friends' and preferential treatment for those 'friends' causing unjustified medical licensure suspensions of women MDs who object - Dr. Nice can now get any woman MD to sleep with him or lie for him.   									",Doctors

										Mr. Richard Whitehouse (Executive Director of the State Medical Board of Ohio) & Governor John Kasich, despite Kasich's 2010 campaign promises to reform the Medical Board, are continuing stacks of false physician disciplines and suspensions from the 1990s.  Ohio is the state with the largest backlog of false physician disciplines - with no reforms on the horizon as Governor Kasich is not up-to-date on what is going on at the State Medical Board of Ohio - no interest.  He'd much rather listen to a Taylor Swift song - even though he and Ohioans may never be 'getting back together again' after 2014.Looking at The Ohio State Medical Board in the 1990s is like visiting a time capsule: a time when there was no due process, no rules of evidence, no need for patient complaints or criteria, and no statute of limitations = 1990s.  In continuing false cases, Governor Kasich is assuming the 'blame' and liability; going backwards. [continued below]....
									
										..... Because there are no statutes of limitations in Ohio that affect State Medical Board investigations, the Medical Board is allowed to continue a suspension of a physician for 2 decades even though they do not have a case yet.  Provisional information, from 'confidential' sources, allows that the Medical Board of Ohio suspend a physician, even if that physician has no patient complaints and no criteria for the provisional.  Qualifications, and conflicts of interest, of signers of 'confidential' physician complaints are never checked - even to this day anyone can file a confidential complaint about a physician with the State Medical Board of Ohio - they take all trash.The Medical Board seldom assesses the local politics, the wives that complain about a woman physician that their husband has seemingly paid too much attention to, or the hospital jealousies that the 'confidential' system feeds into (young newly-trained vs older physicians).  This 'confidential' mess, destroys physician careers that are needed to staff rural & community hospitals, research centers.  Communities, in need of physicians, need to start paying attention to what is going on at the State Medical Board of Ohio with regards to false cases, fraud, and the ol' boys network - or these communities will have to import FMGs that don't appear to be targeted by The State Medical Board of Ohio as much - for some reason.  Women MDs, American Medical School grads - are who the Medical Board of Ohio goes after with no basis and extreme prejudices.  DOs on the Medical Board especially target the MDs - rivalries of training in Ohio.  The worst case is one where the woman MD has had her license suspended for objecting to Dr. Nice orthopedic care, when Dr. Nice did not have certifications in that specialty of orthopedics.  The Ohio BC/BS (Blue Cross/Blue Shield Medical Insurance) would not pay for Dr. Nice to be caring for those fractures or the woman MD patient - not one cent ever came back in a check from the BC/BS insurance for Dr. Nice - yet he had 'friends' on the State Medical Board.  But the woman MD could not get him to sign-off, refer, and stop trying = trying to do care that Dr. Nice did rarely, or not at all, if he had a hip/knee replacement to do.  If the woman MD did not like Dr. Nice 'care,' then she did not 'deserve' care.  Mrs. Nice got into it - even though her husband could not collect for any 'care' that he did, and why would he continue 'care' that he was not authorized to do by the BC/BS insurance?  What was her husband Dr. Nice getting out of the woman MD, or trying to get from the woman MD, that this farce continued far too long, and for too many complications?  The Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Ohio would not pay for Dr. Nice to do the care - but the Medical Board of Ohio has paid >$500,000 to 'go after' the woman for not liking Dr. Nice care; making too much of bad care that BC/BS did not even reimburse Dr. Nice to do in the Cleveland Area.  Taxpayers fund all these false 'cases' in Ohio - each one costing about $500,000 - which is a lot of casino money.The Metropolitan Cleveland Area is considered a medical tertiary care 'center,' and so BC/BS can specify that 'care' be done by physicians with the proper certifications and level of experience - and that they will not reimburse hip-and-knee replacement surgeons to do wrist fracture care = the issue involved.  Dense but: it has taken the State Medical Board Members two decades to get the POINT - that even physicians can't pay for their medical care out-of-pocket; they have to go where the insurance will pay part.  And it's not in the end ANYTHING PERSONAL OR PSYCHIATRIC.  The insurances control medical care.So the Medical Board of Ohio gets into it that they will mandate that Dr. Nice do care that BC/BS does not have him on the roster for, and won't reimburse for, but his wife wants to say that the woman MD was 'crazy'?  Dr. Nice should not have been trying to do care that he could not collect for as the certifications & experience were not there - and BC/BS had & has that information.  But to take this to the suspension of a medical license for 20 years - with no one 'seeing' the truth and Mr. Whitehouse not answering his phone - is just plain stupidity.  Governor Kasich seems more concerned about his RNC speech than anything in Ohio.  Communities in need of physicians need to check no further than the State Medical Board of Ohio - where there are stacks of physicians with medical licenses in 'limbo' for crimes as 'simple' as objecting to the wrong care by a physician that BC/BS would not re-imburse for the care.  And professional courtesy for physicians ended in 1990 - what was left of it; so physicians have to be concerned that their insurances will cover the physician's care that they need - for ob-gyn, pregnancy, fractures, etc.  Physicians, as well as patients, have to go to the provider that their insurance will re-imburse.  But the Medical Board of Ohio doesn't see this, Governor Kasich doesn't see this.  Communities in need of physicians need to contact Governor Kasich and bargain for the release of one of the physicians whose license was taken for not going along with admittedly 'bad' medical/orthopedic etc. care by the 'wrong' provider for the medical insurance.  There are literally STACKS of these physicians, with such good qualifications that colleague jealousies led to 'confidential' complaints.  Legislators like Representative Matt Lynch need to know what is going on at the State Medical Board of Ohio - instead of retrofitting Emergency vehicles for campaign gimmicks.And somebody please answer why an orthopedic wife would campaign that a woman MD's license be suspended for trying to get 'out' of her husband's care - when her husband would not be reimbursed for trying to do care out of his purview, experience, and qualifications/certifications?  What was the wife getting from this?",Doctors

										The Ohio State Medical Board is taking US-educated women MD, in many cases Ohio-educated at taxpayer expense, medical licenses for upwards of 20 years - for complaining about bad care that the Medical Board doesn't want to fix. = NOT HANDLING ADMITTED BAD CARE IN OHIO WELL = BOYS BEING BOYS 'CARE.'  
The State Medical Board of Ohio has no STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS to find a case once a medical license is suspended for 'provisional' - even if provisional is a bona fide hoax.  How can you prove that you don't even KNOW the physicians that signed the complaint when the signatures are 'confidential?'  No credentials are required, no background check, to complain 'confidentially' against a woman MD in Ohio.   
Woman physicians in Ohio are disciplined for having the 'personality' disorder to notice the bad care practices, the complications, and for trying to improve things, e. [continued below]....
									
										.....g. fractures allowed to ripen to 'excrescence' in Ohio at Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield Heights (Cleveland).  For the stats, as the men MDs can't be disciplined in Ohio.  It's what Lance Armstrong ran up against, confidential sources that don't have to exist.  Governor Kasich campaigned about this problem, and to this date has done little-to-nothing to fix the 'stack' of false cases at the Medical Board going on since the early 1990s -- where out-of-date practitioners 'confidentially' complain about physicians who just passed their Boards and finished up-to-date residencies.  Once you get complained about 'confidentially,' you will never practice medicine again in Ohio, or anywhere - that's the Dr. Nice threat.
It's the ol' boy network vs the new girl on the staff problem. The Ohio Legislature knows about the mess, and will not do anything because of the HUGE liability involved in these false cases - even if the statute of limitations is over in an real sense; 20 years the statute of limitations is 'over.  There are so many false cases of physician discipline/suspension in Ohio that went on in the 1990s, that the payment of justified damages would bankrupt Ohio - per the Speaker of the Ohio House in 2003. 
In Ohio, there is no statute of limitations at the State Medical Board of Ohio, or procedure to get a false case against a woman MD dismissed in Ohio - unless that woman is sleeping with someone powerful or on the Medical Board.  These 'cases' are not even about the woman MD's medical care of patients - they are that the Medical Board does not like her 'personality' as she disagrees with more senior MDs if she has to - which is daily in Ohio.
It's the corruption that 'confidential' complaints about physicians causes in Ohio - a mess that the TX & NY Medical Boards have been sued successfully for - by the AAPS (Am Assoc of Physicians & Surgeons).  Every other state except Ohio has some reforms about this in legislative process.  Ohio just ignores the problem, and wastes the lives, skills & training of the MDs while importing MDs from the rest of the world - who can't speak English, but will never disagree about anything except that they didn't get their check ($).  Communities in Ohio, or other states (Georgia, AK), needing a Board Certified Woman MD Internist who can pass every test (MENSA IQ), and has no patient complaints, should contact Governor Kasich's office about getting women MDs out of trouble in Ohio, and back to medical work - not neverending 'therapy' to have the designer personality that the Ohio State Medical Board wants.  It's not about the patient care of these woman MDs, it's that they don't 'please' the Dr. Nices. 
At least one woman MD just objected to the bad care done to herself, care that she was supposed to lie about - and she couldn't do that because her condition was left untreated - for her to die basically.  Dr. Nice had 'friends' on the State Medical Board, so he didn't have to refer, consult, cast, arrange for a workup, keep accurate records or send them.  
Psychiatric 'therapy' of disagreeing woman MDs does not fix the Ohio medical mistake problem, or the acknowledged patient morbidities and mortalities that they cause.  Ohio has no medical mistake laws, so women MDs complaining about bad care - that 'friends' of Medical Board Members get away with - have their medical licenses suspended indefinitely until they learn to lie and not mention the mistakes of these 'Friends.'  
Internationally-known Dr. Resnick is asked to evaluate them for the 7th time, to still try to 'find a case' after 20 years - and the problem is that he GOES ALONG.  Dr. Resnick will not allow that the woman MD defend herself against the 'confidential' - he's an ol' boy - kangaroo court with talking heads.    
This is not working; Governor Kasich knows about the STACK of false physician cases.  'Friends' of Medical Board Members get their 'confidential' complaints against Ohio State Law.  Medical Board Members in Ohio break the law for these 'friend' practitioners so that they can clear their names and not spend huge monies on 'confidential' cases.  The law is broken daily for 'friends' in Ohio.The attached photo is of one woman Internist who needs a community that wants her services.  Her medical license has been suspended for objecting to admittedly wrong orthopedic care = the care was very bad, but allowed in Ohio at the time.  Because there were no medical mistake laws in Ohio, the Medical Board assessed that she handled things in the wrong way by trying to get her medical records to the consultants, and therefore did not deserve to practice medicine in Ohio or anywhere.  She was supposed to 'cover' things up in some still undefined way.
The woman MD was trying to save her hands, her bones, her career, and her ability to have a family.  Call Governor Kasich & register that your community, or practice, needs an Ohio-educated physician (Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine).  Maybe EBAY is a better place for an auction, but there should be some professionalism left in Ohio.   Communities, or rural areas, in need of a Medical Internist, who did not go into medicine for the money, should contact Governor Kasich's office at (614) 466-3555, or Mr. Richard Whitehouse at (614)728-3673.  This woman has to pay the State Medical Board another $5000 for a 7th psychiatric evaluation of her 'personality,' but she would repay any community 10-fold for the opportunity of serving them for at least a year.  And she's not sure that Dr. Resnick will 'let' her pass unless she lies about what happened - she was taught not to lie about medical care problems, but to 'fix' the problems - to admit the mistakes.  So Governor Kasich needs to fix the catch-22 also.
The problem is that she HAS a personality - which has passed evaluations by three nationally-known experts who have told the State Medical Board of Ohio to 'stop' this after 4 evaluations.  The US expert on personality disorders at Columbia-Presbyterian in NYC told the Ohio State Medical Board to 'stop' the emotionally damaging evaluations in 1995-6.  That was just a challenge to the Ohio State Medical Board & Mr. Whitehouse. Communities needing US-trained medical practitioners need to step up to the plate and 'see' what is going on - where only 'friend's of the State Medical Board Members are licensed in Ohio. ",Doctors

										Loss of medical licenses gets pretty petty in Ohio - just disagree with Dr. Nice & his buddies at Hillcrest Hospital and they will write a 'confidential' complaint - all the neighbors & their wives.  'Confidential' complaints have no rules in Ohio - anyone can do one - for any reason; doesn't have to be about the physician's patient care, can be their personality, and the signer can be a polo pony for all the Medical Board checks on the credentials of the complaint signers.  Because the complaint is 'confidential' - you will never be able to clear you name and get on with your life - and Dr. Nice knows this.  But Dr. Nice can get his 'confidential' complaints to clear his name against State Law for some reason - it's privileges for ONE in Ohio under Governor Kasich.  Governor Kasich expects the Medical Board will reform itself.  Governor Romney apparently agrees with this - and his wife - as Governor Kasich & his wife agree.  So 'confidential' complaints will be the rule at Medical Boards come November 2012 if the Republicans carry the US?  Governor Kasich was a keynote Speaker.  Two years ago, Governor Kasich ran on a platform to clean up the corruptions at the State Medical Board of Ohio - and he has done literally NOTHING to do so in TWO years - so it's all talk.  Nothing Mrs. Romney can say to women will get any woman MD voter support with this gig = 'confidential' complaints are a way to get free sex from a woman MD (it's just billed as a personality disorder if she doesn't do it).  Anita Steinbergh DO has gone along with this charade for 20 years now.MD Internists are in demand in most states & rural Ohio, but Mr. Whitehouse will go along with woman medical licenses being taken for 20 years because the woman MD is not supposed to mention what Dr. Nice care really is - the care that got him kicked off of Geauga Community Hospital.  The woman MD sans a license is supposed to refer to Dr. Nice, and let the Medical Board know all her medical history and who she dated, or slept with - etc. - for Dr. Nice's purposes.  It's all about gossip.  And if the woman MD isn't experienced enough - then she's just paranoid of the 'boys' and what diseases they might carry on the side - so she needs therapy mandated from the Medical Board to get with the Ohio program.  It's all about nonsense in Ohio.  And what woman MD would/could be seductive with Dr. Nice?  His wife can't manage it even with the bonus MD attached to her mailing address.  The problem is that the Medical Board has never seen Dr. Nice in person, or in a picture - and a picture is worth a 1000 words.  Google a picture of Dr. Nice standing all of 5'5"" with not much in the way of hair on top.  He's so unappealing that he has to threaten to get it 'on the side,' and the Medical Board of Ohio is in business with him for this - Mr. Whitehouse doesn't deny it in 7 years and 4 months.  Mr. Whitehouse is apparently not authorized to end unjust cases that were carried on before he was appointed (stacks of them).  Those physicians just are supposed to go to Dr. Resnick for a 7th psychiatric evaluation for 8 hours/2 days at $5000/appointment.  These physicians have/had no patient complaints, practice higher standards of Internal Medicine than usually go in Ohio, and yet aren't allowed a medical license because they didn't/don't handle disagreeing with Dr. Nice the right way.  Dr. Nice interactions are the litmus test for Medical Board licensure in Ohio.Dr. Nice, on the Staff of Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield Heights, practices orthopedics so badly that most of the 700+ physicians on staff have to disagree with him if they have anything to do with him.  Only his Gates Mills neighbors, Carla O'Day MD, and physicians promised staff or ER privileges will sign complaints for him - and they don't know the physician that he complained about - they don't have to know the physician.  Carla O'Day MD talked to one of these woman physicians, that she signed a complaint against, only ONCE in 32 years - on the phone because she couldn't bother to talk with her in person.  And the woman MD had to do Carla a FAVOR or lose her hospital privileges - which were lost anyways with Carla's signature.  The woman MD did the favor for CARLA O'DAY MD, but it wasn't enough.     In Ohio, it is ever stranger who gets their medical license suspended: physician complaints about colleagues are the main item on the menu these days.  In Ohio, it doesn't matter if you don't know the physician that you sign a complaint against - it's 'confidential.'  There are no rules about WHO can complain under Governor Kasich - and Governor Romney needs to do something about this, or all Mrs. Romney's good intentions won't persuade one woman MD to vote Republican come November.  In Ohio everything is done for Dr. Nice: Dr. Nice can complain about any physician and see that they never practice medicine AGAIN in ANY state - he tells you this - and the Ohio Medical Board insists that you guarantee to refer him patients as a condition of re-licensure/licensure.  You can complain about a physician in Ohio if: (1) you exist with a body (doesn't matter the IQ level or the neurological impairment, or the criminal record); (2) you don't have to know the physician or have ever seen or spoken to them - just be promised a reward, contract for business, real estate, donation, etc, that you expect to collect on; (3) you are a neighbor of Dr. Nice, or party with him at the Gates Mills Hunt Club; (4) you were introduced to your wife by Dr. Suppes (Dr. Botti); (5) if you drink alcohol to excess on week nights, or at Medical Staff Meetings, in front of the woman MD (Dr. Suppes & Dr. Bash); (6) if you bump, rump, and hug the nurses in the OR and don't want the woman MD who saw it to say anything (Dr. Tozzi - whose wife ought to be better informed); (6) if you spoke with the physician once in 32 years on the phone and they did you a favor (Dr. O'Day); or (7) if you are on the Staff of Hillcrest Hospital and need ER privileges = something that Dr. Nice can provide.Time to re-visit 'confidential' complaints as every other state BUT Ohio has done in Republican Administration real-time, time for some reforms in Ohio if Romney wants to carry Ohio.",Doctors

										The usual treatment for abdominal wall nerve pain  after you get the correct diagnosis from Carnetts test & a history - is a nerve block after a workup, surgery is a last resort.  And Surgery not even 24 hours later, tells you that Mayo is having trouble. However, at Mayo Clinic in Rochester  no one mentions anything except taking you to surgery to fill Dr. Sarrs OR schedule.  In between flights out, he has to have a full OR schedule.  Literally Dr. Sarr tells you he has a 'sudden' opening, like another place in a gas chamber at Auschwitz, for his experiments, and he'll spend an hour arguing that a resident do the case and you came from Cleveland for him to do the case as Dr. Stellato is stumped.  5 minutes Dr. Sarr.The Plastics Chief at Mayo - who you had an appointment with - cant be bothered to even see a woman MD patient himself- sends in a FMG with a heavy accent to fumble around - not even a good toucher - just a groper.  However, the problem is the procedure that Sarr does without workup, and that the closure for this laparoscopy is usually a layered closure of just the muscles that needed to be cut or retracted, not cutting an additional muscle to sew them all together causing a deformity.  Dr. Sarr uses a common mass closure - cutting every abdominal muscle which will cause pain and weakness for the rest of that woman's life - only does it to women.Sarr's common mass closure is a rehash of the 1980s through-and-through closure, which never worked, and it's used to save 2 suture packs and training time.  To do a layered closure requires a resident, or attending, who can stich  not a Dr. Sarr  who only pretends to do closures.  Anyone in a Surgical Residency in the 1980s, saw this.  It was a publication gimmick - like the nerd male Medical School classmate who wrote an article that was published in JAMA about doing CPR with your foot.  Common mass closure, like foot CPR, was never meant to be really used - but Dr. Sarr doesn't 'get' that being out-of-it and in-the-air too much of the time.  Abdominal wall pain is Dr. Sarr wanting OR time, preying on women patients without the workup  and woman MDs cant always object as strongly as non-medical people; our reactions are graded and you can't 'react too much or you need counseling.  It's like in the movie 'Trust' - where the girl is 14 and guy about 35.  Women MDs can't always say what they mean, or object as they should - we are sent to counseling that we don't 'go along.'  And that has happened to me, and other classmates from CWRU Medical School - where it was common practice.  So attendings like Dr. Sarr can 'clean' up on assault and rape (multiple pelvics under anesthesia).  That's what women MDs are for - PRACTICE.  But Warner Oldenburg MD going along for the Mayo ride?  Common mass closure was a bad idea from the 1980s, then called through-and-through closure, that was resurrected for CV publications & sloppy quick closures by day-wonder trained techs, medical students with no hands (blacks and the non-interested), or residents from another country not familiar with sutures in the US.  Its beneath the Mayo Clinic  where all unconsented for closures need to be repaired as requested by patients for years now - Jill Beed-Smith, Esq still has no plan for this.  Women patients are placed under anesthesia with no anesthesia consults, with no asking about medication reactions or thyroid disorders, to assault them with common mass closure.  The workup, and differential, is at http://hcp.obgyn.net/laparoscopy/content/article/1760982/1887231- maybe Dr. Michael Sarr and Warner Andrew Oldenburg could read.  The flow chart is at the end - for the Plastics guy with no sense, it nowhere says to 'turf' to General Dysfunctional Surgery.  At many institutions, Plastics handles abdominal neuromas or abdominal wall pain - just not at jock-city Mayo Clinic.Patients with abdominal wall pain should not go NEAR the Mayo Clinic.  Warner Oldenburg needs to oversee the undoing of all these unnecessary procedures for the last 10-plus years, with mass common closures, on his woman colleagues at least.  He's looked the other way for this closure for about 20 years - it doesn't work.  It's one thing to marry for money, but to undo classmates with horrific procedures without consent? When a woman MD says No to the medical student (black or white), the creepy intern who can't use a scalpel (Dr. Baghai now slashing patients in CA), the anesthesia (drugs + airway Dr. Sarr were refused about 5 times), the muscle or nerve dissection  that means No  do not touch, and do not let the medical student practice on a closure that then requires years of plastic surgery to undo.  The worst nightmare for a woman MD is a male medical student, then a female intern, then a male black medical student out to prove his prowess and testosterone drive - that the woman MD deserves him - and he douses up for this with a whole bottle of black cologne.Dr. Oldenburg  do this on your kids or wife  not a medical school classmate.  When someone says No that No should be respected or it is assault.  Neuromas are common occurrences on General Surgery, Vascular Surgery, Bariatric Surgery, and Endocrine Cancer Surgeries - so all surgeons should know the WORKUP, the differential, the patient options, and SAY them - not just well you need to be in the OR tomorrow and don't argue with me girl = the Sarr attitude.  All that Sarr went into a diatribe about was the 'glories' of Mayo Clinic - where the boys do whatever to the women.Jill Beed-Smith needs to schedule the undoing of all Dr. Sarrs unconsented for procedures - the Chief Counsel is even worse than Sarr ethically.  The worst is when Dr. Sarr brags that he can get away with it  that he can operate and do a procedure without consent or discuss  and Dr. Oldenburg buys it for his tenure  like he bought a marriage of convenience = bottom line.  If Warner, then 'Andy' was good enough, had been around Case Medical School, instead of pleasing his new wife and her family for Mayo recommendations, he would be able to be talked to  if he had done the blood drawing, the late night studying, and the student discussions.  Dr. Sarr will also file a defamation suit against patients for saying that they did not consent to his procedure; while he admits that he did not discuss or obtain consent - and the lawyer is psychotic.    from http://hcp.obgyn.net/laparoscopy/content/article/1760982/1887231There are techniques, flow diagram charts as above, so that even a 'jerk' can correctly diagnose abdominal wall pain before scheduling procedures.  Dr. Sarr has a special back-alley FMG clearance, does not have to obtain anesthesia consultation, and has no surgical checklists.  The powers that be in Cleveland do not know how to do abdominal wall pain either: Ponsky, Stellato, Rosen, Grundfest or Shuck (after 50 years no Rules of Shuck).  ",Doctors

Dr. Sarr won't speak to you the morning of surgery as he arranges this farce, forgetting all that he promised the previous day before sex, shower, wine and play with the boys in the OR clique.  He's surrounded by males in ecstasy.  But the OR 'help' that goes along in a trance - without consent forms, without a qualm of conscience or a degree of moral compass, is the truly sad part.  Not ONE Operating Room RN will object, not ONE resident question, not one student say 'No.'  Not even a surgical tech will object - and they are trained NOT to do this type of procedure - not to start without a signed consent form - because THEY will be blamed if no one else.    No patient is supposed to have any procedure, or part of procedure, that was not discussed, merited or consented to.  The Mayo Clinic is not Auschwitz, and the horrors of that type of free-lance medical experimentation should have stopped in the 1940s.  And that includes the Mayo Clinic anesthesia residents who go after you that they will 'watch you' - with drugs - before you can object or manage to say the word 'No.'  Before you get to say your name, you are drugged.  The drugging for a case is the worst part - when you can't metabolize the drugs with an untreated thyroid disorder that Mayo Clinic conveniently missed and didn't test for on pre-op.  Dr. Sarr has a 'special' clearance foreign resident - for the 'quickie' disfigurements.It's Andy Oldenburg MD's (who now wants to be called 'Warner') last 'revenge' to permanently disfigure women classmates who did better than him on ONE test - couldn't take it so had to marry a non-medical person who wouldn't challenge.  But cutting all someone's abdominal muscles to permanently damage them?  A swimmer no less - if he bothered to know anything about his classmates.  Any cut in an abdominal muscle or fascia has to be for a reason, not a paycheck.  And that's probably why not ONE of his children will go near medicine as a career - too much of a challenge, and too little sense involved - they'd have to study and care about people.  After one test in Medical School at CWRU, WARNER didn't want to hang out, or discuss, or work together - he decided to go back to his 'good luck charm' college girlfriend and her parent's money.  But disfiguring a classmate, doing an unnecessary procedure?  That's get-back from hell.  Dr. Sarr will do a procedure that the woman classmate NEVER heard of, a procedure that was outlawed after 1980 and then brought back because the residents needed publications = common mass closure = Warner's revenge.  But for even Andy that's a low point.The Mayo Clinic should not be doing/scheduling, or contemplating procedures that the patient has not consented to.  If an attending agrees to do the procedure himself or herself, that verbal agreement should be honored.  Having a black student - possibly a Mayo visitor - with no suture experience or suture clinic requirements under his belt - go at a woman MD to disfigure - is not equal-opportunity, it's a tragedy.  It's just equal stupidity.  The black students should not be in on procedures where the woman patient requested 'no students' - just because they are black does not mean that they should be allowed to be in on procedures where they will cause complications & don't know the case.  Same rules as for white non-minority students should apply.  White medical students/residents need to know the case before their name is on the OR schedule.  And the slasher 3-month resident should not be working on re-do procedures where she never saw the patient before.  But if Andy Oldenburg MD has any ethics left, he should at least arrange that the procedure be undone where he can watch who goes in the room.  So far Jill Smith has no plan to schedule that this procedure be UNDONE.  But it's at least the classmate thing to do - to try to 'fix' things.  Warner Oldenburg didn't want a child with a woman MD, but to wish her brutally disfigured for fun is another degree of savagery.The Mayo Clinic should undo every procedure not-consented to in a woman MD patient, or any patient.  Neurectomies should be discussed, and as the nerve is ABOVE the transversus muscle - there is no reason to cut that muscle to do a 'common mass closure.'  STUDENTS: ask why Dr. Sarr does this?  Common mass closures were outlawed in the early 1980s because of the disfigurements, the horrible dehiscence, and the pain of sewing 2-3 muscles together that contracted in different directions and were of different length-tension strengths = PHYSIOLOGY 101.  Didn't Sarr every see this, or was he too busy playing the surgeon at the cocktail parties?  With common mass closures, the abdominal fascias are permanently WEAKENED (so that the abdominal muscles will give and extremity fractures occur).  Abdominal fascias are unfixably damaged by careless incisions - and Dr. Michael Rosen has a machine to measure this in Cleveland.  So you don't do these incisions for a 5-minute procedure where the consent was 'no muscles were to be touched,' for a normal nerve that is just inflamed and has some scar tissue on it - you remove the scar tissue and close the fascia in LAYERS.  You don't throw the nerve away like trash.  Dr. Sarr can't understand ENGLISH, can't keep his hands off a woman patient that he has drugged, and can't control his urges to cut and cut and more cut someone to bits and pathological pieces.  However, that doesn't explain Andy Oldenburg's going along for the career move.  What if it were one of his adult children?  Would they lose their abdominal muscles for a publication or a several hundred dollar fee for Dr. Sarr - who didn't do the closure - just supervised with coffee while chatting gossip with the nursing staff.  Getting his hands gloved is a problem for Dr. Sarr.The disfigurement of 'common mass fascial closures' will require plastic surgeries for the rest of this woman's life.  No one mentions that in any of the publications.  COMMON MASS CLOSURE DISFIGURES - it's a crap closure for a surgeon with no judgment, no ability, and no sense.  That the original work on this closure was also not done with women, or children, patients is also always omitted in the discussion - because the women and parents would complain of the painful disfigurements in the name of saving ONE suture pack and using 'help' with <6 months of experience.  No resident, or student with less than 6-months in the OR should be assisting on a procedure with a MD patient.  And certainly no resident or student should be in the room that didn't KNOW the case at MAYO CLINIC.  Residents, students, and anesthesia personnel, who never saw that woman patient before, should be banned from the room - surgery is not for ogling of breasts nor for free vaginal exams for twitter publication.  Then the woman resident had her mother calling the woman MD that she disfigured?  Where did she get the phone number is the question?

										Since 1990 there has been a new surgical closure in the literature - actually an old one that was thrown out in the 1980s = common mass fascial closure.  Common mass fascial deformity, or common mass mess in the OR jokes.  This is a supposedly 'new kid' on the block of surgical closures, to replace the traditional time-honored 'layered closure' - a closure that takes more time, thought, and surgical skill - which the Mayo Clinic has a surplus of (MDs with nothing other to do than perfect an obtuse skill).  So the Mayo Clinic is trying to replace a surgical skill closure with a surgical assistant 'quickie' closure, and the result is a mess of excrescent tissue sewn with careless botching of any surgical principles of wound closure.  Something that would flunk a high school student in home economics, is now a surgical staple in the book of wound closure at the Mayo Clinic.  With these with abdominal procedure closures, ALL the muscle fascial lawyers are cut and sewn together = MASS CLOSURE.  The current (last 20 years) surgical literature is full of the praises of this closure - for publications only - not by the patients.  But in reality it is a painful, disfiguring closure that no one follows - where the dehiscence can be catastrophic as all three layers of abdominal muscle will rupture.It's like an ENGINE DISABLED PHENOMENON in a 2005 Chevy Cobalt - suddenly your abdominal muscles are FROZEN.  And this will send the patient into reparative surgeries for the rest of their earthly lives.  BUT the disfigurement is particularly bothersome to women patients - and the residents will botch this one suture pack quickie closure so that hours of plastic surgery will be required once you get off the plane just to correct that part.  And Dr. Sarr will say that he did the closure - in his dreams maybe.It is a disfiguring closure - and the surgeons say NOTHING about that in all the literature = convenient omission.  DISFIGURING and Dr. Michael Sarr wouldn't do it on his wife, or daughter, but he does it to Dr. WARNER 'Andy' Oldenburg's former Medical School classmates - to get back or just hurt a woman MD where she can be hurt - disfiguring her for kicks and student amusements.  It's a public disfigurement, a public chastisement of everything that a woman MD has worked for - the aesthetics & sensitivity of surgery - the art of surgery being more than a Picasso abstraction.  And Picasso, at an earlier date, did kn how to draw in the classical NY Art Student League sense.Mayo Clinic, under Dr. Sarr's GPS direction guidance, has been a full-service facility for the doing of this MASS procedure on women patients who say 'No.'  Just say 'No' and it will be done to you.Women patients say 'No' because all three abdominal muscles are weakened in this closure (no more 6-packs), because it leads to an obvious deformity to sew the abdominal layers into ONE big muscle, and because the painful muscles spasms only get worse over time - causing falls & fractures.  That this closure works is not proven - no pathology is ever demonstrated or shown with the ruptures.  No one has 'undone' several closures to get the pathology on what happens to 3 muscle fascias sewn together - where the 3 muscles contract in different directions and have different strengths.  The external oblique direction tends to win - causing unique muscle movements.  This is a horrible monstrosity of a closure - a Mary Shelley Frankenstein closure for women.  The closure weakens over time - so it's a ticking time bomb of a closure - that will eventually require it to be undone as happened in the 1980s with this closure.  But to do it on 'Warner' Oldenburg's classmates?  And why doesn't he object to the mutilations?Women MDs have requested that this procedure not be done to them.  And it's 'done' for no OTHER reason than Dr. Sarr wants his staff to have experience doing them.  Women MDs have requested that the closure be UNDONE if it was done without consent (Jill Beed-Smith says that the Mayo Clinic has no plan to do this), and that the doing of these closures to nonconsenting patients be STOPPED - especially when the patients say NO to touch the muscles without a complete workup = closure and re-operation after trials of non-surgical ways to treat abdominal nerve inflammations.  Closing a surgical incision and thinking is supposed to be on the new OR checklists.Dr. Sarr ties these closures to 'neurectomies' of normal nerves - he has to have an excuse and so removes normal nerves cutting the transversus muscles completely for the kicks of doing so = some resident, student or visitor needs to get experience cutting abdominal muscle fascia.  The nerve he removes is above the transversus abdominis muscles - but no one at Mayo Clinic cares though Rosen in Cleveland lectures on this.
So far the undoing of these closures - even in Warner Andrew Oldenburg's women MD classmates - hasn't happened.  And that speaks volumes about him as well as Dr. Michael Sarr's thoughts about women MDs and patients.  And residents, students & visitors come into the procedure at Mayo Clinic and participate - when they wouldn't want this closure done to them without a GOOD reason, they have never seen or spoken ONE WORD to the patient, and they don't know the case.  It's completely ROBOT.The Mayo Clinic Rochester commonly brings people into the OR suites that do not belong there - people that have been requested by the patient to NOT BE THERE or to NOT touch anything surgical.  Mayo residents are aggressive, brutal, insensitive, and out for the HONORS without caring who they disfigure, maim, or mutilate.  The clerkship Honors should be about getting the diagnosis of an inflamed normal nerve in an old incision - a diagnosis that needs only a nerve block.  But they all have a mental block as to anything that won't get Honors - and you get Honors for cutting at most Medical Schools.So far Dr. Sarr will not undo those procedures that he forced on patients - under anesthesia that he ordered so that they would not object and be able get off the table.  Paralyze the victim is the mantra.  Sarr does a Mayo kind of 'date-rape' on these women patients - even MDs - just to get these procedures.  Women MDs under anesthesia are a good joke.  Women MDs have requested that he take out of his publications any patient that he forced this on, as when you object, the follow-up is dropped (the patient requested the procedure undone).  So far it's all just a joke on women's bodies - see how much disfigurement and pain women can take - test the stress factor.  Keep the OR 'ovens of Auschwitz' at Mayo going night & day.    Dr. Michael Sarr, and Mayo Clinic Rochester, need to make arrangements to undo this closure on any patient that they have forced it on.  ASAP before they rupture.  Their Chief Legal WOMAN Counsel, Jill Beed-Smith, needs to understand that this could be done to HER - and stop the pretenses of defending this nonconsenting surgery.  Surgery by definition has to be consented to - not for the surgical literature or the CV publication list.  The closure was thrown out in the 1980s because of the painful disfigurements, because the ruptures occur AFTER 5 years with the weakened closure from the muscles pulling in different directions.  The pathology needs to be checked on the women patients where this closure is removed and replaced with the layered closures - at MAYO CLINIC EXPENSE.  OLDENBURG can do this - even a VASCULAR SURGEON can do this.  This fraud needs to be stopped.  Women MDs have requested that this be undone to them, with the pathology studied - DR. SARR has the patients to UNDO the closure and study the situation - as does University Hospitals & Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland.Patients seeking consultations at Mayo Clinic need to have iron-clad surgical consent forms from lawyers - forbidding unnecessary personnel in the OR, unconsented closures, and that anything done without consent be undone at Mayo Clinic expense - starting with the COMMON MASS CLOSURE FARCE.  Publications about this need to mention the DISFIGUREMENT - that the Cleveland Clinic notes when they see these patients.Dr. Jeffrey Ponsky, of University Hospitals Case Medical Center, needs to take a position on this closure.  Patients have requested that he, and his staff - Dr. Rosen, Dr. Stellato, and others - UNDO and document the pathology at the suture line - where after time, things will rupture catastrophically - as they did in the 1980s.  Dr. Grundfest at Cleveland Clinic has patients who have requested the undoing of common mass closure; she knows how to do this, but won't, because Dr. Sarr is a Jewish buddy.  And Jewish buddies are thicker than ethics. ",Doctors

Newport Beach, California United States of America ",,949-646-2998,"WILLIAM R. DOBKIN, MD HOAG HOSPITAL THE BUTCHER OF NEWPORT BEACH Newport Beach, California","
										This is the story about my roommate, MIKA OGURO and Dr. William R. Dobkin, of Hoag Hospital, Newport
Beach, CA; known to our circle of friends as THE BUTCHER OF NEWPORT BEACH.  
MIKA OGURO was my roommate for 9 years. She was a hip, trendy, bright, bubbly and extremely athletic girl. She left the house every morning at 6 AM to play tennis before work. After work she went to the gym, then took off to night school where she studied to be an an accountant. She was also a social butterfly who had more friends than I could count. The only time I ever saw her was Sundays! 
And then, one fateful day in late 2009, she went to a clinic to see about the slight pain in her neck. It turned out to be a tumor ... THE SIZE OF AN ALMOND ... no big deal, nothing to worry about. 
She was sent to Hoag Hospital where she met with neurosurgeon Dr. William R. Dobkin. He gave her a 10-minute consultation (that's how low-priority the situation was) and they scheduled the surgery. What happened next is an outrage!!!
During surgery, Dr. Dobkin cut out two of Mika's discs from her neck AND THREW THEM IN THE TRASH!!
Then, he attached a LARGE METAL CROSS BAR TO HER NECK THAT HE SCREWED ON WITH NUTS & BOLTS. And no one could figure out why!!!  The medical report before the surgery clearly stated the small tumor HAD NOT attached itself to her spinal discs!!
After that, Mika was in CONSTANT PAIN. She could not breath properly, could not stand or sit, could not swallow properly, could no longer work or fix herself meals. Showering was a nightmare and I often heard her chocking in her room. But the surgery was supposed to be ""minimal evasive.""
Mika went to other doctors to get help. They evaluated Mika's post-surgery X-rays and concluded that the metal objects in her neck were large enough for A GORILLA!! (Mika is only 5'3"") Another surgeon said her neck was so butchered, the X-rays looked like a car crash victim. All the doctors agreed that Dobkin could have easily removed the small, almond-size tumor by using a simple laser apparatus. There was no reason for him to cut out two of her discs and throw them in the trash.
We wrote letters to Dobkin and Hoag hospital administrators. Hysterically - they never replied. They didn't even ask Mika to come in for another examination, which is normal protocol after surgery. 
Then she went to a pain-relief doctor in O.C. to be evaluated for permanent disability. Dr. Steven Dennis of 19582 Beach Blvd., Suite 306, Huntington Beach, CA 92648. Although Dr. Dennis saw the post-surgery X-rays, clearly saw the 'gorilla parts' and the 'butchered tissue' - he wrote in his report to the State Disability case worker, 'There is nothing wrong with this patient.'  Hence, Mika was denied disability and had to go back home to Japan, where her mother takes care of her now full-time. Dr. Dobkin ruined her chances of ever working again, and Dennis  ruined her chance of living a normal life. 
Something obviously went terribly wrong during the surgery and Dr. Dobkin, Dr. Dennis and Hoag Hospital are obviously engaged in a cover up. How do we know? They never replied to our letters for help nor returned our calls. They also LIED in their reports to the State. Who does that???
Dr. William R. Dobkin should have his license revoked and be brought up on charges. Do not go to him. He will cut your bones out of your spine, throw them in the trash, attach gorilla parts to your neck and hobble you for life. 
Hey Dr. Dobkin - You're not in prison today because Mika was forced to leave the country!! You got real lucky!									",Doctors

										I became a ""patient"" of Dr. George W. Rozakis in September 2010 ... seeking help for several and severe symptoms related to menopause. After reviewing my blood tests and in a face to face meeting; the doctor told me I was a classic case and he could make me well in 90 days with30 various supplements and bioidentical hormones. He also said that I should be experiencing significant progress in 30 days and at that time, would need to take additional blood tests so my program could be adjusted.The initial cost to be a ""member"" of the Dzugan Meathod was $2100 along with $350 for supplements and $100 for hormones and $450 for blood tests. None of these costs were covered by insurance.By Janury of 2011 I was not getting better. I was getting worse and experiencing several side effects. I had a face to face meeting with the doctor and at that time he made some changes to my program. He was very put off that I had expressed concern and doubt about his abilities to help me; as he seemed confused and did not know what to do and all the promises he made to make me better were not happening. The last thing he said to me was to eat less and excercise more.  I was furious. I did not spend thousands of dollars with ""experts"" to get ""advice"" that is free anywhere to anyone. In May of 2011, I sent a letter to Dr. George W. Rozakis severing all association and asking for my $2100 member fee be returned to me in 30 days. I recieved no response. At the same time, I stopped taking all supplements and hormones perscribed by the doctor. In 3 weeks I was feeling like a new and healthy person.In January of 2012, my attorney wrote a letter to the doctor asking he return my money. After several phone conversations between my attorney and the doctor; he agreed to do so. As of this date my money has not been returned. And expect it never will.I drove past the docto'rs office last week and the Dzugan Method sign is gone. In its place on the door, reads --- ""Your Natural Perscription"" ... Dr. Georgre W.

										Anita Steinbergh DO has been on the State Medical Board for almost 20 years.  Her 'best' case is taking the medical license of a women MD for objecting to the wrong care of herself and reporting the problems in care - that her fractures were left uncasted, unreduced, without padding, without x-rays, until the fractures collapsed.  And no blood work was allowed - because the Medical Board Members don't know about blood work.  This woman MD lost her license for this, objecting to the wrong care of herself, and only reported things after months of lies, bad care, and lost blood work.  University Hospitals physicians goofed, Dr. Nice goofed, and Dr. Suppes & Dr. Robert Botti tried to cover it up by alleging that the woman MD had 'dementia' - when she tests a MENSA IQ.Anita Steinbergh DO basically hates women MDs - we are not allowed care or a life, or to argue with her.  She can't hold her own in a conversation with a women MD - she has to be right.  When you meet with her she tells you what books to read (ICEBOUND), how to think, what you should have (a nice bipolar personality for the Medical Board stats - when you have no criteria), that you should feel 'sorry' for Mrs. Nice (who finally separated from Dr. Nice), that she is not responsible for you being threatened by male MDs who goofed, and that you should lie for her to get your MD back and get back to work.  Licenses are taken for decades while she changes the 'confidential' complaint.  When she can't do anything - because you won't lie for her - she gets on her cell phone and walks away.  And what lies will cover this up?  And she teaches DO medical students this.  Dr. Steinbergh has no differential diagnosis about a women's medical problem.  No blood work is allowed women MDs who complain about the boys being boys at the Medical Board.  None.  She doesn't know about thyroid function tests, that thyroid disease can cause bone problems, or what thyroid tests to order before your get your medical license taken.  Women MDs get their licenses taken and they don't need blood work.  You can't discuss that you didn't get lab work with her - it doesn't exist.  The differential diagnosis of multiple fractures without stress is long: thyroid disease, multiple myeloma, malignancy, parathyroid disease, etc.  Fractures are not a psychiatric disorder - except at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  And yet NONE of this was done, or allowed, for a woman physician whose license she has voted against for almost 20 years - she had to have a personality problem because she would not refer to Dr. Nice or go along with his bogus care.  And the medical students she works with should ask why a white woman physician, with more training than Dr. Steinbergh, should not be allowed blood work and fracture care by a tertiary center orthopedic who knows about bone disease - not a hack who does hips and knees when he can get them at Hillcrest Hospital in suburban Cleveland.  And Dr. Nice is a hack who was asked to only temporarily cast and refer - because he doesn't do wrist fractures enough.  Dr. Nice was kicked out of Geauga Hospital before 1990, for abuses of trying to care for orthopedic problems that he had no experience with - like wrist fractures.Dr. Steinbergh has mandated 6 psychiatric evaluations, or goes, on this woman.  Won't listen to Andrew Skodol MD - who did every test on her in 1995-6; Dr. Skodol only co-writes the DSM.  Dr. Steinbergh would not allow Dr. Skodol to do thyroid function tests and a medical workup; he had to give the Medical Board a report sans anything medical - so that the case could be fixed.  When Dr. Steinbergh wants, everything is 'psychiatric,' and your grade with be that way if you don't go along.  But you will not learn anything.  Yes her only crime was trying to go to the orthopedic offices to discuss that something 'else' was wrong as symptoms, and fractures, kept occurring.Dr. Steinbergh needs to grow up and learn a differential diagnosis, allow women MDs a practice and a life, and stop mandating Dr. Nice care for women MDs - who don't want to be 'easy' for his personal needs.  Dr. Nice still has a license, still inflicts his personals on colleagues, and still does very bad orthopedic care.  Yes, this woman MD was naive - but that was all she was guilty of.  And she asked Nice & Keith, & Botti to refer her to the Hand Surgeons at Cleveland Clinic or University.  Because getting through the gauntlet of the hospital ERs is very difficult - and she knew what she fractured.  This woman MD has a phone number, but this is not psychiatric.  She does not need a seventh psychiatric evaluation with DR. RESNICK - who does criminal forensic psychiatry, not women's health - she needs treatment of her bone & thyroid problem - by someone who knows how to do it and is not threatened by the State Medical Board of Ohio.

										For several years I was a loyal patient of Dr. Brent Laartz. I did everything and anything that this doctor told me to do even when he was doing little to nothing for me other than to prescribe large amounts of Morphine. Then one day, I recieved a letter from Dr. Larrtz's office telling me that I was being dismissed from their practice for ""Non-compliance"". Needless to say, I was floored by this.
I contacted Dr. Laartz's office to find out why they were saying that I was being non-compliant. I was told that because I had requested that they send in the next month's prescriptions to the pharmacy a week earlier that they were due, I was being non-compliant. I explained to them that the month before, I had gone almost a weekend without my pain meds because the pharmacy that I was with (AHF) had recieved the prescriptions late from the doctor's office.
I explained to them that I was under no circumstances trying to get my meds early but rather that they send the scripts early to the pharmacy. They would not hear of it and told me that I needed to find another doctor. I then contacted the pharmacy and requested that the head pharmacist send Dr. Laartz a letter explaining the situation. She did but still they would not take me back.
I went for a long while before I was able to find a local doctor to take me back but I am infuriated at the fact that this docotr, Dr. Laartz, who never really did anything for me, other than to spew numbers and surveys and percentages, was accusing ME of being non-compliant. 
The worst part of it is that because of what he said, I could not have the doctor that I REALLY wanted to take me as a patient because they belong to the same practice and once one of the doctors dismisses a patient, none of the other doctors will take the dismissed patient as their own.
Dr. Laartz's saying that I was Non-compliant truined it for me from getting actual quality care. I am HIV+ and good quality care is essential to my well being and my life. There are so few GOOD HIV doctors in the Tampa Bay area and the one doctor that I believe IS ACTUALLY a good and reputable doctor, now will not take me because of what Dr. Laartz said about me.
Dr. Laartz is one of these yuppy Dr.s who was born with the golden spoon in his mouth and went to Ivy Leauge schools. He is one of those doctors that got to where he is, not becuase of his expertise or knowledge but rather becuase of the money he comes from and the people he knows. When asked any serious questions, he will dance around the answers by spewing percentages, and numbers, and surveys and so on, and so on.

YouTube Video .. Dr Jay Calvert Breast Reconstruction Large Areolae - Follow Up.At Roxbury Clinic and Surgery Center, they work to treat each patient equally and we aim to please all of our patients. Safety is their number one concern in taking care of patients and secondly is that they obtain satisfactory results. It is their goal that each patient has a great experience from the time they make an appointment until the time they are done healing from their procedures. Communication between staff is very important to ensure the quality of patient care.Each patient comes into the office for a consultation to discuss their concerns. The area of concerned is examined and a treatment plan is formulated if possible and medically advisable. The patient then will meet with the patient coordinator to schedule the surgery and will be given a price quote. The patient is welcome to come back to meet with the doctor during my office hours if they still may have questions that are unanswered or any other concerns.The treatment plan is advised at the time of the first consultation. If a treatment plan is not made at the first visit because of need for further information then the patient is asked to come back for a second consultation once all information has been obtained or the patient is referred out to another surgeon. Each patient is assessed and consulted prior to obtaining any treatments or services to ensure they are fully aware of their course of treatment. At the time prior to the procedure (usually the pre-op appointment), the patient will fill out informed consents and is advised to ask any questions that they may have regarding the procedure. All risks and complications are discussed with the patient at this visit as well.In a scenario that the doctor would not advise a procedure be done on a patient, Dr. Calvert stats that he would discuss with them their goals for the procedures, look at alternatives, and try to help direct them to either a better solution for their concerns. If they are still unable to come to a resolution, the doctor would refer them to someone for more information if he did not feel comfortable doing it for them. Dr. Calvert would communicate that in his hands that it probably wont give them what they want and he would refer them to someone for another opinion who may be able to address their concerns.After treatment, the office makes sure to place frequent follow up calls (video calls if the patient is from out of town), frequent postop visits to the office, and having competent staff that can handle any issues that may arise with patients.  They also send each patient a post-operative questionnaire that specifically addresses their care and service. The patient has multiple opportunities to voice concerns as the office is heavily staffed with nurses and/or PAs. It is not uncommon for patients to feel more comfortable addressing their concerns with the PA or nurse and therefore it is their goal to make sure that the patients concerns are addressed and proper action is taken.Since the office has been a part of Ripoff Report, they make sure all patients are well informed and educated which begins at the very first phone call or email that they may receive from a potential new patient. They also have clarified our consent forms and policy and procedure materials that are given to every patient. Patient complaints are taken very seriously and are dealt with immediately. No matter what the complaint may be the office will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible or come up with a solution that is agreeable between all parties.Furthermore, the office has discovered that better patient selection is key in prevention of complaints. There are many patients that have had multiple procedures from other surgeons, that makes Dr. Calvert am very careful to assess whether or not further surgery is advisable for that patient. They also have heavier screening for body dysmorphic disorder and major depression that has allowed them to save patients the frustration of having further surgery and not being satisfied with the results.As stated above  something that needs to be repeated to those seeking any kind of plastic Surgery .. The company states that they are committed to doing whatever it takes to make the patient happy because they have always worked tirelessly to revise surgery when necessary.

Beverly Hills, CaliforniaDr. Jay Calvert ruined my nose. Hes an awful surgeon and very corrupt. He should lose his license.  He caused major damage to my septum and columnella during a primary cosmetic rhinoplasty and then he tried to sell me on another surgery to fix it and surprise, surprise, he wanted to bill me a bunch more money plus he wanted to bill my insurance again, after though my surgery was all cosmetic and even though he'd already billed them for a ridiculous amount on top of the money I already paid him.  I wouldn't ever trust him to do surgery again, not even on a guinea pig.  He uses his Roxbury surgery center for illicit insurance billing.  He's very sneaky, underhanded and slimy.  When I told him Id report him to the medical board, he said hed sue me if I did.  Classy.  His staff are poorly trained and not very bright.

										On April of 2012, we received a letter from Wakefield and Associates saying that we had a account on collections,  after calling several times I was never able to contact anyone of the reps that had my husbands account.  I finally gave in and left a message with the operator, the operator  I guess never passed on the message.
I got a phone call from Crystal a month after I had left a message who said that now we owed $200.00 more because of interest.  I told her I had left a message and no one ever called me back, I told her I did not think it was fair that we had to pay the interest since no one in her company had ever returned my call , she kept on giggling every time I talked.  She than gave the phone to her supervisor Art who started screaming at me and telling me that if was not going to pay the debt in full he would not let me speak.  I had no defense what so ever he hung up on me.
I called the following morning I asked the operator to please transfer me to someone who was going to be able to listed and not hang up on me.  She transferred me to gentle man with a very deep voice, he instructed me to send a payment by mail so that they would see that I was interested in paying the debt.  I sent a bill pay check in.  A week later Crystal called my husband and my husband told her off.  She than called me and said your husband is really rude and she giggled ( I think Crystal is high).  She informed me that the gentleman that I had spoked to gave me the wrong information and that he did not note the account.  30 minutes later she found the notes in the account ( again she is High!!) she giggled again.  I went ahead and set up the payments how she asked and we set those up for June and July and she told me to call back in August to see if I could payoff the account, she never said "" Hey lady if you do not set up payments to payoff the account you will be charged an 8% interest rate, because you are not showing that you want to payoff the total"".  Today I called because my payment that I had set up for Friday did not get taken off the account,  Crystal tells me that she only set up the account for June payments.  I asked her what the total balance due was and she gave it to me.  I asked her how many she showed I made and she said two, my 1st payment that I sent in was missing.  She was High again this Morning because she kept on giggling WTF. 
 She told me that I never sent in a payment that I was very confused, after she had a few giggles and after 5 confused comments  she found the 1st payment (20minutes later).  She said the money was never accounted for and she was going to have her manager review the account she told me I should owe less $100.00 less .  5 hours later she called me and said that I do not owe less that I owe the same amount even after my first payment was never posted to the account.  I went ahead and set up more payments with my ""high"" friend Crystal and I asked her if her manager could please review the audio tape because I did not think it was fair that she never informed me that the account would keep on incurring interest fee's if it was not set up to pay off the account.  She said I was difficult and she transferred me to her supervisor.  
Why is this company getting away with treating people like SHIT,  I feel like taking them to court just so we can go public and the judge can hear how ART and Crystal have treated me.  Thank you Vail Summit Orthopedics in Frisco Colorado  for hiring such a bullshit company to do your collections now its because of companies like Wakefield and High Associates that hard working people never make it out of debt.  ""I am hard to deal with because I am asking for my account to be reviewed and for someone to do something about the way I've been treated by Wakefield.  I hope no one ever has to deal with the company.
Thank you!

										I took my mom in to geT some work done on her teeth to a prothodontist, which I had seen prior. Since I had been referred to Dr. Sneezewell, my first prothodontist, he had had some health problems so, had cut his hours, and taken another Dentist in his office. Hethen, forwarded some patients.Unfortunately, I was given to Dr. U Nassar,whom, after I had work done, and mom needed work, I took her to him. Since my work, Dr. Nassar had to move out of Dr. Sneezewells office because he was selling it. Dr. Nassar, Was teaching the odd day at the University. Since he now had no office, he was just using a temporary office at the University, to take patients, with no hired assistant. My mom and I went for her initial accessment. When we went back, so she could get the prep work, for her bridge done, he still did not have an assistant hired. My moms dentistry bill was going to be substantial so, my sister(Ellen) took $1500 cash from her credit card to give towaards the work on moms teeth. Since there was no assistant, I asked Dr. Nassar, ""who  should I give the envvelope of money to?"" He said, ""just give it to me, I will remember you gave it to me. I won't forget. I give you my word."" Well mom, had a brain anuerism, and was in the hospital, for the better part of two years. I did keep in touch with dr. Nassar, throughout the ordeal, and he had, had some health problems with his wife around that time as well. Over time, we decided to get the work done through her regular dentist, and I spoke with Dr. Nassar Several times, and relayed this to him. Everytime I explained, I would get the same answer, ""Just bring her in'. Wherther I sent an email, a tex,t or called him.Finally after waiting, way too long, and getting no refund, In April of 2012, I called and asked him if he was ever going to give me my deposit back. He laughed at me and said,"" You are askng me now after 4 years? For your $1600"" I said, it is $1500, and when I talked to you only a year ago, when she was having the work finished, You remembered,Quite clearly when you thought you might still be doing the work."" He said""Fax me the paper work I'm leaving on my holidays today for Mexico, so don't expect an answer for at least 2 weeks."" He wants paper work,which he knows I havw none, at least not for the money in the envelope, because he gave me his word, ""I DID'T NEED ANY"".  I waited about 2 weeks,before sending, the estimqte, and reduced price list. it, so when, he returned, it would be on the top of the faxes. Then I waited. Another month and still received nothing.I faxed him again and still nothing.Then I texted him, I said, it is a good thing, I saved all the emails and recoreded our conversations, otherwise, it would be my word aginst yours. You acted like it was up to me to chase after you, to get back MY MONEY. I sent severl emails , texts and calls and always gave the same answer, bring her in.Everytime I emailed you, I told you she didn't want to come in, she was going to antother dentist, so please send us our refund, but you never did. So you are the one that should be ashamed. I threatened him with going to the Trouble Shooter, which I am in the process of doing . People, BEWARE, of that name, Ussama Nassar,  Dr. Nassar, tell everybody and anybody who will listen, do not use this thiefs service, ever!!! Not only is he a cheat, but a lier, and a horrible prothodotist!!  Taking his word at that timee because, he lift me with little other option. Now he wants paper work, which he knows quite well, I don't have because he gave me his word I didn't need any.People beware, because not only is this guy a bald faced lier, but if he has to keep $1500, of peoples money for work that he didn't even do. Then he is obviously, not a very good prothontist! Not only does he charge way beyond what is reasonable, but gave me a paper, with prices he said, he could reduce by thousands of dollars. Again, does a good dentist, lower his prices. Not unless, HE ISN'T A GOOD DENTIST, OR A GOOD PERSON. ONE THING HE IS, IS A GOOD LIEING THIEF!!!!!! 									",Doctors

										Dr. Houston and Doctors 365 are nothing more than a so called ""Clinic"" that commits FRAUD, at least in my opinion.  His office manager Jennifer and all the rest of his so called staff including the Physician Assistants do nothing but LIE to Patients simply to get their MONEY.  
If you complain to the staff or the so called Doctor of this activity,  they simply TELL YOU Dr. HOUSTON will NO longer allow you to be his patient.  
I went to visit Doctors 365 on Friday and after sitting for well over 2 hours, I was notified by the P.A. (Physicians Assistant) that is the actually running the clinic that he was unable to sign my prescription.  
He notified me that DR HOUSTON would have to sign my prescription.  So imagine a P.A. in charge of an emergency clinic and unable to prescribe certain medications even though he treated patients for a specific medical condition.  
Steve, the P.A. stated he would have Dr. Houston sign my scrip the following morning and it would be ready for pickup. However Jennifer, the so called office manager stated that Steve would be violating the law by not having Dr. Houston actually see me due to the nature of the medication.
So she set an appointment on Tuesday, keep in mind still no medication.  I received a call from Ms. Jennifer around 4:54 on Monday and stated that Dr. Houston does not ""feel comfortable"" seeing me and that my appointment was canceled.  
STAY TUNED FOR REPORT #2 with Jennifers message she left and a COPY of the complaint filed with the Florida Medical Board.  
Its going to get interesting..... One just has to wonder ...... Does Dr. Houston's P.A. fill out all prescriptions and then simply comes by and signs them even though he legally has to see the patient?
...... Since I was under the care of Dr. Houston's P.A. and suddenly told days later to go some where else.. is that patient neglect?  Lots more questions BUT TRUST ME I WILL HAVE ANSWERS!!!!!!!!!",Doctors
Governor John Kasich Ohio,"  Governor John Kasich Ohio  77 South High Street, 30th Floor Riffe Center 
Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614)644-5088,"Governor John Kasich Ohio  by continuing the controversial 'confidential' physician complaint system, inflicts costs of false investigations on taxpayers & the falsely accused physicians, 48 other states allow disclosure of any Columbus, Ohio","
										Ohio is one of only two states to continue 'confidential' physician complaints, and the only state to accept anonymous physician complaints.  All other states do not do this because, without disclosure of the issues, complaints, and the complainers - to validate the complaint & credentials of the signers - the professional insurances can not bear any of the costs of the Medical Board's actions - even to repay the Medical Board costs for a legitimate complaint.  Professional medical insurances exist for this and other reasons - to pay the cost of an impaired physician.  It's not the job of the Ohio taxpayers to do this.
Governor Kasich is paying a carte blanche bill for the State Medical Board at this time - while complainers of false complaints are not liable in any way - so the Executive Director of the State Medical Board has to worry about the statute of limitations for the terrible negligences of physicians that the Board has decided to allow - Dr. Nice, Dr. Keith, Dr. Suppes, fracture care at Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, etc.  
Once the Ohio Court of Appeals throws out a Medical Board case, then the Medical Board is entirely liable for all the investigations, evaluations, rehab, and the legitimacy of continuing the case.  There's at least a handful of cases that the State Medical Board of Ohio has continued without the support of the Ohio Court of Appeals - all at great cost to the taxpayers of Ohio - who helped pay to educate the falsely accused physicians.
Carla O'Day MD - during 1990-3 - started a pile of false cases against colleagues - at least one of which the State Court of Appeals threw out telling the Medical Board to 'solve the case in another way.'  The Medical Board did not take that advice, because Carla O'Day MD hated the other woman physician, and the Medical Board under Rick Whitehouse, Esq. is still looking for a case - while Carla O'Day MD is nowhere to be found for the money involved.
There are a stack of false physician cases, that the Ohio Medical Board is now entirely liable for damages for, as the complaints were not disclosed to the professional insurances before any suspension or disciplinary action was taken - and the complaints were probably false.  There was no due process in these cases.  Once the Medical Board acts, no matter how unjustly, the professional insurances are gone and the Medical Board has to pay all the costs - no matter how they were misinformed.
Governor Kasich needs to do reforms at the State Medical Board to allow the professional insurances to know the cases and bear the costs if the complaints are justified.  If the complaints can be disproven by the professional insurances, then the Medical Board should have to pay damages for falsely injuring that physician's reputation with a frivolous unverified complaint and actions.  This is as it is in 48 other states, where the State Representative & Senators know about medical mistake laws and the problems with 'confidential' physician complaints - the black hole for money on the costs of these cases. 
All cases of Carla O'Day MD need to be reviewed externally - internal review has only been able to say that there were problems but not enough evidence (2005).  Governor Taft asked for this in 2005.  External review will allow other witnesses in these cases to come forward - and this should have been done 20 years ago as Carla O'Day MD got rid of her colleague competition this way - like the Past President of the Texas Medical Board.  
Governor Kasich is a bit impaired that he can't see what the Governors of 48 other states see as a no-brainer. 									",Doctors

Dr. Singh stated that Walmart had $4.00 prescriptions, and that he called them to verify it.  Well he may have verified the prescriptions were $4.00, but that is ONLY had he WRITTEN the Rx correctly!  He wrote the Rx for 500 MG of Penicillin instead of 250 MG.  The 250 MG is $4.00, the 500 MG was nearly $20.00.  The total prescriptions should have come to a total of $16,.00, but I had to pay over $52.00!!  Their screw up cost me not only money I didn't have, but it took us nearly 2 hours to get the Rx because Dr:. Singh wrote the OTHER  Rx incorrectly, causing a major delay,. The Pharmacist caught the error and had to spend
time to call this inept Doctor  to get it corrected'.  My nephew suffered needlessly due to Dr. Singh's gross negligence,.  I have tried for over three weeks to get this resolved and CareNow refuses to talk to me about it claiming HIPAA Laws, when I was the one who paid for the treatment.

										Carla O'Day MD is known for misusing partial medical information - that she has access to by virtue of ER attending work, on medical colleagues to get their medical license suspended for 'objecting too much' to admittedly wrong/bad care - care that Carla was partially responsible for.  If you have to disagree with Carla O'Day MD - you will lose your medical license and hospital privileges - she goofs for the hospital and then has to cover it up.  St. Vincent Charity Hospital has recently hired her to be the ER Director - without checking into the trouble she caused for other good physicians in the past 20 years.  The one case that Carla O'Day MD started at the Board in the 1990s, when she was there as an appointee, against a woman MD classmate from Medical School who didn't have any patient complaints, has ended up costing the Medical Board (the Ohio taxpayers) somewhere's over $500,000.  Carla O'Day MD started the case without first allowing the women MD classmate to get even blood work, Carla didn't know what blood work to order and wouldn't check a textbook or google, to see what the bone pains were caused by.  Women MDs don't 'deserve' blood work per Carla O'Day MD, so how are St. Vincent's ER patients going to get blood work?But this one case that Carla O'Day MD ran, has cost the State Medical Board about $500,000 so far, and still is unresolved as the woman MD didn't have what Carla O'Day MD wanted her to have - and she's not Carla O'Day's patient.  Governor Kasich's office can't even get an estimate from the Executive Director of the State Medical Board - Mr. Whitehouse - about how much ($) this one unresolved case for 20 years - too many lies from Carla O'Day MD and friends - has cost Ohio.  The cost can't be even estimated as the State Medical Board is still spending money trying to 'find a case' for Carla O'Day MD.  Carla O'Day personally put this case ahead of rooms full of boxes of complaints about physicians with multiple patient complaints - it was a personal case.  The State Medical Board still thinks that the case can be solved locally, in Cleveland, by finding the right Ohio psychiatrist to lie for Carla O'Day MD to get them out of trouble.Carla O'Day MD will charge any physician that calls her to try to tell her that she made a 'mistake' - in assessing the wrong diagnosis, or not doing the necessary blood work - with telecommunications harassment - in court.  She has nothing better to do.  Carla O'Day MD will then take any recorded messages left by the physician, and edit them for Rocky River Municipal Court - deleting all the dates.  Carla O'Day can file telecommunications harassment in Rocky River Municipal Court with taped evidence where the chain of evidence has been broken by her and much of the taped message deleted - they let her as her husband is a lawyer in the community.  Physicians should not leave her a phone message about anything like a care problem - it will show up in Rocky River Municipal Court.     Carla O'Day MD will not call the Mayo Clinic, or an out-of-state expert physician, on a patient - the patient is just 'exaggerating' if they don't like her care (calls were offered to be paid for so that Carla O'Day MD would be reimbursed every penny).  And you can't read Carla's writing - she has an illegible personality disorder.  Taxes is not the answer in Ohio, the answer is more responsible government and appointees better than Carla O'Day MD - even at St. Vincent Charity.  The poor deserve better.  So Carla O'Day MD doesn't think that women MDs, who might be her competitor, need blood work - they just need a new right Ohio psychiatrist.  The sheer storage volume of false accusations in the one case was unimaginable.  Carla O'Day MD accused the woman MD of trying to re-break her wrist fracture (and allowed her to be beaten up in one of the orthopedic offices), of being 'seductive' with her fractures (no one looks seductive with fractures), of not deserving care, of not needing blood work for a multiple fracture syndrome - which has an extensive workup in all the medical textbooks.  Carla O'Day MD had the Medical Board take the fractured woman's medical license so that she couldn't go on her Medical Fellowship in Bone Metabolism at St. Louis University - because Carla O'Day MD does not have the smarts or the intelligence/background to get those prestigious fellowships - so the woman MD had to be 'crazy' - and Carla O'Day MD's second husband puts up with this - the accusations of friends, the filings in court, and the lies.    In the 1990s, Carla O'Day MD watched while the woman MD tried to work at the hospital with an uncasted wrist fracture, and despite over 20 orthopedics and her well-equipped ER, would not help her - it was a joke.  So expect a laugh when you have a fracture and go to St. Vincent Hospital ER.  Since Medical School Carla O'Day spoke directly with this woman MD, that Carla claimed to know 'well,' only once on the phone - to get the woman MD to admit a patient from the Hillcrest ER that NO ONE else would take as she was dying and didn't have any procedures that anyone (the guys or boys) could do.  The boys wouldn't admit the patient despite having made a lot of money on her past care.  The woman MD did Carla a favor, and then was accused of being 'obsessed' if she wanted a cast on her wrist fracture.  This happened at Hillcrest Hospital in Ohio where a woman MD went to the ER, was put in a conference room for casting, was casted without an x-ray or reduction and without padding, while the orthopedic ate pizza in front of the physician-with-the-fracture.  The orthopedic Tim Nice MD was Carla O'Day MD's friend, and he could do what he wanted in the ER - including using the ER as his personal office (to avoid the costs and for lunch) and not referring the case - he was not a hand/upper extremity orthopedic.  Carla O'Day MD, who was on the Medical Board in Ohio from 1990-3, and still has 'friends' there, defended this awful care as the woman physician needing therapy to get over it and that the fractures were 'simple.' The fractures were not 'simple,' the underlying cause was a rare endocrine presentation (a bone condition that still needs treatment, but Carla O'Day's lies are blocking that treatment), and the woman did not need psychiatric therapy from one of Carla's women psych friends.  Carla O'Day tries to set her 'friends' up with unnecessary consults - Sister Judith Ann Karam you are in for an education as to how Carla O'Day MD practices medicine. But Carla O'Day MD lied boxes, and still is trying to prove that she was 'right' after the woman MD had to get to her license suspended, undergo five evaluations, and fracture 5 more bones.  Carla O'Day is still insisting that the woman MD needs a 'new right Ohio psychiatrist.'  And this is only one of Carla's goofs - she could not finish a residency at University Hospitals because of her patient behaviors - the patients and attendings were livid with the 'simple' and the 'psychiatric.'  But now she's again the Director of an ER to misuse patient information for her own appointments, hospital contracts and self-serving purposes.  Patients going to St. Vincent Charity ER should find an ER physician besides Carla O'Day and be aware that everything will be 'simple' and 'psychiatric' for her.  The Administration at St. Vincent Charity should have required that Carla O'Day MD straighten out all the past lies, misinformation, and false cases against colleagues at the State Medical Board of Ohio (the statute of limitations is over) - all the woman MD competitors for whom she has destroyed their chance of getting married, their careers, their Fellowships, their reputations, and their health.  It needs to be over Carla, and any hospital contract should require that she not misuse health information on an MD patient or their family, or threaten any telecommunications harassment when you try to get ahold of her to get her out of her lies and mistakes - to try to cover for her because if she has any liability she counter-accuses. ",Doctors

										Governor Kasich is running the worst Medical Board in the US - with the most false suspensions & disciplines for non-medical issues like a woman MD objecting to 'boys being boys' during professional time.  Boys have to be boys in Ohio.  If elected to national office, the MDs won't have a chance with Medical Boards that have 'confidential' complaints - where the facts are never checked, the signers don't have to ever have seen or know the MD (paid signers), and the content is hidden from the public so that other witnesses can't come forward to straighten things out in a timely way.  For women this is a disaster like the Titanic - with the boys complaining about your personality when you don't do the personals.  Carla O'Day MD started this kind of nonsense in 1990-3; taking out her competition from Medical School because she couldn't study and go through a residency like most other graduates.  Carla O'Day MD is now the Director of the ER at St. Vincent Charity and if the nun knew better she wouldn't appoint her to direct the Maintenance Department - but nuns are stupid.  When Carla O'Day disagrees about a diagnosis - she doesn't do the blood work - if you call her as a classmate MD, she drags you into Rocky River Municipal Court for telecommunications harassment.  Ask Carla O'Day how she treats the women in the class behind her from CWRU School of Medicine - she gets their licenses pulled so that they can't complain about her ER directing (Hillcrest) or her hating other women MDs.  Carla's present husband has to be the most out-of-it guy on the planet - she's a complete fake regarding any kind of scientific approach to medicine - everything is psychiatry requiring a new right Ohio psychiatrist.  So Sister Judith Ann Karam, unless you want to end in court - like other Catholic girls who weren't 'easy' enough for Carla O'Day - reassess.  But that Governor Kasich is continuing destroying the careers of good physicians with provisional cases - based on obvious misinformation, a complaint where some of the signers never knew or saw the MD, and a falsified Rorschach (the legislators just laugh), a complaint that the Ohio Court of Appeals had to throw out in 1993 - but the woman couldn't get to her 1992 St. Louis University Fellowships.  Medical Fellowship jobs are hard to come by, and should not be derailed by false cases and jealousies at the State Medical Board of Ohio - where cases and outcomes are a crap shoot.  The Medical Board in Ohio is composed of the worst physicians - who get rich on the contracts that they get for fixing cases - like Carla O'Day MD.  And everyone admits that Carla O'Day MD got her contracts this way - providing protection.Governor Kasich allows that Rick Whitehouse not be working at resolving the past false cases - that he spend his time updating his social media sites instead of answering his phone.  Tom Dilling, the past Executive Director of the State Medical Board of Ohio, left Mr. Whitehouse with a stack of unresolved false cases because there is no procedure to undo false cases except that the physician dies.  The physician can't even get the false complaint from the Board for other states to evaluate - Governor Kasich is totally inefficient, uneducated about running a Medical Board, completely out-of-touch with what is going on and having no options or plan to 'fix' things.  ",Doctors

										Governor Kasich thinks that it's ok to abuse women MDs - who don't get degrees for kicks or easily.  Male MDs are abusive with language, offers, and then care in Ohio - it's boys being boys.  Women's fractures are left uncasted to 'ripen' in Ohio - and the Board allows this or thinks that you should get therapy to handle it.  Dr. Resnick goes along with this VIOLENCE.
Dr. Phillip Resnick MD, internationally known forensic psychiatrist - known for his assessment of 'violence risk' will be apointed expert and the women MD forced to go speak with him - psychiatric rape that he can't fathom as he is the physician forcing himself on another and it's so he can 'cover' it up with the boys.  He can't recognize another psychiatrist's work - just his own.  The violence has already been done -  the woman's arm was broken once by neglect of a thyroid condition and twice because of the poor care of the original fracture - Dr. Lafferty at University Hospitals couldn't order a TSH and thyroid antibodies - the woman MD just had 'problems with men' - not thyroid - but he couldn't be bothered to check. 
The violence is in the care at University Hospitals where Dr. Thomas Stellato will do a procedure, cause nerves to be inflamed - then he can't diagnose the nerve inflammation and do conservative care - he schedules another surgery.  But his office manager can't sent out the papers about where to show up and when - she blames you that you 'stood up Dr. Stellato.'  If Dr. Stellato could diagnose abdominal wall nerve inflammation and conservatively treat, or repair abdominal fascia that another surgeon has butchered, he would be CHIEF - but he can't and neither can Dr. Rosen or Dr. Ponsky - because a Jewish surgeon did the butchering at Mayo Clinic - because he didn't understand abdominal wall pain - Dr. Michael Sarr's abuse. Jewish surgeons, and program Directors, are some of the most abusive MDs to women MDs.  Dr. Stellato has spent a lifetime doing bariatric surgery - which leave all kinds of neuropathies, peripheral and other, over a lifetime - micronutrient deficiencies which are never followed.  But it's the abuse of the men that's the problem - Dr. Resnick's colleagues.  
The violence is in his own guys at University Hospitals - Dr. Keith will beat a woman patient up when his experimental cast doesn't work.  The woman MDs arms - both- now have no strength.  The arm that was experimentally casted - unnecessarily - broke again after 6 months of reflex sympathetic dystrophy - an unheard of complication unless there is ABUSE.  Abuse which Dr. Resnick can't see in his colleagues; it's abusive - and violent - to take a woman physician's license for 19-20 years for objecting to admittedly wrong care - unheard of in any other state. It's not the woman MDs violence that is the problem here - but the men MDs - his friends - are never evaluated.  Dr. Nice casts when he feels like it, Dr. Kieth does experimental and then gets abusive verbally when it doesn't work, Dr. Suppes drinks excessively in front of women MDs, Dr. Carla O'Day objects to violence done to herself but then wants it done to others so that they go through what she has, Dr. Botti just likes to put one over on women - women smarter than his son MD.  
Dr. Botti does a program in Legal and Ethical Issues in Mental Health - but the violence is at University Hospitals of Cleveland - has been for years - screaming at women trainees, etc.  There's no lingering or deception, the bones will break if thee is no improvement in care, behaviors, and policies at the State Medical Board.  Tragic waste.  And if the Health Insurance is taken before a diagnosis is made to blame the woman MD - there's no way to pay Dr. Resnick fees.  Rorschachs were cheated on, a diagnosis that didn't exist was used - and Dr. Resnick goes along with the fraud.  
Internationally Ohio medical care and Dr. Resnick are nothing but fakes. 									",Doctors

										Governor Kasich knows that the State Medical Board of Ohio functions on the false cases of women MDs that object too strongly to the wrong care of themselves & the Ohio mistakes in simple medical/orthopedic problems.  With women MD license suspensions, they have become the new 'target' to keep male MDs from license suspension for multiple patient complaints - the women MDs don't have to have patient complaints and their 'cases' are put ahead of boxes of cases of physicians with multiple patient complaints - to get rid of competition for Carla O'Day MD and her friends.  In 2005, Governor Taft finally ordered an investigation on Carla O'Day MD - a Medical Board Member during 1990-1993 - and her 'techniques,' but not enough was found - it was inconclusive as everything was 'confidential.'  That is not the type of woman MD that should be the President and CEO of a major Cleveland hospital - she got there the WRONG way; her and her attorney husband living off the false cases that she provided the State Medical Board.  Her attorney husband also needs to answer for Carla's actions.  The false cases she put through have never been reviewed - but they are admittedly probably false (Tom Dilling).The same criteria do not apply for licensure disciplines: male MDs v women MDs.  Women MDs can be providers of better than average medical care, have no patient complaints, but they just objected too strongly when they could not get the 'right' care for themselves - they were supposed to 'take one' for the system.  Women MDs are supposed to allow unnecessary surgeries to be done to themselves, fractures to be left uncasted until they become 'excrescent' (a Medical Board word for 'ripen' to hugely swollen), and Catholic women MDs are not allowed families, children or ob-gyn care - they didn't 'do it' with Dr. Nice (married with two children, but friends on the State Medical Board supply his personal needs with the State of Ohio budget).  The Medical Board of Ohio ensures that certain 'friends' will be provided with patient referrals and personal needs.Ohio has no medical mistake laws, so Medical Board Members handle medical mistakes by taking the medical license of the physicians who object or report the problems.  Thyroid disorders are at an epidemic 'high' in Ohio, no epidemiologist cares, while the State Medical Board takes the licenses of women MDs with thyroid problems - women MDs who don't need blood work as the Ohio Medical Board Members don't know what a TSH is.Thyroid problems in Ohio are mistreated badly.  The Medical Board does not allow blood work before taking a woman MD's license for symptoms of thyroid problems that the woman MD is trying to get properly treated - the Medical Board Members can't see a swollen neck.  So the State Medical Board of Ohio has the woman MD taken off thyroid medication, and subjected to serial 'goes' to find a case - having a new right Ohio psychiatrist recommend some psych med that will then - in the setting of untreated subclinical/clinical hypothyroidism - cause the woman MD to go suicidal.  Placing woman MDs in therapy, or on psych meds, for disagreeing with the wrong care of themselves is an Ohio specialty - to fund the extra building that the Medical Board occupies, the case workers, the cottage industry of false physician licensure suspensions.  The Medical Board occupies bank real estate in Columbus at taxpayer expense.Ohio has the highest rate of false physician disciplines & suspensions in the nation - we can't do real business so the Medical Board 'finds' business and the case complaints are 'confidential' unless the physician has 'friends' on the Board.  The Ohio physician confidential complaint 'law' is broken by the Medical Board & Govenor - for friends, campaign contributions, and the need to 'find' cases to keep jobs at the State Medical Board.  It's a cottage industry of crap.  But making women MD competitors of Carla O'Day MD suicidal by faking false diagnoses, treatments, and suspensions?  Ohio Medical Board experts have been trained in Russian psychiatric torture techniques - as one lawyer in Columbus was astounded to find.  Ohio is only the State where medical mistakes are treated by allowing the statute of limitations to expire - the only words that talking-head Mr. Rick Whitehouse can say.  Forty-plus states have medical mistake laws, but Ohio legislators pretend to not know what they are (John Eklund, Matt Lynch).  Senator John Eklund will ask 'tell me how medical mistake laws function?'  He doesn't GOOGLE.So women MDs pay the price as there is no reconsideration of false cases, no objective third party judicial review, no objective criteria for cases at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  The Ohio Medical Board votes to suspend a license on provisional innuendo, false testimony and lies - no rules of evidence.  The Medical Board lawyers call the woman MD lawyers and say ADMIT THE CASE.  There's no law, or procedural rule, that the Ohio State Medical Board can't change to win a false case.  There are no procedural rules to follow to undo a false case - the physician has to die.  Other states admit the mistakes and get the physicians back to work with some payments for damages and licensure fees (some repayment plan for careers lost).  The State of Ohio is broke under John Kasich = BROKE = so there is no discussion, no negotiation, no end. If the physician in Ohio does not admit the false case, they never get their medical license back; the Ohio State Medical Board is never wrong even when they cheat.  Governor Kasich must be teaching his girls to cheat - the Medical Board admits that they cheat on cases - cases that have NOTHING to do with patient care except that the woman MD could not get care as her competitors wanted her dead or disabled by withholding 'care-to-function.' Male MDs, Medical Board Members, and lay Medical Board Members can't allow the proper treatment of thyroid conditions in Ohio - it causes fractures and the male orthopedics need practice, while the Medical Board needs cases to subject to serial psychiatric evaluations at taxpayer expense.  No one has a budget for the State Medical Board, or knows how much these false cases cost.  Ask Brad Reynolds - no answer. Many cases at the State Medical Board of Ohio - going on for decades - have NOTHING or ANYTHING to do with patient care.  Some cases of women MDs are for 'making too much of boys being boys care.'  When 'boys being boys' care is done to a woman MD it isn't pretty.  The misdiagnosis of thyroid conditions - so that the woman MD gets psych meds added to an untreated thyroid condition & commits suicide - is a common 'case.'  When the male MDs miss it - they tell the women MDs to 'change their story or lose their license.'  But you can't leave thyroid untreated, so the woman MD tries to get proper treatment and her license is taken to find the new right Ohio psychiatrist that she supposedly needs.  Adding psych treatment to an untreated thyroid condition - not because the woman MD has criteria for any psychiatric disorder - will trigger suicidal behavior (hypomania or worse = the Mary Kennedy problem).  The pharmacologists, experts for the Ohio State Medical Board, and Mr. Rick Whitehouse have known this - that when they can't prove a case they can get the woman MD suicidal by getting a Hearing Officer Judge to say that the woman MD needs psych treatment for objecting to the wrong care done to herself.  That's not a psychiatric diagnosis; women MDs should be allowed to negotiate their points as in business or law. We are so Neanderthal in Ohio that it is a psychiatric disorder for a woman MD to object to a male MD doing the wrong care on her - to cover for negligences.  Wrong care means 'experimental' casts after Dr. Nice lets fractures ripen to 'excrescence,' not allowing proper blood work or workup, not allowing ob-gyn care so that women MDs won't have families or children (but Dr. O'Day can have 5 children and get the Directorship of the Hillcrest ER selling out classmates who are not allowed to get care-to-function).  Board Members sell out their competition for hospital appointments, contracts, real estate and media deals - why Governor Kasich puts real estate moguls & medal spin doctor's wives on the Board - to get them hospital contracts by covering up messes taking the MD licenses of the physicians that object.Suggestion Governor Kasich: clean up the State Medical Board.

I got a call from my credit provider Chase Health about a past due amount of $2,300, I asked what for they stated from North Valley. I told Chasse Health that I closed my account with them same day I called North Valley. Chase Health reopened the account to charge the amount to my card. I disputed the charge with Chase Health they investigated and found there was no surgery preformed and no services were rendered. They dropped the amount off my card and I have a balance of $0.00. Then I filed a BBB report which North Valley told BBB they were dropping said charges of now $5,005. Then I get in the mail a collections notice from North Valley..But I never once received a bill...yet. I'm now disputing the charges with Collections agency. They never preformed any surgery nor did they ever see me beyond my first appointment. How they can charge me anything beyond a canceled appointment fee I just don't know.

Winston Salem, North Carolina United States of America ",http://www.eiofnc.org,336-659-8205,"Epilepsy Institute of NC  Fraudulent/incorrect billing practices, Horibble customer service, Threatened me with atty after I complained on internet!! Winston Salem, North Carolina","
										The Epilepsy Institute of NC & Dr. Marsha Webb located at 1311 Westbrook Plaza Dr Ste 100, Winston Salem NC, #336-659-8205 blatently billed my insurance for services that were never rendered on a particular date of service.  This office has now billed me for three hours of neurological tests performed on my minor child both for dates of service 2/24/12 and 3/22/12. I will agree that the tests were performed on the date of service 2/24. The date in dispute is 3/22/12, which is a date that MY SON WASN'T TESTED AND WAS NOT EVEN PRESENT, and school records back this up. The actual appt in question was for the doctor and myself to go over test results for tests administered on the PREVIOUS 2/24/12 date of service. Of course, insurance denied the duplicate claim so the doctors office attempted to pursue me for the bill. 
When I contacted the billing department (Tom) on 6/5/12, he basically called me a liar, loud talked, berated and talked over me, flat out refusing to answer ANY of my questions as to why I was being billed for services that were not performed on 3/22/12. When I tried to explain to him that my son could not have possibly been tested a SECOND time and was not even present that day, his reply was basically OH WELL THAT IS NOT MY PROBLEM, THIS IS WHAT THE DOCTOR PUT IN THE CHART AND YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT!!! 
 
After that call ended, I voiced my complaints via every avenue possible....the NC Attorney Generals Office, the NC Department of Insurance Fraud Division, all of the local news stations I could find and my Facebook page. At 8:13 am on 6/6/12 I left a voicemail for Dr. Marsha Webb herself advising her of my experience with Tom, reminding her that my son was NOT present at the appointment the day they are fraudulently billing me for testing and giving her an opportunity to rectify the situation before it went any further. She immediately called me back at 9:19 am and quickly advised me she would write off the bills if that was to my satisfaction, I asked her to send me documentation supporting this, she agreed and then rushed me off the phone. 
Several hours later at 2:11 pm she left me a voicemail that she had talked to TOM and at this point they changed their minds about writing off the bills and I would need to discuss the matter with TOM (I saved this voicemail). Shortly after that at 2:57 pm, I received an irate call from TOM stating that he listened to my ""tirade"" on the doctors voicemail and he is aware of all my Facebook posts complaining about their business and he has contacted their attorney and IMMEDIATELY hung up on me before I could respond. I immediately called him back and asked him why did he call me just to hang up on me and why has this escalated to this point. His excuse was that I was irate when we initially spoke on 6/5 about the billing and that he felt that I, and I quote, ""backed him into a corner and that's how he responds if he feels backed into a corner"" ..??!! I told him if questioning him about being billed for services that were never rendered is what he considers ""backing him into a corner"", then that's unacceptable and so is the manner in which he responded to my questions. I advised him of course I am irate because everytime I try to determine what/when I was billed for, he raises his voice and talks over me never allowing me to finish. So he tries to explain again that the bill was for three hours of testing done on my son on 3/22/12. When I finally got him to listen to the fact that my son was NOT there and I had proof AND that the doctor is aware of this, he then changed his story around and said the charge was for them scoring my sons test results that morning. Again, I pointed out that when I arrived, his office SOMEHOW had misplaced the test results that they had ALREADY PREVIOUSLY SCORED PRIOR TO THE APPT on 3/22/12 in some random file (they never found that file) AND that I had to wait an additional hour in the lobby while the guy scrambled to re-score the test results so that the doctor and I could finally go over them....and that I am certain the doctor remembers the situation because she was overly apologetic about losing the results, she just didn't know how that happened, and she will get them to re-do the scores quickly cause she knows I have to drive an hour to work...etc etc... and even sat in the lobby with me for about thirty minutes keeping me company. When I finally DID go into her office to go over my sons test results, I was there for about an hour and when we were done she advised she would compile a complete 8-9 page report and would mail to myself and my son's school to help with his IEP/Section 504 evaluation. So I told him again, NO TESTS were done and why are you now claiming I was charged for re-scoring because your office lost the original test scores??!! He just acted surprised to hear I never got the doctors report and that they had LOST his scores in the first place, but claimed he would investigate what exact services were rendered on 3/22/12 and what happened when he can get wih the doctor. 
Well about 30 minutes after that conversation, I got a call from Mrs. Young at the NC Atty Gen office who offered to call him on three way to attempt to get some of my concerns addressed before she went forward with actually having me file a complaint. When she asked TOM to explain specifically what the bill for 3/22/12 was for, he AGAIN changed his story and said that the bill was for three hours the doctor spent writing the test result report (a report I have yet to get and its been 3 months). So, that makes THREE different explanations/reasons for what the charges are for on just ONE of the dates of service 3/22/12. So I asked him to confirm that he is now saying that the $510 bill was for ""three hours report writing"" that the doctor billed on that same day, He said correct, billed at $170 an hour. I asked if he was talking about the report that they never sent me? He replied well yes but he is working on getting me that report. So I asked has the report even already been done? Well he replied that he couldn't seem to locate it in the file and he hasn't had time to talk to the doctor, etc etc. I replied by telling him now he should understand why I am irate, because you tell me different stories everytime we talk, you lose my sons personal health records that have yet to be found, and you can't even give me a clear answer of what I am being billed for on 3/22/12. I advised the rep at the Atty Gen office that I really hope that Tom and the Epilepsy Institute takes every step to rectify this and I will give them until Friday 6/8/12 to call me back before I go forward with filing a complaint.
 
Interestingly enough, when I got home tonight, I pulled out my itemized statements for all three dates of service, and sure enough it clearly notes that on two separate dates of service (2/24/12 & 3/22/12), I was billed for NEUROPHYS TEST BATTERY, when my son was only tested in that office once on 2/24. The date 3/22/12 is the date in question that my son was not present AND that TOM in billing has changed his story on three times. This itemized statement came directly from the doctors office themselves and is a clear indication that something is amiss here and this could clearly be considered a cause of fraudulent insurance billing.

for taking colleagues 'out of the competition' for non-patient care related issues - it's a way of getting back, getting even, and all at taxpayer expense.  In Ohio, the grudges and bullying of Medical School continue into middle-age tragedies. It's not just the teens shooting up their classmates - they only copy the adults - and the Ohio Bullying Bill needed to get passed long ago.  The real problem in Ohio is the so-termed adults not allowing their MD, or women colleagues, medical care, a family, ob-gyn care, fracture care or any care - MDs who think that competition oks that their colleagues just don't 'deserve' medical care.  There are currently a stack of false cases, disciplines & licensure suspensions, at the State Medical Board of Ohio - from the sucessful 'bullies' on the Board.  Bullies that the Governors go along with for the campaign money.  Using a gun to shoot the competition is only one way of 'killing' - the pretty girl from Medical School with the father MD has to pay in Ohio - with loss of her medical license for not going along with admittedly bad care practices done to her - to disfigure, to maim, to hurt, sterilize and to destroy - leave her fractures uncasted and make her beg, then go at her with the shrinks.  It's not just the sociopath teen in Chardon, it's Judge Grendell that facilitated that the State Medical Board do this in 2003-2012; the kid only learned from example.  Judge Grendell, then Representative & Senator Grendell, knew that the State Medical Board cheated on cases and supported it - to the point of withholding needed medical bone treatments for a woman MD who wouldn't go along that her bone problem was a personality disorder - Grendell screws up psychiatry for his own uses and pretends to be a friend of the Mentally Disabled in Ohio - now he's met his match in Chardon.    Terrorism allowed the US state government to creep into everything personal - but in Ohio that preceded 2001, and it has meant that since the early 1990s, the State Medical Board can get into a physician's medical records and decide what care that physician deserves and what diagnoses that physician should have for the 'impairment' stats.  The Medical Board needed impairments even if they had to manufacture them by changing medical records, inventing diagnoses, withholding blood work, and fixing test results.  In 1995, the State Medical Board invented a new psychiatric diagnosis to continue the false suspension of a woman MD's medical license - a diagnosis that doesn't exist and this is all still in public records as a valid reason for continuing the licensure suspension of this woman MD - posted on the Medical Board's website. This woman MD had no patient complaints - something that her colleagues were jealous of.  In Ohio a good woman MD has to have a psych diagnosis to discredit - she's smart not because she studied, but because she's crazy. The Governors in Ohio have gone along with Carla O'Day MD perfecting this new MedBoarding 'torture' on her women MD colleagues since 1990 - defending the false suspensions that she engineered - the precedents she pioneered.  The false cases that she ran through on lies have never been externally reviewed - the cases have never even been proven - but they are fact despite the Ohio Court of Appeals trying to throw these cases out.  Speaker Budish wanted to only open one case partially - a Jewish lawyer with strong feelings about the Holocaust had no feelings to mistreat a woman MD for power purposes - to gloss torturesque policies that the Democrats have been sponsoring as Carla O'Day MD is a big Democratic contributor in Ohio.  Withholding needed medical care & blood work is Hitler-type torture, and forcing serial psychiatric evaluations for objecting to 'boys being boys' is also torture that the Jewish lawyers in Ohio have no qualms using on Catholic girl MDs - Catholic girls who weren't 'easy' enough for Dr. Nice.  The State Medical Board, and the Jewish Speakers of the House in Ohio, defend Dr. Nice's need to get the personals - without a ethical second-thought or a four-o'clock shadow of conscience.In the 1970s, Carla O'Day MD was a prison social worker who took advantage of a new program at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.  This was a program that allowed older students from other disciplines to apply to medical school with only the basic science courses - or sometimes with just the promise of taking these courses.  It worked and it didn't - and Carla O'Day MD's career shows what happened.  The 'bent arrow' students did not have any heavy science interest, background or experience - and they tended to do the minimal in class to 'pass' and have no real 'feel' for science or medical research - they had 'feel' & ability for the original field that they went into - not the equal opportunity 'chance' that they got for nouveaux political purposes.  So they would skip lecture/lab classes that were more basic science, and not be in any way a mentor, or a student that you could get anything from as to example or wisdom - in mindset they were still prison social workers.  Carla O'Day MD skipped a lot of class, did the minimal and graduated from Cleveland's CWRU School of Medicine going into ER medicine.  In the 1980s she tried at least two residency programs, but didn't ever get through this formal training because of family issues (her ex-husband was a primary excuse) and her own issues with the discipline of studying medicine - going from prison social worker to MD is a big transition and she brought some of her back-alley personality into daily Rounds.  Patients are not criminals and most of her classmates were not criminals - although she has tried to drag some into court and give them criminal records for not going along with her ideas and crazy diagnoses.  She has no clinical ability in medicine - everything is psych - because she skipped out on the other lectures.  So she didn't work out on the wards of University Hospitals in the 1980s.  But she had more chances than any other student or graduate, as she knew Governor Celeste and there was a Celeste Research Building going up at the time - a card which she played to the full.  She begrudged other students chances, and took over her allotment of second and third changes - the University having invested in her, they tried to prove the experiment.    Then someone decided that she should be on the State Medical Board as a career move, go into Administrative Medicine or something like that, and she got appointed with little 'background check' in 1990 and stayed until 1993 - when an investigation into her actions on one case involving another MD from the class behind her at CWRU School of Medicine threatened to go sour as she fixed the case for money - Carla O'Day MD had cheated as she learned long ago in the system to do - she studied criminals and learned - she went to those classes.  CWRU is the only Medical School that encourages classmates to screw each other for power.   No one denies that Carla O'Day MD cheated to get appointed to the Directorship of Hillcrest Hospital ER, or that she profited from fixing the case of the woman MD that Hillcrest Hospital, and several physicians, had mistreated.  No one wants the case opened up, including Governor Kasich, but the woman MD is still without a license - with no patient complaints on her record.  Carla O'Day MD would have the Board move personal cases, or situational problems in which she was involved, into number 1 investigation spots - ahead of boxes of complaints about physicians from patients - the real cases of the State Medical Board of Ohio.  With little secretarial ability, she was the Medical Board's 'Secretary' - a huge climb to another level of incompetence.Carla O'Day MD - bitter from her divorce - continued to fake as a way of getting ahead, getting credentials, and getting to the money in medicine - and her second husband being a lawyer facilitated this.  She grandfathered into Emergency Medicine and got her own group together, but she does not work well with colleagues and tends to be rather crude in conversation, writing, etc - as you would expect of an ex-prison (not hospital) social services worker.  But the Governors from Celeste to Kasich defend her, befriend her, and go along with whatever grudge she wants to play out.  Going after students who really studied in Medical School has been her life's work - getting the competition in a legal way.These cases need to be reviewed.  But in the meantime, the Medical Board's withholding of licensure, jobs, and medical care from physicians for Carla's grudges, needs to stop.  Physicians should never lose a license for complaining about care that was controversial, experimental, and never consented to - care that cause complications for over a year for the physician or another patient.  Women physicians should never have their choices, or objections to bad care, involved in their licensing process.  That's what women physicians are trained to do - to get the best care for themselves as well as their patients - because you need to be physically healthy to care for patients.  Neither the State Medical Board - or Judge Grendell - should be arranging a sixth psychiatric evaluation for a woman MD that needed treatment of a thyroiditis in 1992, and treatment of the bone problem that the negligence caused in 1992.  That one woman MD has been made to endure the 'torture' of no medical care, inappropriate medical care, and seeing herself fracture unnecessarily.  The woman MD needs semi-urgent treatment of her bone condition, treatment that she would have gotten long ago if she were not a political Ohio Medical Board 'case' that Carla O'Day expedited.  Carla's classmate Abby Abelson MD has helped block the woman MD getting care at Cleveland Clinic - Carla can persuade any MD from her class to go along with almost any care abuse of someone outside the class of 1979.  Judge Grendell facilitated this abuse for years.  Carla O'Day MD's influence at the State Medical Board, and her psych mind control over Mr. Whitehouse (previous to that Mr. Dilling), needs to come to an end.  All her cases need external review asap, and complete opening up.  In the meantime, all colleague licenses that she went after for grudges, and where the reasons for the licensure suspension are either controversial or confidential, need to be returned.  Appointments to the State Medical Board in Ohio need to have some orientation, or medical training, to do their job - and these appointments need to be made for the 'right' reasons - not because someone has flunked out of every other use of the MD degree.  Governor John Kasich needs to get over Carla O'Day MD, and do the reforms that he promised. Carla O'Day MD has almost unbelievable 'choke hold' over men - she sucks them into her agendas, into her character destructions, and into her sad world of getting back at people that did nothing to hurt her and only wished her well - but not to interfere with their lives & careers.  Competition and discipline has to be fair at the State Medical Board of Ohio, and recognize that some have abilities that others don't, but that's not reason to withhold medical care hoping to kill a colleague with a very slow, painful, and in Ohio 'legal' death.   ",Doctors

										Governor John Kasich allows outright fraud at the State Medical Board: cases go on for 20 years because no one is able to sign for an end with everything 'confidential' or lies.  You can't as a physician sign a pile of lies, and no job can hire you with any Medical Board 'confidentials.'  Because the other states know that Ohio is cheating, and want the facts. The Ohio Medical Board is allowed to cheat to win cases: change complaint documents, change procedural rules when they lose a ruling, change evaluations, invent diagnoses that the physician is supposed to have & get treated for, throw out blood work, and protect 'friends.'  Medical Board Members contract with hospitals to 'fix' cases and collect in return: hospital appointments, hospital contracts, and other 'favors.'  They admit it - but it's legal.  All of Dr. Carla O'Day's cases from 1990-3 were paid for - she doesn't do anything for 'free' - even for the innocent.  There has to be a limit on the number of years that the State Medical Board can keep trying to 'find' a case; the number of evaluations or 'goes' that they can order a woman MD to - it can't be endless.  Cases are allowed that have nothing to do with patient care - wasting tax dollars and resources.Reforms have been needed for 20 years - and nothing has happened.   The Ohio legislators think it's a joke that the Medical Board cheats - and the Medical Board can say that a physician is 'exaggerating,' but doesn't see that their whole case is exaggerations and misinformation without any rules of evidence.  Legislators - Trakas, Dolan, Grendell - admit that the State Medical Board cheats - and so what?Senator Grendell, now Judge Grendell, and trying to make teens tow the mark, didn't make the Ohio Medical Board adhere to any standards of conduct for the last decade - it was all a joke for him.  How can he lecture, or judge teen murderers when he destroyed the careers of women MDs when they said 'No' to 'the boys being boys' - thereby killing patients that needed the care of that woman physician?  There are many ways to kill people - shoot them or don't provide them adequate, timely, compassionate, and academically sensical medical care - take your pick.  The care that the MD 'boys' provide in Ohio kills - just like a gun. Mr. Whitehouse is never available, Brad Reynolds does not answer his phone, and Governor Kasich is somewhere on cable tv or radio - or having a 'bad hair day' because Ohioans don't 'get him' - another boy.  You can see why all jobs, and 49 other states, want to know 'why' in writing the Ohio State Medical Board took your license for 20 years - when you had no patient complaints and just didn't like Dr. Nice enough - they want to see that 'confidential' and not be conjointly liable for fraud.  If other states grant licenses by endorsement, they have a right to see the 'confidential' and make their own decisions not to 'go along with the boys in Ohio.'  ",Doctors

										They don't come stupider than the Governor in Ohio - who lets the State Medical Board destroy physicians for objecting to the wrong care being done to themselves.  If women MDs can't object and get the right care for themselves, they won't be able to negotiate the right care for any patient.  No other Governor does this, no other Governor wastes lives for petty jealousies and colleague competition.   The Ohio State Medical Board is allowed to take a woman MD's license, not allowing them care-to-function, then lie about them because there is no procedure to handle a medical mistake or dismiss a false case at the State Medical Board in Ohio - it's double jeopardy for life.  You can't order your own blood work, x-rays, and care when your license is taken, and you are mistreated because the jealousies get truly out of hand then - get back time.  And you can't have a kid, because Carla O'Day hated you so much.  The appointees to the State Medical Board in Ohio have slept around, married around, and don't want colleagues to even have a marriage that might be happier than theirs.  Carla O'Day MD wanted everyone screwed after her marriage went down the tubes after Medical School, and no one wished her unhappiness - we were all supposed to 'stand up' for Carla.  I met Dr. Tim Sidor one day, and he wanted Carla O'Day MD fired/removed/contained - taken off the wards - from something done to a patient of his, for sheer incompetence and taking out on every man her anger at her husband.  I talked him down, and then Carla went after me for saving her hide - which I deeply regret.  But Carla's flirting around the Medical School was what eventually did her marriage in - she was on the prowl and didn't care about her 5 kids.  All of us who knew Carla O'Day in medical school have paid dearly for Carla O'Day to be getting it - to have all her personal needs met and money for selling everyone else out.  Carla, to my knowledge, never helped a colleague out with any medical care - she wanted you misdiagnosed, mistreated, disabled, and without a license to compete with her.  She's what they call pathologic - someone who hates everyone except for a few who will worship her and believe everything that she says.  But the false cases that she started at the State Medical Board for her own profit, they need to be reviewed.    Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Dilling before him, just don't answer their phone and the Board Members say to admit the false case so you can get back to work doing the good medical care that you do - better than average physicians are having to admit false cases to keep their licenses so that the Ohio Medical Board can support it's buildings and cottage industry.One woman MD was left without ob-gyn care for 5 years, treatment of a thyroid problem for 10 years, and had continual fractures - which the Board publicized to the rest of the country as the woman physician's personality disorder for objecting to 'boys being boys care' - she was supposed to hide what was going on.  It's not just that the Ohio Medical Board refused to allow certain women MDs to get care, they tell the whole country not to provide care - that's it's just all psychiatric - exaggerations.  Exaggerations with no blood work, no casts, no cast reductions, no ob-gyn care, and no life.  The rest of the United States never questions the Ohio State Medical Board of fraud.When the one woman MD finally called Carla O'Day MD about the blood work that she was not allowed to have, Dr. O'Day dragged her to Municipal Court for calling her on the phone 9 times in 3 weeks trying to reach her - 3x/week the woman MD tried because her bone condition needed treating - she was going to have another fracture.  Then she was fined and told to live with it - she didn't deserve medical care or a life - a municipal court judge did this without the file of what was going on - it's all confidential.  The phone records were not admissible in state court - because the state had to find a case against the woman MD after 13 years - it's now 19 years and no case.  Governor Kasich doesn't want to pay damages.When the State Medical Board of Ohio takes a license without a case, the whole rest of the state is supposed to help the Board get the woman MD to admit the case by withholding medical care.  But the 'boys' don't get this done for them in any other state.  So the woman MD will carry a high risk of thyroid cancer for the rest of her life, and never get over the physical and emotional abuse of 19 years of lies - for jealousy, for stupidity.  She won't have a kid but all Carla's BFFs will have everything that they want.Governor Kasich knows that there is a stack of false physician cases & disciplines - a stack since 1998-9 when it first became obvious to Tom Dilling that there was a mess at the State Medical Board with the 'confidential' complaint system - where physicians probably did nothing except try to do the right care and were being reported, lied about, and trashed.  The worst case still going on is a woman physician who only objected to admittedly wrong care being done to herself - she was supposed to take one for the system in Ohio.  She couldn't stand up for patients, but tried for herself.  So her life was destroyed - by a classmate at Case Western Reserve University who got herself appointed to the State Medical Board without completing any formal residency training - she knew the Celestes.  Carla O'Day MD was finally investigated by Governor Taft internally, and internally the evidence was deemed 'not enough' to act to review her cases and decisions.  Could the Medical Board please open their confidential files - transparency is the only way out?  But it's truly a tragedy that Ohio elected officials are so stupid, so corrupt and so destructive of careers, abilities, and dreams.  ",Doctors

										Governor Kasich promised to reform the State Medical Board & the direction of the Medical Board - the boxes of false suspensions, and false disciplines for just trying to do good medical care in Ohio.  In no other state does a Medical Board take the license of a woman MD for objecting & reporting - because of harassments, threats, and changed medical records - the problem with orthopedic mistakes in Ohio.  It was a general problem - women patients don't get good orthopedic care in Ohio - we get a lot of fooling around, posturing, and 'Orthopedic Surgeon' on the white coat only.  The bullying of women MDs, and women patients, goes on in present-day Ohio because there are no medical mistake laws and no way for the 'boys' to admit a mistake and refer without torturing the woman MD patient with psychiatrists - it's unethical but who cares.  The note from Dr. Tim Nice of Hillcrest Hospital read that the woman MD was supposed to 'lie' - change her story - about what happened - the Medical Board has that note, but has harassed her and ruined her career for 19 years - nothing better to do in Ohio than be a 'cleaner' for Dr. Nice's orthopedic mistakes.  And lying won't fix the problems, won't undo the bad care - and Dr. Nice would not refer because the woman MD did not 'deserve' care from him or anyone else in Ohio.  That's what women are in Ohio - trash per the State Medical Board that endorses this attitude.That orthopedics in Ohio leave fractures uncasted to get surgeries, or cast with 'experimental' casts that don't work to get surgeries that don't work - they don't refer when things go bad.  When women MDs try to get 'help' - that's paranoia in Ohio - that you won't lie for the boys.  When in 40-some other states you don't have to lie for the boys - where the Governors support medical mistake laws or provisions - that 'unanticipated results' be handled with professionalism in days - not 19 years of lies.  Senator Eklund didn't know what medical mistake laws were until recently - and he practices health law in downtown Cleveland - he won't Google. In Ohio when a medical mistake happens, the woman MD noticing the error will have her license suspended to get psychiatric 'help' - which no medical insurance will pay for - to not remember the problems - to not mention the fact of medical errors and that all physicians have to have a way of handling them professionally - because all physicians make mistakes.  It's like the original La Femme Nikita series where Nikita is 'treated' to not remember Michael - well that's the Ohio State Medical Board way of handling things - Madeline 101.  Governor Kasich was supposed to fix this - but so far his appointments are campaign contributors with no capacity to fix, or even understand, the problems.  No other Governor would have continued one of the false cases - from 1992 - from a woman Board Member going after a classmate from Medical School - a classmate that she couldn't help get a cast and some blood work.  Carla O'Day MD watched while the other woman MD tried to work with an uncasted fracture - and she had plenty of cast material in the Hillcrest ER, but Carla had no capacity to help a colleague in a medical way - no compassion, no judgment, no nothing that a MD is supposed to have or be trained to develop.    Watching the old La Femme Nikita - with Roy Dupuis & Peta Wilson - one is struck with a strong woman character who argues her points with Roy Dupuis 'Michael.'  A cooperation, a partnership, a very good relationship that isn't ever allowed for women in medicine - if we disagree with are sent to the Madeline psychiatrists to be tortured into submission.  That's Ohio medicine - never Mikita.There's no state money apparently for Judge Grendell to order a psychiatric evaluation of the 17-year old teen whose tragic home life, and the school bullying that he couldn't process, resulted in his fighting back with a gun - at Chardon High School.  No one helped the kid though he messaged his hurt - and no one phoned him to find out what was wrong - no one cared - a whole community didn't extend one hand to help in time.  Senator Grendell - now Judge Grendell in the Geauga Juvenile Court - did not support a bullying bill with any sense in the Ohio legislature - he's been bullying the woman MD into submission for the Medical Board - to get appointed to the Court by fixing a problem for the State Medical Board - by threatening & forcing a woman MD to a sixth psychiatric evaluation because she had no patient complaints and made a good point about the bad fracture care in Ohio.Senator Tim Grendell worked with the State Medical Board to order two days of evaluations with Dr. Philip Resnick of University Hospitals of Cleveland for this woman as a way 'out' - two days of hell that the woman MD who objected to Dr. Nice & Keith's bad fracture care was supposed to go through to get her medical license back in 2003 - this after five other evaluations - four of which were done without allowing blood work - and the problem with the bone pains was an untreated thyroid problem - a common problem in Ohio that she couldn't get treated or order her own blood work for.  Three national experts have told the Ohio State Medical Board to stop this years ago, the woman MDs mother pleaded with Senator/Representative Grendell that five evaluations was enough for the Board to prove a case or dismiss the case for fraud.  Grendell probably read the 'confidential' complaint, and held the State to its promise to promote his career - he destroyed the woman's career for the State of Ohio.  Trakas blocked discovery for an appointment on the State Cosmetology Board - this woman MD is getting careers for politicians who block her license being returned, her case has changed more rules at the State Medical Board than they had.  What was needed was an opening of the 'confidential' complaint years ago - so that the woman MD could defend herself that none of the complaint signers knew about no blood work - or the need for it - and the symptoms that translated as a serious thyroid problem.  And you can't leave thyroiditis untreated - as you then create a high risk for thyroid cancer and lymphoma of the thyroid.  But Senator Grendell is too stupid to know that - he just wanted to solve the Medical Board's problem by making the woman MD have a diagnosis that she does not have to get the Board out of liability for taking her medical license in 1992 WITHOUT DUE PROCESS.  Should such a lack of due process lawyer be a Judge?  So is that 17-year old in Chardon going to get any due process - probably not.  And he wasn't a stupid kid, just a mistreated kid, with guns in the home, handling his problems in a very wrong way.  But had the bullying bill passed the Ohio legislature awhile back, maybe that Chardon kid would have had somewhere - or a cell phone number - to get some help - he did use his phone before a gun. Bullied teens can commit suicide or harm others - it goes either way.  But Judge Grendell has been busy fixing Hillcrest Hospital's bullying problem with over-psychiatrically evaluating a woman MD who needed basic fracture care & some thyroid function tests.  Instead she has gotten 19 years of 'hell' because in Ohio you can't admit a medical mistake, or that a physician is bullying a woman MD patient, and get the care transferred within days for an 'unanticipated' fracture result.  If the male MDs, the Senators & Representatives in Ohio, are bullying women MDs, how will bullying ever stop in Chardon?   The boy in Chardon needs the 2 days of Dr. 'Forensic' Resnick, not an over-achieving MENSA MD graduate of Case Western Reserve University - she recognized that Drs. Nice & Keith didn't know what they were doing, and that she needed help - so she finally complained to the Medical Board - then her life was ruined.  Not because she was wrong, or that she had psychiatric-anything, but because she disagreed with the boys and reported their fracture bullying and refusals to help her with even the most basic casting.  It took 5 days of begging for Dr. Tim Nice to put a very badly fitting cast on her - which had to be removed at Geauga ER after 5 days for 'eating' into her hand.  It didn't fit, and Dr. Nice doesn't bother to do x-rays after he casts - he eats pizza in front of you - shows women patients how many pounds of wrist grip strength he has instead of using the device to check the healing of wrist fractures.  Is Dr. Nice any less disturbed than the Chardon teen - both are acting out for some need to grow up.No other state would have allowed this to happen with the woman MD - within days in states with medical mistake laws the hospital, facility or office has to have a plan to undo the bad care or is closed (Pennsylvania).  But Judge Grendell has participated in allowing the State Medical Board to cheat on Rorschach tests, to invent psychiatric diagnoses that don't exist, to not allow blood work for women physicians before their licenses are taken for 'exaggerated' bone pains, and now the Chardon teen is an adult - when Judge Grendell isn't an adult.  The State Medical Board of Ohio needs to stop bullying women MDs into false cases, the Ohio Legislature needs to pass a strong student bullying Bill, and the boy in Chardon needs the 2 days of Dr. Philip Resnick - before Judge Grendell rules on if he is any more of an adult than Judge Grendell.  You've 'killed' a woman MD's career, and her health, and destroyed her family and her parent's health - is that any less of a crime?  You let the State Medical Board lie and cheat - poor example for any teen in Chardon.  ",Doctors

										University Green Road Medical Center provides medical offices for a lot of University Hospital of Cleveland physicians - who should be able to behave professionally, with courtesy, and before they cause complications with misjudgments - to discuss patient concerns and all options - with the patient or physician.  You don't just walk in after driving all night, schedule a procedure without thinking because your father just died, and not see the 'shock' on the patient's face - but they do this at University Green Road Suburban.Dr. Thomas Stellato is the Medical Director and one of the worst offenders of trying to see patients without a night's sleep, the proper reading or preparation, or the proper affect - if you are bored with patients that day, cancel the office Dr. Stellato and take a few days - like you should have done years ago when you got too tired or had a family emergency.  Now finally patients can refuse to see a physician, or undergo a surgery, if the surgeon presents too tired and with no sleep - your replacement at University Hospitals talks about it at Grand Rounds.    And next of kin phone numbers are to be called before there is a mix-up about a surgery or appointment - which Dr. Stellato's Office Manager can't seem to do - although she breaks into tears when you confront her with this.  The secretaries at Green Road should be able to contact patients, or physicians, before procedures, and to explain these procedures - not be accusing patients of 'standing someone up' when no information was sent to the patient about where to show up and when.  If there was nothing in the mail, the procedure wasn't scheduled properly Dr. Stellato - blame the person who did the scheduling.  Things have declined in the last 10-20 years.  Dr. Thomas Stellato is the Medical Director and has the responsibility of being a showcase for the kinds of behaviors that should go on at University Suburban Green Road.  Yet Dr. Stellato - when he makes a mistake or misjudgment - which causes a patient harm - needs to discuss - and he's calling the South Euclid Police - with the support of the Administration - leading physicians to believe that someone is cognitively impaired over there. And before Dr. Stellato handles more patients, he needs to go through the patients that he needs to discuss things with, and solve ALL the problems of the past that he's caused by trying to do too many jobs through the years.  You can't run a private practice, be Chief of General Surgery, be the Medical Director of Green Road Suburban, etc.  And he's not Medical.    All General Surgeons at University Green Road should be able to diagnose, and treat conservatively, an inflamed nerve in an incision that they caused - not to cause that patient to have a neurectomy (nerve excised which is painful & deforming).  This is treated with a nerve block, non-inflammatories, and observation - by Anesthesia - and there's a number of anesthesiologists at University Green Road - who can see patients between procedures for this - before Dr. Stellato schedules another procedure for abdominal wall pain.  It's not a cause to provide misinformation to a patient, or physician, about - or to break a sweat about -  it's a common problem that Dr. Stellato and his staff of surgeons need to have information on and be able to diagnose correctly - and they should all be able to fix the surgeries that should not have been done cutting muscles & nerves.  If Dr. Stellato can invent bariatric procedures, he should be able to repair a few muscles - it's not brain surgery - it's just General Surgery 101.  Dr. Stellato's own misassessment of this has caused trouble on this diagnosis - and he needs to be able to repair the muscles cut in unnecessary procedures on patients for this and stop making this mistake - his misassessment caused the mistake.  And when someone leaves him the medical literature on the diagnosis of superficial abdominal wall pain at his office - articles written by a Gastroenterologist who trained at University Hospitals initially - he needs to read them - not give them to the police or throw them away.  When he sees a patient where this might be the diagnosis, he needs to order the appropriate workup, and document the appropriate concerns in the records when they are requested - the differential diagnosis which still applies to him as to other surgeons.     Dr. Stellato was supposed to be the alternate choice for the Chief of Surgery at University Hospitals several years ago - yet he can't repair a few muscles with a University plastic surgeon - superficial abdominal wall pain is a difficult diagnosis and the unnecessary surgeries are deforming, painful, and the common mass closures just ridiculous.  If Dr. Stellato wants a surgical problem to solve: solve the problem of the abdominal fascial closure - include women patients - and repair with layered closures = the Art of Surgery for Dummies.  The literature on this is horrible.  Dr. Stellato needs to learn to discuss at sixty-some, it's not anything that the South Euclid Police Department know anything about or can fix  - so please stop the behavior - it's demeaning to the patients and reflects poorly on all physicians who trained at University Hospitals or worked there for any period of time.  The Green Road Suburban Administration needs to require that if Dr. Stellato makes a misassessment, he discusses, as every other physician has to do.  Dr. Stellato's secretary needs to answer her phone and get back to patients - with mailing or internet communications for procedures.  Her job is not to be the blood pressure girl for the building - that's where mistakes happen to start. 									",Doctors

										Governor Kasich is allowing the misuse of the State Medical Board powers, and the emotional & physical abuse of women physicians who have to insist that they need the right blood work before their medical licenses, and hardwon clinical privileges, are suspended for 19 years for objecting to 'jock' care (a joke of care) in Ohio by physicians that do not understand about metabolic bone problems and fractures.  Mr. Whitehouse - the continued by default Executive Director of the Ohio State Medical Board - and his predecessor Tom Dilling, do/did not know anything about women's health - and they believe the rot that the other Medical Board Members feed to them.  Both do not believe that women MDs need blood work - just a new right Ohio psychiatrist - which is terribly sad and cruel.  Mr. Tom Dilling would say this on the phone to women MDs; that they had to do what he wanted or there would be consequences - Tom Dilling's medical stupidity was AWESOME and LEGENDARY - the stuff that disasters are made of.  These types of metabolic fractures, the fractures that occur with untreated thyroid disease, need to be handled at a tertiary center, not Hillcrest Hospital and ER as it was run by a former Medical Board Member in the 1990s - who then took the licenses of everyone who objected to her judgments - which were poor to negligent as she never went to class at CWRU Medical School and never talked to the other medical students except those in her little 30-some clique of 'mean girls' - which happens even in Medical School in Ohio.  Carla O'Day MD didn't/doesn't know that to evaluate a thyroid problem you need a TSH - Abby Abelson MD (Cleveland Clinic) never talked to her about that so Abby is busy trying to kill this woman MD former classmate too - with neglect - a condition that John Brems MD tried to tell Abby is for real.  Earth to Abby - who is too busy being a Department of Rheumatology Chair to notice a classmate being mistreated - it's all game for Abby Abelson MD - the truth - which she won't interfere in; Carla O'Day MD can kill and no one will tell her differently.  Eyal Press's recent book, BEAUTIFUL SOULS Saying No, Breaking Ranks, and Heeding the Voice of Conscience in Dark Times, is one that Abby Abelson needs to read - a Jewish author chronicling courage in 'beautiful souls' who say 'No' to the herd.The New York Times article on Eyal Press's book summarizes that: ""Even in contemporary America, where the costs of doing the right thing are relatively low, most reeds bend in the prevailing winds. According to research by the sociologist Claude Fischer that Mr. Press cites, Americans are far more likely than Europeans to believe workers should follow a bosss orders even if the boss is wrong.        Thyroid problems are not treated with a sixth psychiatric evaluation 'go'.   Carla O'Day MD never got thyroid disease - but she didn't stick around long enough in the corridors of Medical School for anyone to figure that out.  Thyroid problems happen 90-plus% of the time in women - the reason that they are so misdiagnosed by men that it is a national medical mistake - women athletes have gone to Congress to testify about this type of medical mistake.  Currently Olympic Runner Kathy Butler has thyroid disease - but it is being treated (Olympics 2012).  Gail Dever's had thyroid disease - why the epidemic of thyroid in only women runners - because thyroid is a woman's disease - and shows up a lot in stressful situations.  This is a FACT which Ohio physicians, including Carla O'Day, Anita Steinbergh, and Lance Talmadge don't know.  Rick Whitehouse, and Governor Kasich don't know about thyroid disease either - and they don't follow Olympic women runners or wonder why thyroid only affects women runners - beyond their pay grade.So Carla O'Day MD in 1992 ran the case against the women MD classmate at the State Medical Board as her 'bosses' directed - to get experience.  Carla's false cases - at least one against a woman classmate - caused the loss of the woman classmate's medical license for 19 years - as the woman MD had to disagree with Carla O'Day MD to try to save her own life.  Case Western Reserve School of Medicine must be the only Medical School in the country that turns out graduates willing to destroy a classmate's medical license for the price of an unethical buck - the bucks that Carla O'Day MD admittedly collected from Hillcrest Hospital for getting them off the hook of not doing the correct care in the ER.  Carla O'Day MDs class in Medical School - took drug companies to task for the freebies that they offered medical students - and mostly they were needed freebies like stethoscopes - without any condition of payback.  And Carla O'Day MD is the expert in taking unethical paybacks - one of the 'beautiful souls' that went after Lilly for their lovely stethoscopes. Lilly in the 1970s was just trying to make better physicians by GIVING medical students something that they might not have the money to buy - a GOOD stethoscope - they didn't want BAD stethoscopes being used for teaching.  Lilly just wanted BETTER physicians, and Carla O'Day MD turned that one down.  Her class almost ruined it for those of us that wanted those GOOD stethoscopes day #1 - to practice.    Carla O'Day MD was told to 'call the Mayo Clinic' and to meet with the woman physician and her father MD before telling the Medical Board a pile of lies - just as Dr. Nice didn't get that the fractures were not fractures for Hillcrest Hospital except in a splint/temporary cast sense, Carla O'Day MD didn't get that she should discuss before she diagnosed.  Dr. O'Day, since graduation from Medical School, has only talked with this woman MD once - on the phone to take a patient that NO ONE ELSE would take at Hillcrest Hospital - an admission of a dying woman with no procedures.  Once in 30 years is all that Carla O'Day spoke to the woman MD that she screwed and pretended to know and dissect/dish to Members of the State Medical Board - Carla the gossip girl.  The woman MD asked Dr. Nice to stabilize and refer as she needed someone to help her with this referral, not to do care that he didn't have the training for.  The woman MD asked Carla O'Day MD for a little clinical maturity.  Hillcrest Hospital's Dr. Nice, like most men, doesn't 'get' much.  And it took 10 years to get someone IN ANOTHER STATE, to order the right blood tests after Carla O'Day MD had this woman's license suspended for 'making too much of bad care' that was going to eventually 'kill' her - Carla O'Day screwed a classmate for her career - when the classmate had NO patient complaints - even 'sick' this woman did better medical care of her patients than most MDs do when 'well' in Ohio - again, not saying much about Ohio medical care.  So it's taking another 10 years, after the thyroid tests were done & presented to Dr. Angelo Licata at Cleveland Clinic - who is just watching the woman MD break bones as he doesn't have the conscience to say anything that might cause a problem for HIS medical license - another 10 years to get someone in government to realize the mistake - Governor Kasich, his useless talking-head Lieutenant Governor, or the Attorney Genera DeWine.  So far no one in Ohio government has admitted the 'reality' of the medical mistake used to take a woman MD's medical license - but there are a pile of notifications of this on ripoffreport - which should not have to be used as a medical report.   This killing of someone, destroying their health & career, for having to object to a medical mistake is what Governor Kasich is continuing in this situation - by not reviewing this situation externally or personally - he's giving a death sentence.  The Ohio State Court of Appeals did what they could by trying to throw the case out in 1993 - and this is now 2012.  Ripoff is the last resort, because no one will communicate at the Ohio State Medical Board - Mr. Whitehouse does not have the official ok to admit a mistake - which needs to come from Governor Kasich if he could get off the golf course & out of the Meet The Press television studios long enough.  Medical mistake laws need to happen in Ohio.  Senator John Eklund, and Representative Matt Lynch, need to do something besides post their pictures on the Ohio Legislative website.  There are a stack of false physician disciplines at the State Medical Board of Ohio that need to be reviewed EXTERNALLY so that someone can say what really happened and get these poor people back to work - clear their licenses.  This has been admitted since 1998-9, admitted by Larry Householder's Office when he was Speaker of the Ohio House (the most corrupt Speaker was the most honest), and indirectly admitted by Speaker Budish who wanted only a limited opening of this woman's case - to save the state the embarrassment & promote his career.It's impossible that this women MD, and the other falsely suspended Ohio MDs, could/would sue the state - it would ruin whatever is left of their lives and their careers - and they all want nothing more to do with Ohio - any redress would be botched.  So it's diagnoseable paranoia on the part of Mr. Whitehouse & Governor Kasich, to even imagine that these physicians want more than the return of their medical licenses so that they can be resigned when another state license becomes their primary (48 hours).  These physicians simply want out of the mess that is Ohio government - run as it is by people who long ago reached their levels of incompetence.  Earth to Governor Kasich - you didn't cause the problems, but you are responsible for fixing them.  You can't continue a Medical Board that is the most abusive in the nation.  Physician complaints can't be 'confidential' - or the problems can't be solved because NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE CASE IS REALLY ABOUT.  The cases will go on forever as the Board changes the 'confidential' complaint trying to find a case for decades.  Physicians make mistakes, Medical Boards made mistakes - at least 15% of the time - and there have to be ways to dismiss cases at the State Medical Board - the 15% solution.  Your Medical Board Members have diagnostic error ratings of at least 25% on the web.Cliques in Medical School lead to problems in real life with communication among women MDs.  Stupid MDs who don't go to class then make stupid decisions - you can't get it all out of a book, or on the lecture videotape - and you don't learn the communication skills this way.  Lectures were not videotaped in Carla O'Day's day.  Taking medical licenses to force a physician to go along with bad care - of themselves or another patient - is negligence and unethical practice.  And no psychiatrist - even a lying forensic one - can fix this; the Deans at CWRU Medical School did not use Dr. Philip Resnick for the problems that women MDs have on the wards, because he didn't have a clue or the sensitivity for these types of situations.  Most lawyers in the Cleveland area admit this - they would not go near Dr. Resnick as a lawyer, or if they needed a shrink.  Dr. Resnick is well-placed with serial killers, criminals who have almost unrecognizable sensitivity.  The woman physician has to have her thyroid problem treated adequately - or it will go to thyroid cancer or lymphoma - and the bone problem caused by it has to be treated before 20 years.  And it's now 20 years this summer.  Governor Kasich you need to 'step up to the plate.'  Or this woman MD, and the stack of false physician discipline cases for reasons that are just arbitrary, are going to die and their dependents & families will eventually sue the state for all that their lives should have been worth.  Mr. Whitehouse is not adequate to the job, Brad Reynolds is not adequate to the job, and so far YOU are not adequate to the job - and it's not just that Ohioans don't 'get' you - it's that you don't 'get' the job.  ",Doctors

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614) 466-3555,"Governor John Kasich  allows State Medical Board Members to use the Medical Board to 'bully' ex-Medical School classmates into accepting medical care that is admittedly bad & wrong or lose their license for making too much Columbus, Ohio","
										Governor Kasich is allowing Ohio Medical Board discipline and complaints to be for all the wrong things, everything except patient care, by continuing the 'confidential' complaint system done away with in almost every other state but Texas - where there was a bill to start the 'reform' of things in 2011.  
Other than misguided Texas, no other state does 'confidential' physician complaints - because when the Medical Board makes a mistake - then the Medical Board is to blame for acting on the 'confidential.'  When has Ohio wanted to follow a Texas precedent, except for fraud?
States doing away with 'confidential' complaints are a liability decision - that a physician complaint has to have a name & address is legally necessary or you waste everyone's time and money.  Governor Kasich would have seen this if he had any legal training, but he's directing a legislature with a over-supply of it - where the lawyers don't seem to have any social conscience whatsoever.  In other states they won't accept a physician complaint unless there is a name attached and the credentials of that name can be checked - check out Rhode Island - and the complainers have to have known the physician (give the details of any relationship with the physician, ie can't be the guy who wanted sex on the side of his marriage, or the medical school classmate who hated her).
Ohio legislators can't seem to wrap their heads around Medical Board reforms and medical mistake laws, even when you tell them that almost every other state has more fairness & due process than Ohio - and the legislators are all lawyers.  Senator John Eklund, and Representative Matt Lynch, have been approached in 2012 about reforms needed at the State Medical Board - reforms already written in 49 other states.  Bills that they just have to choose wording from.  
With 'confidential' physician complaints, colleagues can complain about physicians after they have interfered with the medical care of the physician - so that they aren't sued - to let the statute of limitations expire - which is unethical.  Bullying of colleagues is basically what is going on - medical bullying that continues from Medical School where the older more experienced woman students - Carla's clique (Abby Abelson MD at Cleveland Clinic) - bullied the younger woman students that they were supposed to be a social mentor for.  So you hate someone, ok, but taking their medical license is taking hate & grudges too far.
Carla O'Day MD was taken at CWRU School of Medicine to be a sort of 'den mother' - to be experience that other woman students could draw from and look up to - except that didn't exactly work out as planned by the Deans.  She became a Medical Board Member in 1990-3, and started cases that no one has ever seen the like of; she seems to have really hated her younger women colleagues from Medical School.  Carla O'Day was extremely bitter about her divorce from Magistrate Streepy - the whole state had to hear about her divorce - but that kind of person should not have ever been on the State Medical Board.  Did anyone ever ask the CWRU Deans?
Carla O'Day MD was an older MD student at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in the 1970s, but with her appointment to the Medical Board in 1990-3, she used the Medical Board to go after a younger woman MD that she had hated in the late 1970s, early 1980s - a woman with no patient complaints, but with her medical situation being mismanaged.  Instead of intervening in a responsible way, and showing the guys how it should be done with women's care, Carla O'Day MD used her Medical Board appointment to arrange payment for suspending the woman classmate's license - hospital appointments & ER contracts for herself and her ER group.  Carla played hardball with the boys, knew how to scare them, and the boys fell for it, when Carla O'Day's Hillcrest ER was equally liable for mistriaging the situation and letting Dr. Nice eat pizza in the clinical areas.     

The bullying continues to this day at the State Medical Board of Ohio - Hearings with piles of lies, no one knowing what the case is about, that the case has been allowed to continue for 20 years with no case or to find a case - no discussions as no one can find Mr. Whitehouse or get him on the phone.  Most Medical Boards insist that the case be about the physician's patient care, not their child support, and that the case is not older than so many years or it is thrown out.  In Ohio, it's like Once Upon A Time, with all the cast members being unsure of their job and names - no rules that can't be broken or re-invented in Storybrooke Columbus.  And no one ever leaves - Anita Steinbergh DO has been there for 20 years.  
In Ohio, Board Members run the cases against classmates after they sign the complaint - to protect the Board Member who orchestrated care in an ER that was not very good.  Carla O'Day MD didn't just start cases against classmate colleagues in the 1990s, she ran them, arranged for falsified Rorschach testing, and did everything except call the Mayo Clinic to find out what the woman MD classmate really had.  
And the Governors from Celeste to Kasich have known about the problem with the cases that Carla O'Day started - Governor Taft had her reviewed internally, so that the pile of unjustified confidential complaints that Carla O'Day MD orchestrated weren't opened for reforms - not enough evidence as everything is 'confidential.'  It's now a society that is post-9/11 and disclosure of what is really doing on at the State Medical Board needs to be done - if only so that other witnesses that knew what was really going on with Carla O'Day MD can come forward.  
So that the physicians falsely accused because of Carla O'Day being bitter about things can get back to their lives & careers.  One woman's misuse of her appointment has made a mess - but the mess should have been reviewed by one of the Republican Governors before Kasich - if only to highlight the abuses of picking ones friends or campaign contributors for Medical Board positions.  No Ohio Governor should be able to get just expedited 'green lights' in the Senate Health Committee.  Medical Board appointments should have something to do with medical care - not real estate, political spin-doctor's wives, or just because of the money.  
Medical Board cases need to be about the physician's patient care, not to support the Medical Board cottage industry.  Medical Boards need to allow that physicians object to the wrong care for themselves or their patients - as part of the job.  The physician needs to be in good health to care for patients - her fractures can't be ripening to EXCRESCENCE.  
If the physician is getting medical care that no one else in any other state would have to tolerate - then the care is wrong - it's not a personality disorder of the physician.  The Ohio State Medical Board is misusing psychiatry - when the diagnosis can be found by calling the Mayo Clinic - and no blood work is allowed before the Board acts.  Women MDs don't deserve gyn, blood work, or casts with padding and fracture reduction in Ohio - they have to be mindless groupies saying a drugged 'yes' to whatever the boys propose in the way of care, standards, or fraternization - why not get a surgical robot?  It would have been cheaper in this case.  
And then the Cleveland Clinic won't act to treat the bone condition.  After the Medical Board acts in Ohio, no one has the social conscience to help a physician whose license has been suspended, no matter how unjustly.   
One woman physician has had her license suspended for 19 years for making too much of admittedly very bad care (the 'boys were being boys' is how the Medical Board has described the care).  She was one of Carla's cases that has been continued because the Board has no procedural policy to handle a mistake - to undo a case.  Other states have policies to cover Medical Board mistakes - that they will cover re-licensure and re-education.  Ohio legislators are not so farsighted.Governor Kasich should not be legitimizing 'boys being boys' medical care for starters.  The woman MD's cousin had the same metabolic bone condition in another state - getting the correct treatment - so the woman MD objected and her license was taken with no legal basis for this - but the Governor is not a lawyer.  Neither Ohio physicians, nor Medical Board Members, can do the correct treatment or call the Mayo Clinic to find the correct diagnosis before an emergency session to provisionally taken the woman MD's license to cover the liability of the woman Board Member (Carla O'Day MD), the hospitals and the physicians involved in the 'boys' care in Cleveland - boy's care that didn't even involve picking up the cell phone.  
First, these kind of cases are a misuse of the Medical Board.  Second, it's a situation where the Board should be intervening in to improve the care in Ohio to the standard of the other 49 states.  And third the Medical Board has to encourage communication, consultation, and dialogue to improve physician care.  And the discussions should not have to be on ripoff - a real case and the Ohio Court of Appeals would not have thrown the case out in 1993.   ",Doctors

Coon Rapids, Minnesota United States of America ",http://health.allina.com/locations/55,763-236-9236,"Allina Medical Women's Clinic - Coon Rapids, MN  Bad information by employee resulting in over $600 bill Coon Rapids, Minnesota","
										I was receiving care at the Allina Women's Medical Clinic in Coon Rapids. I stopped going here and transferred to the Champlin clinic due to poor service, communication and incorrect information given by the staff resulting in over a $600 bill that I was told would be covered by insurance.
I am pregnant and prior to my 12 week visit I was told if I showed up early for an 8:15 am apt they would get me into the lab right away to drink the diabetic testing stuff so I would not have to wait around an hour after the apt. Upon checking into the front desk 45 minutes early and watching the front desk person hand the orders to the lab tech who walked them back I was called in 5 minutes prior to my apt to drink the syrup. This was only the first issue of this apt. If there was an issue in getting me in early it would have been great for some communication before the apt or during the wait time from the time I checked in at the front desk; there was none during the 40 minutes sitting idle in the waiting room. The nurse called me back and checked me in and asked me to get into a paper gown. I sat with my husband in the cold room for over 30 minutes, with no word or update from any staff before the doctor came in with a weak apology. All that was needed at this point was some communication from the staff that the doctor was running behind. This appointment ended by us sitting around after the apt waiting for the lab techs again to call me back to draw blood due to the syrup not being in my system long enough due to the delay before the  appointment. Upon leaving the 12 week apt I made my 16 week and 20 week apts. I asked the woman who made these apts for me how many people could go back into the ultra sound room for the 20 week as my husband and I wanted our parents to be there, if possible. She said 2-3 and suggested that if we wanted more we should make an apt across the street at Mercy Hospital. I asked if it would work the same and if they would charge more? She assured me that because it was my 20 week ultra sound that it would be included the same way as at the clinic. She proceeded to call over to Mercy Hospital to check how many people they would allow; they confirmed 8-9 so she made the 16 week and 20 week doctor apt at the clinic and the 20 week ultra sound apt at Mercy Hospital for me handed me a card with the time.When I exited my 16 week apt I stopped at the front desk to confirm my 20 week apt as the nurse said she did not see any other apts made during the apt. The woman at the front desk could not find them either she made the 20 week doctor apt and called over to Mercy Hospital to set up the apt over there. She was on hold so I got the number from her and called to make the apt myself as I needed to get to work. When I got to the 20 week ultra sound apt at Mercy Hospital we found out upon check in that they would only let 2-3 people back at a time. They worked with us and we rotated and made it work, but another disappointment as it was the whole/only reason we made the apt at Mercy Hospital. If we would have known this we would not have made the apt over there but stayed at the clinic.About a week later I received a bill in the mail from Mercy for almost $600 for the 20 week ultra sound apt I immediately called the billing office asking what was going on and they told me what the bill was for they advised me at this time to call my insurance company. I called the insurance company, they told me because I had the 20 week ultra sound apt at the hospital it is billed differently and there would be a charge or lesser coverage vs being totally covered ($0 expense to my out of pocket) by insurance, like if the ultra sound was done at the clinic. Over the next few weeks I talked multiple times to many people at the Allina Women's Clinic and Mercy Hospital. Mercy Hospital did reduce the bill by 1/3 but the Allina Clinic who created the issue with the woman who made the 16 week apt not telling me to call and check with my insurance, but ill-advising me did nothing. I then received another bill from Suburban Imaging for the tech portion of the 20 week ultra sound for around $100. I was told pretty much the same thing and blown off again by the Allina Women's Clinic and the clinic's billing employees.I would have never made the 20 week ultra sound apt at Mercy Hospital if I would have been advised to check with my insurance and found out that the 20 week ultra sound apt was not covered the same as at the clinic. I would have been able to take our parents out to a great dinner for the $700 in bills that are not being charged. If the woman who made the 16 week apt at the Allina Women's Clinic would have not told me misinformation I would not have the almost $700 bill and if I stayed at the clinic for the apt it would have been 100% covered by my insurance. I have requested the Allina Women's Clinic refund me the almost $700 that I have paid on the two bills due to the misinformation and ill advisement of the person at the front desk at Allina Women's Clinic Coon Rapids. I have paid both bills in order to keep my record clean. That is the only reason the bill has been paid.									",Doctors

										Governor Kasich has yet to get the message that there are problems at the Ohio State Medical Board - where women physicians have their licenses taken by colleagues who can't do a differential diagnosis of bone pains & order the correct blood work - so no blood work is allowed.  It's not about blood work at the prestigious Ohio State Medical Board; it's about who you've dated or scored with, and did you do it with Dr. Nice and why not ie why don't you like him in this way?  Two whole days in the 1990s were spent discussing the dating life of that woman physician - at taxpayer's cost = why the high sales taxes in Ohio.  This was a woman MD who didn't have enough 'experience' for the Board's liking - heavy sexual stuff was not there - she didn't sleep around with multiple partners like an 'easy' Catholic girl should.  And expert from Columbia-Presbyterian who co-authored the DSM had to be flown in to testify for her - and waste his time on going through her dating life - not her patient care.  And ? this was why they took her into Medical School?  Anita Steinbergh DO wanted to know about her dating life; prim Anita.  The question is why?  And that the case is not over.Because of the 'confidential,' Members go after colleagues who they hated in Medical School, with no information, and the rest of the Medical Board Members - talking heads that seem to be on Prozac or Abillify - ask no questions.  Ever go to a Medical Board meeting Governor Kasich?  Everything at the Ohio State Medical Board is about stats of bad physicians, even if the physicians disciplined have done nothing wrong to patients, do not do drugs, are up-to-date on CME, and their alcohol use wouldn't help support a liquor store in any way - a taste at a wine tasting on a Saturday evening - no parties on week nights, no nothing except trying to do her job.And the Ohio legislators all benefit from this and other cases - in hiding the facts.  Jim Trakas blocked discovery in one case, got rid of a woman office worker who tried to get the physician's file from the State Medical Board (a really loyal worker for his office, and a looker besides), and he's now hiding the facts at the Ohio Cosmetology Board - at a salary of over $90,000 for his silence.  What happened to the office worker that he lateralized - no one knows.  Tim Grendell got appointed to be a Geauga County judge, out of sequence, because Governor Kasich owed him for not opening up the case about what was going on with a woman physician's license in his district.  So Grendell will now hide the facts in court.  Dolan was favored to run for Cuyahoga County Executive - he saw the file - but no one else can get it.  No one knows why at least one woman's medical license has been suspended for 19 years - unheard of in any other state even if the physicians have killed a patient - and this woman had no problems with patients.  Mr. Whitehouse can't be gotten on the phone for 6 years now.  In 1999, there was an offer to open the files, and this was rescinded after the Board admitted that the woman MD was probably unjustly suspended - the Board's admits this but has no procedural policy to undo the mistakes of past administrations & staff.  The Board wanted another 'go' at the case because the evidence was that the Board acted without due process or common sense.The only offer in the last 10 years - have 2 days of evaluations with a guy that hangs out with serial killers in his office most of the time - the patients in the waiting room are killers.  The last two appointees for Cuyahoga County, Senator Eklund and Representative Lynch, owe their appointments/job solely to Governor Kasich - so they are loyal partisans.  And neither believe in medical mistake laws or that physician complaints at the State Medical Board should not be confidential.  Texas is the only state still doing this, and they had to do partial reforms - complaints have to be about patient care, not that a colleague is competition - in September, 2011 - notso in Ohio.No physician, or lay person, who couldn't get to class in college or Medical School should be on the Medical Board.  All of Dr. Carla O'Day's decisions, and the cases she ran, have to be reviewed.  Governor Taft tried to start this in 2005, but the review was internal, and no physician who has had to disagree with Dr. O'Day was allowed to testify - the results were not conclusive, but they were not good, and nothing more has been done to right the wrongs that Dr. O'Day did.  All her cases from the 1990s have to be externally reviewed - she lied about colleagues as her way of getting ahead.  Since Medical School she's done this - which is why she's not on staff at University Hospitals of Cleveland.  But she's gone after the physicians that she couldn't go after in Medical School while on the Medical Board.But the naivete of Governor Kasich is astounding.  The false cases continue, there are stack of physicians without licenses for no real reason except that they disagreed with someone powerful, and the mess is getting bigger every day.  ",Doctors

										Governor Kasich has done nothing to improve the State Medical Board mess in Columbus, and the taking of women MD licenses to let the statute of limitations on the bad medical, or orthopedic, care done to them by the 'boys' expire - Mr. Whitehouse's words - the current Executive Director of the State Medical Board.  And no one in the Governor's office in Ohio seems to be able to get Mr. Whitehouse on the phone - he and the Governor don't discuss.  Dr. Carla O'Day - who started the mess in one case - was asked to call the Mayo Clinic & she refused - she knew better and had wanted the woman classmate punished for just being who she was - she studied and went to classes in Medical School at CWRU - and Carla didn't.  Carla O'Day MD skipped so much class, and went to the Health Sciences Library so rarely, that it's still a record for the librarians at least.  And class materials would often be only on file in the library.  That's the kind that get appointed to the State Medical Board of Ohio - the woman megastars.The Ohio State Medical Board wants the women MDs to sign that they cause their male colleagues to make the mistakes - when they tried to talk to the boys, send them notes, asked them to call the consultants, and got the parents to talk to them about the family history.  Nothing works because the Ohio State Medical Board does not mandate that the men MDs refer, consult, discuss, and send their medical records on patients or MD-patients -- they simply don't have to.  And there are no medical mistake laws in Ohio, so the legislators for the most part don't know how this concept works in 40-plus other states.  Ask Senator Eklund from the Cleveland area - he doesn't google - his staff probably knows, but not him. When a woman MD objects to the wrong care, instead of mandating discussion, family history & blood work - the men go into defensive mode and start a countercomplaint on the license of the woman MD.  This is facilitated by the 'confidential' complaint system - where the guys have a drinking party and do a complaint - which the State Medical Board of fools takes absolutely seriously without considering the context of what is going on - it's a frat party kind of thing.  The Medical Board will then meet down the street from Riffe Center after dinner and drinks, and it's all over for the woman MD.Things are done in Cleveland, or Dayton, where the cow country folk in Columbus haven't a clue about the local politics & dislikes of metropolitan Cleveland or Dayton/Toledo - things that play into a physician not getting care when they are injured or have a thyroid problem.  And women MDs are the only ones that get the thyroid problems with stress; thyroid problems occur like 90%-plus of the time in women only.  And in Medical School, when there is any lecture on diseases that occur mostly in women, the boys are on the tennis, basketball, or other courts - or playing pool on all the pool tables that medical schools provide.  Medical schools provide for all the male sports - as they know the boys will require amusement and distraction - guys can't just go to class.One woman MD, who has had her Ohio license taken for the last 19 years, had a woman cousin with the same problem who lived in another state - a lawyer.  This woman lawyer got the problem diagnosed, and the accompanying weak bone condition treated in 18 months, and never lost her law license (years ago now) - and the lawyer wasn't considered 'impaired' when she had to ask tough questions of her MDs - AMAZING!  Medical care can work, but not in Ohio with the kind of dufuses licensed in Ohio - IQ of <100.  This woman lawyer was never psychiatrically evaluated that she had to disagree - normal for lawyers - and insist on the right blood work, and casting care.  Fractures take longer to heal with this condition - and the orthopedics have to be at a tertiary center where they can get consultations.  Her counterpart in Ohio has been evaluated five times, and the Medical Board wants another 'go' to get it right with a forensic psychiatrist that knows people like Jeffrey Dahmer - to find something that a new right Ohio psychiatrist can treat - after 20 years of trying.  This kind of psychiatrist will for sure screw up everything seeing things from the perspective of an expert on serial killers.  That's not appropriate, anymore than local orthopedics trying to care for metabolic fractures in Ohio - the problem is called triage.  Because the woman MD's physicians in Ohio couldn't place a phone call to the physicians treating her cousin - the bone condition in the Ohio MD remains untreated - after 19 years and piles of documentation as to what it is - documentation sent to Members of the State Medical Board including Anita Steinbergh DO.  Dr. Licata at Cleveland Clinic won't treat until the license is returned - you need money and credibility to pay for the care - and the misunderstandings cleared up - he doesn't want to lose his medical license for having to try to educate the Ohio State Medical Board, he can't start therapy and be ordered to stop.  And the last appointees of Governor Kasich will need a lot of education about anything medical.  ",Doctors

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614) 466-3555,"Governor John Kasich  has continued the policy of making medical licensure be about the woman MDs agreement with Ohio medical care practices as relating to her own medical care ie that she go along with what the boys want  Columbus, Ohio","
										Medical licensure in Ohio should not be about what the woman physician chooses for her own medical care, or if she has to disagree about what she feels from her training is sloppy medical, gyn or orthopedic practices that she doesn't want for herself - but that's what Governor Kasich has continued.  And Ohio care is sloppy for women patients.  The Medical Board of Ohio admittedly 'cheats' on physician discipline cases and licensure suspensions - by not having the facts, the criteria, or allowing the legal due process.  There's a lot of drinking at the Ohio State Medical Board in Columbus - down the street from 77 South High Street, and in the Medical Board's own expensive building - the legislators are all stacked at high rise 77 so that no one will attend Medical Board sessions.Physicians in Ohio, particularly women, are not allowed what is termed 'care-to-function' before their medical licenses are suspended - or even after the suspension until they agree to the Ohio Medical Board's solution & resolutions - suspensions for disagreeing about not getting that care-to-function in Ohio.  Care-to-function means a new right Ohio psychiatrist in Ohio - six times if necessary - while the blood work is continually not allowed or lost.  The lay Members that Governor Kasich has selected wouldn't know malpractice from practice - they have no training in that. Mr. Tom Dilling, and currently Mr. Rick Whitehouse - the last two Executive Directors of the Ohio State Medical Board - do not believe that women MDs need blood work.  Mr. Dilling told me that on the phone in 2005 before he was removed for threatening physicians on the phone to 'admit the case' or face the consequences.  The physician's colleague 'competition' on the Medical Board - the Members - don't want you to get any blood work before they act to take your license in a drunken emergency session based on the fact that you had to disagree with them.  The case is fixed - and there's a stack of these fixed cases at the present time - the legislators admit it and the lawyers can't do anything about the Ohio Medical Board.  It took one woman physician about ten years to get thyroid function testing - the cause of her bone pains (not allowed before her license was suspended for making too much of bad care) - and the blood work had to be done at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington DC after another fracture.  And Governor Kasich wants to rule Washington DC - tell them how Ohio does it?  It's not uncommon for a woman physician in Ohio, to have her license suspended for 'provisional' confidential whatever - and then be refused ob-gyn care, blood work, treatment of bone conditions, etc., for years.  No one cares that it was unjust or wrong, the other physicians just don't want the appearance of having to disagree with the arbitrary Ohio State Medical Board so they go along; they all agree with the State Medical Board - even the Cleveland Clinic physicians - no matter how stupid.  Care is withheld until a confession is signed; until the woman physician admits the Board's case no matter there's not a shred of truth to it.And after your medical license is suspended for 'confidential,' you can't get a decent job with medical insurance as no one knows what this 'confidential' is or means.  This is post-9/11, and there has to be disclosure - but not in Ohio.  At the Ohio State Medical Board, you have to agree to what the Medical Board wants you to have in Ohio - which isn't anything 'medical' - before you get 'care' for anything - and then it won't be for what you have.  When you sign the papers to get your license back, you will have to agree to treatment for what the Medical Board wants you to have - so that they won't be seen to have made a mistake.  And even the best of physicians make mistakes about 15% of the time - it's a fact.  And the Medical Board is not composed of the best of physicians in Ohio - the Ohio Members have Internet rates of not getting the right diagnosis about 25% of the time on patient feedback ratings - and the lay Members don't know medical from real estate terms.  This taking of a medical license, for disagreeing about the wrong medical care, happens only in Ohio - where the physician's agreement with Ohio practices & mistakes is the litmus test for licensure.  You have to change your story that the mistake never happened, like in Once Upon A Time in Storybrooke, and then you can't get care to 'fix' the mistakes.  Mistakes in medical care mean that someone has to recognize the problem, and provide care to modify the mistake - someone has to admit that the care was less than perfect and the result 'unanticipated' - however you want to phrase it.  Ohio is particularly bad about women's medical care; thyroid disease is missed all the time, fractures are left to ripen to excrescence so that the male orthopedic physician can try to get an unnecessary surgery.  It costs several thousand to cast a fracture, tens of thousands if you do an open reduction or plate - and the hospitals want those open reductions, plates, & pins.  So the orthopedics try to manufacture them.  Medical licensure should be about the physician's care of patients - not the autonomous choices that the physician makes about his/her own medical care depending on family history and training.  Medical practices, and training, differ depending on the states - what the physician has experienced differs, ie what they know about complications of certain care choices and certain physician's stats.  Physicians should have the right to choose the best care for themselves, regardless of what state the expert resides in, or what the 'friend' physician of the Ohio Board Members wants to do to the woman physician under the guise of care.  Yes, medical care is withheld in Ohio until the woman physician agrees to what the Medical Board wants - and even then it is withheld.  The Ohio Medical Board is a cottage industry looking to keep up high rates of impaired physicians - it manufactures them in Ohio by withholding normal medical care and making a personality problem of the woman physician who has to disagree - an orthopedic casting problem hence becomes a psychiatric problem - which is unethical in every other state except Ohio.  No woman MD wants to disagree with her colleagues - it's a no-win situation.  So the medical care of a woman physician, the choices that she makes for herself, should not be an issue at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Few patients, and few physicians, agree with Dr. Nice orthopedic care most of the time - the standard in Ohio at the State Medical Board.  The woman physician in question could not refer more patients to Dr. Nice as she was requested to di as a condition of re-licensure - because the patients refused to go - but Anita Steinbergh DO refused to accept that.  Certain physicians are supposed to be referred to for licensure in Ohio - which is illegal.  But no legislator goes to the Board meetings. . .  Women physicians get their medical licenses suspended in Ohio - for decades - for making too much of admittedly bad care; care that the woman physician can't go along with for herself.  Care that her patients wouldn't tolerate for 5 minutes is care that the woman physician is supposed to say nothing about.  That a woman physician should consent to treatment is also not always allowed - she gets what the boys & girls want to do to her in Ohio - regardless of consent laws.  Medical licensure, under Governor John Kasich, is contingent upon agreeing with the 'boys' in Ohio - the new 'right' Ohio orthopedics, psychiatrists, endocrinologists, obstetricians and gynecologists.  No blood work is allowed women MDs before their licenses are pulled for symptoms such as chronic fatigue, bone pains & fractures - whereas 'care-to-function' is allowed physicians in every other state before any consideration of an impairment.  An impairment in Ohio is currently objecting to the 'care-to-function' that every physician needs.  And this is not care that any Ohio legislator's spouse, or partner (gay or straight), has to tolerate.  Mrs. Matt Lynch (Representative Matt Lynch) gets her blood work.   									",Doctors

										When the State Medical Board of Ohio acts 'provisionally' on a false complaint about a physician - or wants to manage the physician's medical care by saying what diagnosis they have - then mistakes are made & no procedures to dismiss a false physician complaint exist in Ohio.  
In other states, there is a time frame for dismissal - before 20 years - and the physicians are awarded at least minimal damages for the wasting of whatever 'time' out of their careers - awarded re-education & licensure fees if nothing else.  You can't not have a case to take a physician's license in every other state.  Even Texas has reformed their 'confidential' physician complaint system as of last Fall - and better reforms are on the horizon there - the lawyers at least blog about the problem.  In Ohio there is a stack of cases, where when you call the Medical Board, they are 'still looking for a case.'  And Richard Whitehouse's staff admits this at times - Eileen.  But mostly no one answers the phone, but they keep up their social media sites - check out Richard Whitehouse JD. 
In Ohio, reforms at the State Medical Board of Ohio have been admittedly needed for 20 years - 48 states have gotten rid of 'confidential' physician complaints entirely - Rhode Island State Medical Board won't accept a 'confidential' complaint to even be read (returned to sender) - as they can't check out the 'confidential' or shoulder the liability of destroying a physician's career.  You have to have a checkable signature on your complaint in Rhode Island - no John or Jane Does.
Most states admit freely that 'confidential' physician complaints are used by colleagues, former employers, and ex-spouses/partners, to get at money or destroy the competition - the complaints have nothing to do with the physician's patient care.  But that's the kind of complaint that Ohio likes - going at the personalities of women physicians & their dating lives - do they have enough experience with men?  Hours are wasted in Columbus discussing this nonsense - that the women don't like colleagues who have certain personal habits ie they hit on women or do sexually-laced comments during professional times.  Ohio has 20 years of that liability - acting on medical licenses before they had a case - or checked out the case.  The Ohio State Court of Appeals tries to throw out these cases, but they can't get the files to hear the cases - no evidence.  And Governor Kasich won't answer his phone on this situation - he doesn't talk to physicians.  Governor Kasich's last appointments to the State Medical Board of Ohio - his lay appointments - couldn't figure any medical from business management.  Lay appointees can be academics (Mathematics or Epidemiology PhDs), RNs who have been legislators or are JDs, former hospital administrators; they can be appointees with some medical 'connection' or knowledge - and should be.    
Currently Governor Kasich won't answer his phone about this.  Brad Reynolds - his go-to man - is not available - and medical anything is not Brad's forte.  Richard Whitehouse hasn't answered his phone since 2005 about this situation.  And the legislators - while they admit the stack of false cases against physicians incurred with the 'confidential' system of complaints - don't want to bankrupt Columbus with justified suits.  
This has been admitted by Speakers Householder & Budish - that the problem exists & that only a limited opening of these cases can be done - but no limited opening and 'clearance' is available under the present Rules.  Present Rules dictate that the Medical Board can deem an 'impairment' simply a physician objecting to the wrong care of themselves - which is going to happen as medical care is done these days.  So how are physicians supposed to object to the wrong care of another patient?  And that's what physicians are trained to do - there are huge numbers of medical mistakes daily in Ohio.  But the State Medical Board of Ohio, and Governor Kasich, won't admit the problem.  
Someone needs to pick up their phones in Columbus.  New legislators - Senator John Eklund & Representative Matt Lynch - you have an golden opportunity to craft new legislation that will protect physicians & patients - and cancer patients have many mistakes made in their diagnosis and care.  The problem in Ohio - a physician can't admit mistakes in Ohio, document, and refer, transfer or consult without penalty - as in 40-some other states.  
Harvard Partners publishes HARVARD mistakes & how they handle them - some in the New England Journal - and the patients at least have a chance at something other than inappropriate & unethical psychiatric consolation or a mess of lies.  Lies don't improve health care, and false cases against innocent women physicians - who are always blamed by the men - are ruining the careers of many women physicians in Ohio.  How many well-trained women MDs have 'retired early' in Ohio?  No stats.  Governor Kasich needs to call home from Meet the Press, and Meet the Press needs to ask the right questions.     ",Doctors

										Governor Kasich is continuing a horrible practice of past Governors of Ohio - in taking women MD licenses if they object to the wrong care being done to themselves, or other patients.  This is a ghastly & unethical practice, to find 'bad MDs' that have done nothing wrong in the traditional sense - and punish them for statistics.  Notches on the belt of Mr. Rick Whitehouse - an abusive practice done most notably to women MDs.  Governor Kasich's 'job' and 'employment' statistics are probably equally as 'fudged,' misleading, and temporary - just jobs in February 2012 - nothing that stands up beyond a month's time - just in time for Meet the Press.These physicians just 'made too much' of the admittedly bad medical, surgical, ob-gyn, and orthopedic care passing for 'medical care' in Ohio.  It's not about the 'pills mills' - that was a 'red herring' - the real story at the State Medical Board of Ohio is the 'confidential' physician files with no 'case in them - used as excuses to start endless cases with no merit.  The budget that Governor Kasich allots to the State Medical Board has no review, no limit, and no justification - the State Medical Board of Ohio is an autonomous, arbitrary Board with no funds restricted & occupies another expensive building in Columbus down the street from 77 South High Street.  All these false cases took up too much room at 77 South High Street.  Bringing in women MDs that did nothing wrong to patients takes a lot of money & time - a whole village of opportunists.The Ohio Medical Board admits the care was bad, and the Ohio Court of Appeals tries to throw these false physician-physician disagreement cases out, but the Ohio Medical Board always wants another another 'go' at these physicians.  There's no statute of limitations, no procedural policies to 'undo' false cases & compensate - as in most other states where the State Medical Board has to act responsibly. The 'confidential' physician complaint in Ohio can be changed for 20 years to try to 'find a case' against a physician - and the Medical Board admits that they can change files, cheat on psychiatric tests, invent/fabricate or manufacture a diagnosis that doesn't exist that the woman MD is then supposed to get 'treatment' for by a new right Ohio psychiatrist.  20 years of these physician careers are then gone to politics, and they can't get their license back without signing a confession that the Medical Board 'bulks' with all kinds of things that the physician doesn't have, can't do, and never did - these documents are about 99% lies, conditions that no one can comply with, and it takes a lot of money and legal time to write them. In Ohio you can't find an orthopedic that can cast for 3 weeks, but they can find endless emergency psychiatrists to work for the Medical Board - forensic psychiatrists that want a $5,000 down payment by the weekend - Dr. Philip Resnick for one.  He'll do a tenth psychiatric evaluation on a women MD for the Medical Board - for no reason - just for his own career and the money. So Ohio has the most false suspensions of medical licenses of all the 50 states, with 'confidential' reasons given - nothing to do with patient care or the physician passing her Boards.  The women that Governor Kasich is going after passed their Boards on the first try - but they were not black, not LGBT, and not immorally 'easy' enough to sleep around to get a license or hospital appointment and keep it.  Then - what's worse - he oks that their medical care be withheld until the woman MD admits the Board's case - and this involves falsifying medical records, public records, and facts to protect 'friend' physicians of Governor Kasich, his Administration, and the Ohio physicians who have 'friends' on the State Medical Board.  The Medical Board appointees are not representative of Ohio physicians - two recent lay appointees were just big donators to Governor Kasich's campaign.  To get on the 'prestigious' Board of Medicine in Ohio - you need money.  Governor Kasich seems to be totally unethical, totally cruel, and not adequate to the job or the problems - just another talking head with no common sense.  The worst lawyers have jobs at the State Medical Board - or they'd have a job at a good firm.  Dregs of psychiatrists keep company with the bottom-feeder lawyers, and it makes for a mess.",Doctors

										I am upset, back in April 2007, I went to see Dr. Benjamin Venger a the Western Regional Center for Brain & Spinal Surgery. My back had excruciating pain & I had an MRI film with me to show broken vertebrae touching my spinal nerve causing numbness & pain to lower extremities. He sent me to the ER at Sunrise Hospital & I was given an IV with pain meds. I was admitted for spinal surgery & it was to be done that night at 7:30pm.  
I was admitted into a room, and the nurses admitted me for surgery.  My husband was eating food next to me, & placed his McDonalds bag on the bedside table. The doctors PA & hospital nurse walked into the room & saw the McDonalds bag & called Dr. Venger who then cancelled my surgery for that night because they said I had just eaten a meal, when in fact I hadn't. Dr. Venger later came into my room, mad as hell because he was told I ate food right before surgery.  I was mad & called the nursing supervisor to report the nurse.  So the doctor rescheduled the surgery for the next night.  He said he had to fly to AZ to treat his patients down there & would fly back, but he had to do it all in a rush and blamed it on ME.
The next night, Dr. Venger, came into the OR bitching about how I messed up his day. He then did a spinal fusion on my lower back & I was taken to a room afterwards. After a day or two I was sent home. A week later the pain was worse than before surgery & it was excruciating.  I went back to see Dr. Venger & he refused to see me, and his PA told me to live with the pain.  NO this really felt like something was wrong. A month later the pain was so bad, I couldn't move, or go to the bathroom without excruciating pain. Dr. Venger made an appointment for me to see him & after an MRI before the visit, he tells me the fusion came apart & the vertebrae was pinging on the spinal nerve & I needed emergency surgery. He was leaving for Paris, France & was sorry he couldn't fix it. I waited a month to be seen by him & not his PA who kept telling me nothing was the matter with me!  
So Dr. Venger then asked his partner, Dr. Michael Smith if he would redo the surgery. So Dr. Smith sent me to University Medical Center, Las Vegas, where he was on-call that night & called ahead to the ER to tell them to admit me for surgery.  Surgery was done the next day. But wasn't done right again. 
I had to keep going to the Wound clinic because the sutures petrified in my rectum & had to keep having them removed.  It also felt like one of the rods was coming thru my rectum. When I kept complaining to the PA in wound clinic about the severe pain in my back again, she kept telling me there was nothing the matter with me.
A month later Dr. Smith refused to see me because my insurance expired & without insurance he wouldn't see me.  He wanted me to be on a trial program with the titanium company. I never got any literature from them, nor was ever allowed to be seen by Dr. Smith again, even when complaining of severe pain. The PA kept telling me to live with the pain.
So I went back to work. My left lower extremity kept going numb & there was pain all of the time down to my toes & my feet.  Now on my new agency job I received health care, but all doctors would do is to prescribe pain meds, no treatments of any kind to the point of having to wait until 2009 to be seen by a Kaiser doctor who had to redo the whole spinal laminectomy again in July 2010. He told us that all of the metal from the previous surgery had collapsed & now I am stuck with permanent nerve damage as their is a metal screw attached to my spinal nerve from the previous surgery.  
I had contacted Dr. Smith by mail many times, but received no answers to my letters. 
Dr. Andrew Slucky of Oakland Kaiser wrote in his notes that I have permanent nerve damage cause by the previous surgery.
I had contacted every personal injury attorney in Las Vegas & local areas to file a claim against Dr. Smith, but no attorney would take my case. No one wants to go up against this medical practice.
Dr. Benjamin Venger lost his medical license between 2007 & now for fraud.
I'd like something to be done. I'm now permanently disabled as I went for 3 years without the proper treatment.  I worked a steady case management travel nursing job while in pain. I never knew I could do that, but when I kept falling down on the job, that was the last straw.  My left leg kept going numb & I kept falling down on the job.

										Governor Kasich would rather 'kill' someone with medical neglect and wrong care/diagnosis - fabricate a personality problem (and politicians have the 'disagree' personality disease in spades - not the trait) - than admit that the Ohio Medical Board made a mistake in taking the license of a woman MD for objecting to the wrong care of herself - admittedly wrong care of 'boys being boys.'  And actually it's not a DSM diagnosis to disagree with the wrong medical/orthopedic care of yourself - the insurance companies won't pay for that care.  But you can't tell Mr. Whitehouse this - he doesn't answer his cell phone (current Executive Director of the State Medical Board of taking physician licenses for objecting to wrong care - they actually tell you this in Columbus - calling it 'making too much').The irony was/is that the Medical Board admits that the 'boys were being boys,' and that the care had complications for over a year - serious ones that this woman's parents & family were supposed to pay for - but that the woman MD 'handled it wrong' by reporting it - she was just supposed to play along with the boys.  But boys are supposed to grown up, even Governors; boy-toys are out except if you are JLo and can pay for the toy.  And about 40-some states have medical mistake laws that tell physicians just how to handle the medical mistakes that happen, so that they can't be accused of this rot, but Ohio has yet to admit the problem of medical mistakes (the boys) - everyone just lies along with the general psychosis.  The roads are good, but the thinking is a mess in Ohio. Boys being boys is allowed in Ohio, from the Governor on down; John, Brad, Rick and the boys.  The joke in Columbus is that the women there 'take their daily testosterone' - that's a guy legislative joke, but it's pretty accurate - it's all boys in Columbus.  But just not letting the woman MD get the correct treatment - for 19 years - keeping her fracturing bones (not preggers just in casts & splints) - and not allowing her to move to a state where the boys are supposed to be men and responsible professionals - is just plain stupid - a waste.  The cost to the Ohio taxpayer: each false case at the State Medical Board costs the taxpayers of Ohio somewheres over $500,000.  But then Governor Kasich's choices on the State Medical Board of Ohio couldn't figure out a medical mistake if you tutored them, and they don't do accounting, don't do ethics, and they don't do medicine - they are talking heads on a prestigious Board that is just show and no substance.  Anita Steinbergh DO can't discuss medical anything - she tells you outright to just lie to get your license back - but what lie will work? - and that she's not responsible for anything (for the last 20 years).    But killing someone who never hurt you, or who really can't sue the State of Ohio if she wants a moment's peace for what's left of her life - that's just cruel, cold-hearted insanity - of the type that was responsible for the 'solutions' of WWII - for the women that Hitler hated.  It doesn't make any sense.  But there's apparently a stack of false physician cases - admitted by Tom Dilling in 1998-9 and yet unresolved - for everything from not referring to the 'right' physician, to objecting to rather obvious suable neglectful medical care - all of which Governor Kasich has no time for between 'takes' for Meet the Press.  Well, it's starting to shape-up that Ohioans would like to suggest that Governor Kasich would just get a job on Meet the Press - he's not really into being a Governor - just a celebrity.  He's another photo-op on the job.    But what did these falsely charged and punished physicians ever do to him to deserve this awful treatment?  It's not their patient care or their drug or alcohol use, they admittedly practiced above average for the State of Ohio = that was the problem = they had to be taken out of the equation of patient care because complications are money.  Bad care is profitable. The State Medical Board of Ohio still acts on the antediluvian 'confidential' complaint system - and 'confidential' by its definition can't be checked, verified or have the 'confidential' person held responsible or expose their conflicts-of-interest.  It's like the French Revolution, with colleagues ratting on colleagues to get them out of business - they pass the tests too well - nothing really to do with royalty; getting rid of heads was the object.  Hitler kept control over his advisors by having them taken out, one by one, by 'confidential' accusations.  Didn't like what someone told him, they were 'confidentially' accused of something where they had to resign.    The 'confidential' physician complaint system - which only Texas and Ohio still have - is a complete cop-out of completely stupid men - who can't prove cases, or get cases because the negligent physicians are their friends.  Well, then make medical mistake laws, and allow the mistakes without penalty - that's what Ohio male physicians want - but mandate referral and some improvement in the number of mistakes.  But no - that's too difficult for the legislators and the Governor to wrap their brains around - no one has any higher thinking or common sense in Ohio.  In Columbus, as at the Cleveland Clinic ORs, the help has admittedly got a 'touch' of Alzheimer's disease - and patients & physicians are just supposed to 'understand' the bad care & the mistakes.  But killing someone for this folly?  Even Texas has had to reform their confidential physician complaint system, and the lawyers in Texas acknowledge the problems and the tremendous waste of this system.  If patients have a real complaint, having the investigation 'confidential' won't improve the care problems - or help get a money settlement.  Whoever 'sold' patients on this nonsensical illogical point was not thinking for the patient; the Medical Board can never be sued for wrongful cases where everything is/was 'confidential - that's logical.  The system was a way to get the Medical Board of Ohio out of any liability for wrongful suspensions of medical licenses - it wasn't for any patient or to improve any care paradigms.  The Ohio State Medical Board is completely, as is Governor Kasich, self-serving.  Killing someone by mandating that they not receive care for a bone condition - because the Medical Board 'missed' it because they didn't allow consultation, a workup or any blood work that came back in Ohio - well that's just a Governor who hates women = misogynist in the DSM parlance.  And that woman MD had a Fellowship to St. Louis University in Bone Metabolism that was nixed years ago - where the bone condition would have been treated as part of the job so that other patients could benefit by whatever happened to her with the treatment.  She had a rare - still does - familial problem where no physician doing reasonable care would be sued for missing things - but the care wasn't even reasonable - it didn't exist except in fantasy.  So this opportunity was nixed, not because she did anything wrong, but because the Board Members were jealous of her achievements and smarts.  Governor Kasich wants only the stupidest on the State Medical Board, the biggest campaign contributors, and not for women to achieve, disagree and improve standards.  It's like Hitler's view of women all over again; that they should remain in the home or be taken out.  Ohio is The House of Dolls as in the book by that name.Just a no-brainer:  Brad Reynolds understands nothing about (1) how the Medical Board of Ohio operates; (2) women's medical care, or (3) what's going on at the State Medical Board of fraud and folly - where nothing is about patient care.  Call home Governor Kasich.

										The State Medical Board of Ohio makes mistakes, and takes medical licenses - particularly of women MDs - when the mistakes threaten 'friend' physicians of Members of the State Medical Board.  Medical licensure is not about patient care in Ohio.  There are no medical mistake laws in Ohio, nor provisions for the State Medical Board making a wrong decision on a provisional accusation that doesn't materialize as being true.  There's no procedural policy to undo bad Medical Board decisions.  And the physician complaints are 'confidential' - if you don't have friends to get you the complaint.  And the license is taken before any investigation, and no witnesses can come forward as no one knows what the case is about - it wasn't about her patient care, CME, etc.  Many cases have nothing to do with patient care.In Ohio, the falsely accused physician either admits the Medical Board's case, or never gets their license back; there is no due process at the State Medical Board of Ohio - they acknowledge this openly.  And the Board is never wrong.  Meanwhile, the medical care of that physician is withheld to try to get a 'confession' - other physicians are told that they will be penalized if they care for the suspended physician - until she admits the Board's case.  You have to go out-of-state to get blood work, or ob-gyn care, and you are shunned literally.And it depends on what the case is - the case that the Board wants - as to what a physician can admit.  When the Medical Board wants an admission in Ohio, they blame the woman physician for everything - her personality, the male MDs being aroused thinking something 'seductive' that is just swollen to excrescence (a wrist?), the male MDs inability to cast a 'simple' fracture, etc. - it's all a witch hunt.  The woman physician's lawyers are called and threatened almost hourly - what the state will do unless the lawyer admits the case.  The last Executive Director of the State Medical Board of Ohio - Tom Dilling - did so much of this phone threatening, that even Governor Taft finally had to get rid of him.  Now Mr. Whitehouse either threatens through another person, or refuses to answer his phone - just updates his social media sites on state salary and time - you can't get him on the phone.Governor John Kasich has continued this farce, and the threats.  The 'confidential' complaint against the physician can be changed 'confidentially' for 20 years if necessary - killing the physician with the neglect of his/her medical care, and reducing the medical career of the physician to a national farce & waste - a career of an MD who went to Medical School in Ohio - her training & education subsidized by Ohio taxpayers.  You have to admit to have what the Medical Board wants you to have - even if you have no criteria and the tests are fudged or the diagnosis doesn't exist - and your medical insurance won't pay for this of course.There is at least one case like this currently before the State Medical Board of Ohio - where the woman MD has had to continue to fracture because her bone condition was thought to be an exaggeration - an exaggeration to protect the physicians that missed the diagnosis causing the fractures.  No Ohio physician will treat the condition - so the woman MD continues to fracture unless she admits that it is all her personality - which she can't.   Fractures are not psychiatric, but the State Medical Board of Ohio is still trying to find a case, and prove this wrong assessment, after almost 20 years.The Members of the State Medical Board of Ohio do not allow blood work, consultation or proper casting of fractures on women MDs.  They don't know what thyroid function tests are.  And if the women MD complains - about her own care - then her license is taken for 'making too much.'  And Governor Kasich goes along with this even when the woman MD calls his office from Johns Hopkins after she fractures another bone - it's just a joke in Ohio.  Just a joke for the guy who is completely out-of-touch with reality despite occasionally visiting Bob Evans if he needs to impress for a few votes.  And, of course. Governor Kasich doesn't get on the phone to talk to the Johns Hopkin's senior Staff orthopedic physician who saw the fracture in real-time.  It's all just a dream, from which the State of Ohio never wakes up - part of a Taylor Swift song about bullying. . .The Ohio State Medical Board meanwhile, continues to put out that the woman MD's fractures are just 'psychiatric' - needing a new right Ohio psychiatrist.  For twenty years - it's all psychiatric because the State Medical Board of Ohio made a mistake for a 'friend' physician - to cover his liability and the liability of a Board Member involved - her ER mistreated one of the fractures - no x-ray, no cast padding, and no fracture reduction.  This woman MD skipped those parts of Medical School at CWRU = Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine (a University in Ohio that allows unlimited skipping of classes at the Medical School level - where you can refuse to come for almost a whole year and still 'pass' if you 'pass' the tests).     This woman MD has survived 5 evaluations, a faked Rorschach - admitted 'fake', a diagnosis that doesn't exist anywhere except at the State Medical Board of Ohio, a drunken 'emergency' Board session, and a Court of Appeals decision throwing out the case that the State Medical Board then reinstated because they can't be wrong - the woman has survived - barely.  This is an insane situation of a state agency making a mistake and trying to 'kill' the mistake - based on 'confidential.'  Governor Kasich is looking the other way as he wants to be in Washington, DC and run the country - perpetually on Meet the Press.  And no one wants government this corrupt, or this detached.This woman, and probably an unknown number of other falsely accused MDs in Ohio, will die if the neglect & mistreatment of her medical condition continues.  Governor Kasich's office is aware and hoping she dies - they hang up saying that the Governor can't be bothered - that it's Brad Reynold's responsibility - and he has stopped answering his phone.  Meet the Press, meet the Governor - who hasn't got a shred of ethics, common sense or compassion - he just has to be 'right.'  NFL concussions are one thing, but leaving women MDs to die of fracturing is even worse - we now admit that NFL concussions are a bad thing, whereas Governor Kasich thinks torturing a woman MD for a confession is still good policy.  ",Doctors

										If the State of Ohio Medical Board is any measuring stick, then Governor Kasich is running Ohio as no one would allow him to run anything in Washington, DC.  Ohio has the worst of systems of physician complaint and review, where false physician discipline cases are the rule to the point that there currently exists a stack of known false cases that the state is probably liable for in some amount.  So threatening is the liability to the State of Ohio that no legislator will permit a full review of any of the cases to date (only partial review where everything will be 'fixed' - that was the Budish solution).  Hence the physician careers are gone forever, for nothing more than a physician trying to get appropriate medical care for themselves and having to disagree with out-of-date Ohio medical practices.  And Governor Kasich promised to reform the bad practices and the State Medical Board.  Senator Eklund - district 98 - would rather craft a bill to let Mexicans drive without a license in Ohio.There needs to be an outside 'external' review of all the false physician disciplines & suspensions at the State Medical Board of Ohio over the last 20 years - even if there is no possibility of the state ever paying damages - at least lives will be saved - of patients and physicians.  But a law has to be passed for this review - and that the State of Ohio would not be liable - so that the State can proceed with a review.  But Senator Eklund, and Senator Grendell before him, can't write that bill for some reason - they don't know about medical mistake laws.  Ohio is one of maybe 5 states that have no medical mistake laws - again Governor Kasich is a bit out-of-date even though a 'darling' of Meet the Press.There's no statute of limitations for new evidence that was the 'case' to begin with at the State Medical Board of Ohio; confidential complaint systems allow physician licenses to be taken with no case except 'confidential' - a confidential that can be changed many times as the state tries to 'find' a case.  Suicides might be averted if nothing else.  Many of these 'disciplines' are for nothing more than not referring to the 'right' physicians, not agreeing with bad medical & orthopedic care practices, and reporting the bad care - which is making 'too much of bad medical care.'  In other states, medical mistake laws mandate such reporting.  But Ohio isn't like any other state - even Texas has had to reform their controversial confidential physician complaint system.  And the lawyers in Texas blog quite openly about the problems - unlike the wimps in Ohio. If colleague physicians complained falsely about a physician, relying on the 'confidential' excuse, and the non-checking of the State Medical Board, then those colleagues need to be penalized - pay damages to the state for not even speaking with the physician that they falsely accused.  It's not patient-physician communication that is the problem in Ohio, it's physician-physician communication and medical mistakes.  You can't reward colleagues that would take a physician out of practice during an easily treatable illness or recovery - by saying that they don't 'deserve' care - or suspend a woman physician's license during pregnancy or a fracture illness from a neglected endocrine problem ie the guys don't know how to order thyroid function tests in Ohio - either at University Hospitals in Cleveland or The Cleveland Clinic.  Withholding blood work, casts, doing unnecessary procedures etc - is the rule of physicians caring for physicians in Ohio.  Disable your colleague is the mantra as in the concussion saga of the NFL.  Governor Kasich - with no graduate degrees - has no concept of the value or sacrifices that go into graduate professional education.  He should not be ok'ing the 'taking out' of women physicians who didn't sleep with Dr. Nice, or agree to University Hospitals Endocrinology physicians not doing any thyroid blood work.  And he shouldn't be appointing Medical Board Members who know nothing about medicine for campaign contributions.",Doctors

										In the state of Ohio - where there are no medical mistake laws, and no reforms at the State Medical Board so that physician complaints are still 'confidential' from lawyers, experts & the woman MD accused (of what she doesn't know) - women MDs are being 'sold' to the State Medical Board for statistics.  While foreign women MDs, and black women MDs are given 'spots' on the State Medical Board, white women MDs are trafficked for the needed 'bad MD' statistics.  The Medical Board has to have something to do, and can't go after their male friend MDs, so in the land of 'confidential,' women MDs are the commodity to be suspended - without patient complaints of course - just make up some psychiatric diagnosis that doesn't exist or fudge a Rorschach.And Governor Kasich does know that this goes on, and is also 'looking the other way,' when even Texas had to recently reform their 'confidential' physician complaint system.  The woman Board President in Texas, as goes on in Ohio, was having her husband submit complaints on her professional physician competition - she couldn't get patients the 'fair' way by being a good medical practitioner.  Ditto is going on at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  And Governor Kasich has sold out every just about every Ohio government appointment except the US Senate. State Senator Teresa Fedor has no idea of the trafficking in women MDs in Ohio: we are sold to the Medical Board for stats and then sold back to the male MD that we refused to 'service' for re-licensure purposes; euphemistically the woman MD has to work with that personally needy male.  And Ohio male physicians with 'wandering eyes' are always 5'6"" short, balding, smelling of Polo cologne, and with a gut - hardly sexually attractive to any woman let alone a woman MD with a brain.  And this is human trafficking as it gets into the personals - a peculiar Ohio kind of MD woman trafficking.  The Ohio Medical Board makes fun of sexual harassment and doesn't deal with it - the woman MD was asking for it per Mr. 'Dick' Whitehouse - who has the wrong things on the brain instead of patient care.  He spends his time updating his social media sites, and the lawyers can never get him on the phone.  And no one stops to think that the guy MD isn't even attractive to his wife who married him to be a Mrs. Doctor (Dr. and Mrs.).After being accused - but not of patient care communication problems - women MDs at the State Medical Board in Columbus are then ordered to multiple new 'right' Ohio psychiatrist evaluations = 5 or more 'goes' to find a case - with explicit and exhausting detail on their dating or sex lives, at state expense - over and over again that they had enough 'experience' with the male sex to endure horrible innuendo and comments in professional situations - comments & innuendo that the women MDs are expected to handle with 'aequanimitas.'  For one woman MD, because they haven't 'found' a case yet, it's been 19 years of discussing her non-existent dating life - who she dated in college - every guy - because she didn't 'like' Dr. Nice who left her fractures uncasted for days to weeks, or badly casted with no padding - because he didn't have time to order cast materials.  And the hospital ER (Hillcrest Hospital, Mayfield Heights, Ohio) didn't stock the 'right' materials as the one Ohio Medical Board Member (the Board secretary) was the de facto Director - and she didn't have time to do her day job.  You can get an appointment with a psychiatrist in 3 days in Ohio, but you can't get an orthopedic in 3 weeks.      Aequanimitas is Anita Steinbergh DOs favorite excuse for what women MDs are supposed to just deal with and 'handle better' = abuse = physical, emotional, professional, sexual, and medical abuse.  When the fracture isn't casted, the next guy up the orthopedic ladder gets to try an 'experimental' cast - that leaves the woman MD with a year of orthopedic complications neverbeforeheard of if Ohio only did the usual care of the fracture.  And in the land of no medical mistake laws, the woman MD is supposed to 'get counseling' so that she doesn't mention the medical mistakes anymore - Anita Steinbergh DO doesn't want to hear about it.  But about 40-some other states deal with the medical mistake problem with medical mistake laws; where the 'unanticipated' result is referred in time for things to be fixed - notso in Ohio - where everything is just one big lie because mistakes happen.  Every procedure in medicine is at least as complicated as a calculus III problem - so many mistakes per class or time in the office or OR. Governor Kasich can't mention medical mistake laws either.    State Senator Fedor (Ohio 47th House District) appears to have no idea what is going down - down the street from 77 South High Street in Columbus - and her office does not answer the phone.  It was explained to Senator Eklund - who doesn't 'google' and doesn't know how medical mistake laws work supposedly - so maybe she should check with him.  He's only a Partner in a firm that does health care law in downtown Cleveland. . .And the US Services (ie Army, Navy) are told that the woman  MD had to talk with a psychiatrist - that she couldn't enlist when she tried - to get out of Hillcrest Hospital (that's a stable mental decision).  The escape routes for women MDs are closed early on - even Afghanistan.  Appointments to the State Medical Board are now on a cash-only basis, and cases are all 'confidential' - except if you are a male MD with 'friends' on the State Medical Board, ie Dr. Nice and other male MDs, get their 'confidential' complaint - and it's confidentially thrown out before it is ever investigated.   For the woman MD to get her license back, she is then required to then 'work' with the male physician harassing her for 'understanding' that he couldn't get from his wife.  And a DeWine woman lawyer will say this to the woman MD with a straight face - that the woman MD will need to refer to Dr. Not-so-Nice to get her provisional license back.   And does Meet the Press have any idea about what is going on REALLY in Ohio?Patient care - patient care that the woman did better than 'average' male internist for Ohio - is not the re-licensure agenda - it never was.  And other women can't come forward as they don't know what the case is really about - there are the obvious lies, but no one tells the truth in Columbus, and no one can - there are no medical mistake laws and no mistake laws that apply when the State Medical Board makes mistakes.  And medical care, and Medical Board decisions with 'confidential' materials, are full of mistakes.  It's all like a calculus III problem, and even the professor makes legitimate mistakes explaining things like triple integrals and mass density.  It comes with the territory that mistakes will be a daily problem.  And who ever heard of a 'confidential' psychiatric diagnosis, or 'confidential' physician impairment?    The 'confidential' complaints at the State Medical Board of Ohio never surface in the case of women MDs - did the complaint ever exist as the Ohio Court of Appeals couldn't get it, or find it, as the excuse goes?  Where is the complaint, and what is the case about, is always the question of the lawyers - but the woman MD and her lawyers are supposed to 'admit' some hypothetical case, or the case is 20 years in the finding, but no one knows what is going on.  But Governor Kasich is careful to know about the 'tight as a tick' Presidential election on the horizon, and every other national issue.Women MDs are bought and sold by the hospitals, and male colleagues, and then expected to work and be personal action for the same MDs that reported them to cover the medical mistakes of the males.  No accounting is ever made of who complained, their credentials as to malpractices cases & bad results, and their conflicts-of-interest.  Or what they were really asking the woman MD to do, in a state that until recently didn't admit that human trafficking even existed in Ohio.  Those topless joints in downtown Cleveland than fund Gates Mills mansions with fountains????Meanwhile Governor Kasich has 'sold out' every appointment to the State Medical Board to the highest bidder or campaign contributor - hoping to build a 'war chest' for a run outside of Ohio.  On Meet the Press on April 8th 2012, he was touted for a rise in employment in February, 2012 - when that's his job - and talking about the Presidential campaign - when one of the worst problems in Ohio is the worst Medical Board in the US for false physician disciplines, suspensions, and sanctions - sanctions for saying 'No' to male treatments & surgeries after fractures are left uncasted for weeks.  The US Navy is getting rid of COs that party, but in Ohio, the male physicians are still partying and blaming the women MDs when the patient care is wrong and they were coming off a party bender, ie Dr. Nice's parties are legendary in NE Ohio.  He's known at party centers, not medical supply companies. State Senator Fedor, your looking the other way, is responsible for the trafficking of women MDs at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  While medical licenses are falsely suspended with 'confidential' innuendo of the sexual sort, these women get no decent medical care = what they complained of in the first place.  You can't marry because the classmate that liked you thinks that you were, or will have to be, servicing the male MD who complained about your personality - and you have no criteria for any psychiatric personality diagnosis - you just said 'No.'  The guy medical classmate isn't 'blind' to what you will have to do to get your license back - and it won't be over in 90 days - because it hasn't been over in 19 years. Governor Kasich - Meet the Press should have the guts to question you, and keep questioning you, on the issues and problems in Ohio - you are not running for President yet.",Doctors

										I am a 59 year old male, my wife is 56, back in June our pcp retired, so we were forced to find another doctor,  as my wife is very sick and has about 15 or so prescriptions she has to have, so in august 2011 we went to doctor rao , I told him why we were there as my wife was ill and needed a doctor that could help her, he said that he could so we both switched to see him, things were OK in august,  sepember, but October we came down to see doctor rao , 2 days or so the doctors office called and said doctor rao would not be there on the day of our appointment,  so I had to reschedule,  it seemed like that was the becoming of the end.
November he was gone all week of November appointment,  reschedule again, also the phone was turned off many times could only get the after hours message during regular hours, very unprofessional,  now in January the doctor says he no longer wants to give my wife the paid meds she needs, he wants us to go to a pain management clinic,  we were fine with that, so we waited for the refurrels,  they came in the mail in February but we were told by the az spine and pain that they had to have the referral from the doctor before I could make an appointment with them, so I called apex in February to get them to get the referral to them, so we waited 6 weeks no referrals, I called Aarp united healthcare to complain, but I told doctor rao today that he said he could help my wife but I guess he couldn't.
I told the nurse terry I think her name is that apex medical was the most unprofessional doctors office I have ever been to. In other words THEY SUCK. They took the copay and I did not receive any services on the last appt.

Had the injection, went up to the coungter, was charged a total bill of $420, I paid the bill in full, got a receipt and left. 2 Days later I started getting threatening text messages from Timothy Goshen and his staff. Timothy Goshen said to me in a text message that I owed him a balance and that if I didn't pay him he would sue me. If I owed anything other than the $420 I was charged then why was I not told that the day I was in the office and why wasn't I given a balance sheet or made to sign anything? Also why didn't I get a proper estimate before services? I asked them all several times for a quote and they just said, ""Come on in and don't worry about it"". So I did and now they are trying to sue me. 
Do not do business with these Dr. Timothy Goshen or Fort Lauderdale Medical Surgical.

Governor John Kasich,"  Governor John Kasich  77 South High Street, 30th Floor Riffe Center 
Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.gov,43215-6117,"Governor John Kasich Mr. Rick Whitehouse while doing Meet the Press is ignoring the loss of careers for fraud at the State Medical Board and the human trafficking in women MDs told to refer to the right physicians for their licenses and to e Columbus, Ohio"," Since taking office in Ohio, Governor Kasich has been ignoring the 'human trafficking' going on at the Ohio State Medical Board - while he appoints his biggest campaign contributors to the State Medical Board (the Fraternal Order of Cash) - people who know nothing about medicine, medical care standards or what physicians should be doing.  The DOs, and podiatrists, don't know much more either - most could not get into Medical School - even being female or minority.The Ohio Medical Board has the highest rate of false physician cases: suspensions, disciplines, and sanctions for objecting to the wrong medical care when you are supposed to 'look the other way' and go along.  This is not what you are trained to do in Medical School - when you see a medical mistake, you are supposed to admit it to the patient, and try to get it fixed, referred, consulted, and transferred.   Physicians are ALL supposed to consult, refer, and send medical records - but not in Ohio, and not Dr. Nice. There are no medical mistake laws in Ohio, so it's just a pile of lies when things go wrong - as they do every day in a complicated system.  The State Medical Board, under DeWine & Kasich, is the biggest medical liar in the state - on camera or off.  Every other state except Texas has done away with 'confidential' physician complaints, and allowed physicians to get adequate care before taking medical licenses for objecting to no care of simple medical problems: fractures, thyroiditis, and bone density problems - notice they are problems that women get in their peak years.  And pregnancy forget it - you will be made fun of, told to 'do it' with the Dr. Nices (good Catholic girl doing her duty), and not allowed to have a moment of peace.  Governor Kasich has no time for Medical Board reforms and Meet the Press never asks the right questions. After residency/fellowship training, many women physicians have bone density problems - the food, the lack of sunlight (vitamin D levels plummet after 2 week vacations), the abuse (verbal, emotional & physical), and the all-hours on-call system screwing up hormones, etc.  It's what horrible practices do to healthy bodies.  A guy in my medical school class collapsed in the Psychiatry wards at MetroHealth (on his Psychiatry clerkship) - only to get 'used' to try out open cardiac massage - which he didn't survive of course.  Probably his cholesterol and cardiac spasm - but no one really cared.  And open cardiac massage?  It's only done to medical students, medical residents, and women - to see the breasts flop around.    Women MDs, when they complain, have their medical license taken for objecting too much to the wrong care (of themselves) - just verbal phone/cell messages & writing out the abuses - no threats - just asking for help in how to manage when medical mistakes are made.  Then they are told to refer to the 'right' physicians, to get treated for what the Medical Board wants them to get treated for (what they have no criteria for), and to make sure that Dr. Nice & Dr. Keith get their personal needs & understandings met.  Too busy with Meet the Press, Governor Kasich has no time for medical mistake laws - just human trafficking laws which don't apply to what the State Medical Board asks women MDs to do.  Dr. Nice asking you to office parties, polo games, to view his antique care collection, and 'understand' him because his wife doesn't = that is not medical practice.It's aequanimitas for the 2000s - that you cover for the 'boys' in that they can't be sued for negligence or 'hitting on the help' - that's just Ohio medicine.  Meet the Press misses the issues in Ohio - that Governor Kasich is presiding over the worst Medical Board in the history of the 50 states - the only Medical Board to not have reformed, in some way, the 'confidential' physician complaint system - where colleagues get your licenses taken when you are competition, or don't allow you care-to-function (basic medical care).  Even Texas had to start reforms last year- after the President of the State Medical Board had her husband filing complaints on her competition - complaints that had nothing to do with patient care - just the 'making too much' of the competition & jealousies that exist between physicians.  Getting medical care in it is a good thing to have your competition fractured, disabled and with every complication - the opening the chest for cardiac massage maneuver.  My friend did not survive that, and it was hardly necessary.  Every other patient would have gotten closed cardiac resuscitation.  No Governor of a State with 'confidential' medical complaint laws is electable on a national level - Governor Perry had to 'go home.'  And John Edwards - who made his money suing physicians instead of crafting medical mistake laws - hasn't ended well.    Auto jobs may be more in February, 2012, but the stack of false cases of physicians grows every bigger at the State Medical Board of sleaze in Ohio - where Mr. Whitehouse can't answer his cell but continually updates his social media sites.  Then when you get your license taken, you are supposed to work in labs, or Cleveland Clinic ORs, where you are abused and told to move the 'furniture' for the black 'help' to have a joke (Luvenia Lewis RN can make you fracture your shoulder doing this - she did it to one woman MD) - when you did nothing wrong except say 'No' to Drs. Nice & Keith.  This was what Mrs. Reagan said to do a couples decades back, 'Just Say No.'  The Cleveland Clinic is running a 'special' on fracturing woman physicians who couldn't do it with Dr. Nice, the bone density problem is left untreated as Dr. Nice still has hospital privileges at Hillcrest.    There's no redemption because no one knows what you did with the 'confidential' physician complaint system.  Bluntly put, Governor Kasich has no answer to this question or the problem - he's part of it, not understanding that you can't have 'confidential' complaints & diagnoses of physicians -you have to allow that the lawyers and experts have the file, that witnesses come forward, and that cases be about patient care & not 20 years old - not who that physician didn't please, or refer enough patients to, in the 1990s - who she didn't 'like.'  The American Medical Association admits that getting the 'right' fit of a practice situation is a trial-and-error tricky thing, and not a psychiatric 'thing' - physicians practice differently, and should be allowed to practice in an environment that is not threatening and supportive = means outside Ohio.And you can't keep changing a false case for 20 years - with the legislators (Senator Eklund) looking the other way for this trafficking - trafficking in false statistics of physicians who did nothing wrong except say 'No' to the wrong care, wrong behaviors and wrong Ohio physicians.  Senator Eklund had to be explained medical mistake laws recently - and he has a law firm that specializes in Health Care Law in downtown Cleveland.  40-some other states have some version of medical mistake laws that he can check - but he doesn't GOOGLE.  That's only for women MDs.  There needs to be reforms at the State Medical Board of Ohio - it's not about the RomBama Presidential election predicted to be 'close as a tick' = what a screwy reference.  It's about appropriate medical care and protection of women physicians so that we aren't a commodity to be trafficked with.  DeWine & Kasich know about it, and to open the files would expose a mess of so many valid suits that neither wants to commit Ohio to reforming the State Medical Board = more than a one day job.  Meet the Press needs to ask about the State Medical Board in Ohio, and what the women MDs are told to do by Anita Steinbergh DO - to read ICEBOUND and give Dr. Nice what he wants - which is not even scut work.  And NO ONE wants to try to solve problems on RipoffReport, but Governor Kasich can't be bothered to sit down and discuss with a woman physician - can't find the time.  ",Doctors

Now, I'm stuck with a bill from GE Capital Retail Bank. This is the credit card company that they used.

The nurse ( RN ) said she would page the Dr. She also said she knew he was at the hospital because she had talked to him a few minutes prior to me letting her know this. Every time she came in to either give me meds or to ask how I was doing I would ask if she had heard from Cardona and she continuously said no. Come bed time (roughly
midnight) I finally got mad and asked why hasn't he called..... it had been hours. So according to the charge nurse on the floor that head paged him even several times throughout the night. And when 7am came around that nurse paged
him as well (when I got up early that morning to take my meds I informed her and she said she would page too). Finally Around noon the nurse came in and said that Dr. Cardona said I can only take the pain meds I am currently taking
(15mg Oxycodone which if anyone knows about pain management, if you have a chronic problem where you have to take something like this on a daily basis, your body does get use to it. Yes I take it for my back but this just wasn't
helping the pain with my cyst on my face). This was the worst pain in my entire life. When this Dr. Cardona finally decided to come see me, which was about 3-4om Saturday March 10th 2012. He was in my room all of 4-5 min. He basically

waiting for Cardona to come and see me so I could tell him nothing was working for pain. Well Sunday I seen the infectious Disease Dr. He took off the scab and puss was coming out. He swabbed it and sent off to be tested. I was in so much pain I can't even describe how bad it hurt. I asked that Dr. if he could give me something for the pain and he said Dr. Cardona would have to do that.
So once again the nurses, even the charge nurse blew up his pager.  He never called and never came by Sunday, and
the pain management Dr never came by. Later Saturday night the nurse did tell me that the pain management Dr would not be coming by that the hospital is sending someone from the pain management team with the pharmacy to see what they could do. Well they didn't come Sunday as well. With all this and some other things that  happened (read the report on LRMC and you will see what I am talking about) I called the floor manager, she came to my room and I told her how bad the care I was getting. When I was done she called the pharmacy and basically told them to come now. And then she said she would talk to Dr. Cardona. Guess who came to see me finally Tuesday night.....
yep at about 7pm Tuesday night he finally decided to come and visit me. On the other hand the pharmacy management team came by Monday and was able to give me what the ER gave me with the exception I got it only when the dressing was changed. I was fine with that because by that time that was the only time it hurt. I went all weekend in excruciating pain but once the scab had been taking off and it was draining it did help. The next time I would see Dr. Cardona  would be Wednesday. The infectious Disease Dr came by Wednesday March 14, 2012 and said they found out what I had (a type of staff infection) and it is healed up enough where I could go home and take oral antibiotics. He said Dr. Cardona would have to release me though..... He said this around 11am..... at 7:30pm Cardona finally decides o bring his butt to my room (I was in the bathroom) and my husband says let me get her she is in the bathroom, and he says, ""no I will just go sign the paperwork to let her go home."" He didn't even want to discuss what was happening what will happen,
what I needed to do, or anything. This Dr. has horrible bed side manners. I would not recommend him to anyone. He acts like he doesn't care. Not to mention I asked why he didn't want to give me something for the pain and the floor manager, nurses, and charge nurse all said they didn't understand it either. He had the ability to be able to give me something so I was comfortable. And just because I was on 15mg of Oxycodone that seemed enough for him..... just because
I am taking that for my back doesn't mean it will help with the pain on my face (and it didn't at all).
Luckily the pharmacy pain management tech came and seen me and basically said, ""OMG he really didn't want to give you anything?"" he then asked what I was allergic to. I told him and I also told him I was given something in the ER and it worked for several hours. I was lucky to get the same thing. I think they said it was Dilaudid. This Dr is awful...... do not go to him..... he doesn't care and barely wants to talk to his patients.  I almost walked out of the hospital after all this and the situations happening Saturday night with the nurse I had..... yeah read about that one on my post for LRMC. This Dr. needs to care about his patients more even though I wasn't one of his patients on a regular basis the least he could have done was car. He only seen me 3 out of the 6 days I was there......  bad Dr.",Doctors
Governor John Kasich,"  Governor John Kasich  77 South High Street, Riffe Center 30th Floor 
Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614) 466-3555,"Governor John Kasich Mr. 'Dick' Whitehouse is busy pulling a 'Blagojevich' in Ohio by appointing to the State Medical Board on the basis of campaign contributions - a pay for view of 'confidential' records, patient & physician medical informat Columbus, Ohio","
										Governor John Kasich promised to reform the State Medical Board practices and licensure of quasi-qualified physicians to do patient mayhem.  His solution - to appoint his campaign contributors to the 'prestigious' Board - real estate developers, media mogul spouses, etc - all seats going for the 'auction' contribution of somewheres $25,000 = relatively cheap payback.  Considering the power, the appointments should go for at least $50,000 - and the recent appointees were just contributors that he couldn't award with a more 'social' service appointment - to the Ohio Real Estate Board (licensing realtors) or the Republican Spin Doctors Board?  These lay persons - who could be RNs who have been legislators, academic PhDs, and other more qualified candidates (all of Ohio to pick from) - have access to physician & patient confidential information, complaints, and medical information on physicians - they make decisions about cases, medical care standards, hospital and medical facility credentialing.  These Ohio Medical Board decisions are not able to be reviewed externally, because everything is 'confidential' - so that the physicians don't know the case against them - and the cases can involve patients or not involve patients - it's not about patient care, it's about politics.  And no one knows what 'law' is ever invoked; impairment is everything from disagreeing about bad care to not referring enough surgical patients to a 'friend of the Medical Board physician' - the minutes are 'confidential,' the deals are 'confidential.'  And this is only Ohio - even Texas has reformed things (Senator Eklund) somewhat regarding 'confidential' physician complaints.  Physicians with their licenses under suspension are exhorted to refer to the 'right' physicians, ie friends of Board Members (and real estate developers, etc).  The lay Members don't have training in law (Mr. Dick is supposed to supply that angle), ethics, Medical Management (an easy degree) - they have $.  HIPAA does not apply to State Medical Boards, and I don't see Governor Kasich, or Mr. 'Dick' Whitehouse, giving their medical information to these people.  However well-qualified they are in their chosen fields, they are not qualified to be lay-people on the State Medical Board with votes on physician licenses.  Some of them didn't get into Medical School, others had no interest in anything medical - just power.  But putting the media spouses on the Board, to do the 'spin' on the false physician disciplines from 'confidential' complaints where colleagues complained after they goofed on a physician's care, or didn't get their personal needs met by that woman physician - is not ok.  The media mogul's spouse is now supposed to 'discipline' the woman physician who said 'No' to Dr. Nice & Keith - when she obviously said 'Yes' to a monied husband and didn't bother to go to Medical School.  Women who have collected for their 'Yes' are on that Board - or Anita Steinbergh DO who no one in their 'right' Ohio mind would seduce.  It's not about morals.  There need to be serious reforms at the State Medical Board of Ohio - and the names in this are just out of a soap opera - 'Dick' Whitehouse makes sure that Dr. Nice gets his potency needs met - that woman colleagues 'understand him because his ex-wife didn't,' and Anita Steinbergh DO makes sure that it's all covered under the 'umbrella' of 'aequanimitas.'  Even the State of Texas has reformed their 'confidential' physician complaint law - after the woman President of the Medical Board was having her husband complain 'confidentially' about her competition - and she was processing the complaints and voting to suspend the licenses - without patient complaints.  Patients think that this is the way to go?, to get vengeance, anonymous won't get a decision in court or the facts.  Even Emily Thorne does it better.The same is going on in Ohio as is/continues to go on in Texas.  In Ohio, the legislative House Speakers from Householder, to Husted, to Buddish to Batchelder have tried to 'hide' the problem of the false cases (they admit the problem exists however & the number of false physician cases is at critical mass), disciplines & suspensions for spite, for not going along with bad care or making too much of bad care in Ohio - the legislators admit the problem but only want the cases opened in a limited way if at all - they don't care that someone lost a medical license that they worked hard for - Ohio can import physicians from any foreign country and regularly licenses more FMGs than Ohio grads - because they 'go along' and don't say anything.  That's another of Governor Kasich's appointments to the Medical Board, FMGs - try the Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals, or Cincinnati - try a pediatrician - someone not totally into sex and of Ohio Medical culture - someone trained in Ohio who grew up here.  Allowing the wrong people access to physician and patient files, allowing Mr. 'Dick' to be the person in charge, as the Executive Director of the State Medical Board, of going after woman MDs who don't put out for male colleagues ('dick' rules) - and allowing 'cases' where this is involved as legit - is not ok.  The puns on this choice to go after women physicians for saying 'No' are just not even funny - but certainly someone has a sense of humor in Columbus - pick a Joseph, Tom or a John, Ron, Dave but not a Dick - who keeps up with his social websites but can't get back to physicians on his cell.  If Dick were only not such a 'd*ck' - there might be a chance for patients, and woman MDs, in Ohio.There are longstanding cases at the State Medical Board in Ohio that have absolutely nothing to do with patient care, the woman MD was a threat to patients only because she wouldn't refer enough to the Dr. Nice's - who take women to surgery preggers and do knee replacements where they hit the popliteal artery - putting the woman into shock, but getting huge fees for the hospital involved - you have to use the ICU, the vascular surgeons, the cardiologists (Dr. Botti), and the hospitalizations go weeks instead of days - fill those beds.  A lot of bungled care in Ohio is to get a surgery - where the cast eats through the hand, or the fracture isn't reduced, or the replacement was put in the wrong way and got infected - how convenient - just like the Foley catheter with barbs on it to rip the urethra and 'get the guy back' - for not being a 'good' patient.  It's a new saga - THE GOOD PATIENT.  Medical care can be done in a way to 'look good,' but be horribly wrong - but the Kasich Board Members will never figure that out - and Anita just hates women MDs - not her fault of course.   Governor Kasich can certainly do better by physicians, and might get more contributions from physicians if their licenses weren't being continually taken for saying that they can't agree to the bad care that goes on, or that care for themselves.  When a physician doesn't want that care for themselves, but would sell it to a patient, it's not good care.Making too much of bad care that the Medical Board in Ohio has decided to 'pass' on - as their 'friends' are doing it - is a reason for licensure suspension in Ohio - not in the law, but in the practice of an autonomous arbitrary Board with each Member out for themselves.  Physicians, in becoming MDs, don't relinquish the power of consent to their medical care - that they have the 'right' to ask for consultations, referrals, and proper care in a timely manner without anyone getting back - without revenge as in the popular nighttime soap - for not wanting Dr. Nice care, Dr. Keith experimental, Dr. Lafferty blood work, etc.  The consent form should be also allowed for the Medical Board ordering of serial 'goes' at women physicians - serial psychiatric evaluations at non-medical sites ie above Chinese restaurants in rundown shopping centers, at Community Centers outside Columbus.  These evaluations are done by physicians who can't find other work, and who promise the Medical Board to say or diagnose what the Medical Board wants - diagnosis by the real estate developer or the Republican media spin doctor's wife - just order another 'go.'  The spin doctor's spouse is now a crucial vote as regards serial 'goes' at woman physicians - ugh!It's one thing to say that it's ok if patients want this care, but another to force a trained physician to go along with bad care for themselves, or their patients, because of bad people on the State Medical Board.  Women MDs do not have personality disorders because they say 'No' to fulfilling Dr. Nice's personals, to Dr. Keith's 'experimental' casts, to Dr. Lafferty saying that women physicians don't merit blood work as they just 'have problems with men,' or to inappropriate appointees having access to their medical files full of mistakes, misinformation, and garbage - all the kitchen sink went into files in one physician's case - everything about anything except her medical fracture care.  All the excuses are phrased in sexual, sexist, and crude terms - this crude writing goes into cases where the woman physicians are judged 'seductive' or that they 'asked for bad care' and bad boy behaviors.  They couldn't do it better in porn writing = Ohio State Medical Board cases against women who say 'No.' The legislators involved in Ohio case are also Governor Kasich appointees: Senator Eklund and 'Bridie' Matheney (who can't add the 'math' of this kind of corruption in terms of human suffering as long as she gets to have her husband and two kids).  Senator Eklund is doing bills on Mexican immigrants getting to drive without Ohio licenses, and Matheney is concerned with cyber-security - neither are concerned with what is going on in physician offices and at Hillcrest Hospital - where physicians can walk around for 3 weeks begging for a cast for themselves while everyone laughs - including the Administrator that sold the hospital to the Cleveland Clinic for his future.  It's all in a day's work in Columbus, but that no one is doing anything about the 'confidential' physician complaint mess, or the quality of the Medical Board appointees (Members & Executive Directors).  Ohio deserves better than what Dick is managing - with less of 'dick' innuendo and nonsense.  Patient care is a serious responsibility, and a 'trust' that should not be taken lightly by a Governor who hasn't got a clue - and Representative Boehner thinks that Governor Kasich should be giving lessons to Washington D.C.?  It's all a game of golf apparently - the Tiger kind. ",Doctors

It sounds like he is more interested in backing PETA than being concerned about the health of his patients.  Is it possible he chose the wrong career path?  How can a doctor make disparaging comments like this to his patients?  This sounds like a legitimate case for the medical review board.  This could also be interpreted as slander if I was making this statement and it was not the truth, however, I heard Dr. Michael Schooling make these disparaging comments myself.  Be careful if you are part of the baby bommer generation because you will be frowned upon, if not ignored if you are not a vegetarian or a non smoker.

He is a lying (he lied on my medical chart that he wrote for me, when I came to his office for an appointment) incompetent Doctor who only cares about money.  He was banned from the OR (Operating Room) for actions that were dangerous to the patient. Normally a knee replacement is one 5 day hospitalization and takes about one month to recover 95% from. My left knee replacement took place June 9, 2009 and as of today February 16, 2012 I have had 3 surgeries, 5 hospitalizations and an
out of pocket cost of $12,654 (normally $1200). The surgeries were due to effusion of blood into my knee joint plus I had a huge blood clot (which Ballard totally missed detecting in my groin area). Just from this clot alone I had to take a blood thinner (Coumadin, which I had to go to the hospital twice a week to have a level measured), I had a 60% chance of dying from clot alone.My pain every single day is terrible; I barely can walk, cannot ride my bike or drive my car. I cannot drive as I must take morphine and oxycodone (which I hate to take, as it makes me sleepy, itch and I cannot drive). I worked in the Pharmaceutical Industry for 30 years and had to retire.He always acted so nice to me, when I came to his office or was in the hospital but I found out it was all an act. Even though he acted nice, he wrote on his Medical Records about me: ""Michael did not take care of his surgery site"" (my wife is an Intensive Care R.N., so she took care of the site), ""he did not follow medical orders, he came to my office with dirty clothes, late and did not speak in coherent sentences"" (I have worked in the corporate world for almost 30 years and
graduated with M.S.). All he wrote were lies.As soon as the statute of limitations was up (2 years in Oregon) to take legal action against him, he dropped me as a patient and told the rest of other Orthopedic Doctors not to see me when I had problems with my shoulder. Ballard is a bad Doctor and cannot be trusted.

										Essentially, we noticed a monthly deduction from our accounts with no notification, labeled ""Healthplan"" on bank statements.  When we tried to reach someone at the phone number, we were placed on hold repeatedly.  Finally, after trying several times, we reached an account representative, who could not identify her company, her company name, or the services they provided beyond a rehearsed ""60% off health care for owners, employees, and family."" Apparently, they stated that a former employee authorized the transaction and provided them with the business account number - which she did not have access to in the first place.  They agreed to reimburse 6 months of charges and cancel the withdrawals immediately.  They have charged a total of 9 months of charges.  I am forced to keep my account open to them for 1 month to see if we do get reimbursed at the next billing cycle.  If we do not see this reimbursement, we will freeze the account and legally pursue them.  EDitor's Suggestions on how to get your money back! HERE IS WHAT RIP-OFF REPORT SUGGESTS YOU DO: Go to your bank within 60 days of the charge, or as soon as you know about the charge, don't delay, and tell them that there has been fraudulent activity within your account.  Explain that you wish to file a dispute, and demand that they assist you in accordance with Federal Regulation E.According to the majority of victims interviewed by Rip-off Report, those who immediately called their banks to dispute the charges did not get very far.  Many victims got the following responses from their banks: we could not do anything for you or you waited too long; it has been more than 60 days.If the bank is says that you have waited too long, explain to them how you called their 800 number as soon as the charges were found, and were told by the bank that nothing could be done.  Remind the bank that they failed to assist you properly at the 800 #, and instead, provided you with an inadequate explanation of your right to dispute.  Tell the bank that it's their fault time has expired, and since they gave you the wrong info to begin with, they will just have to deal with it, take the loss and reverse the charges.Tell them the truth; this was unauthorized and your account was NOT to be charged! Keep emphasizing how you never authorized anything!  Direct them to the hundreds of victims reports that were filed on Rip-off Report.com.  And if you're at the bank, walk them over to their computer and make them go to this site!  If you are on the phone with them, tell them you will wait while they access this site!  Either way, be persistent!DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER! Let them know nicely, that you were advised to Report them (the Bank) and this situation to the Banking Commission in your state.  Since each state has a different name for the agency/controller over banks, find that name before you call or get to the bank so you can throw it in their face. The more knowledgeable you appear to be, the further you will get.And just continue to demand the Federal Regulation E form! The bank CAN, MUST and WILL reverse the charge!  But, you must be persistent; ask to speak to the supervisor or the area manager for all the branches in the state.Let the bank personnel know you are meeting with the media later in the day, that you would much rather they do the right thing (as most other banks have) by looking at the complaints and immediately reversing the charge(s) to your account; no matter how long ago it was.  Be sure to call the Media if necessary so you are telling the truth.If you have to, be loud (but nice) in front of other customers. If you are just calling by phone, the above tactics should still work. The bank can easily fax or mail to you the Federal Regulation E dispute form.CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT CARDIf the charge was to your credit card (not debit card, check card, or checking account), contact the credit card company as soon as possible to request a dispute form. Consumers usually have a little longer to dispute fraudulent credit card charges (up to 6 months), but it is better to act right away.  In this type of situation, credit card disputes are usually successful since fraudulent companies often won't contest the disputed charge.  In rare cases, credit card companies will review disputes, but refuse to reverse the charges.  If this occurs, complain to a manager and let them know you will be filing a report here.Remember Don't let them get away with it!   Make sure they make the Rip-off Report .. The more Reports filed on a Company or individual, the more likely it is that the authorities, media and attorneys will want to take action. And good luck Let us know how you do!ED Magedson  Founder

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614) 466-3555,"Governor John Kasich Mr. Richard Whitehouse allow dysfunctional dealings of the State Medical Board taking women MD licenses for not going along with Dr. Nice care & behaviors - where he can't cast and can't call the Cleveland Clinic as he has  Columbus, Ohio"," Can't have a life in Ohio if you don't first do it with Dr. Nice - with his wife going along with his philandering, cheating, and lies.  The State Medical Board of Ohio Members confidentially sell their looking the other way & fixing 'protections' with their CV = why Anita Steinbergh DO has so many lines of achievements while destroying the lives of other better educated and more ethical women who won't lie for a license.  So that boys being boys is ok in Ohio, everything is aequanimitas like Bon Iver music is a haze of acoustic guitars, airy synthesizers and tumbling drums floating beneath Vernons hallucinogenic yowl, like two stratus clouds overlapping in a dream = Ohio Medical Board decisions.  In Ohio you can't depend on a male for anything except stupidity, not be able to be an orthopedic (synonymous with jerk), and crass behaviors & needs - their only concerned about their groins and potency.  And if you don't fulfill those needs you won't ever have a life or a Valentine's Day, because everything is confidential and fixed - nothing is about chocolate. It used to be the parents that thwarted loves & lovers - now it's the Ohio State Medical Board and the Governor's office that promised to improve things - but just not in his governorship.  Let's take a look at the things that fiction is supposed to teach - fiction that Dr. Anita Steinbergh didn't read.  In Ohio it's not the Montagues and the Capulets - it's the Nices, Keiths, Suppes' & O'Day's that cause the tragedies - the jerks no better than their fictional counterparts.  Dr. O'Day is straight from Snow White, Dr. Steinbergh from the Land of Oz = the bad witch.In Ohio, the State Medical Board wants to perpetually dictate for women MDs what they have, who they work with & refer to - the 'right' physicians - and if they can have a license if they can't go along with the adolescent attitudes & boys being Peter Pan at 50 & 60-some.  You have to have bipolar to keep a medical license in Ohio, and Senator Grendell thinks rebelling against Board over-prescribing to be a personality disorder.  After you pass your Boards in Internal Medicine at 20-some, on the first go-around unlike most of Ohio, the State Medical Board should be there only for support - not to dictate like a dysfunctional parent in need of the therapy they so freely prescribe.  The training in medicine fosters a dysfunctionality that permeates the Ohio State Medical Board decisions - where everything is confidentially adolescent. Romeo & Juliet should teach that ""Entering an adult relationship, one has to have individuated from the family,"" says relationship therapist Carin Goldstein, creator of BeTheSmartWife.com. ""If you still feel too tied to expectations, their judgments and critical thoughts make it impossible to have an intimate relationship.""  In Ohio, even being a Board Certified Internist, one is still too tied to the impossible critiques of the State Medical Board of Fools - who want you to get treated for something that you don't have - the disease of saying 'No' to the big boys Dr. Nice & Dr. Keith.  It's not a disease, it's an Ohio fact that Dr. Nice has a problem with women - just because they won't come forward doesn't mean that it's not local common knowledge.  And a sixth evaluation of Juliet won't make it Columbus common knowledge as the Ohio Board experts hide the pathologies of the male MDs in Ohio.  In Ohio, one is forever caught in an never-ending tragedy as the Ohio State Medical Board can't end a false case, can't move on from past misjudgements.Sayuri & the Chairman from Memoirs of a Geisha - and being a woman MD in Ohio is a bit like geisha training.  The lesson: The Chairman's warmth and generosity, qualities missing from Sayuri's youth, ultimately helped her heal.  If you've had a tough upbringing, says psychotherapist Mary Jo Rapini, look for someone ""with the positive characteristics that you would have liked to see encouraged in you when you were a child.""  However not a fat chance that you will find that type amongst your male colleagues in Ohio.  Robbie & Cecilia in Atonement, the lesson: Life isn't fair, but a strong bond can weather the storms. ""If you're in a committed relationship, you are in it together,"" says Goldstein. ""Life has ups and downs, and you need to be there for support.  It gives your partner a reason to fight the battle.""  However, no committed relationship survives the State Medical Board's inquisition - part of the investigation of women MDs is for them to detail over and over their sexual history - for Dr. Nice to make sure that he won't catch anything when he makes it a condition of your re-licensure that you work with him - which is euphemism that perennially eludes 'can't figure' Governor Kasich.Lastly Petro and Tita from Like Water For Chocolate - Each of us is born with a box of matches inside us but we can't strike them all by ourselves. . . The Lesson: It can be tough to break ties,  even from difficult parents and Medical Boards, but Tita and Pedro might have saved themselves the worst heartache if they had done so. ""I have seen so many young adults taken advantage of by their parents,"" says Rapini. ""If your family ever asks you to compromise on something that will break your heart, you may have to divorce your parents who, after age 18, should be there to emotionally support you.""  The Medical Board 20 years ago asked me to compromise on a relationship with a male MD who was looking for another notch on his belt - like Mr. Whitehouse.  Couldn't but still lost the box of matches - and Anita Steinbergh is too stupid and concrete to get the analogy.  Bad parenting.Governor Kasich - you need to open the false cases at the State Medical Board of Ohio and let the characters have lives.  MD licenses should not be contingent on multiple psychiatric evaluations of a normal woman wanting her heart's desire like Bella in Beauty & the Beast - which you've seen in cartoon if you haven't read any of the above books - and as you have no imagination maybe you should - your wife will have the books.  Wasn't interested in Dr. Nice but no one has gotten the message in 20 years.    ",Doctors

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614) 466-3555,"Governor John Kasich Richard Whitehouse Esq need to stop the Carla O'Day MD personal suspensions & disciplines at the State Medical Board of Ohio for disagreeing with her or her friends - physician license suspensions without patient complaints Columbus, Ohio","
										Governor Kasich, and Mr. Whitehouse, need to stop the personal suspensions of Ohio medical licenses for physicians who disagreed with Carla O'Day MD, or her friends, angered her in some petty way in Medical School, or don't know what they did wrong as the situation is 'confidential' and doesn't involve the physician's patient care.  That's why physician complaints can't be 'confidential' - the complaints that were co-authored, investigated, and run by Dr. O'Day in 1990-3 - cases still unresolved for lack of a case against the physician.   Earth to the State Medical Board: there are cases in the Cleveland area that the Cleveland area medical community can't solve - the physicians will never be rehabilitated in Cleveland medicine and the independent psychiatrists involved have said for years that these physicians can't work in Cleveland or in Ohio - because there are real personal hatreds, agendas, etc. of medicine as practiced by certain practitioners in the Cleveland/NE Ohio area.  NE Ohio is a difficult place, and a political place, to practice medicine.   The 'confidential' files have to be opened of those Cleveland cases, as was recommended in 1998-9, and there has to be an external review of all cases where Carla O'Day MD co-authored complaints of other physicians - cases where the physicians didn't have any patient complaints at issue.  The Cleveland area physicians are not going to clean up the mess - the standards will have to change in Columbus about starting investigations into physicians for the conflicted reasons of Board Members.  The Medical Board of Ohio is supposed to be about patient complaints - not colleague issues.  That's why physician complaints can't be 'confidential' in Ohio - the colleague complaint problem that then happens - because no one knows what the issues are then, and there's no procedural bail-out for the State Medical Board to admit that they made a mistake after the fact of being had for six figures times 5.  In making access for patients to anonymously file complaints against physicians, the State of Ohio has opened a Pandora's box of complaints by not well-meaning colleagues for funny, ridiculous, and non-patient care reasons - for the personal agendas of the Board Members and their friends.  No physician complaint should be anonymous, or 'confidential,' in any state - the extreme education of a physician, and the complexity of medical care, merits that the physician be allowed to defend themselves out-in-the-open, and bring other witnesses to the situation before 20 years - whether Carla O'Day MD hates you or not, whether Anita Steinbergh DO hates you or not.  And that hasn't been the case in Ohio for 20 years - the Board Members are political appointees and their agenda is political & self-serving.  Lance Talmadge MD is on the Ohio Medical Board to make sure that Ohio legitimizes third trimester abortion; doesn't go after any physician doing abortions.   But the situation in at least one physician case should not be going on - and taxpayer's should not have paid over $500,000 for this false case - which was Carla O'Day MD's personal agenda with this colleague.  It would have been less costly if Carla O'Day MD could have met with the physician and screamed and yelled at her for whatever - but she wouldn't and hasn't been willing to do so for 20 years - even for money for her time.  My first suggestion to Mr. Whitehouse is to mandate that Carla O'Day MD sits down with this physician and her attorney - who knows her husband - and see if things can get straightened out as it wasn't about this physician's patient care - she took the leftover patients that Carla O'Day MD threw at her from the ER at Hillcrest - the patients no one else would admit or take care of.  It's a caste world in NE Ohio medicine, where only certain physicians take certain patients and the rest get the leftovers that don't promise big money.  The Cleveland Clinic doing a radical cyctectomy nets $250,000 and the physicians tell the patients that upfront.  Even the Ohio Medical Board admits that the one case is a local Ohio fight, but won't know the half of it without opening the 'confidential.'  The physician doesn't know how she angered Dr. O'Day - but it's something personal and 'confidential.'  Ten psychiatrists won't be able to untangle it without the 'confidential' complaint and some truth - but it started about 30 years ago in Medical School for sure.  The Ohio taxpayers & the Governor should not be playing along.  The fact is that medical licenses in Ohio have been taken for false complaints filed, or co-authored by Board Members, using the State Medical Board for their own purposes since 1990 = what was going on in Texas until 2011 is still going on in Ohio.  And these particular Board Members then run the case against their classmate colleague physicians - to the death.  Carla O'Day MD (Streepy in Medical School), since 1990, has authored complaints against, and continued to manipulate cases, of physicians that she knew in Medical School - for personal reasons -where the physicians don't know what they did to deserve her misplaced interest five psychiatric evaluations later.  If Carla O'Day MD's divorce papers (her marriage to Magistrate Streepy) were not sealed, there would be ample reasons for not allowing her to be an author of colleague MD complaints - her credibility, her nastiness, and motives are never called into question in Columbus.  It's questionable if any MD should have behaved as she did during her divorce.  And Governor Taft tried to get at this in 2005, but the physicians involved with her false complaining were not allowed to testify at the investigation - so the investigation was 'inconclusive.'  The fact is that it has been legal for State Medical Board Members in Ohio to author complaints against physician colleagues, without patient issues or patient complaints, and to do the 'dirty' investigations of these colleagues, without normal due process - to put these 'cases' ahead of other cases with multiple patient complaints.  The money is provided.  It has been legal for Ohio State MD licenses to be taken for 'making too much of bad medical care' done in part by a Medical Board Member's ER, and her friends (Carla) - because she was multi-tasking and not running things in any good way.  Carla O'Day MD is not stupid, but always doing too many things, and with too many commitments (2 husbands, 5 children, two careers, multiple attempts at residency training, dragging colleagues into court for calling her to get her to discuss, etc).  Carla O'Day MD didn't have the training, or the maturity, to be on the State Medical Board in 1990-2.  But she did know the Celestes, and Governor Celeste used her to micromanage his wife - wrong choice for wrong reasons.  Governor Celeste should have straightened out his marriage, and the gender identity issues of his then wife, before running for Governor - it wasn't a secret that there were problems - and Carla O'Day MD couldn't straighten them out, but she used things for her personal agendas.    Problem: Dr. O'Day won't ever sit down and discuss things - so you can find out how to NOT interfere with her program - even when asked by other 'friend' physicians and offered payment to sit down and discuss - because the arguments are making a mess of the State Medical Board and costing the taxpayers money to train physicians that she then trashes.  Carla O'Day MD (Streepy) - and putting this on the web was not anyone's first choice - got into Medical School at Case Western Reserve University under a 'special' program - where the Deans for awhile admitted students from other 'tracks' of training (nurses, social workers, lawyers, Case professors of whatever, etc.) thinking that they would make good physicians for some reason.  It was an attempt to make medicine more broad thinking.  So Carla O'Day MD (Carla Streepy), when admitted to Medical School was a prison social worker by educational choice & job training - and didn't take half the science classes that most of the other students had taken before she got admitted - her admission to Medical School was 'special' - she was put ahead of other straight science major students in the selection process.  Carla Streepy had street smarts, and a tough side, and used this when more straight-arrow students irked her that they studied and took the classes seriously - which she didn't.  As the librarians pegged Carla Streepy, she was a 'political' student - admitted for political reasons and never quite buying the gestalt of Medical School - so she never finished a residency in anything although she started several. Retraining professionals doesn't always work.  Carla O'Day (Streepy) MD regularly skipped classes at Case Western Reserve University Medical School, made fun of 'straight' students, and didn't fit the 'bill' of being an older wiser student who could have helped the classes that she was part of - she didn't bring the 'maturity' factor and the Deans soon found that out.  Instead of being the married mother of 5, she was on the prowl like a new-age Demi Moore, competing with other woman students for the attention of fellow students nearer her children's age.  Because what is now the Celeste Research Building was in planning stages & then under construction, and state monies were involved, Carla Streepy (later O'Day) manipulated the situation at the Medical School.  In fact she got away with more not doing things the 'right' way than most - because she knew people - like Governor Kasich she had a book of contacts.  Per one source, she would threaten the Deans and she lied about things causing patient problems on the wards.  At times, meeting up with male fellow physicians who wanted to 'kill' her for making a mess of a patient's care, you had to do the woman-thing and calm the waters.  It wasn't the 'physician children' medical students who got away with things, it was the very crooked-arrow 'special' students, who had gotten admitted for all the wrong reasons, who got away with things at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, ie not having to tow the mark and be a part of the Medical Student culture.  So she apparently hated MD's children, for their being part of the culture and fitting in - but she didn't try.    The problem for the physician licenses of those that somehow wandered into her ER, or onto her radar in professional life, was that she parlayed things with the Celestes to a Medical Board Membership in 1990-3.  And for ER job contracts, would then promise that the hospital, and certain physicians, would not be bothered by the State Medical Board.  Her 'protection' was part of the ER subcontracting package.  So certain physicians could then threaten that they had their own personal 'contact' on the State Medical Board in Ohio - which they did, and continue to have in her continued unofficial role at the Medical Board.  Special things were promised to certain Hillcrest physicians when Carla O'Day MD's group got the ER contract, and then she was made the Director of Emergency Services after certain Medical Board services.  By ability, Carla Streepy O'Day MD is/was a social worker - that's the kind that don't do heavy science well, or appreciate those that do, and who don't manage ERs well unless they get some post-graduate training that isn't on-the-job.The State Medical Board of Ohio needs to openly review all cases of physician discipline for not going along with Dr. Carla O'Day's agendas - those cases where the physician was judged impaired in a local fight of personalities without patient complaints.  There are apparently more than one of these cases in the stack of false physician suspensions and disciplines - cases where the investigation was even a waste of money but politically (monetarily for Carla O'Day MD) motivated.  Mr. Whitehouse, the Cleveland Medical Community is not going to straighten out these cases that were manipulated by Dr. Carla O'Day MD.  And her lack of credibility, if you consider her messy divorce and piles of problems with male colleagues - to the point where she could not finish a residency program - does not qualify her to author, run, or further manipulate physician cases at the State Medical Board of Ohio - her influence needs to be over - as Governor Taft tried to effect.      ",Doctors

										Sept. 29, 2011...Jan 28th 2011To Whom It May Concern,On July 26th 2011 my son and I had a doctors appointment, with a Doctor J. Wellington Adams in Leland, NC.  We were new patients because we relocated from PA to NC in June.  Preston was charged $26.00 for Behave Change Smoking 3-10 Min the code used is (99406) I was there when the nurse asked him did he smoke and he said yeah (1) cigarette a day because my mom doesn't like it.  The nurse said oh (1) that's not smoking and laugh.   Not once did she say there will be a charge for her or the Doctor asking him this question and handing him a pamphlet at the end of the Physical. Not once did she say there would be a charge.   If that was the case, I would have told her to keep her pamphlet, (materials)and we could look up our selves the dangers of smoking for free in the comfort of our home on the internet.  On August 19, 2011 we received a bill in his name in the amount of $26.00...I contacted Lynn I guess shes the receptionist on Sept. 6, 2011 @ 4:25pm and advised her of the situation. She stated that there is nothing she could do, but have either the Doctor call or the nurse.  I told her he can call or her, but I am not paying this bill, this is fraud and a scam and this is not right and that I was filing a complaint with the insurance company, which is what I did. I spoke with a Customer Service Agent by the name of Dora. She took my complaint and advised me of the next steps. Which is to write this letter.  I also contacted the BBB, Consumer Action and the Attorney General and no one could help meThe date above is the first date of my complaint and still no resolution and we just received another bill on January 25th 2012 and this time its from a collection agency. Second Letter...November 16th 2011 To Ms. Michaud, The doctor is utterly wrong on a few of his statements. First of all the only bill we received was August 19th 2011. Second how dare he say that his nurse (Heather) would never say oh one cigarette is not smoking when he was not even present in the room. The nurse most definitely said that one cigarette was not smoking. We know what was said Thirdly, I never said I called the office on the 26th of September I said the 6th of September and every time I called that office the receptions always said her name was Lynnif that is not her name then she is a liar just like the Doctor. I went into the room with my son and my 4 year old daughter and Dr. Wellington never made any inquiries to Preston regarding cigarettes while I was present. Even if he claim he did, he did not disclose at anytime there would be a charge for me asking your son questions regarding cigarettes. If that was the case, I most certainly would have said no. What sense does it make to make two $15.00 co pays for me and my son and then be billed for $26.00 dollars? It makes no sense at all. I left the room with my 4 year old daughter as soon as he proceeded to examine Preston, Preston informed me that he asked him the questions after I left the room.   I waited in my car and Preston came out with papers on cigarettes that was printed from the internet on smoking. The doctor is wrong never did any one call my home and if they did what is the point of his statement, the only call that was received was placed to my cell phone and that was on September 30th 2011 not our home numberHow dare he say what me and someone else talked aboutErika never stated that the charge was correct in fact she said that this is not the first time that a patient has disputed charges, but that after 90 days it will go to collections The dispute we have with this office is that at no point did the nurse or the doctor say if I ask you questions regarding cigarettes that there would be a $26.00 dollar charge. This is the essence of our dispute. I worked in a doctors office and a dentists office and I know about procedures and ethical disclosures.  We have just spent over $25.000.00 dollars to our basement to our second home in Dover, Pennsylvania so $26.00 dollars is not the issue, it is the principle.   I have been in customer service/Management for almost 25 years and this is not customer serviceThis is like going out to dinner and the cook says taste this steak and at the end of the dinner give you a bill for the price of the steak, and this would be considered fraudgoing forward I have forwarded this compliant and the pervious one to the North Carolina Medical Board as well as Consumer Action and I also sent a report to channel 14 news..",Doctors

										Governor John Kasich is literally 'killing' some physicians with allowing false Medical Board suspensions to continue at the State Medical Board of Ohio - for the physician objecting to medical mistakes on themselves.  The physician tries to save their own care, and runs into a Board-friend physician still doing some really outrageous care practices - and these types of physicians exist at every hospital and are many times the 'recommended' physicians - until you try to talk with them about a care problem.      It's one thing to not say anything for another patient's mistakes, because you can't be sure of exactly what really happened, but when the mistakes are so bad - and so uncorrected because the male physician thinking is so screwy - that they finally get done to a woman MD - things are not ok.  And a Columbus courthouse is not the place to solve medical care disagreements, and care paradigm confusions, because of the different ways physicians are trained.  Colleague disagreements belong in a non-punitive track at the State Medical Board - like in Minnesota.  In case management conferences, physicians are trained to disagree if they know something that the other physician doesn't.  But in Ohio practice, that disagreement is an impairment meriting Medical Board licensure suspension; that you don't go along with the more senior male/female physician. However, the Ohio policy of leaving wrist fractures to ripen to excrescence, and the casting of them with 'experimental' casts, are two practices which do not belong in Ohio care without some restrictions.There are certain medical problems that occur almost exclusively in women, and Ohio does a bad job of these medical diagnoses - thyroid, endocrine gynecology (even fertility is just a business), and bone metabolism problems causing early fracturing.  Men don't fracture for the most part, unless doing some sport, until later in life.  So the majority of pathologic fracturing - without any stress - occurs in women, and is badly assessed in Ohio - leaving women patients fracturing in their 30s and 40s unnecessarily.  Despite CCFs own Dr. Chad Deal's Frax Index, he does a miserable job of assessing woman professional patients with metabolic bone problems.  Dr. Deal will write anything that the Medical Board tells him to, without examining the woman patient - he's a tool, a talking-head, a jerk in the parlance - not an ounce of guy stand-up value.  But he's not the only plastic male MD in Ohio.   Women MDs are particularly 'targeted' by the present State Medical Board - no changes under Governor Kasich so far - and then ordered to repetitive psychiatric evaluations by Board-appointed 'right' Ohio psychiatrists while their normal medical care is neglected, or not allowed, as they don't 'deserve' care.  The problem is the neglect of the 'mistake' care that occurred, the lack of any common sense about treating what's real.  Women have their medical licenses suspended without blood work, with unfinished physical therapy, without the EMG, to just get psychiatric care for wanting better care - care that they were trained to give and trained should exist.  Going to a Community Hospital practice in Ohio is like entering UNDERWORLD without Kate Beckinsdale.For women MDs in their 30s and 40s, medical care (especially ob-gyn) is critical, the more so because many neglected care of themselves during their residency and training years; the hand-to-mouth existence of medical training - the constant no money.  So it's important that women MDs be able to get medical care of themselves which is not 'mistakes,' not Medical Board-appointed, and not just psychiatric, or consisting of repeated psychiatric evaluations trying to find a case for the logic-impaired Medical Board in Ohio.  The State Medical Board of Ohio wants women MDs treated for only what they diagnose them to have, not the medical care that the woman MD needs as care-to-function.  The Medical Board Members seem to be pretty stupid MDs about normal medical care for women colleagues; have never heard Dr. Steinbergh or Dr. Talmadge talk anything but psych and they are not Board-Certified in Psychiatry - they can't discuss a common medical problem like thyroid disease in women.  They talk about Mrs. Nice?  Psychiatrists have nothing better to do in Columbus apparently - the Medical Board is their scheduling secretary and booking agent.  And these are not 'normal' psychiatrists - they are new right Ohio psychiatrists who don't follow the DSM.  Like Chad Deal, they will write anything that the State Medical Board tells them to - literally anything for the money.  They invent diagnoses, as they did in one case, and the Medical Board of Ohio pays them because they don't realize that they are paying for fraud.  Then Mr. Whitehouse puts these false evaluations on the web.   The situation is gruesome - and literally destroying the health of a number of falsely accused physicians - both male & female - who can't get the 'confidential' complaint to clear their names and licenses - clear themselves to get normal medical care again.  It's a hand-to-mouth-existence, with the only medical care allowed being repeated psychiatric evaluations by idiots who can cash Ohio State Government checks.  No physician wants to care for these falsely accused MDs, as they are afraid of their own medical licenses in the situation of all this false accusing and no medical mistake laws in Ohio - it's like a 'reign of terror' with a 'trial' by 20 years of fire - some survive and some don't. On one case, the Board hasn't found a case in nearly 20 years, but has almost killed the woman physician with the neglect of care that every other woman can get - no blood work, no ob-gyn care, no endocrine help.  And women need endocrine help in their 30s and 40s - if only to stay healthy.  Dr. Lance Talmadge should know this - but he doesn't want these women MDs to get any care - just to admit the case that he made up; his clinical skills appear to be missing.   The only care that the State Medical Board allows, or wants, these women MDs to get is psychiatric - so that they don't 'notice' medical mistakes done on them or their patients.  The Medical Board wants them drugged, their personalities homogenized, and their intelligence and dignity lost in the fray.   Anita Steinbergh DO, a current life-term Board Member (20 years), is particularly unreasonable on these cases for some reason - citing that the woman should just lie, and it's not her responsibility that the bad care is continuing.  Well the Medical Board Members are supposed to set some standards of care, as they do in every other state except Ohio.  Ohio needs medical mistake laws, not repeated psychiatric evaluations of women physicians so that they don't say anything about the mistakes even for care for themselves.  Governor Kasich needs to get up to speed on the fraud down the street, and stop killing women MDs because he's so detached and not 'on point.'  It takes a huge amount of money and effort to train a woman MD, moreso than the men.  And the loss of MDs to the State Medical Board's 'machinery' is a tragedy.  Women MDs do the politics badly, because it's just not in their make-up except for the Dr. Steinberghs and the Dr. O'Days - who are killing the rest of us with their stupidity. ",Doctors

Internet United States of America ",http://gates.kaleidahealth.org/oiioio,(716) 887-4225,"Millard Fillmore Gates Hospital Dr. Linda Harris intrusive venogram test with no sedation/needlessly hospitalized/rubber-stamped by Doctor  Internet, New York","
										In September 2011, a doctor at Trinity Medical in Orchard Park informed me that the pain in my chest was most likely from Thoracic Outlet Obstruction Syndrome. He came to this conclusion after listening to my blood flow at various points in my arm and chest. He told me to find a Thoracic specialist to proceed from there. I went in the phone book and found Dr. Russell Carlson. Since this past summer, I have had a serious pain in my left upper chest. It often feels like someone is kneeling on it. This is why I sought help. 
I got an appointment with him fairly fast: he wasn't sure what was causing the pain veins to be inflamed, and wrote some prescriptions for me to have a veinogram and CAT scan. I got the CAT scan right away and set up an appointment for the veinogram, both at Catholic Health System facilities. Dr. Carlson called me after getting the CAT scan results, saying there was something irregular in both the inferior vena cava and juggler veins. He recommended that I see Dr. Linda Harris, a vascular specialist at Millard Fillmore Hospital in Downtown Buffalo.  Again, I set up an appointment. In the meantime, I had the veingoram at Mercy Hospital and that doctor told me there was nothing irregular. 
When I saw Doctor Harris, she almost immediately on seeing me, stated that I looked like I had Marfans, explaining that it was a genetic disorder that might be the cause of my body shape. I have always been tall and skinny. That has always made me feel a bit different. By skinny, I mean 6"" 2' and 150 lbs. She set up another veinogram, and I left feeling that finally someone can explain why I am the way I am, and also help me with the chronic pain I have had for many years. 
The veinogram was set up at the hospital for 2pm, and I had to be there at noon. In the directions, it also recommended that I set up a driver. I got there a little early, was admitted to a room, dressed in a hospital gown, answered some questions, and watched TV while I waited. Why I had to be admitted is unknown to me now? I laid there for over two hours going on three and was eventually taken down: rolled down in my bed. Tha girl who escorted me was an excellent aide and person. She did struggle to get the full-sized hospital bed into the elevator. She left me in the hall outside of the ""operating room"" for anther 45 minutes. The time came, and I was rolled onto the room where the procedure was to take place.  
I was a bit nervous, but had gone through a venogram at Mercy just a month before. I didn't realize that this was going to be a lot different. My left arm was taped to a plank and I got some injections of a numbing agent. I thought I was going to get a shot of dye and some pictures of my chest taken. I got something inserted into my veins, and it felt very uncomfortable. I tried to think about something else to take my mind off of it but couldn't. I started to have an anxiety attack and my legs began to move erratically. This test took 45 minutes or longer. Like I was instructed to do I had set up a rife there and back. I couldn't ask someone to sit in a lobby or waiting room for hours, so the ride was coming at four o'clock. I figured the test at two, she told me it would take 45 minutes, so that seemed a reasonable time to set for him to return. We live in West Seneca, and it isn't close to the hospital. I was supposed to have a venogram of my head done also, but was too upset from the procedure to go through anymore. I got back to my room, got dressed and left feeling like someone just beat me up.
I called the Doctor's office a few days later and set up a follow up appointment. Dr. Harris's PA came in first and explained that nothing was irregular was found except a surface vein was collapsed and that was nothing to worry about. She left, and Dr. Harris came in, standing just inside the door. She told me that she found nothing but that surface vein which is ""the most used and abused vein"" on the body. I asked about Marfan's, and she said I should talk to my regular doctor. I asked about the pain? She told me to see a orthopedic surgeon and walked out. I sunk in my chair, got up and followed her where she stood with her back to me at a desk. Where I initially thought I had an answer, I now felt like I wasted months of time and insurance money.
 
I am writing this to let you know that:
1. My time spent in a bed at Millard Fillmore was a waste of my time and insurance company money.
2. Whatever the doctor's of any personal opinion of my situation (if that is the case?), to run a patient through a test like that with nothing but topical anesthesia was almost inhumane, it was at minimum extremely physically disturbing.
3. Her abrupt treatment of me in the follow up was, to say the least, was saddening. What she told me in less than a minute could have been done over the phone and not having me to come into Buffalo again, pay to park, wasted my time, and charged to my insurance company.
4. I had to do my own search on Marfan's and discovered I now need to see a rheumotologist and would have wasted another month or two chasing the wrong answer again. Regardless of anything, I am an individual person and my time is a valuable as anyones. I felt like I was rubber-stamped and sent on my way like my symptoms were imagined. I guess I expected a more compassionate or may be more guiding doctor. I would like all unadulterated records from her assessment and notes sent to the address below or I can pick them up. I will pay postage. I am not the type person to legally do anything, I just want you to know I will not use your facilities nor staff again. The attending staff, nurses, and aides we're all excellent. Thank You,

I called Dr. Carlson after the procedure and he didnt remember the problems detected with the CAT scan and only referred to Dr. Harriss final analysis.

										Most states have abuse laws where you can't leave a patient being abused without reporting the situation.  In Ohio if you report bad orthopedic or medical care, you have your license pulled for 'making too much of bad care;' for seeing the abuse and problems that you were trained to correct.  As in the HG Wells Country of the Blind story, in Ohio any sight means that you need counseling.  There are no medical mistake laws, so mistakes happen and are covered up.  Not reporting something that has no real material effect is one thing, looking the other way while fractures don't have casts and patients aren't allowed blood work is another - even for a medical license.  No neglect is too bad to look the other way for in Ohio - it's the country of the blind. Everything at the State Medical Board of Ohio is 'confidential' - so bad care is covered up for friends of Board Members.  Against state law, friend physicians get their patient complaints and counter-complain or go after the complainer's license - so the care is never improved.  Physicians that can't do medical, orthopedic, or surgical care can do counter-complaints against colleagues than can.  Women MDs are not allowed proper casting of fractures (because they are 'seductive' that way), physical therapy, blood work or a medical license if they don't like the game.  Dr. Angelo Licata is now withholding care of bone problems so that the Cleveland Clinic shoulder department can get more fractures - and it's working - he just orders a yearly TSH and a biennial vitamin D if the woman physician complains - and the women MDs continue to fracture with that care.  Is that what Dr. Licata is teaching medical students?  One hopes not - because someone deserves better care and a better workup in 2012.  And the insurances will pay for better care if one has a moment to do it in between continuous drug company dinners and lectures.  But the Cleveland Clinic doesn't want that money - they just want the procedural monies.That's how the Cleveland Clinic gets their business; let the patient fracture is the mantra - the medical students & residents need the experience seeing fractures that should be prevented in 2012.  The black help will help by watching while women MDs try to move 300lb OR beds for 'kicks' - it's 'prejudice' to have maintenance do their jobs.  The bone meds are for the drug company honorarium talks - not women MDs.  Three metabolic bone physicians does not get one treated at Cleveland Clinic; more cost-effective to do nothing - they won't interfere.  Dr. Chad Deal will let women MDs fracture no matter how high the Fracture Index - he does only what the Medical Board tells him to do without a second thought or even a first.  Women physicians just have to have 'aequanimitas' about this - per Anita Steinbergh DO - a Medical Board Member who needs a mental status exam - needed one 20 years ago before she got appointed to the State Medical Board.  And she will probably be reappointed this year for a fifth term, as Governor Kasich hasn't a clue.The situation at the State Medical Board of Ohio is Kafkaesque and critical - where women physicians are supposed to get treated so that they don't notice that the orthopedic is not thinking correctly, and hasn't ordered any cast material - just a party tray from a local deli.  Cast padding, Dr. Nice saves that for the polo ponies - and the elderly patients that he mostly cares for don't notice the difference.  The ERs run by Dr. Carla O'Day's Emergency Service just put women physicians in conference rooms and make them watch the orthopedics and staff eat pizza.  Dr. O'Day knows where to get good pizza.  Dr. O'Day was on the State Medical Board for awhile in the 1990s, and no care is too bad for a colleague of hers from Medical School.  Dr. O'Day wants her competitors continually psychiatrically evaluated at state expense = every classmate's dream of getting back at the A student who can pass the tests that no one else can (creepy Streepy) = state subsidized bullying of women physicians who just want a life.  Carla O'Day MD is one toned bully.There are many problems, and many mistakes in Ohio care, but leaving fractures uncasted, bone conditions untreated, and punishing women physicians by making them take Rorschach inkblot tests where the answers are not recorded, publishing diagnoses on them that don't exist and that they have no criteria for, and continuing to let them fracture without treatment of a serious bone condition that they have -- needs to stop.  But Dr. Licata isn't going to treat the bone condition.  This isn't about ethics, it is just plain stupid.   The evaluations of women MDs produce diagnoses that don't exist, which are published at state cost on the Medical Board's website - where nothing is too false to leave out-of-print.  Women MDs are continually overtested at every juncture in Medical School and training - so having any new findings of psychiatric fact would be pretty suspect if any Medical Board Member thought about it; but how many times can a woman physician be psychiatrically evaluated and tested in Ohio? - the number is over 5.  Rorschachs shouldn't be ordered at local shopping plazas above Chinese restaurants, and evaluations of women physicians shouldn't be done at Columbus day care community centers in the play rooms.  And no state, or court, uses Rorschach testing anymore - it's medieval - but not in Ohio.  Governor Kasich doesn't know this however - he's still trying to figure things out; he knows how to manage a State Medical Board?  First off, you don't let everything be 'confidential' or things are really screwed up.     Governor Kasich campaigned to fix the horrendous problems at the State Medical Board of Ohio - and so far he's done nothing but make things worse.  And physicians are dying because of it, call his office to ask that he please look at the problems, and he's doing nothing - the contact is Brad Reynolds (talking head #1).  There is a stack of false Medical Board cases that were all supposed to be opened in 1999 for REFORMS.  There are physicians with licenses suspended for nothing more than objecting to the admittedly wrong of themselves by practitioners totally 'out to lunch' about anything regarding women's medical care.  There is no other State Medical Board that does these things.  Physicians are trained to recognize wrong vs right care, and to say something to save patients or themselves - not to lose their licenses for trying to stop ADMITTEDLY bad care and behaviours.  Someone needs to clue in Governor Kasich that women with fractures are not 'seductive.' 									",Doctors

										The first question in the MKSAP 15 (Medical Knowledge Self-Assessment Program) for Internists is about how to handle medical mistakes and readsITEM 1: An 83-year old man is hospitalized for cholecystitis.  He is prescribed subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, 5000 units every 8 hours, for prevention of venous thromboembolism.  By accident, the nurse uses a vial with a more concentrated heparin and administers 50,000 units to the patient.  She immediately tells her supervisor.  An incident report is filed and an immediate PTT is requested.  When or under which circumstances should the error be reported to the patient?  (A) As soon as possible; (B) If additional therapy is required; (C) If the PTT is greater than 100 sec; (D) If there is clinical bleeding.  And the answer is A, and the purpose of the question for the certifying of internists is to understand disclosures relating to medical errors = something that the State Medical Board of Ohio does not understand.  Does anyone on the State Medical Board recertify?   Medical errors happen every day; drug, surgical, orthopedic, gynecological, pediatric, obstetric, etc., and the only thing that sets physicians apart is how they handle these errors - the checklist for medical mistakes.  But when the State Medical Board of Ohio, instead of admitting care errors, wants the physician-patient punished that she brought this problem to their attention - to get therapy for this 'personality disorder' of being honest that there are problems - there is a compounding of medical errors resulting in a ruined health career to show for the situation.  Disclosure of medical error is not a psychiatric diagnosis - some errors can be looked the other way for - but that doesn't mean that the mistake won't happen again.  Even a discussion of clinical near-misses might prevent a 'miss.'    State Medical Boards are supposed to have a policy for physicians, hospitals, medical facilities, nurses, etc. on medical error in 2012 - and not be punishing anyone that brings these situations to their attention.  Medical 'whistleblowers' just want to get the care corrected - it's not a personal thing or even for damages - just for the patient to live or recover.  No one wants to 'tell' on a colleague, but letting someone die or suffer medical complications is unethical if not stupid.The charts need to be sent before 2 years or 20.  Medical errors happen in Ohio, they happen in Pennsylvania - but Pennsylvania has medical mistake laws and a lawyer Governor.In general, and State Medical Boards need to help physicians with this, physicians should disclose to patients information about procedural or judgment errors, and unanticipated results happening in the course of patient care - if it can avert, prevent, or modify an adverse event that might occur, or has occurred, and will be made worse if the staff tries to cover up the mistake.  Errors that are material to, or make a difference in, the patient's well-being need to be disclosed.  This means casts not applied before terrible swelling and deformity (excrescence) develops from trying to use a fractured extremity (physician shopping for polo ponies), casts applied wrongly or without x-ray confirmation (physician partying), lab work not done or lost (physician's office goofed), lab work not ordered but indicated (no differential diagnosis), physical therapy not ordered, and labs or x-rays misread.  Anything that starts an error sequence, needs to be reported to stop, undo, or lessen the bad care outcome - to get the consults, or the drug to reverse the effects of the overdose.  Lies never make anything better.  But in Ohio, because of the State Medical Board, errors are lied about and then compound because the next care of the patient, or physician-patient, never fixes the problem that is the 'elephant in the room' and can't be admitted.  And physician-patients are the worst off in this scenario, as medical licenses are then taken for 'making too much of bad care' - to let the statute of limitations expire for the error - so that Anita Steinbergh DO doesn't have to hear about it again.   Most patients, or physician-patients, don't want to go to court with the mistake, as they feel guilty that they went to the wrong physician or didn't try hard enough to get referred (didn't see that the physician was not capable or able to solve the problem), but they do want the mistake admitted and TAKEN CARE OF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE before 2 weeks, 2 years, or 19 years.  Being 'had' is painful, but not being able to 'take that Marilyn Monroe tattoo off' is even more painful.  Killing someone with silence is not the answer; letting the 83-year old bleed out before admitting what happened is not the answer.  Yes he was 83, but that doesn't mean that he didn't 'deserve' proper care.After 19 years, an untreated metabolic bone condition is much worse than what it was 19 years ago when a physician at St. Louis University wanted to treat it - but the State Medical Board of Ohio disagreed that it was just 'psychiatric' - to cover for the 'friend' physician who goofed.  And now the Cleveland Clinic is blaming the State Medical Board in their notes, but not fixing the problem afraid that the Medical Board will go after one of them.  Blame games don't solve problems.    After a decade, an autoimmune thyroid problem is much worse, has destroyed a part or most of the thyroid gland, and might have gone to cancer or lymphoma - and it's important for a woman physician that those outcomes NOT HAPPEN.  And her life, health, and career have been ruined - she did not get to have even one child even though they would have had to monitor her thyroid during the pregnancy, they didn't while she had a medical license - no need to check that.  And with the 83-year old, he might have clinical bleeding.  But if the nursing supervisor or physician is immediately told, then protamine sulfate or heparinase can be administered to reverse the effect of 50,000 units before any clinical bleeding occurs.  But in Ohio, the nurse will be afraid to tell her supervisor or the physician - delays will cause clinical bleeding - and the family will eventually know but after the damage is done - which can be a GI bleed, a subdural/intracranial bleed, or some benign bruising - depends on the clinical condition of the patient in many regards.     The thinking is in Ohio, for physicians & nurses, to LIE, accuse the patient of being difficult and senile, and make every excuse except to admit that a mistake happened; the patient is just crazy and doesn't deserve care.  The thinking in Ohio is that if a patient is crazy, then they didn't deserve care, and it was ok to make a mistake = DR. NICE quote.  This happens every day; the surgical technologist doesn't realize that part of the surgical tray, or OR equipment, was not sterilized until too late in the procedure.  The physician doesn't find out until the patient spikes a fever post-op, and four days have gone by without adequate antibiotic prophylaxis of the errorThe Medical Board hears & decides a case, then 19 years later realizes that the lab work was omitted, and the physicians lied about the care - took them long enough, but still asap the patient should know - and there needs to be an administrative procedure for handling medical mistakes and the wrong judgments on those mistakes at the Ohio State Medical Board.  Physician need to improve medical care, and lying about errors needs to be somehow stopped.  Really it's not the mistakes that need the discipline.  Most errors have no intent to harm; it's the lying about the mistakes that are intentionally harmful -  while the patient crashes or has a complication and everyone looks 'dumb.'  The State Medical Board of Ohio - like 40+ other states - needs to have some form of medical mistake laws to protect patients and physician-patients; so that the women physician doesn't lose her license for making too much of bad care after miraculously surviving the boys being boys admittedly bad care.  Medical 'near misses' are just as painful, the recoveries are very long, and the emotional damages are real - but won't be solved by a new right Ohio psychiatrist for the State Medical Board.  A 'sorry' goes a long way, an acknowledgement of the error, and helping the person get back to health or practice - every day that the person is back to work they regain a part of themselves.  A discussion of the 'elephant in the room' helps prevent this error again, and gives 'how to handle this' care paradigms to other health professionals.  Governor Kasich needs to consider the implementation of medical mistake laws.             ",Doctors

										I went to Dr Larsen in 2009, he explaned to me that I had a lot of scar tissue that needed to be removed, and that this would clear up my pain in my stomach that I was having. Well on 06/11/09 I went into surgery.. I had explaned to him that I was very scared because of past experiances. When I came out of surgery I spoke with the dr with my husband, and he said I had a lot of scar tissue, and that my bowle was mangled very badly.Well on 07/30/09 I went back into surgery to correct the bowel. He told me I would not have to worry aout surgery no more because he corrected everything need to be done. Well low and behold I had to go back into surgery on06/06/11 because of my appendix, it was that time that I was told that I not only had scar tissue but it was massive. It was still so bad he had to cut me open and my 30 min. Surgery turned into 5 hours. Peple don't go to this dr inless you like to be cut on because even after 32 staples and 5 week of recovery I still hurt very badly because of the scar tissue.

										Governor Kasich:  You are allowing that State Medical Board Members misuse the 'confidential' physician complaint system for their own interest, and in the interests of 'friend' physicians.  It has been going on for 20 plus years actually.  Reason:  the allowing of 'confidential' physician complaints at the State Medical Board of Ohio - when almost every other state has done away with this policy.  Do you not speak with other Governors? Patients have nothing to benefit from any review of their situation that is 'confidential,' and just because things are not confidential does not mean that things go into public records.  The Medical Board Members in Ohio are not legally trained, not well medically trained & without residencies many times, and not with good judgment in their personal lives - yet they are the standard for other physicians without any external review.  With confidential' physician complaints, the real facts can never come out.  Other witnesses that the patient doesn't know about cannot come forward at the 'confidential' State Medical Board of Ohio, or wont because of their license  even to help the physician.  If there is no negligence found - taking this to a court of law, or trying for a settlement, will go nowhere even with the 'unconfidential' facts that might be in the patient's favor.  Standards of care can't be 'fixed,' or reviewed, as everything is 'confidential.'  The Medical Board is really for the fixing of standards  not damages; discipline should be for breaking standards of patient care, not personal hatreds.  'Confidential' limits the facts of a case to what the Medical Board wants to see as findings of fact.Friend physicians of State Medical Board Members will always 'win' at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Their complaints will be thrown out before they are investigated, and the worst physicians have the 'best' friends.  The Medical Board in Ohio does not investigate every case - and friend cases can be put at the bottom of the endless file or conveniently lost  no one knows they exist.  Certain Members put certain cases ahead for money. Trying to get an outdated care standard, or new procedural guidelines, reviewed usually leads to the loss of licensure of the physician 'making too much of admittedly bad medical care.'  The boys can continue to behave as boys in Ohio, as Dr. Steinbergh thinks that women physicians just need to have more 'aequanimitas' for this, ie for sexual harassments and comments.  The term was not meant to excuse the Dragon Tattoo kind of abuse of women colleagues.  At the time that Osler coined the word, the first classes of women were just going through Hopkins - and these women were treated quite well as women entrepreneurs in the Baltimore community were funding the Medical School at Johns Hopkins - with the condition that the women got in and got through ie that they practiced. The medical mistakes in Ohio can continue to happen, as there is no improvement in the paradigms, or medical care that caused the problem.  Other physicians will continue to make the mistake with a bad standard of care or no OR checklist about the care = why the New England Journal of Medicine recently published at least one orthopedic surgical mistake case  where damages were paid.  At the Ohio State Medical Board, there's cheating that never comes to light in every aspect ofthe case and investigation; physicians are told to lie up front (by Board Members & their respective legislators) to end their cases.  No damages are ever paid in Ohio to falsely accused physicians - unlike in other states.  Ohio is one of the few states without some form of MEDICAL MISTAKE laws.The Medical Board can change the 'confidential' complaint many times unbeknownst to the complainer, or the physician, trying to defend themselves.  At least several ongoing cases have been changed multiple times  which is a legislative joke.  Jim Trakas is probably using this maneuver at the State Board of Cosmetology - he covered up the practice at the State Medical Board as a legislator.  Ask Jim Trakas about what goes on.Most states refuse to accept 'confidential' physician complaints anymore (RI), because of the cost of false investigations and the LIABILITY damages to the state.  No one has the money for thesecolleague-colleague fist fights - and the women MDs get beaten up in offices.  When male physicians can't try something on anyone else, they do it on women colleagues - who can't complain or the boys will see that they never practice again. Neither you, or Brad Reynolds, have figured things out, i.e. how cases go at the State Medical Board. Neither of you can even get an estimate of what one false physician investigation costs the state - but someone knows this at the State Medical Board of Ohio - it's just confidential - the cost even. In Ohio there's very little change in Board Membership - Anita Steinbergh DO has been there for 20 years (4 terms), Lance Talmadge MD for about 3 terms, and Mr. Whitehouse for 5 years - despite who's in the Governor's Office.  And they will probably all be continued, or re-appointed, by the Health Committee in the Ohio Senate.  Physicians with friends get their 'confidential' complaints against state law - so that they can counter-complain instead of solving the problems.  Then the counter-complaint is acted on, not the original problem.  And the confidential complaint law never gets changed, as the physicians who would need to change it, get the law broken for them  for privileges, contracts and hospital appointments  hard to track in any ethical sense.   The State of Texas had to recently stop doing this as the President of the State Medical Board was having her husband complain 'confidentially' about certain colleague competitors - and the state taxpayers were paying for these fights.  The Executive Director let it go on.  Patients were then getting the 'worse' end of this medical competition battle for services - patients need to be able to get different options on care, e.g. seek different options for cancer treatments. Second, Medical Board Members are using their powers to misuse psychiatric evaluations and testing - to order Medical School classmates - or complainers - to these exams to see what they will show. These are exams without the usual indications, ordered on physician colleagues without criteria for these exams = fishing expeditions = the physicians health insurance wont pay as the reason is confidential. They are tests administered by Ohio-proclaimed 'Board experts.'  There isn't a Board expert that looks 'normal' in Ohio.  Psychiatric testing & evaluations are then admittedly fudged, and cheated on, to take MD licenses on a provisional basis - and there's no return from 'provisional' to 'clearance' anytime soon.  Repeat testing isexpensive, emotionally damaging, and very hard to get anyone to do objectively even out-of-state.  Even when repeat testing shows the cheating, the Ohio Medical Board refuses to accept the findings of the 'outside' expert  they publish the facts of the opinions that they paid for.  Only evaluations fudged in Ohio, done by experts approved by the Ohio State Medical Board (talking heads), are accepted = kangaroo court.  Complaints signed by State Medical Board Members possibly banking on, or benefiting, from cases need to all be reviewed from 1990 onward - there have been a quite a few of these - some of which cases are still unresolved after a decade or more of the goaround cheating and appeals process.  The Ohio State Court of Appeals cant get confidential files to hear cases and recommend reforms. The Medical Board Members, and Board caseworkers, just urge that the physician with no patient complaints admit the false confidential case to get 'back to the good care of patients.  When the cheating, and fixing of evaluations, is brought up, the Medical Board just wants another 'go' at the physician  the Medical Board never admits that they cheat, but the legislators do. In a court of law, if the court could get the files, the case would be dismissed - so the out-of-money physician is then told to 'sue the state.'  There's no way to dismiss a false case at the State Medical Board of Ohio - the cheating can go on for decades and Ohio legislators vote for the monies to do this. This wastes physician careers and lots of money; each false case costs the State Medical Board of Ohio anywhere from $250,000 to $500,000 or more.  Most states have gotten rid of 'confidential' complaints because of the COST of false investigations - especially those investigations of physicians where colleagues with conflicts-of-interest have complained.In the 'confidential' system, the 'confidential' person does not have to prove anything or testify for questioning or to see if what they are saying sounds 'right;' the unconfidential physician has their whole life & career laid bare because the case is not limited to the complaint - so dating histories are discussed at taxpayer expense.  Most real judges want the person testifying in court for them to 'see' and question.Present state legislators (Grendell, Husted, Hollington), and former ones (Trakas, Dolan), know of this misuse of the 'confidential' complaint system in Ohio, and the falsified physician psychiatry (diagnoses that don't exist used to take the licenses of physicians with no patient complaints).  The problem is that the taxpayers are paying for these false cases, for the testing that is 'cheated' on, and for the loss of good physicians.  There's a stack of these physician cases at the State Medical Board of Ohio that were supposed to be opened in 1998 for reforms.  The problem: is that you are ignoring the problem, and it's much worse corruption than was going on in Cuyahoga County - where the payoffs weren't killing anyone with bad medical care.",Doctors

										Dr. Stellato is the Medical Director of University Suburban Green Road medical facility, and has a long history of achievements at University Hospitals.  But his latest foray into medical care is a bit of a bust.  Dr. Stellato is not trained in Medicine, rather in Bariatric Surgery, and yet he can't repair some abdominal muscles, but has the patient reported to the police for asking - he can't discuss for 5 minutes even with a family member.  Dr. Stellato should be able to say who can do a particular repair, as he was the Hubay Professor of Surgery for years, and nearly the Chief of Surgery at University Hospitals.  And he should be more of a participant in the surgical education there, despite the fact that Dr. Ponsky - his senior - was chosen.  Rivalries are good for medicine & surgery, they foster different ideas and competition to improve things is a good thing. Dr. Ponsky was writing surgical literature when Dr. Stellato was still a Chief Resident.  Not everyone can be Chief, and you can't show that you are good with teaching unless you keep at it = unless you show for Surgical Rounds and put in a comment for discussion once in awhile.  The residents in Surgery at UH are not getting an experience of Cleveland surgeons, they are getting a lesson in politics - which they didn't come to Cleveland or UH for.  But to just not be able to say who can repair such-and-such to a colleague is just 'nasty.'  Steve Jobs was fired from the company he founded, and yet he created Pixar Studios.  Threatening someone because they put something on the Internet that Dr. Stellato won't 'discuss,' is not ok.  Just be a Steve Jobs and everyone can say wonderful things - just answer the questions.  Just spend 5 minutes discussing instead of 30 complaining to the police department - and the police department should not have someone's 'confidential' records from any UH facility.   Who does repair abdominal muscles anymore, muscles cut by a Mayo Clinic surgeon doing a procedure that was not consented to?  Muscles cut for the Israel Defense Fund, or some child's college fund, apparently?  The layered muscle fascia closure - who does it?  Simple question.  The repair only involves sewing some muscle fascias in a layered closure: Surgery residency 101 - a procedure taught in training 20 years ago.  Yet everyone these days wants to do a common mass closure and create a painful disfiguring abdominal wall deformity?  Even for robot and endoscope port holes, these excrescences are becoming hard for other health care colleagues to handle or excuse - it's just sloppy surgery and you can't keep injecting these tissue masses.   It takes only one pack of running suture = the reason? surgeons can't use more than one pack of running suture is?  Dr. Stellato should be able to answer the question without the SE police department.  And if he could answer the question on that one: the answer would be all over the internet if he had a repair.  Dr. Grundfest says that she has a repair, but she really doesn't, but that it would involve extensive surgery.  Translation: lots of money for the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.  And Dr. Stellato can't even see being a bariatric metabolic surgeon, that a T4 is not the workup for a thyroid problem - and he did thyroid surgery as part of his residency training.  And that if a patient has obesity, or anything that could be caused by thyroid, ie thyroid neuropathy - then you have to order the whole panel before taking the patient to surgery?  He seems to have forgotten this.  Dr. Stellato's secretary/office manager is one of the few that can't call a patient, or a physician, to confirm an appointment or a surgery - then she blames it on the patient or referring physician that they didn't get her message or get through to her.  Even hair salons can do this - but she can't - and then she blames the patient for standing Dr. Stellato up - when the patient had not gotten confirmation to come or the time, no pre-op sheets given, mailed, faxed or emailed.  And communication modalities have improved - you can text or twitter.  But to call the SE police on people/patients that you do this to is just plain crazy and stupid.  Stupid for all the University Healthcare System to be part of that kind of behavior.  And the management agrees with Dr. Stellato on who he blames for his problems - yet Dr. Rosen sent the patient back to Dr. Stellato for a reason.  Show Dr. Rosen the muscle repair and he might have some respect for Dr. Stellato.    Patients, and physicians, think that because of Dr. Stellato's achievements his advice might be worth getting, so they ask.  But they don't want to be accused of things that they couldn't do, or surgeries that they thought they had cancelled, and never gotten the pre-op instructions for, because of another health problem.  And the fact is that C**** does not do things the way that other office managers do; she won't call the second number, won't leave a message, won't confirm - no matter how many Secretary Day's gifts she collects.   									",Doctors

										Governor Kasich knows the problems at the State Medical Board - he campaigned to 'fix' them.  But the 'confidential' physician complaint system continues - where a complained about physician can't defend themselves or even know what they are accused of for decades - the physician is supposed to admit the 'confidential' - whatever that is.  Things would end in 5 minutes if the physician could defend themselves properly - know the accusation and who signed it.Whole cases can be for just 'making too much of bad care' - just reporting the problems.  Bad medical care is the norm in Ohio, and any business moving here will not be happy - we have Governor moonstruck - off on himself.  Meanwhile piles of hearsay lies about physicians, with no names attached, are put into public records - at cost to the state.  One physician has boxes about her, with not one truth - it is all imagined, exaggerated, and invented.  The imaginations of people at the State Medical Board of Ohio are limitless - like in the Bradley Cooper movie, they seem to be on drugs.  And how can anyone admit a constantly changing 'confidential' complaint?  How can a woman physician be 'seductive' with two swollen excrescent wrist fractures?  The Medical Board of Ohio will believe ANYTHING in it's quest to destroy any decent physician's life and future - it's not about patient complaints, it's about who you know.  With the 'confidential' complaint system - everything else about the physician is unconfidentialed; their dating history, their medical history, their educational achievements made fun of, etc. for public amusement and jokes.Senator Grendell has some jokes about how the Medical Board cheats - he's really 'sensitive' about telling them in front of the physician's mother too.  It's just a joke, as it's not his life, and he doesn't CARE about how much money is wasted this way, or his staff.  You are supposed to say that it's just a CME problem when an employer asks, well it isn't and lying is beneath any legislator in any state except Ohio.  Senator Grendell has got the most out-of-it staff around; not a clue about how any other states do things at their Medical Boards or about the reforms needed in Ohio.  And because of the reciprocity of medical licenses, things have to be done in sort of the same ways at these Medical Boards.  No one denies their fees, just their use of them in Ohio.  And eventually this abuse will lead to a National Board system - and what's going on in Ohio will be the reason given to the public.  Then the State of Ohio won't get these fees.For women MDs - their Fellowships are destroyed - destroying the best in Ohio - no achievement is too undoable.  They will call the American College of Physicians feeding them a pile of lies, ie Mr. Tom Dilling did this and it continues under Rick Whitehouse - who has no understanding of women's medicine and the care problems in Ohio.  Dilling thought that all women were bipolar; no criteria required - he hated women - women MDs were top of the list.  The Governors seem to pick Executive Directors that hate women. As MDs we get through medical training to change outdated care, to make things better, and if we try to ask for the 'right' care for ourselves - our medical license in Ohio is pulled.  You are just supposed to use aequanimitas, to 'understand' and accept the bad care - it makes for a lot of psychiatry consults for bad care.  The pill-mill physicians are only capitalizing on the bad care outcomes of the other physicians - there's a lot of that in Ohio.  Why Governor Kasich only targeted that group is unknown; they are just doing the scut care that no other physician will do as pain management does not have a procedural code = bottomfeeding in the medical money hierarchy.The Ohio State Medical Board is into destroying every physician except for themselves and their 'friends.'  And the roster changes very little as there are no appointment term limits.  Everything is outed to get a case that isn't in the 'confidential' complaint = a real case.  No one knows how many false cases are started as 'fishing expeditions' - but there are hundreds each year where the 'confidential' does not allow the checking of the facts before things get out-of-control.  And this is done to very well educated people; physicians.  When the Board doesn't find a case, and there are no patient complaints, there is no resolution possible - the stack of these cases just accumulates and Governor Kasich doesn't have a clue as to even the numbers and the costs.  Every other Board is on a budget - notso the State Medical Board of Ohio.  There is no way to reverse a wrong judgment, pay the physician damages or get the physician back to practice - every other state has this recognizing that about 10-25% or more of the time - the Medical Boards are wrong - they are given the wrong information.  The physicians on the State Medical Board of Ohio make mistakes, or wrong diagnoses in patient care, about 25% of the time = their Internet ratings = probably paid for advertisement.  The real rate of Medical Board, and Member, medical mistakes is probably more like 50% - they are never the best physicians, but they are the measuring stick for everyone else.There's no way to dismiss a false case, the Medical Board just tries to find another case or won't answer the phone - they need another 'go' and another 'go' and it never ends, ie the 'goes.'  Governor Kasich thinks that Brad Reynolds is on the case, and he can't answer any question about the State Medical Board that you ask - he knows nothing.  And the Governor won't discuss the problems with any physicians. With women MDs this 'confidential' can be other professional colleagues who they have refused to 'service' for personal understanding, for office staff & space needs, or patient referrals; anything can be converted into a generic 'impairment' at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  It has nothing to do with reality.  Dr. Carla O'Day - on the Ohio Medical Board until 1993, even though she never completed a formal residency program and had one of the messiest divorces in Ohio legal history - went through a medical class list from Case Western Reserve School of Medicine - signing complaints and overseeing the investigations of classmates - who had no patient complaints, but didn't like how she ran (or didn't run) the ER at Hillcrest Hospital = not well.   She threatened the Deans in Medical School, and was a political student that rarely used the library.  People who just were not her BFF in Medical School were targeted, and she participated as the lead investigator in these cases even though it was a conflict-of-interest.  She profited with the official title of ER Director Hillcrest Hospital, and the contracts = the money.  Board Members can profit from Medical Board cases in Ohio, and it is all 'confidential;' no one has the facts to question anything, and no court can overrule Medical Board decisions - they can't get the files.      Any patient that goes near Dr. O'Day at Southwest General is a stupid fool - you deserve what you get or if she drags you into Rocky River Municipal Court for calling about questions.  She is a monster who started out as a prison social worker; she knows how to destroy you as only the worst of criminals would know - she's very street smart and an accomplished liar.  In Ohio, you just have to disagree with a medical care paradigm that is outdated to run afoul of the State Medical Board of Ohio; everything out-of-date is allowed.  Any physician who goes near Dr. O'Day for any medical care takes their medical license into their hands, ditto Dr. Timothy Nice, and Dr. Michael Keith of MetroHealth.  At MetroHealth students, residents & attendings should stay far away from Dr. Keith; when a mistake happens he will want you to get counseling so that you don't sue, and put it on the chart (talk to your mother if need be about his not being sued), and all he has to do is try to salvage the care - but he won't.  Dr. Keith doesn't know about lab work - you have to explain - and he doesn't really believe in bone density testing - try explaining that to him as at one MD tried.  This complaining about MDs that are a physician's competition was also happening at the State Medical Board of Texas and they finally stopped it, or some of it, but not in Ohio - the Board Members can complain about classmates, colleague physicians, business partners, spouses, or physicians that they made the wrong diagnosis on, etc.  To this date, Governor Kasich has appointed no one new to the State Medical Board of Ohio - Mr. Whitehouse remains in place covering up.  Status quo: no change.Fractures are allowed to ripen to excrescences, lab values for thyroid panels only have to include a T4 (not even a medical student would get away with this), and the 'confidential' can be from physicians/others who just don't like the physician as he/she had to disagree about a care practice or the behaviors of some physicians.    The Governor does nothing; and confidential physician complaints are used in only ONE other state for good reasons.  And Texas, even with a Governor on the run, has managed to at least put a slight reform law into effect; they can't take anonymous complaints, but the physician(s) hitting on the woman MD can still file a 'confidential' complaint.Confidential physician complaints have no place in 2012 - if a person can't sign a complaint with a name then the complaint is not verifiable.  Other witnesses can't come forward to give their testimony about what was really going on - and that is not the task of a psychiatrist to figure that out.  But to have a Medical Board insisting on repetitive psychiatric evaluations, when 5 evaluations have no problems except when the Medical Board cheated, is wrong.  Repetitve psychiatric evaluations in normal people cause emotional damage.  The Medical Board of Ohio should not be diagnosing physicians, mandating treatments or evaluations that are just political.  There are criteria for psychiatric evaluations & diagnoses, criteria for medical problems, and standards for fracture care and thyroiditis diagnosis. The Medical Board of Ohio thinks that you don't have to do blood work on a physician patient - it's all psychiatric.  And you can't leave physicians with abnormal thyroid values - it can go to cancer or lymphoma = they don't care.  And there's an epidemic of thyroid problems in Ohio, teens getting thryoid cancers, and no labs are ordered until the last minute IF the physician knows the labs to order.  The Medical Board of Ohio accepts just a T4 as a thyroid panel - and you only need one of those in 20-some years.  Women MDs don't 'deserve' blood work, but every other 49 states allow care-to-function before taking a woman MD's medical license.  Every other state Governor Kasich.That Governor Kasich doesn't 'get' what's going on is the sad part.  Until then, one can only ignore the physicians that will sell out another physician for money: Dr. Carla O'Day, Dr. Tim Nice, Dr. Michael Keith, Dr. Fred Suppes, Dr. Robert Botti, and Dr. Tozzi (podiatrist).  They know the other names to avoid - names that the physician(s) they complained about never knew.  Physicians, spouses, etc can complaint about physicians in Ohio even though the physician does not know the complainers - never saw them.  That's pretty stupid - to take medical licenses based on complaints signed by names that never knew the person being complained about.          									",Doctors

Cleveland, Ohio","
										Male medical students on clerkships, at every Medical School, seem to have bets on who will collect the pot of the first male student to do a practice pelvic on a woman classmate, a woman attending or community MD, or a big-name woman professional patient or celebrity.  It's a competition every ob-gyn clerkship rotation - how far can the guys get without someone realizing that they are just the MEDICAL STUDENT.Every year, there seems to be a special 'Honors' associated with doing the 'dirty' on a woman professional - with big hands - and telling about it later.  The more good-looking, the bigger the pro football hands, the harder the pass attempt.  It's never a secret who medical students care for on clerkships - classmates, attendings, and community physicians get put in a special category bin to try things on, and have things put into the rumor mill about.  'Confidential' is never really respected with medical students.  Medical students don't know what 'confidential' means, and they are into bragging to girlfriends, parents, friends, classmates and Facebook about what they did that day or week.      But it's 2012, and it's very disconcerting to have a male medical student tailing a woman ob-gyn who has a scheduled woman MD patient next at Beachwood Cleveland Clinic Ob-Gyn = the premier burb Clinic of the Beachwood suburb = where women go for a moment of privacy.  No one wants to go down as one of the first 10 pelvic exams of a male medical student going for Honors on ob-gyn clerkship - consent is required, and they don't know this, and they don't what anything feels like yet.  And my year of Medical School that Honors in ob-gyn when to a looker-guy who had absolutely no interest in pursuing ob-gyn -- just women -- so he was getting his 'experience' that way - learning his way around down there like Steven Hawking would like to.  And it seems to be the Bradley Cooper look-a-likes that try this.  These Bradleys assume that the woman MD patient will be so entranced with the guy's superficial attributes, that she will submit herself blissfully to his BIG CLUMSY HANDS; his first 'fumble' on the job of being an ob-gyn for two months.  And it's the woman MD patient, and the medical assistant, who seem to be the only ones objecting that this is not appropriate - for the patient, or the male student.   Guy student 'docs' are not Tebow - or Bradley Cooper - and Tebow's fumbles are just with footballs - and the fumbles in ob-gyn hurt.  There are women patients who break into tears describing their last humiliating pelvic exam - by licensed Ohio Ob-Gyns - there's one of those rough guys on the Medical Board even - an abortion expert.  And that the guy students, or the women attendings, aren't sensitive to colleague women 'feelings' means that nothing has improved since the days of Semmelweis - we are talking 1800s.  In Semmelweis's day, if women went into labor on the midwife off-days, they would go into hysterical crying - knowing that they would probably die of puerperal fever.  None of the attendings or students noticed except Semmelweis - they didn't even notice to wash their hands.  Semmelweis got his clue by watching women cry on the days that they were admitted to the medical student service - the women knew something was wrong, just not what - but knew they had a high chance of dying of childbed fever.  So all Semmelweis first did was notice the women patients crying - no pelvic exam, no medical history.  Semmelweis just watched the woman patient's faces & death rates - unlike the male medical students at Beachwood Cleveland Clinic busy flirting with the woman ob-gyn attending.  Obviously looking for Honors in all the wrong places; been there, seen that. So the medical student looks like Bradley Cooper - but with big hands and obviously little on the job expertise - that white coat is sparkling - not a crease out of place - just out of the plastic bag.  And the room that you are put into has brown stool on the floor by the way - but he's not going to notice nor is 'the help' that probably put it there.Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals, and MetroHealth should know that women colleagues seeking a little medical care need a moment of privacy - not that their pelvic will be broadcast on clerkship Rounds that day, Facebook or Twitter later that week, ie did so many pelvic exams end of tweet.   In Medical School years ago at CWRU - there was a pile of trouble my year on Medicine for my refusing to workup a fellow student and present him at daily Rounds - all the details of his medical, social, & sexual history would have been forfeit.  And the attending, and the Clerkship supervisor, didn't see that as 'wrong' - that this student would never be able to communicate with his classmates in the same way ever again.  The ob-gyn charts contain sexual histories, or lack of, ie how many partners, BC use, etc.  If guys had these kind of charts, there would be more respect for them.  Practicing on colleagues is dangerous if you goof - they can write you up and report you.  Think about it before you force your medical student abilities on an another MD, ie would you like that done to you?   Get a little more practice first.The 'just saying No' of MDs, medical students, and other professionals wishing a minute of medical care without the publicity has to be respected - and their needs to be a policy about this apparently even at Beachwood Cleveland Clinic.  The respecting of a woman patient's gyn privacy, that includes your sexual history, means that it gets given/handed to the medical student before you've said NO ten times and had to walk out.  The powers that be just assume that there is a woman MD out there somewhere who wants a medical student pelvic - who is just asking for it?      Bradley Cooper go home.  The Free Clinics, the Indian Health Service, and other places including the Armed Forces, will let you do pelvics until you get some real experience - with individuals whose 'confidentiality' - if you break it - won't matter in Cleveland.  Have never seen a guy medical student who doesn't brag about the number, and the kinds of patients, that he did pelvics on - it's like one's first sexual experiences unfortunately.  And women classmates just cringe when the boys start in on this creepy recitation.  Having to walk out of Beachwood ob-gyn because the staff hasn't 'gotten it' yet in 2012, that women MDs can't have their pelvic exam on the community Facebook page is so sad.  And that the Bradley Cooper medical student hasn't gotten the sensitivity yet to see this - to look at the woman MDs face not her vagina - is also disconcerting.  But he'll get Honors, it's written on his pretty face.  The answer is 'No' from the getgo guys.  Practice first on a model even.  Women don't get through medical school to become teaching cases - we've paid our dues - stop the flirting long enough to read my face as I walk past you on the way out - the chart doesn't belong in your hands yet.     ",Doctors

										I had a 9:00 AM appointment at Urological Association of Dothan on Tuesday, September 20, 2011 for a semen analysis.  
I was scheduled to see Lisa Lewis, who was to conduct a semen analysis.
On the previous evening, September 19, I received an automated telephone message requesting confirmation of the appointment. 
Of course, I confirmed the appointment.
On Tuesday morning, I made the one-hour drive from my home to Dothan and arrived promptly a few minutes before 9, whereupon I began to fill out the required paperwork. 
The receptionist suggested I take the questionnaire and clipboard to my seat in the waiting room, and turn it in when being called for the appointment.
After waiting almost an hour, at 9:45 I went to the desk to check on the status of my appointment. It was then that the receptionist told me Lisa Lewis would not be in that day. There was no one else that could accommodate me, I was told, and the best they could offer was to reschedule the appointment.
As I had to travel a round trip of over 100 miles to make the appointment, I was greatly displeased.
I am further annoyed by the fact that the entire staff let me sit there for almost an hour, without telling me that I was waiting for nothing.
The woman I approached at the desk was standing around for at least several minutes without communicating with anyone else. Thus, she knew but failed to notify me that I was wasting my time being there.
On September 27, I sent 11 letters to various principals of the company.
In my letters I suggested that, while they could not give me back the several hours of time lost in traveling and waiting around needlessly, at the very least it would be appropriate for their company to reimburse me for expenses incurred on the wasted trip. 
I suggested that it would be a decent gesture, and much appreciated by me, if they would compensate me with at least $100. 
Doctors offices generally charge patients when they dont show up for their appointments, I reasoned. Why should it be different if the practitioner doesnt show up? 
I received a response to my letter of September 27, by way of a letter from Office Administrator Lauren Losh. Laurens letter was dated October 7, 2011.
In her letter, Ms. Losh apologized for the wasted trip and she offered to reschedule an appointment for me.
It is outrageous that she did not even address my request that Urological Associates consider compensating me. Rather, I was offered a rescheduling. No, thanks.
Not only did I make a wasted trip. I sat for almost an hour while not one of their staff had the courtesy to inform me of the futility of my waiting.
Moreover, I spent several hours researching the principals, writing letters to all of them and alerting them of the ineptness and discourtesies of their employees.",Doctors

										Referrals to friends of Medical Board Members are mandated conditions of medical licensure, or re-licensure, in Ohio under Governor Kasich - as it has been under Governors Strickland, Taft, Voinovich and Celeste.  It's a boy's club in Columbus.  Anita Steinbergh DO has been present at every discussion of this in a particular case, at the State Medical Board of Ohio, since 1993 - that this woman has to 'refer to Dr. Nice' for her medical license and doesn't she feel sorry for his wife?  Well, 'No' on the referrals (can't do as it sets a dangerous precedent for other women physicians even if the women DOs will do it without a thought), and 'No' on feeling sorry for the equally pathologic wife - who goes along with Dr. Nice preying on the neighbor's kids for personal attentions & understanding.  Keeping a husband from 'hitting' on the neighborhood is a wife's job - and even Tiger Wood's wife finally got the message.The woman MD, not being a stupid DO, has refused for 19 years to do this, and almost thrown up at the suggestion that she do so after what she reported about Dr. Nice to the State Medical Board.  The lawyers have been equally shocked, appalled & astounded at what physicians will do to other physicians - they thought that physicians had to have some ethics.  From taking money 'off the top,' to starting a procedure without checking the bone saw, or that this is a procedure that he has ever done before - if you name it - it has happened with Dr. Nice.  And Hillcrest Hospital does not require that Dr. Nice demonstrate either (1) competency in a procedure or specific fracture care (number of cases & results), or (2) show on a checklist that Dr. Nice has ever done that specific operative procedure, or care, before even ONCE.  There needs to be a moment of pause built into Dr. Nice care.    This woman physician had a list of reasons that she could not continue to refer to Dr. Nice - including that he does not have to consult, refer or send medical records because he has 'friends' on the State Medical Board of Ohio, and that he wants you to 'understand' him as his wife doesn't/didn't.  That's a no-brainer comment as to what is really going on; even a second-grader would get that that thought or suggestion doesn't sound 'right' - and refuse to take a ride home with Dr. Nice.  And the woman physician's malpractice insurance said 'no more' Dr. Nice referrals or consultations - or they couldn't cover her stupidity and bad judgment.  How many cases does Dr. Nice have to botch before it's bad care that the Medical Board can admit, how many woman physicians have to have their medical licenses taken for finally saying something?  And having about 12 patients screaming to you about Dr. Nice this-and-that, is enough to drive any sane MD to try to go to his office to try to discuss - which is not capital crime, or shouldn't be, or a reason for medical licensure suspension in Ohio - Dr. Nice has had patient family members at his house in Gates Mills trying to shoot him with good reason.     When Dr. Nice leaves a fracture uncasted, or cuts a popliteal artery during a routine knee replacement surgery, it is the referring MD who hears about it, and who gets co-named in the suit - the women MD who wrote the surgical clearance because that patient's regular internist wouldn't when he heard that Dr. Nice was going to be the surgeon.  Earth to Anita, Earth to Lance, Earth to John Kasich - come in please! The Ohio State Medical Board should not be setting any conditions of specific 'right' physician referrals with medical licensure - that is an insurance, surgeon record and training, patient and family decision - not the MD doing the medical clearance by-default's decision.  It's a condition that can't be met, and then can be used to take that women physician's license again - for not doing the Ohio conditions.  Governor Kasich doesn't GET THIS?  When they can't find a 'case' against a particular physician at the State Medical Board of Ohio, they set unreasonable 'conditions' for re-licensure; when you can't meet the conditions, they have their case that they couldn't prove or get the physician to admit.  It's a nasty Board; prisons have better standards for admission.  But, there's no MD/DO who can guarantee so many referrals to 'right' Ohio physicians, and no woman MD should have that condition put into her licensure equation and conditions - and certainly under Governor New-Age Kasich = the equivalent of California's Governor Brown and Rhode Island's Governor Chafee = the moonbeam crowd beamed back to Earth.  This is fraud, and all involved KNOW that it is fraud = the referring to Dr. Nice.  But Anita Steinbergh DO can do 20 years of fraud because everything is 'confidential' at the State Medical Board of Ohio - and you can't tape these meetings so that the Governor can know what is REALLY being discussed, and he doesn't attend the meetings to SEE what is going on.  And who would want to; listening to these meetings once, or being present at several of them, just sends the lawyers to Columbus bars questioning any sanity or justice in Ohio - people that usually don't like to drink are suddenly questioning the Kafkaesque in the weirdest places.  The lawyers can't stand the illegality of the discussions at the State Medical Board of Ohio - they don't want to go near the State Medical Board of Ohio buildings even to file appeals - they'd rather be fired. Governor Kasich you need to do something about what Anita Steinbergh DO, and friends, expect of women physicians before they license, or re-license, them in Ohio.  Listen in on a few Ohio Board meetings & discussions - or send equally useless Brad.  If you want to seek care with Dr. Nice, that is your problem, but most patients won't go near his office or staff.  And if you want to insist that women physicians refer to certain 'right' Ohio male physicians - maybe you could run for Governor in another state?  But don't take your daughters near these guys or you might be questioned for child abuse.    									",Doctors

										Ohio has no formal medical mistake laws, but should that legalize the 'killing' of women physicians who had mistakes made in their Ohio medical, and orthopedic, care so that no one is liable - the state, the hospital, her no-help medical colleagues?  We have legalized abortion in Ohio, so maybe it was only a matter of time to then legalize the women MD no-care rule, or practice.  Or allow the taking of her medical license for 'making too much of admittedly bad care,' to stop the improving of the aforementioned bad care by not allowing even a discussion of it?  Most states have a non-punitive 'third pathway' for care standard improvements - and don't tax massage 'therapy.'This Ohio woman physician, and there probably is more than one woman MD misdiagnosed and without a medical license in Ohio just no one can get the statistics ('confidential'), is not allowed to say anything about the bad care, or get care of her 'serious' bone condition to stop the fractures - that doesn't exist.  In Ohio medical mistakes, ie the bone condition that she has that is not supposed to be mentioned, are just 'psychiatric.'  And this bone condition is not well characterized because even Dr. Angelo Licata (Cleveland Clinic Foundation) won't order the labs (bone markers) to characterize it - even though he authors & edits the literature on this - so she has an uncharacterized bone disorder that causes serious comminuted fractures with minor trauma.  That's Ohio medicine.  This Ohio MD's 'psychiatric' fracturing, and bone pains, just need a new sixth 'right' Ohio psychiatrist per Senator Tim Grendell - covering things up for his district.  When the MDs can't get the diagnosis, they turn to Senator Grendell who can produce one for them by allowing the State Medical Board of Ohio to cheat and change the 'confidential' complaint - many times.  Women are just crazy, they don't have real diagnoses, or need real treatment (casts, x-rays, reductions).  Senator Tim Grendell has to cover for Dr. Tim Nice - two of a kind about the lying - and he can get Dr. Phillip Resnick to write anything to summarize succinctly.  So the woman MD is dying in front of Governor Kasich who can't figure things out - because everything is 'confidential' at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  This is not about her patient complaints or care - it's about disagreeing about her own medical care trying to save herself for 19 years.  And of course she's not allowed to get married, have a child or a husband - and her medical school guy friends have bolted for the money & the job security - no one has an ounce of character in Ohio.  And they are not even writing Girl with the Fractured Wrists books because of a guilty conscience - looking the other way is all too easy in Ohio.    Because the State Medical Board - and a Governor who can't figure himself out - won't look at the care problems for women patients in Ohio - there's a woman MD who's literally just dying fracturing and unable to use her MD and education to save herself.  Her medical license is suspended indefinitely until she lies a 'good' lie about what happened - changes her story as Dr. Fred Suppes threatened her - and admits boxes of lies that are still 'confidential.'  How can one admit a case that is 'confidential?'  Dr. Nice has threatened that she will never practice again in Ohio, or anywhere, for outing his problems; Dr. Nice can't cast a wrist fracture with the proper padding or in the correct alignment, can't measure the degrees of displacement, can't disimpact and straighten a wrist or anything else, and can't call for help from a colleague - and Dr. O'Day wouldn't recognize a correctly casted wrist fracture if she saw one.  Dr. O'Day never finished a residency, but she spent her time on the State Medical Board undoing everyone else's careers.     This woman MD had a Fellowship in Bone Metabolism, at St. Louis University, which was nixed by the State Medical Board of Ohio in 1992 - they just want women to fracture in Ohio - the orthopedics don't have enough to do and the women have to be stupid and fractured.  You can have a MENSA IQ in Ohio, but you can't use it - too much competition for the coddled boys.  And of course if that Fellowship was completed, she would have been competition for the talking-heads at Cleveland Clinic running the Bone Metabolism Department - a Bone Metabolism Department that won't treat her because they 'don't have to.'  Carla O'Day MD wouldn't let anyone compete with Abby Abelson MD - just like those soccer Moms.  So to cover everything up, because Hillcrest Hospital had to be sold to Cleveland Clinic at a bargain price (no liability - and there's a question that this would ever have cost the hospital 2 cents if the case was referred on time) - the case had to be covered up in 1992 - the woman's life destroyed.  The woman MDs hospital privileges were taken for being bad PR - so that this would all never really be known - she's just 'impaired' without the criteria, and the public never questions the State Medical Board as to the impairment, ie trying to get the 'right' fracture care?  Questioning the State Medical Board of Ohio is like questioning Bishop Lennon - no one does it because no one has the guts, not because they aren't wrong a good percentage of the time.  No one should go to Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield Heights for real fracture care - you may get a psychiatrist when the orthopedic can't cast. The woman MDs license & hospital privileges were taken for saying ""No"" to Dr. Nice and requesting proper care and referral - not for her patient care which was touted as 'brilliant' - because she could get the diagnoses that no one else could.  Just she couldn't save herself as the hospital & orthopedics had goofed - by not calling the hand orthopedic at Hillcrest & Cleveland Clinic.  Male physicians don't have to refer, consult, or be a part of Team Ohio; they don't call anyone unless a nurse can dial the number for them.  Dr. Robert Botti could not call the hand orthopedic at University for her - he was too worried about his retirement package from Hillcrest - what Betty Botti is still worried about should this come out.  The looks in St. Francis Church speak volumes - she thought she had won a sweepstakes picking up a Mrs. Doctor - and he wanted to be part of the Gates Mills crowd, not the Gates Mills Players.  Betty should be worried about if she ever fractures a bone - because Dr. Botti can look the other way for that - without a qualm of conscience.  Dr. Botti was informed that the woman MD looked close to passing out, and he did nothing except tell her to get counseling to get over things - the fracture was still uncasted after 3 weeks because everyone at Hillcrest looked the other way - like they did for an OR nurse's suicide at Hillcrest.  Dr. Botti just mopped up the Hillcrest messes, and retired on it. And what is the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo about, but men looking the other way while women are abused - the author did that when he was 15 - he watched a gang rape instead of trying to stop it.  So Dr. Botti watched a woman MD try to work with an uncasted fracture to prove he was 'one of the boys,' and deserved the Hillcrest package that Betty is living off of.  A lot of people live off watching women in trouble try to endure the abuse.  Leaving a woman's fracture uncasted, until she does 'personals' and referrals for Dr. Nice, is abuse.  But only domestic abuse is recognized in Ohio - not medical colleague abuse - that's just perpetual hazing.    The woman MD had to TRY to refer herself after the orthopedics, and Hillcrest Hospital, told other physicians that she didn't 'deserve' care - she finally got some care at Mayo Clinic after an 'experimental' cast at University.  Ohio hospitals can't make splints in their OT departments that last longer than several hours - that is if the male MDs can take the time to write for a splint or physical therapy.  The State Medical Board of Ohio has persistently denied that one year of every complication in the orthopedic fracture book was anything out of the ordinary - but an 'experimental' wrist fracture cast?  That's not even in the book.   The Hillcrest Hospital ER was run by a woman MD - Dr. Carla O'Day - who wasn't managing things very well - but she was on the State Medical Board managing things for the State.  Only those that can't manage anything locally, or their marriages, are appointed to state office in Ohio = TRAKAS.  And the orthopedics would want to use the ER as an office at Hillcrest - for the cast materials, the staff, and the food - but still leave out the padding, x-rays, and just go warm the pizza - eat in front of the patients & family members.  Dr. Nice ate pizza when the fractured MD came to the ER; in front of the woman MD with a badly casted unx-rayed wrist fracture and her mother.  When the cost of the Hillcrest charade was complained about, that was another point against the fractured MD at the State Medical Board.  But to continue hiding the facts for 19 years, and not allow the woman physician real treatment? - that's a State Medical Board record of neglect.  Some of the best bone metabolism physicians in the country at The Cleveland Clinic have decided not to allow this woman MD care - because it's not politically correct for them to do this care and have to disagree with the mistakes of the State Medical Board.  In Ohio, despite all the new recommendations on admitting medical mistakes, you can't mention a medical mistake - it's the really BIG 'elephant' in the room.  Dr. Chad Deal refused to look at the fractured women MDs blood work, or see her for an evaluation in 2000; he told her he would write what the Medical Board wanted him to regardless of the Fracture Index score - and this has cost her 4 more fractures that didn't have to happen.  When her license was taken she lost the ability to write for her own labs, x-rays, and meds.  So she's had to beg.  Because Hillcrest knew there was a missed diagnosis, they had to stop her ordering trying to find the missed diagnosis as they knew she would find the answer eventually - and they needed the statute of limitations to expire.  The only thing that Mr. Whitehouse talks about regarding this 'case' is the statute of limitations applying - so mistakes were made, they just can't be admitted or paid for in cash.   Dr. Abby Goulder Abelson - a BFF of Carla O'Day MD- won't intervene - she watches the other woman MD - who was in the Medical School class behind her - fracture.  How can you watch someone fracture and not feel bad - what kind of person is that?  Dr. Abelson will watch someone slowly fracture multiple bones - her competition - and laugh about it - totally minus any ethics, common sense, or caring ability - she's got her Department Chairmanship.  But Abby Abelson is so concerned that her mother fractured one bone - she has to take it to youtube?  Maybe she should have done a workup on her mother, a bone density or a few labs; not a youtube expose?Abby Goulder-Abelson is Jewish, and only Jewish women physicians, and those who will lie for Carla O'Day MD, get care in Ohio = the dues.  Abby gets the best of medical care for herself and her family, and her medical license will never be questioned after what she's done for Carla = not interfering.  Tonya Heyman MD makes sure that she's on the 'right' side of things - and this fractured woman went to high school with her.  Every Jewish woman in Beachwood is on some bone med, or several, and probably Abby because she has a family history, but Abby will watch this other non-Jewish woman fracture without a med or a bone lab on the chart - someone has to be a stat for the State Medical Board and it can't be a Jewish physician of course.  The BAD MD has to be a Catholic girl who just wasn't 'easy' enough for Dr. Nice because she thought that maybe, just maybe, one David Walker MD might wake up in time - not a chance on that one either - NO TEBOW FAITH.  Gotta give that TEBOW guy credit for stand up chutzpah and faith - the Broncos are in the playoffs - a true miracle.  Miracles happen with FAITH.  Dr. Angelo Licata - runs the National Osteoporosis Foundation educational programs - and along with Chad Deal MD collects the most drug company monies in the NE Ohio regional area - but he can't help this woman MD with a bone density order or any blood work - it's takes hours of begging to get him to write for an occasional vitamin D and maybe a yearly TSH - which isn't worth getting the blood drawn for.  In the last 2 years, the ob-gyn ordered the bone density, and Dr. Licata ordered only a TSH - which the woman physician can't get drawn at Cleveland Clinic Main Campus Euclid Avenue, as the all-black staff can't draw her blood without puncturing her arm 4 times with hematomas - and even then they can't draw the blood.  It's THE HELP getting back by messing up the white girl's arm - she doesn't need it to practice medicine and can't put s*** on it, but you can puncture it to hell and make her bleed.But regardless ONE lab is not going to make any difference - so the woman MD fractured her shoulder badly in May, 2011; because Deal, Abelson, and Licata can't do one thing to help her because it might have an effect on their medical licenses, their lives, they might have to tell the State Medical Board of Ohio that a mistake was made and that she really does have a serious bone condition.  So like the physicians who prospered while Hitler was in power, they just do what is politically correct - even Dr. Licata who pretends to be Catholic and trained at Georgetown?  And he teaches the Lerner medical students this - to abandon a patient if it's not politically in their best career interest - to draw only the labs that the State Medical Board wants to see -  gotta keep that free office and staff, and the drug company monies?  Dr. Licata can't check a blood calcium, phosphorus, PTH, or the numerical value of the level of anything for this woman MD - she could have normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism for all he knows, or doesn't know - he's never done any general screening blood work - and this is The Cleveland Clinic medicine.John Brems MD - Georgetown University trained - can't say an ethical word either, but can write in the chart that it's the Medical Board's fault - another no-brainer - and therefore he can't do anything?  But at least he 'does believe' that the woman MD has a 'serious bone condition' - looking at the shoulder x-ray with a thousand points of bone fracture.  And you do get fractures on the bone meds, but usually they are not comminuted.  So the woman MD got a 30-year-old shoulder splint; nothing has changed at Cleveland Clinic in the last 30 years of treating shoulder fractures except for shoulder replacements.  There was no attempt at disimpaction or straightening out of the shoulder fragments by traction - that would require an OR effort by the black help, and this woman MD isn't worth that.  She's going to die anyways of fractures, and her medical license won't ever come back - because no one wants it to.  It's God or nothing, for this woman MD - so that she dies faster - and God is co-operating.  John Brems knew her from Georgetown undergrad - where he looked the other way when she needed college advice - too busy with his girlfriend who he couldn't be detached from for 5 minutes.  When do men grow up and stand on their own, without a mother, girlfriend, wife, Parma Community Hospital, or Medical Board to hold their hand?  Tebow is only such a phenomenon because the rest of men are compared to him, and the rest of men stand up for nothing, and won't kneel once in their lives to any higher power to pray for no one or no thing.  Praying for football - could pick a better intention - but at least it's prayer.  Rather adolescent prayer request, in the scheme of things, but at least it is 6'3"" worth of prayer.  And then Dr. Brems could only write for 2 weeks of pain meds - not a prayer of change there - because of the risk that he would be considered a 'pill-mill MD' under Governor Kasich's new rules for not giving fracture patients pain meds.  In Ohio we have to make sure that women don't get addicted to pain meds, but are addicted to psych meds?  And there isn't a chance that 2 weeks of pain meds will do anything, but relieve a part of the terrible pain of shoulder fractures.  The pain meds will only change when Governor Kasich fractures something on the golf course or ski slope - he won't fracture anything working too hard at being Governor. It's such a bunch of self-serving people in Ohio, but to let someone die without a career, a family, medical care, or even a friendly phone call (David Walker MD) - is just so cruel that it's beyond words.  Dave Walker could have said a word about my getting along with men, but that would require some 'stand-up' courage, and he's too worried about his perfect 'deal' at Parma Peds to say a word.  When did Ohio men become such wimps that they would let a legislature vote to allow 'confidential' physician complaints - males in no other state go down to such a diminutive wussy level to allow this degree of insult to their abilities.  In Ohio we don't allow physicians to defend themselves, to argue their points, to be men and women. Thankfully it will only take another shoulder fracture, and maybe one neglected hip fracture, to kill this woman MD who once had a promising career, but just wasn't allowed simple medical & fracture care because the physicians were too busy making mistakes, eating pizza, screwing the staff, being a pediatrician who can't talk to adult classmate anymore, or just shopping for polo ponies.  And she won't be having any children to compete with Jewish prince & princesses of the Abelsons, Deals, Heymans and others.  The names, and the many unmentioned - it's 2012 & all Ohio physicians need to wake up, and insist on decent laws at the State Medical Board level - laws that allow all physicians to have some dignity, to be able to make a mistake and deal with it in a professional manner, or to be able to non-punitively expose/report the mistake and get the woman physician treated.                 									",Doctors

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",,(614) 466-3555,"Governor John Kasich Brad Reynolds continues to allow that State Medical Board Members take medical licenses from their competition, to get themselves, affiliated hospitals, and 'friends' out of malpractice until statutes of limitation Columbus, Ohio","
										Currently the State of Ohio is the only state with unrestricted 'confidential' physician complaints, allowing that Medical Board Members can complain about their competition, or solve arguments about care practice disagreements by taking a physician's license - protecting themselves, affiliated hospitals, and 'friends' from malpractice in a 'confidential' way.  The Members of the State Medical Board of Ohio collect (appointments, contracts, consulting) from cases, and no one can stop this because everything is 'confidential.'  Friends with benefits have 'friends' on the State Medical Board in Ohio - and the physicians tell you this when you try to reason with them about a situation.  Imagine discussing a medical care situation with a colleague who tells you that they are 'right' because they have 'friends' on the State Medical Board of Ohio, and can get your license pulled for the rest of your career if you don't go along with them (and this is about other than medical decisions in the medical environment - the personals also get included).  And further this doesn't belong on ripoff - but it's the 'elephant in the room' in Ohio in the Governor's office.  The Governor of Ohio can't figure out himself, or the State Medical Board of Ohio.Problems happened in the State of Texas regarding the woman physician President of the Board having her husband complain 'confidentially' about certain competitor physicians - so a new law at least stopped that.  That new Texas law doesn't even begin to cover half of the problems in Texas with 'confidential' physician complaints however - a complaint problem that has backlogged as you can't sign as a physician to end a 'case' with the facts being 'confidential.'  If you don't know what you are accused of, and who accused, then you can't sign an admission of facts, or non-facts.  In the US, our Constitution is based on fairness; that you get to confront your accusers and defend yourself; not that being defensive is a personality disorder or that the State Medical Board of Ohio or Texas knows best.  And medicine rests on difficult scientific concepts - that not all colleagues understand, or have the same training about - so you need to be able to explain and make your point.  Governor Perry belongs back in Texas fixing this and other state problems, not running for President.  Governor Kasich needs to fix the Ohio State Medical Board before he gets other office ambitions also.  It's always easier to run the country, or Congress, than Ohio or Texas.    MDs can't diagnose a patient with 'confidential,' or sign a 'confidential' chart for reimbursement.  The 'confidential' is being used to misdiagnose & mistreat physician MDs that the Board Members want punished for disagreeing with someone or the Board.  Psychiatry is being misused big-time at all State Medical Boards, and the 'confidential' complaints are constantly conveniently changed to protect the liability of the state for starting a false disciplinary case or investigation - so that eventually the case has morphed way beyond what it originally was.  This drags Medical Board cases in Ohio into decades - because the case keeps changing and a 'new go' is tried - nothing false is ever dismissed - there are no procedural rules for that.  The Ohio State Medical Board never makes mistakes, even though the individual practitioners are only 'right' about 3/4ths of the time at most on their web posting reviews (if that).  So they are only correct about 2/3rds-3/4ths of the time with Medical Board situations.  In Ohio there is no external review possible - the appeals go to the Ohio Court of Appeals where they can't get the 'confidential' file to rule on the case; so they throw out the ruling and send it back for more lies - wasting resources.    'Confidential' physician complaints at State Medical Boards are not the way to go for patients to collect on liability that courts won't give them, or to have Board Members destroying their competition.  Competition includes physicians that Board Members have harmed with bad care practices needing improvement, or physicians that they want out of the way for a career appointment or just because they have hated them since Medical School.  There are a lot of male physicians that hate their women colleagues, and even hate women patients, and they aren't necessarily gay - but there are a significant number of them in ob-gyn and orthopedics.  They make constant fun of women patients and colleagues, ie Dr. Timothy Nice does this when you don't go along,  Dr. Lance Talmadge likes only women that he can order to psychiatric evaluations - neither like to 'care' for them in any sense of that word (blood work or casts).  It's still all about one-upping, in bed on or on the wards; women aren't people.   It's too easy to use 'confidential' in these complaints, and then not have to produce the validity of the complaint, or the complainer's credentials and CV - who in Ohio can be a male physician that didn't get 'understanding' from the woman MD, or vice versa.  And Governor Kasich is, at this point, in on the fraud - along with Brad Reynolds.  The complaints get way beyond resolutions before the facts are checked.  At the Governor's office in Ohio, they hang up on you when you call, or are perpetually unavailable.  48-plus other states have taken some steps to restrict physician complaints to valid verifiable situations (not virtual, exaggerated, or imagined reality), and to complainers who have to produce their names, credentials and medication lists.  The complainers can't be a former practice colleague who hit on the woman physician for personal 'understanding' - except in Ohio where the complainer can be a spouse, a one-night-stand, a former employer, or a colleague wanting free office space & staff.  It's not that everything has to be in public records, but complaints have to be 'real,' confirmable, and other objective witnesses and parties have to be able to come forward before 19-20 years later.  These false cases cost Ohio at least $500,000-$1M/case - and Brad Reynolds can't even get the exact figures from Mr. Whitehouse.  And after 20 years, most of the other witnesses are not around.  You can't come forward as a witness in a physician 'confidential' complaint case unless you know what the complaint is and who is involved: patient & physician-wise.  So it's just a pile of hearsay ruining lives and consuming state monies, improving nothing because it's all 'confidential.'  And it's not the 'pill-mill' MDs, it's the Governor of illusions that's the problem in Ohio - everything is 'confidential' so no one can resolve anything.  Governor Kasich is supposed to be a smart man, and this is 'smart' policy?   But having the Governor's office hang-up on physicians trying to get the problem resolved is not going to work.  Even Texas has had to restrict confidential anonymous complaints about physicians - and confidential is not going to resolve any problems or legal settlements for medical mistakes.  It doesn't even solve getting the patient their records in Ohio - that's 'confidential.'  The Governor needs to do something about the 'confidential' complaint system at the State Medical Board of Ohio, to ensure that false situations are cleared up and the physicians back to work - which can't happen 'confidentially.'  And there are a number of these 'confidential' cases in Ohio not involving the physician's patient care - just that the physician didn't go along with the boys.  And the writer doesn't want to be the horrible person saying the obvious - but the 'confidential' problem is affecting both male & female physicians in a bad way - not improving patient care. 									",Doctors

										This review is for a surgery that took place on my husband in Nov. 2011 by Dr. Kit McCalla in Scottsdale. Here are the reasons that I would NOT TRUST my health with Laser Spine Institute. You are scheduled to be in Scottsdale for 5 days.  On day 2 you ""meet the surgeon"" to review your case. The surgeon my husband met was not the one who showed up to do the surgery the following morning.  If I am having surgery I want to Google my surgeon and learn a little about him. I felt this was a BAIT & SWITCH routine by LSI. We had an orthopedic surgeon who I later found out went to community college, then to med school and finished up with a business degree. We showed up at 6:45 a.m. for surgery. He didn't go in until after 12:30 p.m. because the patient prior to us ""was much more difficult"" than expected. They told me he would be in surgery for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. After 2 hours they said he was coming into recovery.  Another 2 hours without a word from anyone. Finally, a nurse said he is having some problems in recovery. The doctor finally came out to give me the rundown. Surgery went fine until his disk on c7 & c6 ""popped like a big zit and then we had a tear in his spinal cord which caused a leak of spinal fluid.""I felt as if the doctors and nurses were more focused on getting everyone out of there before closing than they were about his care.  He clearly was not doing well but they were all set to release him. I was insistent that he was not acting normal and was in way too much pain to leave.  I felt if the doctor that met with him the prior day was actually the person doing the surgery then they would know his personality / behavior and know that he was not acting normal. They gave me some story about the ""snowbirds and Scottsdale"" at this time of year if we went to the hospital.  Next thing I know they are unhooking his IV and say transport is here ready to take him back to the hotel in an unmarked white van ambulance. One driver shows up. They say he has to stay at a 30-degree angle, can't use the restroom so they will send a urinal with me, and keep him medicated until tomorrow's appointment.  I want him transferred to the hospital.  I told them he does not look right and he did not complete the tasks that he was supposed to do in order for him to leave. It took 4 people to move him to the ambulance stretcher. How was I supposed to move him by myself in a hotel room?  We get to the ER and he is now in bad shape. Projectile vomiting, blood pressure going through the roof from pain, low oxygen, the list goes on. He threw up all the way to the hospital. The ER Dr. thought it was crazy for him to go to a hotel room in his current condition.In the ER waiting room I see the wife of the patient that our Dr. operated on prior, the 4-hour case that was really difficult. Well, it appears that the same doctor, Dr. Kit McCalla, tore open his spinal cord too! I guess the doctor did not want us to go the same hospital that he already sent another patient to that day. Not so good for the reputation.  (After I posted my first review LSI followed up with a phone call.  They told me that the first patient was also having trouble with recovery due to another issue that was not caught in the screening process.  Another reason that I think that they are very eager to get you in for surgery regardless of your personal situation.  Very cookie cutter experience.) The doctors at LSI do not have privileges at Scottsdale Shea Hospital. They send you to the ER to get admitted. So much for the 'snowbird' story. Another co-pay for you. A big concern of mine was that our doctor was not reachable that evening after we left LSI by the ER doctors.  The next afternoon LSI wanted to see my husband for a recheck, but to make sure we get there by 5 p.m. because that is when they close.  We got there by 4 pm but were told that our doctor would not be able to meet with us for another hour.  Seriously, I just pulled this guy out of the hospital so we could sit and wait another hour for them?  We were given pain medication prescriptions.  We live in California.  LSI failed to mention that we needed to get them filled in Arizona because you cannot fill them out of state.  I called LSI from California and asked them to call me back.  No one called for three days.  Finally my husband called but the prescription situation was never handled.  His pain is back in his neck and arm two weeks later. I guess the steroids/cortisone they injected during surgery are wearing off and now we have a huge bill to pay.  I feel that their doctors are not well trained for the surgery they are performing & they get people that are in pain to agree to pay large sums of money for some quick relief.  You will notice that all of their doctors are investors in LSI. It just goes to show you that these doctors are some sorts of venture capitalist out to make money instead of personalized patient care.If you put a Google alert in place you will notice that LSI will release information daily on all of their good deeds.  I found out later that companies subscribe to services to protect their online reputation by screening and posting information about them.  One way of doing this is to suppress all other information that might be posted about them by piling their own information on top of everything else.  I believe that LSI uses this technique to build content for potential clients to view.  I know this because 48 hours after posting my first review LSI had Yelp remove it.  Yelp is one place that I thought I would be able to keep a personal review available for others to see before trusting LSI with their health.",Doctors

										 After reading the report submitted by someone else who was treated very poorly by Dr. Kreifels I feel compelled to verify that I too had similar experiences and many more.
 This doctor is rude, uncaring, and in a hurry when she's with you, but not while you're waiting. You can often see her through the window playing around on her computer and you can hear her chatting with staff and pharm reps etc while you sit in her hideous waiting room for two or more hours. This happens every appointment, not just occasionally.
 She can't keep help so it seems like there's a new receptionist every time you go there, and several times when I called and thought I was talking to a receptionist it turned out to be her. She just hired a new girl and I wish that poor girl lots of luck. 
 Her personality/bedside manner is brusque, impatient, and intolerant. Her record keeping, both medical and payment, is awful and she often finds a reason to charge extra but never gives you an itemized statement. 
 When she finally sees you after a two hour wait she either rushes you through without giving you a chance to tell her your symptoms, or she starts delving into your personal life asking questions and offering advice on things like dating and where she thinks you should live, things that have nothing at all to do with your health. 
 I kept her as my doctor for several years, overlooking all the negatives, but after the way she treated me during my last appointment I will never go back. She was very rude and I've never seen such unprofessional, uncalled for behavior from a doctor before. 									",Doctors

										Ohio has a Governor that will keep false cases at the State Medical Board going on for ? money in damages - can't straighten anything out and can't figure himself out - everything is conveniently 'confidential.'  Can't move on and admit a mistake after 19 years - that not in the rules & procedures that are constantly changed anyways to ruin physicians that say something that the State Medical Board of Ohio doesn't want to hear - which is anything or everything.  No one else can have a life, have a family or a child - it's all a photo-op for Governor Kasich and kids = meaning 2.5 kids really.  And The State Medical Board of Ohio is not about good patient care - the Medical Board of Ohio is about destroying physician/podiatrist colleagues for the sport of it - destroying lives, careers and ruining the family that never got the chance to get started.  It's about being mean, in a world that is already too 'mean.'  And it's Christmas.    Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine (Cleveland, Ohio) has to be the only Medical School in the US, or Ohio, where classmates try to destroy each other, before and after graduation - a medical school with 'no grades' yet known for colleagues wanting to 'kill' one another for sport - colleagues who go after each other's medical licenses for the endless one-up.  Medical School classmates can't help one another with a classmates' fractures, thyroid problem, blood work - even to discuss - they stay in Parma holed in a box-office (no architectural merit), caring for perpetual kids-like-themselves, and pretend that half-way across town (30 minutes) is too much to travel or phone (local call) for a grown-up.  I-480 is a better road than they have in any eastern state - more lanes and exit ramps than an amusement park.  Gosh!  Just because you have no religion doesn't mean you have no common sense - but it does for CWRU School of Medicine grads.  The religion is themselves.      It's Christmas even if Abbey & Tonya are Jewish - and they can't help because they are Jewish - and Jews only take care of Jews - went to the same high school & Medical School as Tonya - who has the same thyroid problem that she can't help another MD with.  And that MD at least called her for her own problems - wasn't passing out meds, radiation, and bills - like everyone else.  Jewish never meant Good Samaritan, agnostic never meant kind human being - but let's criticize those Catholic priests and take advantage of Catholic girls who should be 'easy,' or aren't 'easy' enough for Dr. Nice - who can't seduce his wife instead?  That Catholic girl is just plain 'unlucky' - unlucky with friends.  Shouldn't, or couldn't, one guy classmate - from either Georgetown or Case Western Reserve - have had the guts to call Dr. Nice, and tell him to get off her case and screw his own wife instead of looking all over Hillcest Hospital for 'supplements' like Tiger Woods?  John Brems & Tim Nice are both ORTHOPEDICS - same club.  Both are men?For a CWRU grad, and even a Georgetown grad who couldn't share notes or 5-minutes of advice, everything is too much bother - even when the getting into Medical School and getting married is over - it's still not about being a human being - about letting another person have a marriage or ONE child.  Christmas is about that ONE child.  Human beings are too much bother unless they can contribute to your career, your appointments, your accolades and favored positions or circumstances - that's the CWRU matra - get yours first.  Love isn't part of Christmas, and that doesn't mean sex; looking beyond the physician fee's isn't part of Christmas, helping a lab-mate isn't Christmas - what is Christmas is calling someone who needs to hear from you.  Nothing is Christmas in Ohio - it's all about Parmatown mall - a more generic mall in a more plastic suburb you couldn't find in Ohio.  Sherwood Anderson wrote about Parma when he wrote that: 'Only the few know the sweetness of the twisted apples,' and George Willard has to get away to find truth and twisted apples - out of Ohio.  Parma Ohio is no 'twisted apple,' and if one were going to run away to Seattle WA and return to Parma - one didn't read Winesburg, Ohio - 'The young man's mind was carried away by his growing passion for dreams. One looking at him would not have thought him particularly sharp. With the recollection of little things occupying his mind he closed his eyes and leaned back in the car seat. He stayed that way for a long time and when he aroused himself and again looked out of the car window the town of Winesburg had disappeared and his life there had become but a background on which to paint the dreams of his manhood.'  There are no dreams in Ohio, just one's own affairs and Legacy Village. When one MD grad has a fracture or needs some blood work - it turns into a 19-year disaster after the fractures are left uncasted for fun.  The blood work is lost, misfiled, or never sent as the endocrinologist has mild cognitive impairment -- and no one noticed.  The bone diagnosis is 'psychiatric' - well only if it's the expedient thing for Carla O'Day MD in between gym memberships & husbands.  That Catholic woman MD just needs a sixth new right Ohio psychiatrist - for what - for more emotional damage?  All that repetitve psychiatric evaluations of 'nomal' people do is cause emotional damage - and there is a direct relationship between the number of evaluations, the number of psychiatrists, and the degree of emotional damage = #psychiatrists x #evaluations.  Do the math - you don't even need a calculator.  The BFF of Carla O'Day MD at Cleveland Clinic won't interfere = Abby Goulder-Abelson, the MD from Georgetown undergrad wishes you well and runs away as fast as he can - he knows you need more help, but that's not his responsibility.  He can't do planks, but he can sprint.  He ran away in college, was glued to the RN that became his wife, but he's now a shoulder orthopedic who should be able to help a fellow Georgetown grad get some bone help - it's not college anymore.        You'd think that classmates would help each other out, want to learn about medicine, and physicians get diagnoses that present differently and unusually - isn't medicine about helping people, mending lives, giving care & grace - the grace of another human being with a moment to spare.  Carla O'Day MD can't diagnose thyroiditis, see that a neck is swollen, see that a wrist is swollen to 'excrescence,' see that a classmate is about to pass out at Hillcrest Hospital from trying to work with an uncasted wrist fracture - that another MD is in tears at the neglect, harassments, and injury with the fracture displacing & seriously painfully iatrogenically impacted.  Carla was busy writing a complaint about the woman colleague instead of helping - and she ran the ER at Hillcrest.  Yes, Carla hated her, and other classmates, but this much?  Hate that compounds this much is sad.One wouldn't want to get pregnant in medical school - or after.  The OB-GYN Chair just strutted across the classroom mimicking a pregant woman's walk - it was funny to look that bad - a joke for the males in the class.  And one wouldn't/couldn't trust Carla O'Day MD in a delivery room - she'd make something happen to permanently impair or injure - the mother or child.  Mark Harmon (Gibbs) can deliver a child better on NCIS - less hate.  And one would not want to have a child with any CWRU classmate - the child would die of being an addendum to a career, sitting in an office waiting for someone to notice until he/she got some disease - and then became a case. Where is there any sense of helping another human being? of compassion?  It's Christmas 2011, 19-years later, and we have a total egocentric personality disorder of a Governor; a narcissistic orthopedic fellow Georgetowner - who will help for his 5-minutes then it's not his responsibility; a totally Jewish-princess CCF Rheumatology MD classmate who can't interfere (helping someone with medical care is an intevention - not a privilege) with the lack of treatment of a serious metabolic bone problem because it might make her stand-up for something besides her own career trajectory; a drink-everyone-under-the table Carla O'Day - who as a Member on the State Medical Board started all this; and finally an Executive Medical Director on LinkedIn only = rick1957.  Is there anyone who is a decent human being anymore? O'Henry's short story, the GIFT OF THE MAJI, ends with the following: The magi, as you know, were wise men--wonderfully wise men--who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents.  Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. O all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest.

										This 'confidential' complaint scam, going after the MD, DO, or podiatrist competition/classmate, was also going on at the State Medical Board of Texas until it was stopped recently by a new law.  The 'confidential' physician complaint 'con' is why 48 other states at this time do not accept confidential, or anonymous, physician complaints.  It matters who signed the physician complaint, and what it says - or the problem can't be solved and the conflicts-of-interest sorted out.  Most Governors have figured this out without much 'help.'Then the 'confidential' physician complaint in Ohio is allowed to be constantly changed and amended (it's legal); when one case doesn't work, another is just inserted in the blanks.  The legislators & Board lawyers admit this fact.  There's no dismissing a false complaint or case - no process to do this in Ohio.  Once accused, the physician is damned.  All the money to train that physician is down the tubes of the Ohio Board gristmill.Members of State Medical Boards should not be allowed to author, sign, expedite or run the cases against medical school colleagues who did better than them on exams and training placements - colleagues who have no patient complaints, or psych problems with men, except for the orthopedic that wants some 'understanding' that he can't get from his wife - the Member's 'friend' - and the orthopedic who tried to fix the mess with an 'experimental' cast.  Things are 'confidential,' and 'experimental,' in Ohio at the State Medical Board, and it isn't working very well for the budget.The conflicts-of-interest can't be sorted at the State Medical Board of Ohio unless the physician complained about knows the identity of the complainers and what they said.  This is especially important when the complaint involves the liability of a hospital (where the Member has privileges & staff appointments), or of a 'friend' physician of several Board Members.  The Member is expected to cover the liability of the hospital and physician 'friend,' or lose appointments & privileges.  Governor Kasich, presents to be a 'smart' politician, but doesn't see the ruse - or the connections - that it is not all about pill-mill physicians.  Governor Perry sort-of sees the problem, but he's too busy running around the country to fix the mess.  Romney's state of Massachusetts has medical mistake laws & Harvard physicians make sure that things are not 'confidential,' ditto Rhode Island where the overflow from Massachusetts' training hospitals practice.  So if the Governor complains about a physician in Ohio, that physician deserves to know that, and what the Governor has alleged - it needs discussion Governor Kasich.  Romney would have his name on any complaint, notso Perry or Kasich. This false physician 'discipline' rip-off has been going on in Ohio since at least 1990 - and one case has gone on for 19 years unresolved - because there is no real case.  The MD is supposed to sue the state - which will take the rest of her life.  Experts called, or approved, by the State Medical Board knew the Member signer, and several other signers of the complaint - and guaranteed what they would say - and one admitted this to the woman physician - that he would give her a diagnosis and he did - one that didn't exist.  It took bringing in a New York City DSM-expert to 'burst the bubble' of the 'fake' for the Ohio public record - but the stuff is still on the Medical Board's website.  Mr. Whitehouse doesn't know that psychiatric diagnoses have 'criteria' - and he doesn't care.  Mr. Whitehouse would treat any physician for what they don't have to get a 'bad MD' stat; another 'notch' on his belt to run for .  .  .Experts for the Medical Board in Ohio are 'hired' only because they will guarantee a psychiatric diagnosis, or to say whatever the Board tells them to say about a physician - regardless of diagnostic criteria.  The Medical Board in Ohio wants to diagnose women physicians for entities that they have no criteria for, while withholding needed medical care until the physician admits the case (the case that the Medical Board can't prove).  The State Medical Board in Ohio wants women MDs treated for diagnoses that they do not have - to get rid of the competition for the stupid men.  The problem in the one case was that the Member, and her friend, missed the real diagnosis that is still untreated, and causing the woman MD to continue to have serious fractures.  The current expert approved - Dr. Phillip Resnick - worked with the Board Member in residency & medical school, and knows maybe 5-6 of the signers of the woman's complaint.  Dr. Resnick could not be objective if he tried.  University Hospitals of Cleveland, Endocrine & Orthopedic Departments, missed the medical diagnosis also - and left the woman untreated, fracturing and with chronic bone pains.    It was a missed diagnosis, that if the woman was not an MD, she would have easily collected $Millions for in malpractice damages - there was no blood work, no care-to-function.  But a physician can't sue another physician in Ohio and have a medical license leftover - that is 'paranoid' personality disorder.  EVERY other state allows a physician care-to-function however, before making an assessment about an impairment - mental, medical or physical.  Every other state allows physicians to heal from negligences and get the blood work to find the cause of the problem - notso Ohio.   The 'case' - and this is admitted by Mr. Richard Whitehouse the Executive Director of the State Medical Board - was to let the statute of limitations expire for all involved.  The State of Ohio is the malpractice insurer for Members of the State Medical Board of Ohio and their 'friends' - friends who get their 'confidential' complaints so that they can counter-complain.  The laws are broken for 'friends' - the Board admits this. When a 'friend' of a Board Member has a complaint against them - it is not investigated.  The 'friend' is given the complaint, allowed to counter-complain, and the counter-complaint is investigated - even when it is an obvious scam for the friend physician to get out of liability for admittedly bad care & boys being boys behaviors.  The State Medical Board of Ohio, despite all the hype about 'abuse,' has no provisions about sexual harassment of women (or men) physicians.  The Board is a literal translation of the GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO title = men [and women] who hate women.  Ohio is way behind every other state in this regard, and every other regard, i.e. medical mistake laws.The Medical Board Member, Carla O'Day MD, authored & signed the complaint, and expedited the case ahead of hundreds of cases involving physicians with multiple patient complaints.  The designated expert in 1995 told the woman physician that he would 'diagnose' her, and her expert should be prepared.  And he invented a diagnosis that still doesn't exist, which the Board has placed on their website - for the truly stupid Ohio constituency - people who don't have the training to see through this ridiculous nonsense.  And the Governor is likewise clueless, can't see what is going on.    Classmates from medical school, can lie and be taken absolutely seriously by other Medical Board Board Members - who don't question the jealousies, the competitiveness about careers & family - who think that the Member is objective.  This scam, of Members getting rid of the competition, is still going on in Ohio under Governor Kasich - it has at least been exposed in Texas.  The number of cases of this is at least one, and probably many more; with 'confidential' physician complaints it is too easy to complain and destroy one's colleagues - without even one patient complaint involved.

										Being concerned about jobs and 'progress' means respecting women physician jobs - so that their licenses are not pulled because they won't refer to Dr. Nice or agree with his bad care.  Which needs dicussion at the State Medical Board - not Dr. Resnick to drug the woman physician into silence - so that Dr. Nice can continue to leave wrist fractures uncasted until more patients nearly lose their hands, nerves, or tendons.  Progress means medical mistake laws, and transparency of physician complaints at the State Medical Board = words that Governor Kasich can not say.  Governor Kasich wants jobs without the responsibility of those jobs = that the workers get good health care from good physicians who have medical mistake laws & policies.  Dr. Nice can cut their popliteal artery while dancing around in the OR, but they will not be able to ever return to work.Osteopaths, and podiatrists, are not necessarily trained like physicians in regards to medical mistakes.  Dr. Anita Steinbergh - currently on the State Medical Board of Ohio - thinks that medical mistakes should be dealth with by aequanimitas - which doesn't give the patient a chance to get treatment for the breast cancer that was missed.  An ex-Miss Venezuela just died of breast cancer with a two-year old; her lump was overlooked while she was pregnant and her treatment was too late.  It wasn't in Ohio, but the same vignette is all too commonly played out in Ohio.  Medical errors need to be disclosed IMMEDIATELY, and the options given the patient - who then can concentrate on getting to the next MD instead of the lawyers.   There's a woman MD who's bone condition was judged as 'psychiatric' by the State Medical Board and she needs treatment which she won't get until the State Medical Board admits the problem and their mistake - to take a medical license, when the woman was tired and having fractures and bone pains, without any blood work or a complete thyroid panel.  The women attorneys who made fun of her symptoms were from the Attorney General's Office - they get their blood work.  The Medical Board Members did not know what a 'thyroid panel' was, still don't, because the process of selection of Board Members does not include that the physicians be good clinicians or know anything about thyroid disease.Jobs means not taking jobs for politics, for medical errors, for administrative errors.  Jobs and progress means that Governor Kasich has to discuss, has to have a Medical Board that allows physicians to work with unnecessary harassments by the State Medical Board or male colleagues looking for free office space and referrals. 									",Doctors

										In Ohio women physicians are getting their licenses, and hospital privileges, suspended when they won't 'change their stories' - because the patient, which could be herself, just needs a referral & consultation with the local expert to turn the care mistakes around - not a pile of lies and a 'campaign' to destroy her career.  Dr. Nice doesn't put a cast on a fracture for two weeks, and the women MD has to lose her medical license and privileges at Hillcrest, until she won't say anything about the mistakes (per Anita Steinbergh DO as Anita doesn't want to hear it = Current Member of Ohio State Medical Board).  Dr. Nice mistakes happen every day as he parties too much, and his name could be a synonym for medical mistakes in Ohio = the Dr. Nice practice.  Nothing changes, as to Dr. Nice standards, when he gets a colleague's license suspended for trying to say 'No' to him, or ask him to refer.  There is a whole male subset of physicians in Ohio who don't have to REFER, CONSULT, or SEND RECORDS - they are protected by the State Medical Board - and they cause a lot of mistakes, delays in diagnosis, and missed care opportunities = the Dr. Nice physicians.  Bad physicians only create more of a mess for everyone else - when they lie, the next physician has to spend two weeks getting the story straight.  Governor Kasich has continued to allow this privileged group of Dr. Nice physicians to control the State Medical Board - where everything is 'confidential' - and making medical problems 'confidential' does not benefit anyone.  First, you can't find the problem is.   Losing good MDs at hospitals in Ohio, does not make the boys party less, make them better clinicians, or get them to tell the truth.  And to make the correct diagnosis, physicians need the truth, the lab work, the what happened without the embellishments of - but Dr. Nice was out playing polo.  And Dr. Nice will get any complaints against his license, so that he can counter-complaint AGAINST STATE LAW - he's protected by the State Medical Board under every Governor since Celeste.  So he counter-complains and the patients don't get treated - because it's a cat-fight of colleagues - which the Ohio Court of Appeals tried to stop in 1993. The State Medical Board of Ohio breaks Ohio law for 'friends,' and Governor Kasich looks the other way.  The Governor allows male 'friends' to get any complaint about their care at the State Medical Board - and there's no way to fight a 'confidential' complaint that can be continually perpetually changed.  The Ohio legislators laugh at how the Medical Board cheats on cases and changes the 'confidential' complaint, it's a joke except for the physicians that take their careers and profession seriously - and their patients.  With medicine changing drastically, as to out-patient procedures and care, mistakes are even more common than they used to be - making the need for medical mistake provisions urgent and critical in Ohio.  And the Governor is just clueless and leaderless on this point - preferring to cite his records in bringing jobs to Ohio. Jobs with women employees should stay away until women's medical care improves in Ohio, as mistakes have a way of happening more on women patients than on men.  Women's medical care is more complicated because of the life cycle changes - and the men don't get it even after medical training.  As Suzanne Somer's puts it - something like - they have 3 hours of endocrine, and want to manage my hormones - which is pretty close to the  mark on male MD ignorance.  Women, more commonly, are then labeled as 'crazy,' or 'unlucky,' or that they 'don't deserve care' because they are asking the 'right' questions.  A guy thinks twice before calling another guy 'crazy' for some reason?  Mistakes happen in Boston - at all the best hospitals - all the time, but as a recent CPC (Clinical Pathological Conference) in the New England Journal cites, they get handled and the resident does not lose her residency because she wouldn't 'change her story.'  Case 34-2010  A 65-Year-Old Woman with an Incorrect Operation on the Left Hand, David C. Ring, M.D., Ph.D., James H. Herndon, M.D., M.B.A., and Gregg S. Meyer, M.D.N Engl J Med 2010;  363:1950-1957 November 11, 2010.  In Ohio if a woman MD doesn't not change her story at Hillcrest Hospital, the Staff Chief threatens and then suspends her.  And this is pooh-poohed that Medical Board Members are not responsible for the tactics in handling medical mistakes; from threats, to suspensions, to years of lost treatment time.The way of teaching in Medical Schools since the late 1970s has been for physicians to disclose errors, and deal with the facts and the options in a forthright manner to patients - not to allow Dr. Nice to get away with not casting a fracture for two more weeks, and not treating the bone condition for 19 years.    Physicians, and Medical Board Members, need to disclose errors and mistakes to promote awareness of the problems and procedural processes for dealing with them.  This disclosure does not trigger more malpractice suits, or Medical Board suits, from the current stats.  Except in Ohio, hospitals and other healthcare organizations are using quality-improvement tools to improve disclosure and referral processes - and the physician does not have to accept blame. but just say that the care resulted in an 'unanticipated' result which needs to be dealt with.  This happens with Medical Board license decisions as well as patient care decisions - there are mistakes from past Boards that the current Medical Board needs to deal with.  Finally disclosure and compensation goes hand-in-hand, and this stops the years of litigation.  And many times the only compensation that the patient wants is a timely referral to undo the mistakes as much as possible, to treat the cancer that was missed, to treat the bone problem that was misassessed.  Many lifetimes are involved in litigation, and the best option is to be able to go-around it.  Boston MDs not only talk about the mistakes - without having to get psychotherapy - or order the woman resident to therapy - but they publish how they are handling the mistakes - unlike in Ohio where the woman MD is analyzed five times that the Medical Board doesn't want to hear about it.  Mistakes are a fact of life in medicine today, and they occur on physicians as well as normal patients, and they have to be handled and not lied about.  The lies only make the straightening out of things worse, and crucial time is lost in trying to decipher the lies.  The 'wall of silence' about the complications that occur when physicians goof has to be a wall that comes down; so that women MDs don't lose their licenses and hospital privileges when it happens and they won't lie or not talk about it.  Dr. Nice didn't stop making mistakes in 1990-2, he's made many since - and he hasn't learned to stop making them as the State Medical Board covers up for him and publishes the names of the patients who refuse to go back to him - making fun of their judgments and fears.'Confidential' complaints at the State Medical Board of Ohio are being misused by colleagues and hospitals to get out of bad care, bad practices, adverse patient outcomes and to waste taxpayer money.  If Governor Kasich complained about certain 'pill-mill MDs,' then his NAME should be on the complaint - so that the physician can dialogue with him about the problems.  The pill-mill physicians are just the only ones dealing with the chronic pain problem from bad surgeries, orthopedics, etc in Ohio - the bad care problems.  The pill-mill physicians did not make the chronic pain problem - that came from bad MDs who did not have to refer their mistakes.Governor Kasich needs to address the problem of 'confidential' complaints, medical mistakes, and false licensure suspensions & disciplines at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  All physician complaints should have names attached, and be transparent to the parties involved in the complaint - so that the problem can be solved, and witnesses, and information shared to improve the mistakes and bad outcomes in a non-punitive way - before 19 years as in one case.  Many mistakes are non-intentional, but the lying about it is intentional - the delays and lies should be punished as 'bad practice.'    The following is taken from the CPC:  'Although the disclosure of deficient practice has been a part of the American Medical Association's code of medical ethics for more than 50 years, it had been interpreted as the need to report such events to hospital and professional organizations.  More recent experience has shown the value of direct disclosure to patients and their families in terms of salvaging trust, decreasing the likelihood of litigation, and facilitating the healing of both the patient and the provider.'Governor Kasich, and Mr. Whitehouse, need to read the New England Journal of Medicine.  It's not the patient's fault that they need to know what happened and need to be informed of the options, and it is not a personality disorder of the patient that the negligences or mistakes occurred - they didn't make Dr. Nice do it by being 'seductive.'  Anita Steinbergh DO needs to allow a 'discussion' of the Dr. Nice and other orthopedic errors at the Ohio State Medical Board - a discussion of how to improve the problem - not punish the messenger - a woman MD.  No one wants to notice problems or mistakes, but in medicine they are not things to lie about.  ",Doctors

										I went to Dr John  Cottam, a dermatologist, on  3/17/11 because of a rash on my neck. He did a skin swab on my neck that he said would be tested by Quest labs. Before I left the office I asked how much I owed and the nurse said ""Nothing."" 
I asked for my lab results  2 weeks later and was told by the Dr's. office it wasn't back yet. I called  again in April and was told to come in on 4/7/11 to get my lab results. I brought a HIPAA compliant request form for release of my medical records, signed and dated it and handed it to the nurse at Dr. Cottam's office. She gave me a couple papers and when I got home I noticed the print was so light I couldn't read it. She had not given me any lab reports. She said they still didn't have them. 
On May 27, 2011 Dr Cottam sent me a bill for $59 for the one office visit on 3/17/11. It said he would charge a $10 late fee if I didn't pay the bill within 20 days. I sent Dr Cottam a letter stating I had asked how much I need to pay on 3/17/11 and his nurse had told me nothing. I said I did not ask him to extend me ""credit"" and therefore I wouldn't pay him any late fees. I reminded him that I was still waiting for my lab results and that when he sent me my lab results I would pay the bill. I sent 2 HIPAA request forms to Dr Cottam. I requested my lab reports on 4/7/11, 6/5/11, 7/1/11 and 7/5/11. I gave this doctor a self addressed stamped envelope to mail my lab reports in.
I mailed a complaint to the Dept of Health and Human Services/Office for Civil Rights, and got 2 letters back in August and September saying they are looking into whether they can help me. I'm pretty sure they are not going to help me get my lab reports which is my right under HIPAA law. 
I complained to ""Quality Improvement Programs,"" an agency that Medicare transferred me to. This agency played phone tag for several months, said they called the doctor and the doctor's nurse promised they would mail my lab results to me in October 2011. They put this in writing.  The doctor's office never sent the lab reports. 
I contacted a legal aid clinic and after waiting two hours,  with an appointment, I was told they didn't have the funds to assist me in getting my lab reports from this doctor. The legal aid lawyers twisted my request for my lab reports into a ""billing dispute.""
It is NOT a billing dispute.  I was ready and willing to pay at the time of the appointment, and my money was refused. I believe this doctor wanted to bill me later in order to charge me extra in ""late fees.""  Medicare paid for my lab tests. The doctor is violating my HIPAA right to my own lab reports.
Since the rash was on my neck, if it was or is contagious, it could have potentially harmed other people who used the same gym equipment, chairs, even washing machines as me. This doctor's refusal to give me my own lab reports could have hurt a lot of innocent people if I was carrying something contagious like MRSA. And I'll never really know. 
It took a long time, but I made the rash go away with my own initiatives and self care. Still, it is possible to be a ""carrier"" of some infectious agents. Another thing I'll never know.
HIPAA law states that doctors can't withhold a patients medical records because of a dispute over the bill.
I know that Florida's state licensing agency for licensing doctors and other health care professionals is not going to do a damn thing about this. I've heard from too many other people in this state who have been harmed or ripped off by doctors, dentists, and nursing homes. I'm posting this as a warning to all health care ""customers."" Know what you're getting into.
 Last but not least, I requested my lab report directly from Quest, the lab that processed the test and they told me my state's laws allow them to release the lab reports ONLY to the doctor.
 
I don't see what good state regulations, federal regulations or ""Patient Protection"" laws do if unethical doctors can still run over our so called rights and get away with it.  ",Doctors

someone with some maturity of character and judgment.  So that women wont be disciplined for false confidential complaints alleging that they have Alzheimers with no patient complaints - while they have wasted MENSA I.Qs.  which is no small achievement in Ohio because Ohio did not make that happen.  Hope you girls get to belong to MENSA, but then are allowed to fulfill your potential.  In a state run by your father  he doesnt appreciate women with high IQs;

the lies are such that no one has seen this kind of case ever happen at any State Medical Board in the history of Medical Boards - it's a ONCE UPON A TIME case.  So she won't be able to prep you for the MENSA test.Mr. Whitehouse wouldnt know about talking to a smart woman either, as hes never bothered to speak to the woman MD  cant find his cell phone or the time.  Yet getting along with guys in class has never been a problem for this woman - she speaks like every other Ohio student, just faster and with more to say.  But speaking fast was supposedly a psychiatric problem for her per the State Medical Board?  Women are not allowed to talk fast in Ohio.  Can you say 'No' girls, and have your father still love you?  So far John Kasich has gone along so that actions at the State Medical Board are taken without anyone even seeing that the woman MD doesnt match the description  so sex was at the bottom of it, ie she said No.  Her IQ was then wasted through 2 Hearings, one Court of Appeals appearance, and 19 years of hell without a medical license  after 4 years of medical school and 4 years of residency training - much of it at partial Ohio taxpayer expense.  If you get through graduate school, go to a state where the Governor wants women employed  not analyzed endlessly by talking-heads with no common sense - for having a personality.  There is endless money to endlessly analyze women MDs at the State Medical Board of Ohio, and endless money to hire people to read these ridiculous reports - yet Ohio is broke and into casinos.  Has no one in Columbus ever seen anyone with an IQ > 150?   Does your dad let you have a personality, let you decide things, or just say that you must have 'blind obedience?' - do what you are told girls - with no fight-back, or arguing of the point, allowed?  This woman has had to fight back for 19 years - like the Count of Monte Cristo - have you read that book?   Will Governor Kasich allow his daughters to say No, or just expect them to get along, and go along, like he does the women MDs?  Girls you need to ask your father this; does he just allow you, or all women to refuse unwanted advances, offers, and attentions?  So far it would be only You two - Governor Kasich expects that the rest of us women will go along for the good of the state - whatever that is.  If Governor Kasich expects that women MDs will just sleep with the colleague who gets it up and down the street, whos going to do the medical care of that?  And, Im sure that Governor Kasich isnt going along with his daughters getting the HPV vaccine (like Governor Perry), because he doesnt want that his daughters will have to sleep with someone that has HPV to keep their medical license (will ever be put in that position with a boyfriend, or armorous colleague, who has HPV and makes the 'make or break' condition).  But Governor Kasich expects that women MDs will get the vaccine, do the right thing for the job, and not complain about the consequences.  Its part of Anita Steinberghs definition of aequanimitas  goodwill that goes too far - 'understanding' male colleagues who don't get it from their wives - colleagues who can 'make or break' you like Dr. Timothy Nice and Dr. Michael Keith - orthopedics that expect 'blind obedience' from women patients.The State Medical Board of Ohio does not allow women professionals to practice as they have been trained; if they challenge a colleague, or ask for up-to-date care, they will get boys being boys  and theMedical Board admits this.  Men in Ohio are not grown up and have to be 'right'; starting with Governor Kasich, they expect that women will figure them out.  And when women come as patients, figuring out some of the male physicians in Ohio is an impossible task  their wives cant do it.  Boys being boys might be ok for now girls, but ask Dad when hes going to grow up?  Get grown males on the State Medical Board of Ohio, not the Lance Talmadge types who want to find different abortion alternatives for women - claiming that is for their 'health' to have choices - for abortion?  That means that women in Ohio are so slutty that we need all these abortion choices - when we shouldn't be having abortions at all?  Abortions are not a good method of birth control - but no one on the State Medical Board of Ohio admits that - they sell abortion procedures to RIGHT TO LIFE as alternatives that women must have = how Lance Talmadge MD got re-appointed the last time = Ohio RIGHT TO LIFE sold out.  One can only imagine the abortion procedure that he is devising for re-appointment - another abortion choice for women's health in Ohio.The State Medical Board of Ohio cheats.  The legislators know, acknowledge, and think that this is a good thing to get the Medical Board out of liability for false cases, false suspensions & false disciplines - it doesn't matter how many lives are ruined or that physicians falsely suspended tend to commit suicide.  Its doesnt matter that it is wrong, its just that you dont pay for it that matters.  It's all about THE ART OF WAR; the best liar wins in Columbus - from the 30th Floor on down.Does Governor Kasich teach you that there is right and wrong, and that getting away with things is not the answer to making things better?  Does your father appreciate you having friends that want to do the right thing like Tebow?  Or does your Dad Governor Kasich advise BFFs like his Medical Board Members - who will tell you to lie to get ahead, that you should feel 'sorry' for Mrs. Nice who allows her husband to hit on the neighbor's kids in a sexual, rather than mentoring, way?  Anita Steinbergh DO tells you straight out that you should lie and get it over  all the good you will do if you lie and smooth over things - lie as the case workers say  as the legislators and Executive Directors say - Mr. Whitehouse and Mr. Dilling.  There are so many lies in Columbus that truth is a hard thing to come by.  They all expect that when it is the State vs. You, that you will lie for the state rather than tell the truth - that you can then function as a professional known for what? - her lies?  So does your Dad say that its ok to lie - be known for your ability to lie - as long as its for a good cause - like women MDs are expected to do?  That it is ok for you to lie to get an A, or be popular?  Or does he say that lying is wrong, but then does it every day on the job just for the money?The State Medical Board of Ohio wrecks lives, careers, and families for decades while they keep changing the case, changing the confidential.  There is no way to dismiss and get the physicians back to work, no way to resolve a 'confidential' case.  As the Boss  your father - cant allow the State Medical Board to admit the mistakes - even though he is not responsible for the present Membership of the State Medical Board, he won't give the woman back her license and pay for the damages - for her re-training and re-credentialing.  Your father is not about being 'fair.'  The aim in Ohio is not to pay for being bad, lying, cheating, and wrecking things  the aim is to get away with it.  Does your Dad tell you that it isnt the way you go about things, but just the final result that counts?  Like the advice that he gives the State Medical Board?    Your dads office hangs up on women MDs who call saying that they will continue to fracture bones unless they get treated for what they have, ie a bone condition, not a personality problem with men.  Do you want your friends to be injured from the wrong medical care so that you can beat them on tests in class (like Carla O'Day MD)  or get ahead by breaking the other girls arm, or giving her a concussion, in soccer practice?  Then standing around and not helping her? That's what your Dad does; that's what Tim Nice MD does when he plays polo, ie swings the stick and sits on his pony while the ambulance workers help the injured player. Your Dad is allowing that the State Medical Board withhold medical care from a woman MD until she lies that her bone pains are psychiatric  to get the Medical Board out-of-liability for the wrong diagnosis and a false suspension of a medical license for 19 years.  Your Dad sat in his office when this woman finally fractured her shoulder in May  when shed been calling almost every day since January that this would happen unless the case was opened, and the Medical Board admitted that she had a bone problem that needed treatment.  Governor Kasich watched, like you watch on the field when a classmate gets injured from everyone being too rough.  While the State Medical Board says that this is exaggeration, the Cleveland Clinic will not treat her.  The CCF physicians dont want a confidential complaint filed against their medical licenses by the corrupt Kasich administration.  At this point Strickland vs. Kasich is a draw.  Your Dad could have prevented that fracture, but sat on the sidelines.  How many more fractures will happen in the next 3 years while he hangs up the phone when she calls?    What does your Dad stand for?  Do you girls cheat to get ahead, lie when you make a mistake, hang up when a friend or neighbor calls for help or texts (even Prince Harry goes to the police station), and watch while someone gets beaten up without doing anything to intervene?  Be a high IQ person, but ask how your Dad treats those 'smart' women, say No but ask what your father does to other women who have to say No.  Be the best persons, and students, that you can, but ask Dad why he lets the boys get away with things and will he do that with your dates - let them be boys?   Is cheating ok for his Medical Board, but not for his daughters, or ok for both?  Can you change answers on a test after time-called, falsely accuse friends of things, or hang up on someone because thats what your Dad does?  My Dad never became Governor, and had to resign from Hillcrest Hospital after I was mistreated there, but he did train me to be a good person  even if Ohio does not allow me my medical license for not going along and lying - that would make me a good physician?  Medical mistakes, and other mistakes, need to be handled by admitting the problem and dealing with the consequences  not by lying or accusing the person you have hurt of being crazy.  This Christmas, the Christmas miracle would be your father  that he figures himself out and sets standards for his administration and his daughters  standards that are the right thing - that he allows that the woman MD get treated for her bone condition and stops fracturing - that he puts an end to the re-confidentialing going on at the State Medical Board of Ohio and learns to speak to a woman MD with an IQ > 150. 									",Doctors
Governor John Kasich,"  Governor John Kasich  77 South High Street, Riffe Center 30th Floor 
Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614) 466-3555,"Governor John Kasich State Medical Board of Ohio continuing the policy of taking the medical licenses of women physicians who object to the wrong, or experimental, care - referrals refused because the male physicians 'don't have to'  so that Ohio s Columbus, Ohio","
										The State Medical Board of Ohio, under Governor Kasich & Mr. Rick Whitehouse, are continuing to take the medical licenses of women who object to admittedly wrong care and just request referrals; that the erring physician sign-off.  That apparently is 'making too much of bad care,' and only requested so that the woman MD can work and care for patients.  
Continuum of care for women MDs is not allowed in Ohio - they don't 'deserve' care.  Six psychiatric evaluations are then requested of the woman MD who just asked that the male MDs, for the money, do a little work and/or sign-off to another physician who wants to do some care.  Asking for a referral, a records summary, a sign-off to another physician, etc - just asking for the the superficial business stuff -is cause for a medical license suspension in Ohio = Rick has nothing better to do.  The boys get to be boys in Ohio, starting at Riffe Center 30th Floor.    
Male orthopedics in Ohio get to walk off and not refer, consult or send even a summary of care = that's asking too much, and it is an IMPAIRMENT of the WOMAN PHYSICIAN in Ohio to ask them to do so, or to complain about this after months of trying to fill-in the blanks of what happened.  Male MDs in Ohio figure that the women MDs need to 'figure them out' - just like the Governor.  
Women physicians are getting their licenses pulled for decades because, after months, they complain - the guys won't put the casts on before the fracture swells to 'excrescence,' they forget the stockingette so the cast 'eats' through the skin after several days, the men won't write for physical therapy or an EMG (they don't know what it is), they order splints that disintegrate in several hours, and go to BEER ROUNDS.  Drinking beer is one talent of male orthopedics in Ohio.   
If you call down to the State Medical Board asking that they reaffirm the standard that male physicians have to send records, you are told to write a letter.  Then you 'don't sound good,' and need therapy and your medical license gets suspended for 'provisional' personality problems - no evidence just the word of the guys.  
Sending records, referring, consulting, and being a 'team' (as in football or soccer) professional colleague are part of the 'game' in medicine - but not for males.  None of them is a Tebow, none of them pray, none of them believe in anything but themselves - ditto the Governor.  Males can play any other game, but not the referral-consultation game in medicine.  They don't make mistakes, so patients don't deserve another opinion.  That shortcut leads to endless diagnostic errors, that the male MD is error free.  
It is not a personality problem of the woman physician, trained by other men, that she expects some communication (in English), or that she expects mistakes to happen and that they be handled with professionalism.  
You can't just dump patients on the office next door - but Dr. Timothy Nice gets to do this in Mayfield Heights, Ohio - he has 'friends' on the State Medical Board of Ohio and can 'make or break' any woman MD who doesn't do his bidding.  Against state law, he gets his 'confidential' complaints so he can counter-complain - he's got nothing better to do as he won't do orthopedics.  The males who can't do anything but Beer Rounds get their 'confidential' complaints, so that they can then spend hours testifying against the woman MD who asked that they do 5 minutes of ORTHOPEDIC work.  Their white coats say 'ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON,' not 'little boy.'
It's not the women physician's job to do the male physician's work - of care that they, or another patient, are paying the male MD to do.  But Anita Steinbergh DO, on the State Medical Board, says this is asking too much - she's not responsible for male MDs not doing any work for the money - women MDs have to have Oslerian aequanimitas about this - that males are troubled and can't do care?  
One wonders if she knows what the word means: calmness of mind, goodwill (Christmas), imperturbability in a troubled world.  Aequanimitas does not mean that medical negligence is ok.  Aequanimitas depends on patient safety in medicine, it depends on male & female MDs working together to make the medical envirnment safe - not in one-upping each other with complaints & counter-complaints.  But somewhere the Medical Board of Ohio has to say this - and send the notes saying that Dr. Nice has a wife back to the jerk.
One women MD has had her Ohio license pulled for 19 years for making too much of bad care - she asked the male orthopedics to refer after unanticipated results, and they DON'T HAVE TO REFER IN OHIO - even when the physician wanting to take over the care calls - he's just not one of the guys.  That's her crime, ie making too much and not handling males walking off care better.  How to handle a male is a question that there is no good answer to.  This is not what women physicians are trained to - they aren't the medical care police. 
Ohio is a state where boys can be boys, where a women MDs medical care can be a boys experiment, where a womans bone problem are just psychiatric as she has trouble with men, ie she says 'No.  Forty-plus states have medical mistake laws, and prohibit experimental being forced on women MDs (they can't complain so things are done to them without consent or discussion in Ohio & at Mayo Clinic). Other states mandate early referrals & consultations  not so in Ohio under Kasich & Whitehouse = Two Boys.    
The latest Medical Knowledge Self-Assessment Program of the American College of Physicians comments about patient errors and quality management in medicine.  If one physician doesn't want to care for a patient - he/she still needs to refer, and sign-off, even if that patient is a physician = communication among caregivers is mandated in all states except Ohio.  Adverse effects can happen in Ohio, the patient is just 'crazy.'  Care-to-function is not allowed woman MDs at the State Medical Board - that's making too much unless Anita Steinbergh DO is the patient.    
Orthopedics in Ohio make the common heuristic error of jumping to the conclusion that when women fracture bones they are just 'unlucky.'  There is no differential diagnosis, and the woman patient does not deserve care if she wants a workup feeling that 'something else is wrong.'  Blood work is not even allowed women MDs, at the State Medical Board of Ohio level, before licenses are taken for the face value assessment that the woman MD is just exaggerating her bone pains.  This is going on under Mike DeWine now.  
The AG's office women attorneys make fun of the symptoms that the woman MD complains of in the chart, or in notes asking the physicians to do a workup - it's a joke in Kasich-Ohio.  Women's health issues are sexual dysfunction, breast, contraception, menopase, vaginal & uterine - and the only pain allowed is pelvic pain - because that's how the guys think.  And men cause a lot of other pains besides pelvic.
Most states, except Ohio, have medical mistake laws in some form which mandate early referral & consultation when an 'unanticipated' result happens.  Governor Kasich can't get his head around this concept - that he and other men make mistakes or just don't want to do something - so just sign-off and leave the woman's livelihood alone.  Refer, even though Dr. Nice doesn't have to.  But don't take the woman MD's medical license because of Dr. Tim Nice or Dr. Michael Keith - they were asked to refer for months - fired multiples and told to sign-off = one sentence on a dictated page of paper.  But that was asking too much?????   ",Doctors

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614) 466-3555,"Governor John Kasich State Medical Board of Ohio the only state with anonymous physician confidential complaints where the Board cheats by changing the 'confidential' and the cases can't resolve - no court can accept a decision based on 'confidentia Columbus, Ohio","
										Ohio remains the only state whose Medical Board accepts 'confidential' physician complaints.  Recently the State of Texas outlawed 'anonymous' physician complaints with a law changing a bad practice only barely - but at least it was a step in the right direction of transparency.  In Ohio the ridiculousness continues, and you can't resolve anything based on 'confidential' -  might as well do a random coin toss for heads-or-tails.  'Confidential' is not the way to solve pill-mill problems, get a discussion of the issues, resolve care standard disagreements, or to get a judgment which can be used in suing for malpractice - it is not a way for a harmed patient to find a lawyer.  The process of undoing the harm, or preventing the harm, has to be better = medical mistake laws.  Medical Board complaints can't even be used to get withheld physician records in Ohio - they allow their 'friends' to edit to the point where what happened can never be determined unless you have the clairvoyance and second-sight of wizard such as Merlin.  The records then never get to the consultants for even more years.  Nothing is binding with 'confidential.'  It is just a rain dance; an illusion that the Medical Board, be it Ohio or Texas, is doing something when it fact, it is doing nothing but ruining the lives of innocent physicians - who asked for the Board to do something about the bad standards of care in a meaningful way to help improve the practice of medicine.  This should be done non-punitively.    If you ask the Medical Board in Ohio to stand up for a standard of care, they say that you need counseling to accept things as they are = the Board's 'help.'  The Help in Ohio then takes the medical license of the physician trying to ask for help.  The crime: making too much of medical mistakes, asking for help with admittedly bad care.  If you can't understand your male colleagues with aequanimitas, then you need the Board's help.  Well forgiving mistakes is one thing, but legislating that colleagues can keep harming patients is another - and that is what the State Medical Board of Ohio does by helping concerned physicians lose their licenses for saying something.  And everyone got mad at Joe Paterno.  In Ohio we have a Board of JoePas - who won't do anything, but take the license of the physician that brought the problem to their attention.    Medical mistakes are the problem, because they can be reduced, but that does not mean sending the 'victim' patient to Board-ordered psychotherapy by a new right Ohio psychiatrist.  Medical mistake laws mean immediately recognizing the MEDICAL ERROR, developing a coherent logical plan, and referring to the tertiary center that can do something about the fracture left uncasted for too many days by Dr. 'Polo' Nice, the thyroiditis that was missed because the right labs were not done by the Lafferty endocrinologist at University Green Road, the cut popliteal artery during a knee replacement because the saw was not checked by the Surgical Technologist, and the post-partum infection from too many monitors and vaginal exams during a prolonged labor.  The problem with 'confidential' physician complaints in Ohio is that when they don't prove to be true, instead of having a path to dismiss the complaint, and undo the suspension, the Ohio Medical Board just tries to change the complaint and do another confidential case.  There is no process for immediately re-licensing the falsely accused physician, returning them to the job of being a physician the week after, and paying them back for every day of missed practice and family life.  Complaints in Ohio don't have to bear the burden of proof with 'confidential,' before they are acted on.  Governor Kasich is concerned about keeping every job except keeping physicians working = not unduly harassed or falsely disciplined by the State Medical Board.  Nothing can be believed at the State Medical Board of Ohio, and no one at Riffe Center knows what is going on.  The Ohio legislators all know that the Medical Board changes the 'confidential' complaints, and the pile of false suspensions is getting worse.  There are so many falsely suspended physicians, that releasing the 'confidential' complaints of all unresolved Medical Board cases, would paralyze the state legal system with justified complaints for damages.  In 2003, then Speaker Larry Householder admitted this, and the problem has compounded since. The 'confidential' morphs over the years in Ohio, and the case becomes increasingly impossible to resolve with all the different versions of the 'confidential.'  After 19 years no one knows what the case is really about, and the Board Members tell you to lie - but that's not the TEBOW thing.  There has to be a way to dismiss false complaints, and when everything is 'confidential' you can't do that - there is no verification, no witnesses that know what the case is really about when they testify, and nothing can be improved as to medical practice care standards.  The elephant in the room never gets discussed at the Hearings.  It's a complete waste of time and money, with Hearing officers that are talking-heads.  Patients try to use the Medical Board route as a last resort for malpractice, but any decision of the Medical Board can't be used in court when everything is 'confidential' - it just makes it easier for the physician involved to get everything thrown out.  The Medical Board is not the way for lawyers to determine the malpractice $-value of a case; some cases collect, and the Medical Board completely exonerates the physician and vice versa.  It's a crap shoot of an arbitrary Board, and patients should know that their 'confidentiality' will not be respected.  The State Medical Board is only using patients as government does.  In one case, the Ohio Medical Board listed the names, in public records, of the patients that would not return to the physician doing marginal care - their 'friend.'If the State Medical Board was doing their job, the standards would never be such that really bad malpractice would occur - or it would occur less and less often with checklists and quality control measures at every point in patient care = the real job of the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Procedures would all have a number of cases attached before a physician attempts them (so orthopedics could not cast wrist fractures if they don't do at least 4/month like touch-and-goes for pilots).  As soon as a mistake happened, a colleague with more experience would have to be called.  'Confidential' complaints are a poor substitute for functional medical mistake laws - and Ohio is one of the few states left with no medical mistake laws on the books, and none in Committee.  That's what Governor Kasich should have been doing instead of getting 'up close and personal' will pill-mill physicians.  If they were making a medical mistake, the case would have been open-and-shut.Medical mistake laws instead go after the process, not the individual person, that fails: that after a correctable mistake, another physician, another plan, is not adopted immediately.  Then if the physician fails to refer or consult, the case is solid - the physician failed to recognize the mistake, and have a check-list for undoing the mistake.  Medicine always has inherent mistakes, what patients should be demanding is medical mistake laws with provisions for damage control and quick settlements. The Medical Board in Ohio doesn't stick with 'confidential' regarding patient care - and who knows what that is really about - they go after a physician's whole life for decades - one case has gone on for 19 years at a cost of over $500,000 to the State of Ohio.  Two days in 1995 were spent discussing her sex life, and if she liked men enough to be licensed in Ohio - well not the married type looking for 'understanding' - which should be a no-brainer.  Mr. Whitehouse does no accounting or budgeting of finances - he just goes after 'confidential' with an administrative fishing expedition - looking for something that will stick with bottomless state credit cards, something to threaten the physician with - and it's a brutal process of more mistakes.  The Ohio Court of Appeals will then throw it out, and the roundabout continues wasting taxpayer monies and solving nothing.  Every good lawyer tells their client not to admit anything - even for a traffic ticket - and that includes 'confidential' - which can be anything and everything in Ohio.    Ironically 'friends' of Members of the State Medical Board get their 'confidential' complaints against state law - to counter-complain about the person who complained about them - and they can get very personal as the 'confidential' is usually used against someone who the 'confidential' complainant knows well.  It's a cat-fight of men behaving badly.  One complaint case, that has gone on for 19 years was that the physician - who then counter-complained as the complaint was given to the him - would not discuss and refer in a timely way.  In residency, this would be handled by the Chief, but his Chief was his neighbor and drinking buddy at the Community Hospital.  The initial complaint was that the physician-patient just wanted the physician orthopedic to discuss, promised no suit if the problem was referred to the Cleveland Clinic, and the orthopedic used the excuse that because he had friends on the State Medical Board, he did not have to discuss, refer, consult or send medical records - it was the ill physician's job to refer herself without his summary and with him telling other orthopedics that she didn't 'deserve' care.  This orthopedic, under the 'confidential' system, still does not have to discuss - he got the Medical Board to do his physician job and protect him against malpractice for leaving fractures uncasted for weeks, while he shopped for polo ponies.  The Medical Board of Ohio is his dating service, his buddy, his referral service, and his malpractice guarantee to keep his rates down.  'Confidential' complaints are being used to go after colleague physicians, as a last resort to malpractice problems that can't be filed, and to solve personal issues that need mandated discussions.  But no one can guarantee that Mr. Whitehouse will discuss the false cases at the State Medical Board of Ohio - not even the Governor.  There is no oversight, no checks and balances for the Ohio State Medical Board. It's a waste of government time, and a ridiculous waste of a physician's time to be suspended & disciplined for 'confidential' - which won't improve anything when it was not about the physician's patient care - it was about disagreeing with her colleagues.  The files in Ohio have been recommended to be opened for reforms since 1998-9; but the Governors haven't figured it out yet.  Maybe the 'confidential' isn't really a case, maybe it's not about what the complaint says (the hidden agenda), maybe the signers wanted personal things such as office space and patient referrals?  And no one can verify a 'confidential' complaint, so licenses are taken on the basis of 'provisional, and for sure only one-sided 'partial' information.  This has resulted in Ohio having the most false physician suspensions & disciplines in the United States - a system of half-truths and word-of-mouth illusions without scientific basis - which is what medical care is supposedly based on.  Wikipedia defines the scientific method as a body of techniques for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge.  To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry must be based on gathering empirical and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.  Nothing about the State Medical Board of Ohio has ANYTHING to do with the scientific method or logical reasoning - and that's not good for medical practice.  If there is a decision about care standards during a case, then it needs to be applied, and can't if everything is 'confidential.'  Medical care has to be able to self-correct with the scientific method = measurable evidence.   The State Medical Board of Ohio needs to to stop the recycling of false physician complaints at the State Medical Board, return the licenses of physicians unjustly accused of making too much of bad care, and clear the records.  Most physicians in Ohio would do this without the $ damages (OHIO is broke) if they could get their license back and get on with their lives.  However, policies have to be developed to penalize the State of Ohio, and the Medical Board, for falsely destroying a physician's live and career - policies like those that exist in most other states for paying for the fees and re-training to get the physician back to work.  The State of Ohio Medical Board has no procedures for accountability.  Governor Kasich is not taking a good look at what is going on at the State Medical Board  where 'confidential' physician complaints by colleague physicians continue to destroy careers, and waste lives.  One should be able to contact the Medical Board about getting records, or a physician to discuss, refer, consult, and be physicianly -

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",www.governor.ohio.gov,(614) 466-3555,"Governor John Kasich State Medical Board of Ohio need to do something about the 'confidential' physician complaint system and the constant changing of a complaint to carry on a case of a woman MD objecting to the wrong care of herself for 19 years - Columbus, Ohio","
										Governor Kasich knows the case, Ohio legislators have admitted that the 'confidential' & case have been changed many times over 19 years, while trying to find a case against the woman MD with no patient complaints.  Former Representative Dolan advised suing the State of Ohio, but no lawyer knows what to put in the complaint, and the State of Ohio is broke.  The Ohio Court of Appeals could not hear the case as they could not get the file - they told the Medical Board to stop things in 1993; that it was a colleague-colleague fight over care that went wrong on a woman physician, and it was not a discipline 'case' of her.No one knows what the case is really about, to this day, except not her patient care.  'Confidential' physician complaints at Medical Boards can be changed = the problem with 'confidential' complaints is that no one sees them in a legal sense, so they can't be admitted into evidence and frozen as to content at any one point in time.  They are in perpetual flux, so that the State Medical Board is never liable for any mistake in investigating the complaint for longer than 5 minutes - you can't fix the complaint.  The signers & content can change, allowing another go at things without the reason given - for decades.  One for Team Kasich. For each 'confidential' change, which the lawyers cannot get ahold of, the woman MD is ordered to another psychiatric evaluation for her re-licensure = GOES in Ohio = to try to find a problem with her life or personality - her medical care was beyond reproach.    Her disciplinary crime: She complained about a physician who had 'friends' on the State Medical Board of Ohio after trying to get him to DISCUSS, send records, and sign-off on her care for over 6 months - in 1991.  Male MDs in Ohio don't want to discuss.  And she didn't send him enough referrals, allow him to use her father's office & staff for free, or 'understand' him because his wife didn't = a valid Medical Board complaint in Ohio in the 1990s - when harassment laws did not exist.  This case antedates workplace harassment laws - it would not happen in today's world.  There were no patient complaints about her, but she had an office full of complaints about Dr. Timothy Nice - who had the friends on the State Medical Board of Ohio.  He piled his furniture in front of her office door, sent a stale 'Angel Food' cake for Christmas, and told the rest of Hillcrest staff that he found her 'seductive' with two swollen deformed wrist fractures.  The guy was on drugs?The complaint - she made too much of his bad care - care that should not have been allowed in Ohio in 1991; she should not have had to complain if Ohio had been up-to-date regarding orthopedic practice standards.  The problem, the endless psychiatric 'goes' that have never gone on in recent history except in Communist states, in Hitler's Germany, or in Vietnamese POW prisons.  They are 'goes' that no medical insurer will cover, and completely 'fishing expeditions' to justify Dr. Nice and keep him out of malpractice claims.  The problem: there is a limit to the number of goes that a human being can undergo without severe emotional damage.  No limit to the changes to the 'confidential' physician complaint however.The case needs to be opened for reforms as was suggested in 1999.  The woman physician is dying of fractures from an untreated bone condition - the physicians at CCF will not help her lest their own medical licenses have any problem - they need to collect those drug company stipends for talks.   Hope you have a great Christmas Governor Kasich, but this woman MD is going on 20 years of hell for trying to save herself from just plain 'bad' Ohio MDs that you promised to do something about.  If it would help, like for getting a date to a ball, or for a Taylor Swift song, I would put a plea on YOUTUBE.  You need to 'unconfidential' things and figure out the problem.  This case was recommended as a starting point in 1999 -- because there were no patient complaints, and no case - but to admit that would mean liability damages even in 1999 -- and a 'show' of all those changed confidential complaints through the years.  Does the 'confidential' really exist anymore?  The reason that the offer was rescinded in 1999: $$$$$.  Does this woman MD need to fracture her other shoulder and get another 30-year old splint from Dr Brems because nothing can be done - for the good of his medical license?  He's definitely getting to clean out his closet of outdated shoulder splints.  The boys were bad in undergrad at Georgetown, and he was one of them, but. . .sex was the only goal, not career dismemberment.         									",Doctors

										In Ohio women MDs get their medical licenses suspended indefinitely (decades) for objecting to the wrong medical care done to themselves in a state where Neanderthal women's medical care is the rule - leaving fractures uncasted until they are swollen to bloody 'excrescence' (to get a surgical procedure).  The State Medical Board of Ohio President is a Podiatrist ('P' for Pres) - who thinks only of women having feet, not a neuron or a thyroid gland - they don't learn about those in Ohio Podiatry Schools.  No blood work needed for women MDs is the mantra at the Ohio State Medical Board since the days of Tom Dilling as Executive Director.  Mr. Dilling (1999-2005) could make any case into something that it wasn't for stats, and would call MDs threatening what would 'happen' if they didn't admit what he wanted them to admit - and Governor Taft let this go on for years.  The writer got some of those calls; the State Medical Board of Ohio threatens lawyers, physicians and witnesses with what can, and will, happen with their professional licenses or lives - on the phone in daytime hours & rates.     Even Lance Talmadge MD never allows a woman MD blood work before taking her medical license - even when she has classic symptoms of thyroiditis - which he can't recognize (doesn't know her, so can't see that her neck is swollen, and all he wants is for her to talk to forensic psychiatrist Dr. Resnick who hasn't examined a thyroid gland since medical school >50 years ago).  Thyroiditis is as common as corruption in Ohio - only the Members of the State Medical Board don't know the labs to order (T4 is not the answer), yet they know how to do a kangaroo court of Hearings at huge taxpayer costs avoiding the issues.  There's no accounting at the State Medical Board of Ohio - and it's not about patient care - it's about payback to colleagues that irk you.In 2000, Gail Devers went to Congress (US: Washington, DC) to complain about the medical mistakes in thyroid diagnosis in the US (done to black women, but white women were supposed to be included) - medical mistakes that nearly cost her her feet being amputated and she was an Olympic runner.  However, they still allow the same mistake done on Gail Devers to be done on white women MDs in Ohio - the same labs are allowed 'missing' to get unnecessary procedures.  Thyroid problems left untreated can lead to metabolic fractures and thyroid cancer - but the State Medical Board of Ohio & Governor Kasich don't care.  Ohio has no medical mistake laws - so any mistake goes.  If Governor Kasich kills a woman MD - he'll just threaten someone like he does for traffic tickets.  He wants to run for President like Donald Trump.Due process, transparency, and reforms are needed, and long overdue at the State Medical Board of Ohio - every Speaker of the Ohio House has known this since at least 2003 (Speaker Larry Householder).  This isn't helping patient care, ie killing any woman physician who knows her medicine for 'hunger games' sport - not allowing her proper medical treatments for the most common of problems.  Carla O'Day MD couldn't pass the tests that this woman can pass, Dr. Anita Steinbergh couldn't get into Medical School so she chose Osteopathic training - both somehow got on the State Medical Board of Ohio to judge their competition.  So kill the woman MDs with the wrong diagnosis, emotionally damage them with unending goes.  The State Medical Board of Ohio was told in 1995 by the US expert on personality disorders (NYC: Columbia-Presbyterian guy who writes the DSM), that this woman MD needed a personality, and to stop the psychiatric evaluations as they would eventually emotionally damage her so much that nothing could be done to bring her back to function.  You can't do unending psychiatric 'goes' on a normal person for political reasons, the Communists, Hitler, etc., tried this - and the dissidents, if they survived, spent the rest of their lives getting better.  One Ohio psychiatrist, who was ordered to evaluate the woman MD at Ohio taxpayer expense, was trained in Russian psychiatric 'experimental' techniques apparently - of how to 'go' after political dissidents with unending psychiatric evaluations and inappropriately prescribed meds - that training is a plus in Ohio - guarantees you a medical license.  Anonymous confidential complaints are only as good as the good-faith of the signers - which can never be ascertained in Ohio - so the cases go after the woman physician's whole life and dating history - because she didn't date Dr. Nice or play along.  The real issues are not on the 'confidential' complaint form.  Women especially are targets of anonymous physician complaints - not going along or not being a team player is a cause for Board ordered psychiatric evaluation in Ohio - that you have a personality that says 'No.'  And that used to be a 'good' thing.'Making too much' of one's own lack of medical care is a reason to take a medical license in Ohio for women MDs.  And if you complain, the complaint is never investigated, but is given - against state law - to the hospital where you work so that your colleagues can counter-complain.  Any state law can be broken in procedural process at the State Medical Board of Ohio, and nothing is ever done about it - the Members can break as many laws as they want.  'Making too much' should not be happening; bad care that you have to report should not be going on in Ohio.  It is 2011.  Governor Kasich goes along so as to not pay damages (the State of Ohio is broke) for the stack of careers that the Ohio State Medical Board has destroyed; there is never any Peer Review at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Investigating Carla O'Day MD in 2006 went nowhere.  No one knows what goes on at the State Medical Board - except that the Ohio legislators know that the Board cheats and laugh about it.  It is the most fraudulent Board in the entire US - by design, intent, and lack of oversight.  There isn't any case that the Ohio State Medical Board can't 'fix' in the name of patient care - even if it means not allowing women MDs any patient care.  You can abort babies in Ohio, so you can abort woman MDs, and the more painful the death (no pain pills or reductions allowed for fractures), the better.  Dr. Talmadge is just doing another 'experiment' on euthanasia.  And if the State Medical Board of Ohio can't find a case after 19 years, as the Medical Board has no review or dismissal process - unlike every other state - the Medical Board just allows that woman will die of lack of care, a decent job, or any justice.  Mr. Whitehouse, who can update his social network sites regularly, can't answer his cell phone (the record so far is 5.5 years like Clarence Thomas).  MD colleagues are encouraged not to treat her, or help her, until she admits whatever it is that the Board wants her to admit that she has (even a diagnosis that doesn't exist was proposed as a diagnosis for her to get treated for - which her expert stopped in 1996 as they can't do this in NYC).  The Medical Board's website is a garbage bin of falsifications, exaggerations, innuendo, and nonsense - a waste of Ohio taxpayer monies.  None of the bone experts at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Angelo Licata, Dr. Chad Deal, or Dr. Abby Abelson) can find any bone medication to treat her, labs are only infrequently ordered, ie a handful of vitamin D, TSHs, and no bone markers in 5 years - this is from the people that invented bone markers, chair the National Osteoporosis Foundation, and collect 6-figures yearly in drug company payments.  Perhaps one of these drug companies could find some complimentary bone medication for this woman MD - so that she doesn't keep fracturing?  Just let Dr. Licata know, he can't find an appointment.  This woman MD's bone situation is the most untreated case at Cleveland Clinic - she fractures and gets a 30-year old splint with 2 weeks of pain meds (lest the orthpedic be labeled a 'pill mill' MD).  The orthopedic agrees she has a serious bone problem and needs some help.  But 'the help' is nowhere to be found.Dr. Chad Deal told her he would write that she had whatever the State Medical Board of Ohio wanted her to have - no exams or labs needed - his career was more important than any patient care.  Dr. Abby Abelson will not intervene as Carla O'Day MD - the Board Member that expedited and made the case against a CWRU classmate - has to be 'right' even though she is so stupid that she could never finish a residency and had to threaten the Deans at CWRU to get through - she knew the Governor.  Carla O'Day MD never had to study in Medical School; if she didn't get Honors, the CWRU Medical School would not get the Celeste Research Building.  Dr. Abby Abelson can't make her own decisions.CWRU is the only Medical School that specializes in turning out MDs that will destroy their own classmates - and not with correct information - but with fabricated lies of the kind that have a grain of truth - and they can't help a classmate with a thyroiditis or a fracture.  It's a Medical School that trains monsters.  Dr. O'Day knew this woman, but barely spoke with her, and she never 'hung' with O'Day who specialized in getting OUT of class, rather than going to it.  CWRU has medical students that barely attended classes, but manage to graduate - no attendance is required to this day.  This woman MD was definitely more stable than Dr. O'Day back in the days of Dr. O'Day's divorce - the whole state knew of Dr. O'Day's divorce, where the records had to be sealed, and she had to start a support group for herself and Mrs. Celeste.  If we are going back 19 years to find a case at the State Medical Board of Ohio, why not 40?  Dr. O'Day's medical license was never threatened even though she did some very crazy things, and made serious patient care gaffes, during the days of her divorce - and her divorce was very bad behavior for any professional to emulate - as was her behavior in Medical School.  She was the original Demi Moore, flirting in the halls with students a decade or more younger - never giving advice or encouragement, just being Carla.  Carla O'Day (then Streepy) was competition for other women for male dates - and we never saw her husband unlike most married student's spouses.  Anonymous physician complaints should not be coming from former Medical School classmates who know too much personal, or pretend to.  And they should not be coming from physician's who have not signed-off a physician's orthopedic care - who are still responsible for the complications that they caused - and who don't want to take care of the mess that they caused = sort of a conflict-of-interst?'Confidential' physician complaints in Ohio means that women physicians have their licenses suspended for 'confidential' unless they will admit what the Medical Board wants them to admit - the cases are total fraud, and don't involve patient care, ie the woman physician is supposed to have Alzheimer's disease when the Mensa Society wants her dues for testing an IQ > 150.  [No one ever knows what the confidential complaint is by-the-way, during the proceedings, and this 'confidential' is frequently changed and morphed to find a case as the testimony goes on.]  The Board uses case Hearings to find a case; they don't have to have a valid case to suspend a medical license in Ohio.Neither Governor Kasich, nor any Members of the State Medical Board, test in the >150 IQ range = the problem in Ohio = legalized stupidity.  Ohio is a state by the stupid, for the stupid, like in the story Country of the Blind by HG Wells (which Governor Kasich hasn't bothered to read as he's waiting for Ohioans to 'figure' him out.  Governor Kasich doesn't read, but he doesn't have to read a 'confidential' complaint - that's why they are 'confidential' - no one has to read anything, and it can be changed.  Does it really exist is the question after 19 years? New laws in other states (Texas) ban anonymous physician complaints, but not so in Ohio where it is a legalized witch hunt - if you don't sleep with Dr. Nice then you are just 'paranoid,' and have to get 6 psychiatric evaluations that you aren't enamoured with your orthopedic - who doesn't know how to cast wrist fractures and can't refer.  And no one bothers to ask when his last STD testing was - is he a HPV carrier like many men in NE Ohio who give their wives cervical cancer as a Christmas present?  Someone's spreading that disease around. Dr. Nice has to have an example for all the state to know that if you don't please him as a medical professional, you will lose your medical/nursing license.  His wife isn't to be felt sorry for, as she goes along with the PR in getting the licenses suspended; she can place any nameless stringer article in the Sun Press, or contact the airlines that you are on drugs - for awhile she had travel agency software.  Carla O'Day MD can drag you into Rocky River Municipal Court on spurious charges, just phoning her is a crime in Ohio - she needs to be in the gym toning her body, and she won't show in court just expect the staff at RRMC to lie for her despite the phone records.  In Texas, the woman Medical Board President was having her husband 'complain' anonymously about her MD competition - until some of the 'confidential' became 'unconfidential' - was tracked to the source.  It is little better in Ohio, Dr. O'Day used the State Medical Board to go after her former classmates.      Ohio needs to have transparency and reforms at the State Medical Board of Ohio before the aforementioned woman MD dies of the bone complications of untreated thyroiditis - a diagnosis that required a thyroid panel in 1992 with some snythroid - she only got those tests done in 1992, in Washington DC, at Georgetown Medical Center after another fracture - and they could not believe the 'miss.'  Cleveland Clinic medicine is only for those women who don't have thyroid disease or an MD.  Even Governor Kasich can do better - but he needs a brain - someone please call the Wizard of Oz.

In fact, he only wants Vietnamese patients, since he does not have his supplies written in English. He then builds Medicare for two visits, and  MEDICARE still pay him. In other words, Medicare will pay a doctor by doing absolutely nothing, even if the doctor injures the patient by discrimination. I disputed the charges, and Medicare ignored me, and says, if he saw you, he gets paid. The doctor even had the audacity to send me a bill 5 months later after I had been in his office, but received NO SERVICES, after Medicare paid him. In other words, all I have to do is stand in front of a doctor, whether he helps me or not, he gets paid. This is how the medical profession has manipulated everything. In other words they are not ruled by commerce. I am outraged that our hard earned money we pay all our lives is mismanage and overpaid to doctors. I tried to call the management company, Noridian Administrative Services, and they tell me that they can't talk to them, to call Medicare and ask for a hearing. I called back and asked for a supervisor. The supervisor tells me that there is nothing I can do, no matter how many times I ask for a hearing that it is not going to do any good.

										Maybe if Governor Kasich were not so busy expecting to be figured out, he might have noticed the abuses of the 'confidential' complaint at the State Medical Board of Ohio - an abusive system needing reforms for decades as colleagues go after their competition 'confidentially.'  And not one legislator seems to get the game.  Earth to Governor Kasich, you might need to be understand your kids instead of them trying to understand you = adult behavior = Psychology 101 in college (maybe not in Ohio).If a woman MD wants to marry a certain guy MD, or have an affair d'coeur, a guy MD who's interested in some other woman MD - just file a complaint against that woman MD at the State Medical Board and her life will be ended as she knows it - just like Carla O'Day MD did in the early 1990s when she was apparently into Dr. Nice.  Because those 'confidential' complaints are just changed until some case is found, even if originally it wasn't a case - that physician's life will never be the same or get back to her Fellowship in St. Louis.  
The Medical Board of Ohio has no way to dismiss a false case that they have acted on, so they never give up and mandate that you admit their lies or never have a license again.  Board Members & legislators, and case workers, tell you to lie - and it depends what the lies are - if you can sign them, say them without choking, or live with them.   
Just ask Jim Trakas how many times these 'confidential' complaints are changed - he's now in the business of doing it at the Ohio Cosmetology Board.  If Carla O'Day MD couldn't have a life, then no one deserved a life, and if she couldn't study, then other women MDs were to have their licenses suspended to level the playing field.  'Confidential' colleague physician complaints are the new age way to go at your competition - and they are very effective in Ohio.  And they were in Texas until just recently - when the Medical Board was sued for this.  
Anyone that Carla O'Day MD ('Streepy' in Medical School) hated was 'confidentialed' in the early 1990s, when she was a Medical Board Member.  And Carla collected for these vendettas from Hillcrest Hospital and maybe other health care system facilities - she was the 'goto' gal to fix bad care things that the guys did at Hillcrest - and she was rewarded with the ER Directorship.  NO ONE DENIES THIS.  Dr. Anita Steinbergh, who thinks that women MDs should understand males with 'aequanimitas,' is her successor in this practice; she didn't get into medical school so she likes going at women MDs who did, and she's not to blame for anything.  
Dr. Carla O'Day got on the State Medical Board because she could 'handle' Mrs. Celeste, and Governor Celeste didn't have a clue; she was the 'pillow-talk appointee' and the Senate Health Committee approved her. . .as they have continued to re-approve Anita Steinbergh DO four times (20 years on the State Medical Board this year), and Governor Kasich will probably re-approve her again.  There are no term limits, and credentials don't count - just read the New York Times bestseller list and be glued to your cell phone if anyone asks a question.  
Maybe if Governor Kasich wasn't so needy he would have time to consider and appoint someone new to the State Medical Board of Ohio - a campaign promise not made good on.  Maybe he should talk with Anita Steinbergh DO, or try having a dinner conversation with the pro bona 3rd trimester abortion guy Dr. Lance Talmadge.  To understand, rather than to be understood, is part of the St. Francis prayer - it is adult behavior that the Governor has yet to set a standard for.  Male physicians then want to be 'understood,' and 'figured out,' and the Medical Board of Ohio expects that women MDs will do this for male colleagues -who don't have to do medicine, refer, consult or send records - they have 'friends.'  Women physicians must use Oslerian 'aequanimitas' to deal with male MDs and their outrageous comments & demands, and if William Osler knew about this misuse of his term - he would projectile vomit from the grave.  
Dr. Timothy Nice (Mayfield Heights, Ohio) is an example, he expects that women MDs and patients 'understand' him as his wife (or ex) doesn't.  The office staff tells you this nonsense - while they smoke and party.  And his wife has him figured out, but the women MDs have their licenses taken for this in Ohio - the 'confidential' complaint that he files about them.  Dr. Nice doesn't have to refer, consult, cast (cast padding goes to the polo ponies), send records, or discuss - he has 'friends' on the State Medical Board - and he does - no one denies this.  And he's still practicing - a disgrace.  Mr. Whitehouse defends him for 6-figures plus in Ohio taxpayer monies.  Dr. Nice can get any women MD's license suspended that he wants; Anita Steinbergh DO & Lance Talmadge MD are two of his many friends.  
Making too much of admittedly bad care - which shouldn't be going on in any state - is a reason to suspend a medical license in Ohio.  Noticing bad care is an 'impairment' in Ohio - where there are no medical mistake laws.  Instead of getting himself figured out, Governor Kasich should have figured this out, by himself, and put through medical mistake laws.  Male physicians get their 'confidential' complaints so that they can get back; just like in Texas where the Board gave a male physician the complaint of two nurses and he went after them.  But in Ohio this is legal - you can beat a woman MD up in an office at MetroHealth.      
The Texas Medical Board has had to stop abuses of the physician anonymous and 'confidential' complaint system.  Their Board President, just like Carla O'Day in 1990-93, was using the 'confidential' complaint system to have her husband complain about her competition - it was completely legal.  Carla O'Day MD would sign the complaints herself, as a Medical Board Member, against classmates from CWRU Medical School - complaints that she expedited - nothing better to do?  
But if Governor Kasich would give good example maybe some of this might stop, and maybe he would have noticed the problems at the State Medical Board that he needed to be focused on so that a woman physician wasn't continuing to fracture from so-termed 'psychiatric' bone problems - a colleague 'confidential' complaint suspension.  When male physicians can't cast your fractures, or order the blood work, they get your medical license suspended.  When Governor Kasich can't get anything passed, he's just misunderstood.   
Everything at the State Medical Board of Ohio needs a new right Ohio psychiatrist - no blood work is allowed for women physicians, no casts, no family life, and no 'figuring out' - that's only for males in Ohio.  Thyroid problems - the woman physician doesn't 'deserve' blood work per the ex-Executive Director Tom Dilling.  
And thyroid problems are ubiquitous in Ohio for some reason, and they can go to papillary cancer of the thyroid - but who cares as the State Medical Board hopes that women physicians who don't sleep with Dr. Nice just die of the fractures or the untreated thyroiditis.  It's not about fair, it's about statistics.If the Governor had immediately unconfidentialed all the unresolved cases - they would ALL be over at this time.  Because most of these 'cases' are blatantly false - just no knows what the case about - including the Ohio Court of Appeals - to dismiss permanently.  There's no oversight of the State Medical Board; no review of their decisions and cases - it's all 'confidential' like oil company bids were in Alaska at one time.  There's been a 'stack' of false MD suspensions & disciplines since 1999 - some former classmates of Dr. O'Day - but Governor Kasich expects to be figured out instead of figuring things out for himself.  Does he need a tutor?      
If the Governor would just grow up, maybe the male MDs, and the State Medical Board decisions, would 'grow' up.  In the meantime, stacks of careers are wasted on decisions made on 'confidential' that can't be verified or see the light of any review panel.  Hearings are endless, findings of fact get stupider and more ridiculous on round #2, even when the Ohio Court of Appeals throws the case out.  But the loss of careers, lives, and other adults being able to have a life and give understanding is the tragedy.    									",Doctors

Governor John Kasich Ohio,"  Governor John Kasich Ohio  77 South High Street, 30th Floor Riffe Center 
Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",governor.ohio.gov,(614) 466-3555,"Governor John Kasich Ohio State Medical Board of Ohio  are killing a woman physician because they can't admit that they made a mistake taking her medical license without allowing her blood work for multiple fractures - we are all supposed to 'figure' Gove Columbus, Ohio","
										Ohio is the only State where women physician licenses are taken for 'confidential' complaints - with 'confidential' meaning colleague physicians who wanted personal & professional favors - without the woman physician having any patient complaints.  The medical mistakes are made on the women physicians instead; they get the 'experimental' casts, the casts with no stockingette padding, the 30-year old splints.  Anything old, that hasn't worked, gets tried on them again as they can't complain or they lose their medical license.  The worst medical student, who hasn't showered, is brought in to assist or sew them up at Mayo Clinic.  Rooms full of observers make fun that she asks that her fracture be disimpacted and straightened out - that's a joke for a woman MD - in front of PAs, MAs and the medical student without a white coat on his cell phone.    This oversight is destroying physician lives, health & their families as the cases go on for decades while Mr. Whitehouse polishes his social network skills on LinkedIn.  Mr. Whitehouse - Executive Director of the State Medical Board of Ohio - can communicate on LinkedIn, but not on his phone with physicians he has falsely accused.  5 years of messages and he can't call them back - too busy updating his social network profiles.    No one knows what the 'confidential' complaint is on most physicians in Ohio, except for the privileged few that get their complaint against state laws.  These physicians have 'friends' on the State Medical Board of Ohio and pay their dues in job contracts, consultation fees, hospital staff appointments, etc.  No Ohio lawyer knows what really started the case, as they can't get the files, and therefore no one can end the case - but you pay anyways.  It's an endless walkabout where the physician is told by former State Representative Trakas to just lie and get back to work.  And Anita Steinbergh DO says the same - lie and end this - well then you don't have any self left - it's all lies.  So at the Ohio State Board of Cosmetology - it's all lies now - as Jim Trakas is running that Board just like he learned.The Medical Board of Ohio can only end a case with a physician admitting the case, dismissals are few and decades, and at least half $millions between - their procedural rules haven't been changed in 20 years.  And you can't admit, or fight, a case that is 'confidential' - even high school kids know this - and they don't know much these days in Ohio.  Endless evaluations done for 'confidential' are null and void, so the Medical Board keeps ordering the 'goes' on women physicians.  Meanwhile, Governor Kasich pretends to be a Renaissance man; eating bananas & name-dropping Taylor Swift to prove his country 'cool' value.    That you can't fight a 'confidential' case, or defend yourself, is why most states do not allow 'confidential,' or anonymous, physician complaints by law - it doesn't work.  And if they do allow the 'confidential' complaint route, most states stipulate that the 'confidential' can't be physicians hitting on the woman physician for 'understanding' and patient referrals, or physicians that couldn't put a cast on the woman physician's fracture.  Diagnoses, or impairments, can't be based on 'confidential,' but lives & reputations are ruined based on 'confidential.'  But someone needs to tell Governor Kasich that - maybe Taylor Swift can compose a song on the Medical Board in Ohio - the Board Members are just like her dates - virtual reality with no stand-up value.  This only happens in Ohio because the Governor is too busy looking in the mirror at himself; 'Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the best Governor of all. . .'  And the mirror has to answer . . .Medical licenses are taken in Ohio for women physicians being victims of malpractice - so that they don't sue, or say anything to improve the care.  They are not even allowed blood work before their licenses are taken for 'making too much of admittedly bad care.'  And the Medical Board will cheat as many times as it takes to find a case, or kill the woman MD - after Ohio taxpayers helped pay for her education & training.  The woman MD won't get any medical care, or be able to have a child, until she admits the Board's case, and the Governor's office will hang up on her for trying - even after she has another fracture.  She will be beaten up in physician offices by the staff, arms bruised, have procedures done on her that she did not consent to - basically any abuse is ok - even by The Cleveland Clinic.  Her lawyers will be called several times a day for the physician to admit.  It's like Joan of Arc and the English except that the Ohio State Medical Board can't burn the woman MD at the stake any more.  But in Ohio they might bring that back too.  And that's killing at least one women physician who was left with an untreated thyroid condition for at least a decade, as well as fractures that didn't even finish physical therapy.  The orthopedics who goofed had 'friends' on the State Medical Board of Ohio; they didn't have to refer, consult, send records or follow their mistakes - they just beat them up minus lab work.  Even the Ohio Court of Appeals telling the Medical Board to solve this in another way, in 1993, didn't make the Board get any sense.  The Medical Board in Ohio has to be 'right' even if they kill the physicians that they are supposed to be working with and helping deliver care.  They can just import more FMGs. Ohio is the only State that has a Governor that the people are supposed to 'figure' out, instead of the Governor being a little less self-centered and figuring out the people, the problems, and physicians, of Ohio.  Governor Kasich isn't much good at self-study.  Governor Kasich appears to be extremely self-centered and self-concerned, and while he likes Taylor Swift he doesn't appear to have listened to her song entitled, 'MEAN.'You, with your switching sides and your walk-by lies and your humiliationYou, have pointed out my flaws again as if I don't already see themI'll walk with my head down trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress youI just wanna feel okay again. . . (Taylor Swift)Currently a number of physicians, including the woman MD aforementioned, have boxes pointing out their supposed flaws in that they noticed the bad medical care in Ohio; they learned from their training.  But not allowing a woman physician blood work, a thyroid panel (and some of the thyroiditis goes to cancer, but who cares? with a woman physician in Ohio?), or even gyn care.  She was just supposed to bleed out in NYC, but she got to Columbia-Presbyterian in time - no thanks to the last 20 years of Ohio Governors & Medical Board Members.  Governor Kasich is just playing JoePa by allowing the State Medical Board to go after women MDs for confidential complaints by male physicians (and friends) who wanted the personal, and then allowing the Medical Board, as a condition of re-licensure, to mandate that the woman physician work with & refer to the abuser male - to make sure she's learned to be 'easy' and 'understand' her place.  Returning to the showers is a condition of re-licensure under 'confidential.'  And Governor Kasich hasn't figured it out yet. 									",Doctors

I was completely disgusted by her lack of knowledge. I had spent over $1000 only to find out what I already knew and all they wanted to do was sell me things that did not address my problem.

											..... He is committed to providing patients’ with the best in education, surgical techniques and technology, highest standards of care pre and post-operatively, and to ensure all patients with a safe and enjoyable surgical experience.  Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery / Statement from the owner:  ""I wake up each morning feeling blessed to be able to help others through the talents and skills God has given me. Aesthetic surgery is my passion. I love that I am able to make a difference in patients’ lives.

I am committed to providing a safe and enjoyable environment for patients, as well as to delivering the unparalleled surgical results they expect. I hold myself to the highest standards in providing excellence in patient care, in always listening to and respecting patient’s needs and to living life as an upstanding human being. I am first a doctor, then a surgeon. I care immensely about each and every patient, and am always available for my patients.” STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM BHPS.

Their new policy is to always contact all customers to gather valuable feedback so that they can continue to adapt and deliver the best customer service possible. They are willing to go beyond the call of good customer service and do what it takes to make things right with their customers. 

“We have an open door policy, and encourage frequent and open communications. We value our patients’ feedback and are grateful for the thousands of positive reviews on patient experience at our practice, and happiness with surgical results. We frequently interact with our patients post-surgically and diligently monitor patient recovery process. Because of our attention to patient care and needs, we have been voted Best of Spa in LA, Top Plastic Surgeon in LA, and awarded with Patients’ Choice Award for the 5 year in a row. We are humbled by such recognitions, and strive to continue to be the gold standard in plastic surgery.” 

“We have one of the most frequent post-operative, follow up schedules in the plastic surgery community. The doctor sees all patients himself for numerous follow up appointments. We also are known to be extremely accessible. Patients have the doctor’s cell phone number, home number, direct line at office, in addition to patient care coordinators’ direct lines and cell phone numbers.” Testimonials from physicians who have worked with Dr. Chiu and Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery:  ""I have known Dr. Chiu for more than 10 years, and from 2003 to 2005 we worked for the same specialty group. During this time, I personally observed his clinical and surgical skills. He is highly respected by our peers and patients for his technical and artistic ability. He also has a deep respect for our surgical practice. He often attends meetings, above and beyond what is needed for CME requirements, in order to stay abreast with the latest changes in our profession. Although we no longer work for the same surgical group, I still maintain a robust academic relationship with him, and we consult each other for suggestions and advice on different topics involving plastic surgery. He has proven himself to be an outstanding and caring surgeon, and I recommend him to you without reservation.” – Dr. Howard Hu, plastic surgeon

“I have known him for 9 years and have worked with him for 4. I have worked with him in the operating room as well as in patient care. I have found him to be of superior knowledge in his field of plastic surgery. He is excellent in the operating room where his technique is wonderful and his care of patients superb. Lastly, he is wonderful with his patients, who love him.” – Dr. Richard Hodnett, plastic surgeon

“His clinical acumen and bedside manners are admirable. He has proven to be an excellent source of information and I frequently find myself adopting his recommendations. Judging by the number of his referrals, his treatment plans more than satisfy his patients’ needs. His surgical habits are as meticulous as one would hope for. He organizes a sound surgical plan but his the flexibility to adjust to any situation that may arise. He is efficient with his time, yet is artistic to his patients’ individual needs. He has always shown himself to be ethically responsible and upstanding. He cares very much for his patients. I have always known him to look out for his patients’ welfare and health above any personal gain. He exemplifies the spirit of professionalism and care. I am proud to call him a colleague and recommend him to you without reservation.” – Dr. Paymon Simoni, plastic surgeon

“He is an excellent surgeon and physician. He is one of the most meticulous surgeons I have ever worked with, and is well-respected by his medical peers, nurses, and operating room personnel who have had the pleasure of working with or for him. His attentiveness, skill, professional integrity, and patient care is commendable and consistent throughout the entire surgery process and I will continue to recommend my patients, friends, and family to him without reservation.” – Dr. Paul Nassif, facial plastic surgeonThe information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Christine Chiu during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery, Inc.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..


In order to provide great customer care for patients, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery offers customer service that is provided by Client Services Coordinators who are specifically assigned to each patient for the entirety of their relationship with the office. Christine Chiu stated that, “All aspects of the anonymous complaint made against us appear to be unfounded, false, and without merit.” 

Their Client Services Coordinators consult individuals about their pretreatment process and are also responsible for following up with clients after treatment to ensure that the clients’ healing continues as expected. 

After complaints were made about them on Ripoff Report, their office staff still continues to provide excellent service to each and every customer and client. 

When asked to describe their standard practices for resolving customer complaints Mrs. Chiu explained, “Each client is provided with the office phone, mobile phone, and home phone number for their surgeon, as well as for their Client Services Coordinator. Any issues are addressed immediately and if immediate action is not possible, then the issues are addressed as soon as reasonably possible at the client’s 100% convenience. For example, if a client sends a text message or calls at 1:00 am the surgeon and the Client Services Coordinator will both respond within a few minutes, if not sooner.” 

Their process for advising treatment plans for patients is a one-on-one process handled by the surgeon, as well as the Client Services Coordinator. 

Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery, Inc. maintains that complaints made about them on Ripoff Report are false. For example, one of the anonymous complaints stated that the client was happy to know the office could remain in business because of the other surgeons in the practice. However, they only have one physician/surgeon in their office. 

During the onsite interview Mrs. Chiu was asked about a complaint that was made by a patient that did not feel as though they received accurate and complete consultation before and after treatments: “The anonymous complaint is based on vague and untrue information which does not reflect the experience of any patient ever seen by our office. 

With over 15,000 successful procedures performed on just as many clients, there have only been complaints by less than 1/10th of 1%, which is effectively less than 10 patients in the very long history of the office’s practice. In each one of those cases, the office bent over backwards to make sure that any and all issues were eventually resolved to the final satisfaction of those clients.” 

All patients are advised accordingly in an open, honest and ethical manner, especially when handling a situation where a client is looking for a procedure to be done that, in the physician’s professional opinion, is not an area of concern for their current state. 

Their company has taken the filing of this apparently false complaint as a real “gut punch.” Customer service has always been their top priority and it remains so at this time as they move forward.

He talked with me about all my options and gave me all the information I needed. My husband and I agreed with everything he proposed and my results turned out amazing! I can’t believe how great I look! My husband is very happy also mostly because I am so happy. Thank you so much!""

NOW TO THE ORIGINAL REPORT THAT WAS FILED   Dr. Gabriel Chiu BHPS, Inc. , Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery Dr. Gabriel Chiu Review - The Most Negligent, Careless, Irresponsible and Uncaring Doctor Beverly Hills, California This report is my experience, and the truth, with Dr. Gabriel Chiu in Beverly Hills at Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery, also known as BHPS, Inc., who has proven to be extremely negligent, irresponsible, unethical and uncaring. I cant even begin to explain the amount of tears and pain Dr. Gabriel Chiu has caused with his extreme negligence.  This truthful report doesnt begin to explain not even the surface - of all the problems, tears and pain Dr. Gabriel Chiu has caused with his extreme negligence.  God knows that this report is nothing compared to what Dr. Gabriel Chiu has done. But it is only the tip of the iceberg of the Karma Dr. Gabriel Chiu has created for himself - by his inexcusable carelessness, and irresponsible mistakes. This report is the direct result of Dr. Chius mistakes and negligence.  Due to Dr. Gabriel Chius negligence, I was even rushed to the hospital emergency room - after panic attacks caused by Dr. Chius extreme negligence and unbelievable mistakes.  I have been placed on different medications just to stay calm.  I went from a healthy and happy person to depressed and even suicidal due to Dr. Gabriel Chius negligence. I even stopped working and havent been out much since his negligence.  I only wish I had known what an uncaring, uneducated (his schools rating says enough) and negligent doctor - Dr. Chiu in Beverly Hills truly is - before being fooled by his Beverly Hills office.  I dont know how Dr.  Gabriel Chiu can put his head down, and actually sleep at night - knowing what type of pain his careless mistakes have caused for another human being and a patient who put their trust in him.  Trusting him has been the biggest mistake I have ever made. Dr. Gabriel Chiu will pay in one way or another for every single tear and every bit of pain he has caused by his negligence.  He might appear to be able hide behind his bank account, and his Beverly Hills office for a short time - but he will NOT be able to hide from Gods justice.  The Karma that Dr. Gabriel Chiu has created for himself, by causing another person so much pain, will catch up with him sooner or later.  I also read other negative comments about his office, and if I had seen them before I stepped into his irresponsible and poor practice, I would have never walked into his office.  Dr. Gabriel Chiu will pay one way or another for every single tear shed, and every bit of pain caused by his poor practices and negligence.  In addition to all that, as long as he has any patient who suffers and whose lives have been affected in any way - due to his mistakes and careless practice, Dr. Gabriel Chiu will suffer at least 100 fold.

We are humbled by such recognitions, and strive to continue to be the gold standard in plastic surgery.” 

“We have one of the most frequent post-operative, follow up schedules in the plastic surgery community. The doctor sees all patients himself for numerous follow up appointments. We also are known to be extremely accessible. Patients have the doctor’s cell phone number, home number, direct line at office, in addition to patient care coordinators’ direct lines and cell phone numbers.” Testimonials from physicians who have worked with Dr. Chiu and Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery:  ""I have known Dr. Chiu for more than 10 years, and from 2003 to 2005 we worked for the same specialty group. During this time, I personally observed his clinical and surgical skills. He is highly respected by our peers and patients for his technical and artistic ability. He also has a deep respect for our surgical practice. He often attends meetings, above and beyond what is needed for CME requirements, in order to stay abreast with the latest changes in our profession. Although we no longer work for the same surgical group, I still maintain a robust academic relationship with him, and we consult each other for suggestions and advice on different topics involving plastic surgery. He has proven himself to be an outstanding and caring surgeon, and I recommend him to you without reservation.” – Dr. Howard Hu, plastic surgeon

“I have known him for 9 years and have worked with him for 4. I have worked with him in the operating room as well as in patient care. I have found him to be of superior knowledge in his field of plastic surgery. He is excellent in the operating room where his technique is wonderful and his care of patients superb. Lastly, he is wonderful with his patients, who love him.” – Dr. Richard Hodnett, plastic surgeon

“His clinical acumen and bedside manners are admirable. He has proven to be an excellent source of information and I frequently find myself adopting his recommendations. Judging by the number of his referrals, his treatment plans more than satisfy his patients’ needs. His surgical habits are as meticulous as one would hope for. He organizes a sound surgical plan but his the flexibility to adjust to any situation that may arise. He is efficient with his time, yet is artistic to his patients’ individual needs. He has always shown himself to be ethically responsible and upstanding. He cares very much for his patients. I have always known him to look out for his patients’ welfare and health above any personal gain. He exemplifies the spirit of professionalism and care. I am proud to call him a colleague and recommend him to you without reservation.” – Dr. Paymon Simoni, plastic surgeon

“He is an excellent surgeon and physician. He is one of the most meticulous surgeons I have ever worked with, and is well-respected by his medical peers, nurses, and operating room personnel who have had the pleasure of working with or for him. His attentiveness, skill, professional integrity, and patient care is commendable and consistent throughout the entire surgery process and I will continue to recommend my patients, friends, and family to him without reservation.” – Dr. Paul Nassif, facial plastic surgeonThe information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Christine Chiu during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery, Inc.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..


In order to provide great customer care for patients, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery offers customer service that is provided by Client Services Coordinators who are specifically assigned to each patient for the entirety of their relationship with the office. Christine Chiu stated that, “All aspects of the anonymous complaint made against us appear to be unfounded, false, and without merit.” 

Their Client Services Coordinators consult individuals about their pretreatment process and are also responsible for following up with clients after treatment to ensure that the clients’ healing continues as expected. 

After complaints were made about them on Ripoff Report, their office staff still continues to provide excellent service to each and every customer and client. 

When asked to describe their standard practices for resolving customer complaints Mrs. Chiu explained, “Each client is provided with the office phone, mobile phone, and home phone number for their surgeon, as well as for their Client Services Coordinator. Any issues are addressed immediately and if immediate action is not possible, then the issues are addressed as soon as reasonably possible at the client’s 100% convenience. For example, if a client sends a text message or calls at 1:00 am the surgeon and the Client Services Coordinator will both respond within a few minutes, if not sooner.” 

Their process for advising treatment plans for patients is a one-on-one process handled by the surgeon, as well as the Client Services Coordinator. 

Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery, Inc. maintains that complaints made about them on Ripoff Report are false. For example, one of the anonymous complaints stated that the client was happy to know the office could remain in business because of the other surgeons in the practice. However, they only have one physician/surgeon in their office. 

During the onsite interview Mrs. Chiu was asked about a complaint that was made by a patient that did not feel as though they received accurate and complete consultation before and after treatments: “The anonymous complaint is based on vague and untrue information which does not reflect the experience of any patient ever seen by our office. 

With over 15,000 successful procedures performed on just as many clients, there have only been complaints by less than 1/10th of 1%, which is effectively less than 10 patients in the very long history of the office’s practice. In each one of those cases, the office bent over backwards to make sure that any and all issues were eventually resolved to the final satisfaction of those clients.” 

All patients are advised accordingly in an open, honest and ethical manner, especially when handling a situation where a client is looking for a procedure to be done that, in the physician’s professional opinion, is not an area of concern for their current state. 

Their company has taken the filing of this apparently false complaint as a real “gut punch.” Customer service has always been their top priority and it remains so at this time as they move forward. Testimonials from REAL patients of Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery:  Dr. Gabriel Chiu, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery website to see handwritten copies of testimonials.

Thanks for your advice!""

K.R.

Kelly

""After hearing so many plastic surgery nightmares I was very hesitant to go into my consultation. I had done lots of research on doctors and looked at many before and after galleries at home. His work really stood out the most to me and I decided to go see him. I was still a little nervous but after talking with him all my fears were taken away. The way he talks about everything is so informative and honest. He doesn’t give you unrealistic expectations and helps you understand exactly what you need to know is best for you. I was worried about my recovery and if I would be able to take care of my kids after. My recovery went better than I thought and I had very little pain. Everything turned out so good thank you!"" 
Gina ""After having four children I never thought I would be happy with the way I looked ever again! After meeting with him I regained hope of feeling beautiful again. He talked with me about all my options and gave me all the information I needed. My husband and I agreed with everything he proposed and my results turned out amazing! I can’t believe how great I look! My husband is very happy also mostly because I am so happy. Thank you so much!""

NOW TO THE ORIGINAL REPORT THAT WAS FILED  ",Doctors
Governor John Kasich Ohio,"  Governor John Kasich Ohio  Riffe Center, 30th Floor - 77 South High Street 
Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",http://governor.ohio.gov,(614) 466-3555,"Governor John Kasich Ohio State Medical Board of Ohio  Please do something about the Stasi Ohio State Medical Board of 'confidential' complaints and lies - where physician licenses are taken without checking the facts that can't be verified with 'confiden Columbus, Ohio","
										Governor Kasich you ran for election in Ohio, and were elected, on the promise to 'clean up' the Ohio State Medical Board.  To stop the bad physicians from leaving fractures to 'ripen,' or doing 'experimental' hockey-stick casts (men think in terms of sports).  My arm for 3 weeks in 1990 looked like a disjointed hockey stick attached to my body.  These are 'things,' or ideas, that don't work, but that idiotic male egos want to try in Ohio - on women patients - on women physician-patients who they threaten with loss of licensure if they report the problems.  My one orthopedic wanted to try leaving wrist fractures uncasted in 1990 - he read it somewhere.    You were NOT elected to terify every orthopedic from giving a hip or shoulder fracture some pain meds for the first few weeks - until the fractures start to heal.  And in Ohio we women are ALL vitamin D deficient, and don't heal fractures very well.  But you've managed single-handledly to make every orthopedic a 'jerk' in Ohio - overnight.  Serious fractures are seriously painful - and you can't do marijuana for this like in California - so set reasonable rules and standards.  Ask my last Cleveland Clinic orthopedic - he has never fractured a bone - never had bone pain - so he doesn't care as long as he isn't mistaken for a pill-mill physician for giving a woman with a serious comminuted shoulder fracture a few pain meds.  He wanted someone else to prescribe the few pain pills I got in Ohio - he doesn't care so long as his license isn't ever questioned.  The women patients can go to hell and back with the pain - he won't budge.  And he was a decent guy in college - not so anymore.'Experimental' anything is just experimental - it hasn't got any track record.  No fractures should be casted 'experimentally' because Dr. Nice can't be bothered to do a decent cast as he was shopping for polo ponies and telling other orthopedics 'not to care' for the patient.  Nice goes around saying that other physicians 'steal' his patients - so no one wants to deal with the psychosis - but he has 'friends' on the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Friends who party with him, and get benefits from him, ie Carla O'Day MD, and the Fred Suppes's husband & wife.  For starters, the State Medical Board should be making restrictions on 'experimental' therapies that aren't signed for with a release, or that have no basis in the literature or even medical fiction - that someone just wants to try.  Dr. Michael Keith, of MetroHealth, still thinks that the Medical Board will back his 'experimentals.'  They don't work, and the Cleveland VA was sued for his 'experimental' work on veterans, but that didn't stop him.  You cannot expect that other state agencies, municipalities, school systems, and the public library system will pay the cost of the abuses at the State Medical Board of Ohio - abuses of power that have gone on for over 20 years - since the 'confidential' complaint system was voted by simple-minded politicians.  'Confidential' complaints - it's an idea that sounds good, but doesn't work in realtime because people are jealous, people are people with flaws & ambitions, and will complain 'confidentially' when they would have no case in court - just for the 15-minutes of fame that everyone else gets = the Medical Board took me seriously 'syndrome' (so I must be ok). So we have a Board of complaints by Ohioans who don't get the attention in other ways - the 15-minutes of fame crowd.  A name on a complaint means some verifiability - some responsibility - some thought went into the complaint and tried to resolve the situation first in other ways.  No thought is involved in the State Medical Board system in Ohio - it's just totally corrupt.  The Board admittedly cheats on urine/drug tests, Rorschach tests, and makes up diagnoses that don't exist.  Do you teach your girls to cheat in school Governor Kasich?  Is it get ahead at all costs, like with the traffic tickets?  You certainly ALLOW the State Medical Board to cheat and they admit it = it's ok.  And you've been in office long enough to start to fix things if you wanted to.Meanwhile, the 'confidential' complaint law is broken every day for 'friends' of State Medical Board Members - certain 'right' physicians get their complaint so that they can answer the accusations and get on with their lives - the rest of us just pay lawyers until bankruptcy.  Dr. Nice took my complaint all over Hillcrest Hospital, the male locker room, the staff rooms, the bathrooms, etc.  Most told him to discuss with my father and I, as he had refused to do, and to settle things privately - that he was a 'jerk.'  No other state does this, and yet you won't check with other Governors and put the Ohio system on a par with other states where the licenses are 'reciprocal.'  You are a maverick, a rogue, who can't take one traffic ticket without an explosion, and you want physicians to deal with years of abuse for false complaints and disciplines.  You can't do what you ask others to accept graciously as the 'system.'  Pay your traffic tickets, the rest of us have to do so - we can't threaten the clerk of courts or the police force.  You've made me pay to fight a corrupt State Medical Board - thousands of dollars that could have paid for a wedding.        You have more physicians falsely disciplined that any other state, but no one can prove this because everything is 'confidential' and changed.  It's just a known fact.  And you are importing more physicians than most states to make up the deficit.  The State Medical Board of Ohio has no way to admit a mistake, and move on, except to kill the falsely accused physician with neglect, harassments, and heartbreak.  I have a endocrine metabolic bone condition left untreated - while I'm supposed to get continual psychiatric 'goes' to try to prove a case after 19 years.  If you haven't proved a case in 19 years, there is no case - move on.  Please 'man up' to your responsibilities.  It is not ok that Brad Reynolds try to do this - he does not have the power to even get Mr. Whitehouse on the phone to answer one question.  He wasn't elected and will not face the responsibility of your not getting re-elected; he will just kiss-ass to the next guy that will pay him a salary & benefits.  Physicians can't get on with their lives and careers unless the 'confidential' is opened, answered and fixed.  Either I have a psychiatric condition or I've been lied about - so that my physicians could get out of the statute of limitations for malpractice fracture care.  Mr. Whitehouse only talks in terms of 'statute of limitatations' being over - for the State administrative malpractice.  When people only talk about statutes of limitations - the case was false and they just don't want to have to pay up or resolve things.  I'm a physician without a license, without a career, without a choice, without a case, without a family, and with constant fractures from neglect of a serious bone condition.  You can't have 'confidential' in your job history or CV - because they think that you literally 'killed' someone - like Professor recently in the news who had tenure.  Cases have gone on for years, decades, at the State Medical Board of Ohio - wasting lives, careers, and taxpayer monies in 6-figures/case.  No state does 'confidential' complaints anymore, because of the admitted wrong reasons and motivations for those complaints - and that they can't be checked in any 'normal' legal way.Transparency is what is expected of every state in 2011.  Meanwhile the Ohio Medical Board holds kangaroo court 'Hearings,' where the women physicians have their dating histories aired for hours, that they didn't 'like' their male colleagues in ways that were inappropriate for any other job, that they didn't pay up with enough referrals to Dr. Nice.  If I had slept with Dr. Nice there would have been no case, but then I couldn't look myself in the mirror.  He was balding, fat, forty-ish, short, smelled of bad cologne, and a jerk.  His wife married him to be Mrs. Dr. - like most physician wives do.  The MD male personalites are 'pathologic' by the time they finish training.   Dr. Nice has been know for 20 years to 'get it on the side,' and his wife finally admitted it recently - but it wasn't the responsibility of his women colleagues to endure the attentions or the ire of his wife or to remind her of the obvious - that he married her for her money.  That's been known since he was at Cleveland Clinic - he 'married well.'  It was never said that he adored or loved his wife - he liked her money.  Mrs. Sara Nice thought that publishing false articles in The Sun Press was the way to keep her husband - and he wasn't a 'keeper.'  Further, it was her fault that he strayed - she supported it - paying for his polo team and African safaris.  He was on the dole, and made the most of it. Dr. Nice's crude office staff would tell physician colleagues, or maybe just the women, that his wife 'didn't understand him,' and that they should therefore 'understand' him.  Even The Good Wife isn't sticking around, and has moved her husband out to his own apartment.  No one asked for Dr. Nice to pay attention to them, he saw me out a window and started sending me patients - and he admitted that in testimony to the Ohio State Medical Board - that he started the obsession with me from seeing me out a window.  And I didn't know existing would lead to so much trouble - that he couldn't keep it in his pants. No physician wants to disagree and report another physician for care abuses.  But in Ohio there is no 'third pathway' to handle improving STANDARDS OF CARE.  Physicians can let fractures 'ripen' to 'excrescence,' and the Dr. Keiths can try 'experimental' casts - say anything and you are doomed.  And all that you Governor Kasich have done, is to make every decent orthopedic afraid of being labeled a 'pill mill' physician if they give a serious hip, or shoulder, fracture two weeks of some real pain meds.  This will be the status quo until your wife, or one of your daughters, fracture something - and then pain meds will be ok again.    Serious fractures are now being left untreated without pain meds in Ohio.  And you won't speak to any of the roomful of physicians that have serious concerns about the State Medical Board of Ohio being a corrupt farce - that would be a town hall meeting to attend.  Members regularly benefit from fixing, or expediting, cases - no one knows because it's all 'confidential.'  No other state can support this kind of graft and corruption.  And Speaker Boehner wants Washington DC to do things like you?  God help us.Ohio has a Stasi-type East German modeled system at the State Medical Board, a police state within a democratic state.  People are encouraged to complain without discussion, to file piles of misinformed lies that can't be checked or verified before a case is started - nothing better to do as there are no jobs.  And once a case is started, the Board has to WIN at all costs - because there are no mistake laws for the Medical Board in Ohio.  No way to end things with just paying for the re-education of the wronged physician - like in every other state.  And try dealing with years of lies - afterwards you need some serious counseling.  Lawyers are called and harassed daily to 'admit' the case that the Board wants - even if no facts are verifiable and the case is a total hoax.  All that is needed are stats.  Power is a terrible thing without a 'check,' and the Ohio State Medical Board system has no external review - the State Court of Appeals can't get the files.    There are no term limits of Members - ie Anita Steinbergh DO has been re-appointed for 20 years and she's literally 'senile.'  All she can talk about is her 'reading list' that women physicians are supposed to read, and that you should sign your life away with a pile of lies - which she isn't responsible for.  She's only responsible for her cell phone.  ICEBOUND is top of her list and that woman MD is dead prematurely of a difficult life - much of it spent in Ohio.  That woman was a lesson in what happens if you try to live in Ohio.  Dr. Talmadge doesn't believe in blood work for women, or ob-gyn care for women MDs - just 'goes.'    Other states have ways to correct a wrong at their State Medical Boards, but not so Ohio.  And you pretend to be a Resaissance man, a person who listens to the average Janes & Joes at Bob Evans - just false advertising.  About 45 other states have some form of 'medical' mistake laws, notso Ohio.  Ohio has a European Gestapo-prototype Medical Board - where they execute you first, and you aren't allowed the complaint - just take the cyanide pill like Rommel.  No physician can 'fight' a case where they don't know the case against them.  My case has gone on for 19 years without anyone knowing what it is REALLY about - it's 'confidential' and this is 2011.  Some of the signers hated my father - but I can't prove that without the document - the piece of paper.  Some of what happened to me is getting back at my father - that was the problem in Medical School, ie they would hear my name and my father had gotten an honor that they had aspired to ie Dr. Izant.  Dr. Izant heard my name and wanted me out of the room, and I had never met him before - it was all about that my father had one-upped him once.  Taking a medical license for 19 years is done in NO OTHER STATE - and for objecting to the wrong care?  Speaker Householder knew that opening the files at the State Medical Board of Ohio in 2003 would have paralyzed the Ohio Attorney General's Office with legitimate cases and serious $ liability for huge damages.  And everything is about MONEY at the STATE MEDICAL BOARD OF OHIO - the most money wins the case and Dr. Nice had the MONEY in 1990-2.  Mr. Dilling admitted to my lawyer in 1999, that there were a stack of 'probably' false physician disciplines, and my case was on the top of the list because there were no patient complaints and I got 'boys being boys' fracture care.  Didn't even get good medical care for an illness - no blood work, didn't finish physical therapy and my license was gone to protect the bad boys.  The Medical Board has admitted that the care that I complained about was BAD, but that I should have handled it better.  The care that I got was medieval, not Renaissance.  The behaviors would have made any elected offical resign in today's world - blaming me for impotence with one's wife?  How was that my fault?  How do you handle that BETTER or WELL?????  PLEASE EXPLAIN?????  In 1999, we 'took' the offer to 'open my case for reforms,' and the offer was immediately rescinded for the Board to try another 'go' - and that's administrative money down the drain - to keep the case going.  If I took the offer, what would have been the problem to end the case?  There's no sense, or dealing with the State Medical Board of fools - they can't see the obvious and are not about patient care.  Like Brad Reynolds, they just want their job and benefits - and will find a way to get hired by the next guy. Reforms have been acknowledged to be needed for over a decade at the State Medical Board of 'secrets.'  You are not an East German Communist regime - you are Governor Kasich in 2011.  Please can't you see that these types of systems DID NOT WORK historically, that they didn't work in ANY OTHER STATE - that they are not 'democratic' or legal?  Mistakes happen, learn to deal with them - I have had to learn this lesson over and over for 19 years.      No one thinks that they will ever collect one dime in legitimate damages, but every physician wants their file 'cleared' of the crap that is currently the status quo at the State Medical Stasi Board.  You are broke in Ohio with mismanagement - and much of it - millions of dollars of it - is from Medical Board mismanagement of physician discipline cases.  All of us falsely accused physicians in the pile want our licenses and privileges returned and TO LEAVE OHIO ASAP - before you finish as Governor.  Please let us go - there are other states that need American-trained physicians with good credentials and a willingness to do standard care - better Governors.  You can have the Dr. Nices and Dr. Keiths, and those that look the other way for their abuse of women patients.  The Mayo Clinic wanted me to see a counselor for the abuse after they took one look at my wrist fractures - they had never seen anything like it in 1991.

										Dr. Boris Abayev has the nasty habit of demanding that patients who have just been treated talk to those in the waiting room. He imposes himself on patients to sell his service to patients waiting in to be treated, particularly new patients who fear injections or have doubts.
Abayev wanted his son, or his wife to treat my son and me with massage therapy. To my knowledge I never saw their license to practice massage therapy which is an area that requires extensive study. Anyone can give love and massage family members at home, no matter how good you think you are unless you learn the basics and more advanced techniques you should keep your hands to yourself.
How much more so a doctor insisting you allow his wife, the administrative assistant or his son to massage patients! During a session of injections to my neck, he was screaming instructions to his wife with his head turned to the right towards the reception area. A real pro, in reality this shows a hubris and overconfidence that is bound to lose out over time, the law of averages. Someone will pay dearly for this Abayev's methodology.

										A friend of mine went to Dr. George Commons nearly a decade ago and is still reeling from the damage done to her by this absolute disgrace to medicine. Dr. Commons turned a routine procedure into an absolute nightmare. He operated on about 20 wrong areas of her body and cost her over $200,000 worth of corrective surgery and attorney fees due to the aftermath of his horrible surgical work. This Palo Alto plastic surgeon shouldn't be allowed to hurt any more people he pretends to want to help. I know my friend is not the only victim of this licensed butcher, but he has money to burn, so he throws enough of it at lawyers to cover up his worst mistakes. Any other doctor who had his record of ruining innocent lives with poor procedures would no longer be allowed to practice medicine anymore. My friend's endured dozens of corrective surgeries she's had to pay for out of pocket, and the doctors who are fixing his shoddy work are always amazed at how incompetent his work was. [continued below]....
									
										.....Judge Leslie C. Nichols fixed the trial for his friend George that would have and should have resulted in some relief for my friend. There is nothing more dangerous than a doctor who is above the law and immune to the civil channels of relief friends like mine rely on as victims. Medical malpractice trials are difficult to prosecute as it is without judicial corruption and doctors like Commons escaping culpability because of biased rulings. Commons operated on my friend's knees for no reason, without her consent. There was nothing wrong with her knees at all, and he did such incredible damage that she now experiences constant pain. Her suffering is brutal to witness, and because of this absolutely unfounded and unauthorized surgery her kneecaps frequently get dislocated. She also had large X marks carved into her hips. Other doctors have no clue why Dr. Commons or any other surgeon would engage in these procedures and do such severe harm. Commons essentially amputated part of her calves, and she has had to go to other countries to get artificial injectable implants to fill in the large concave areas.  Her calves were perfect and beautiful, and they should not have been touchedJudge Nichols made things much worse for my friend by turning a blind eye on the evidence presented in the case. This judge was obligated to consider all the records showing all the wrong operations done on my friend. He saw pictures of the awful injuries my friend sustained, injuries the opposing counsel never disputed by presenting any evidence of their own. Even the statement written for the court by Dr. Commons shouldn't have been enough to sway any judge to rule against my friend. ""I didn't think I did anything wrong,"" was all the doctor said to defend himself of the charges. Apparently the opinion of a friend means more to Judge Nichols than the pain and suffering of a victim. Judge Nichols treated my friend like she was the defendant in the case and forced her to pay all of his friend's legal fees. His corruption was unconscionable and left my friend victimized once more by the very justice system that was supposed to protect her. He even went as far as requiring my friend to remain quiet about her ordeal and prevented her from warning others about the worst Dr. Commons could do. More of his victims will suffer now even after trying to check out his background online like many potential patients do before surgery. The First Amendment simply doesn't exist in this judge's corrupt courtroom. He simply swept the whole problem under the rug to protect his pal and left my friend's life in shambles as a result, her constant suffering magnified by the fact that seeking justice proved so futile. Judge Nichols made sure to rig the entire trial, corrupting my own lawyers to work against me in the process. No witnesses were allowed to testify, no jury was allowed to hear the case, and my friend got no opportunity to have a fair hearing on her grievances. My friend's had to shed so many tears and endure so many days filled with tremendous pain shooting through her body because of this awful experience. The doctor's used his money and connections to erase the truth about what happened. He's made my friend's mental pain just as bad as the physical ailments she suffers because of his butchery. The fact that Dr. Nichols actually teaches future patients at Stanford only makes things worse. This is not an example any young surgeon should be following or looking up to. This man is absolute scum who should not be able to ruin any more lives like he was able to ruin my friend's life. I have known my friend nearly all her life. She was a strong, happy, and dedicated young lady before Dr. Commons came into her life. His crude cuts transformed her into a physical and emotional wreck. Her strength has been sapped by his relentless attempts to keep her quiet at any cost, and his actions to corrupt the judicial system victimize her more with each passing day. She must wake up every day to confront the fact that this man cannot be held responsible in a court of law for what he did to do so much injury to such an innocent person. Seeing what she goes through in being forced to endure this ordeal makes me convinced that the only way to bring this man to justice is to let him be tried in the court of public opinion. Please help spread the word about Dr. Commons and Judge Nichols and their egregious abuses. Please do not let what happened to my friend happen to any future victims who might be fooled by Dr. Commons' fabricated and whitewashed ""clean"" record as a surgeon and Judge Nichols' biased and corrupt judicial practices.  									",Doctors

										About 14 months ago I was diagnosed with Osteo Arthritis of the right hip joint with bone spurs and a cyst by an Orthopaedic Surgeon. I was too heavy and too young for the hip replacement surgery and the doctor told me I needed to see a pain management doctor to improve the quality of my life. At that time I made an appointment to see Dr. Weiwah (Rob) Kwok. Dr. Kwok immediately questioned my pain and the Orthopaedic Doctors diagnoses. He ordered the same MRI test again. He also ordered a MRI of the lower back.
Dr. Kwok insisted the pain was from my back and not my hip joint. He demanded I get a cortisone injection in my spine. I told him I know my body and the pain was in my hip but I will try his treatment. The shot helped my back feel better but my hip pain was still out of control. Dr. Kwok prescribed Norco, 2 tablets of 10/325, twice a day as needed. After the first month I told him that the medicine worked great but the duration was only 3 hours and I needed to take 2 tablets every 4 hours throughout the day in order to have enough relief to enjoy life again. [continued below]....
									
										.....
Dr. Kwok immediately said no that I could only take the 4 tablets a day. He then prescribed Fentanyl Duragesic Patches. The patches helped a little but I still found the best relief to be the Norco. Dr. Kwok would not listen to me. He is completely unapproachable. He then started in that if he prescribed more Norco he could get into trouble and that it wouldn't ""look"" good.
My wife came unglued when she heard this and went with me to the next appointment. Dr. Kwok suggested alternate medicine to me and I tried it only to feel completely listless and I could not function productively in any way. I asked if I could stay with the fentanyl patches and the Norco and increase the Norco by just TWO TABLETS. Dr. Kwok said no I could not increase the Norco at all. I should have walked out at that point but I was afraid it would be difficult to find another pain doctor as they are few and far between.
This same cycle went on for months and months. Dr. Kwok has never listened to my and what I feel might be a better course of treatment for MY body. I have NEVER abused the Norco although I have taken a few more than Dr. Kwok has prescribed because I WAS IN PAIN.  Dr. Kwoks bedside manner is non-existent. He truely only cares about his career and not his patients.
I finally confronted Dr. Kwok yesterday and I told him that I felt he was too cautious and that I needed the Norco and not the Fentanyl and I needed a dosage every 4 hours unless he could recommend something similiar to Norco that worked for a much longer period of time. Dr. Kwok said he was offended that I told him he was too cautious and he said he would no longer treat me. Now I am left without pain medication, and I am in severe pain and suffering.  I explained that my goal was not to offend him but to try and have an adult discussion as to what might work better for ME. He then hung up on me and left me high and dry.
I have never been rude or abrupt with Dr. Kwok even though I thought he was not in my corner and that he was too concerned with HIS career and his butt. What about the patient? Isn't that thie hypocratic oath?? Apparently Dr. Kwok missed that day of medical school. I believe it is unethical the way Dr. Kwok has treated me and I hope he never has the opportunity to treat a patient that way again. I am sure he treats his existing patients that way but hopefully someone will read this and NOT consider using Dr. Kwok for their pain management.
I would love for Dr. Kwock to mature and realize that patients know their own bodies and that not everyone abuses medications. Some of us take it for medicinal purposes and to feel vaguely normal. All I ever asked of Dr. Kwok was his help in feeling like a productive human again. I never abused drugs, I never mistreated him as a doctor, I never abused is staff whom I adore, especially Merna.
I would consider using Dr. Kwock again one day if he can learn to treat his patients with dignity and to listen to their concerns and their needs. He is not God and does not know everything. Dr. Kwok has the potential to be a very good doctor. Even a great doctor. If he continues the way his is, he will never be a good doctor at all and will reap what he sows.

The patient is welcome to come back to meet with the doctor during my office hours if they still may have questions that are unanswered or any other concerns.The treatment plan is advised at the time of the first consultation. If a treatment plan is not made at the first visit because of need for further information then the patient is asked to come back for a second consultation once all information has been obtained or the patient is referred out to another surgeon. Each patient is assessed and consulted prior to obtaining any treatments or services to ensure they are fully aware of their course of treatment. At the time prior to the procedure (usually the pre-op appointment), the patient will fill out informed consents and is advised to ask any questions that they may have regarding the procedure. All risks and complications are discussed with the patient at this visit as well.In a scenario that the doctor would not advise a procedure be done on a patient, Dr. Calvert stats that he would discuss with them their goals for the procedures, look at alternatives, and try to help direct them to either a better solution for their concerns. If they are still unable to come to a resolution, the doctor would refer them to someone for more information if he did not feel comfortable doing it for them. Dr. Calvert would communicate that in his hands that it probably wont give them what they want and he would refer them to someone for another opinion who may be able to address their concerns.After treatment, the office makes sure to place frequent follow up calls (video calls if the patient is from out of town), frequent postop visits to the office, and having competent staff that can handle any issues that may arise with patients.  They also send each patient a post-operative questionnaire that specifically addresses their care and service. The patient has multiple opportunities to voice concerns as the office is heavily staffed with nurses and/or PAs. It is not uncommon for patients to feel more comfortable addressing their concerns with the PA or nurse and therefore it is their goal to make sure that the patients concerns are addressed and proper action is taken.Since the office has been a part of Ripoff Report, they make sure all patients are well informed and educated which begins at the very first phone call or email that they may receive from a potential new patient. They also have clarified our consent forms and policy and procedure materials that are given to every patient. Patient complaints are taken very seriously and are dealt with immediately. No matter what the complaint may be the office will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible or come up with a solution that is agreeable between all parties.Furthermore, the office has discovered that better patient selection is key in prevention of complaints. There are many patients that have had multiple procedures from other surgeons, that makes Dr. Calvert am very careful to assess whether or not further surgery is advisable for that patient. They also have heavier screening for body dysmorphic disorder and major depression that has allowed them to save patients the frustration of having further surgery and not being satisfied with the results.As stated above  something that needs to be repeated to those seeking any kind of plastic Surgery .. The company states that they are committed to doing whatever it takes to make the patient happy because they have always worked tirelessly to revise surgery when necessary. In knowing that plastic surgery is not perfect, they always let patients know that there is a 10% chance of revision rate on any plastic surgery procedure. They do not charge for the revision operation, but the patient does pay anesthesia fees. This is standard practice in plastic surgery industry. Dr. Calvert feels the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program is an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to customer service and he is glad that there is a program that can address these concerns that have been voiced on the Internet.Dr. Calvert, recognizes that complaints posted on Ripoff Report (whether true or not) are issues that need to be addressed, not ignored.  If handled correctly, complaints can be valuable learning opportunities. With the feedback generated by Ripoff Reports on-site review of Roxbury Clinic & Surgery Center, Dr. Jay Calvert, has made organizational changes allowing its clients and employees a more streamlined approach to problem resolution and a commitment to a great patient satisfaction.In summary, after our on-site review, which included discussions with Dr. Calvert, Ripoff Report is convinced that Dr. Jay Calvert, is committed to total patient satisfaction.Read more about why consumers should feel confident when doing business with a member of Rip-off Report's Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.

I called the office immediately upon finding out.     On May 14, 2009, an assistant told my mother that she would talk to Dr. Giese about refunding  my prepaid fees. The assistant called me back and told me that Dr. Giese  refused to refund the money. She said that Dr. Giese would only refund me $2,000.00 of the $11,900.00 paid to her.     I sent Dr. Giese a letter USPS first class mail.  I asked her to refund the fees.  I told her that I was in great need of the money back because I was pregnant.   She never answered me.     I 
asked an assistant to have Dr. Giese call me back shortly before Labor Day and I was told she was on vacation for a month.  I've asked to speak to her several times over the past two years but she's never called me back.  I have spoken to one of her assistants who told me that she refused to speak to me.     I have requested my medical file numerous 
times (via phone, fax, and USPS certified mail with return receipt). I sent her a HIPPA consent form in August 2009 and I didn't get a response.

Josef Mengele did some of the original experiments on withholding pain medications.  Governor Kasich tells his staff that he knows all about Ohio government - medicine & business - it came with the vote, not any graduate education.  Governor Kasich doesn't have graduate learning or degrees, nor respect it in others.  Just call his secretary at (614) 466-3555; Governor Kasich knows what is going on, only he doesn't.  Governor Kasich has the infallibility of having been elected to Ohio government in an election where he was just the lesser of two evils - certainly not the best that Ohio can put forth.  There's not an ounce of humility or compassion in the guy so far - even as regards traffic tickets they are just for everyone else - not him. Ohio is the only state with a 'confidential' physician/medical practitioner complaint system at their Medical Board = courtesy of Mr. Richard Whitehouse = a MONSTER of a man out only for statistics and himself.  Whitehouse = a man that Governor Kasich has not replaced, or considered replacing, for some reason = the true prototype of a Kasich-appointee maybe?  Rick Whitehouse = someone with the conscience of a Hitler, and the clandestine organizational skills of OBL = you can't get him on the phone.  Hitler got into power fabricating false cases against his more ethical advisors = ditto Ohio and Governor Kasich apparently at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Qualifications are not the issue in Ohio, discussion is not allowed, and medical mistake laws are not allowed.  It is estimated, as of 2003, that there are so many false physician 'cases' (disciplines, suspensions) at the State Medical Board of Ohio in the last two decades, that opening up the 'confidential' files would paralyze Columbus for years with valid liability for damages legal cases - physician's lives wasted and careers destroyed - on purpose.  [Source: former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder's Office ~June, 2003.]  Some of these false cases aren't even about the physician's patient care, just that the physician didn't go along with the boys, didn't handle a bad practice situation with delicacy = boys-being-boys care is the rule in Ohio and you have to cover.  In one case, the physician's sex/dating/personal life has been examined in no less that 5 evaluations - the litany of who she dated when was of interest to Ohio public records - five times.  These evaluations are bankrupting Ohio, if not the record-keeping and storage of this rot.  There was nothing wrong with this US-trained physician's patient care to discuss, her crime: she practiced ABOVE AVERAGE medical care for Ohio.  The patient care of physicians on the State Medical Board is ranked mostly AVERAGE on their Internet rankings, or BELOW.  Governor Kasich could pick, appoint, physicians with above-average rankings, but so far hasn't.  One bad Medical Board mistake case, and an admitted stack of them exist, would allow him to re-structure, ie reform, the whole Medical Board system in Ohio.  Yet Governor Kasich can't pick one case out of the stack that Mr. Tom Dilling admits has existed since 1999 - the stack of probably false physician disciplines that has needed to be opened for reforms for over a decade = the FALSE PHYSICIAN DISCIPLINE STASH.  Kasich instead goes after patients who need pain medications - mostly for serious aboveboard indications - it's an EMERGENCY???  Hasn't he got something better to do???  What happens when his wife, or girls, have a tooth pulled or fracture something?  Girls be warned, your dad will leave your friend's & neighbor's fractures without pain meds - it won't get you friends.  The Ohio Medical Board Members profit in hospital contracts, and appointments, coinage hard to trace with everything being 'confidential.'  Transparency isn't a word in Governor Kasich's vocabulary = he can't spell it for some reason.  Many of these physician discipline cases are not for anything in, or under, Ohio law - the physician just didn't 'play the game,' or objected to the wrong care being done to themselves, and now pain meds are added to the list of offenses.  Physicians don't have autonomy about their own medical care in Ohio - the Medical Board determines what you have and get care for - without the criteria or blood work.  The Medical Board of Ohio can 'smell' personality disorders, divine bipolar, and legalize Tylenol for hip fractures.That's what is bankrupting Ohio = Medical Board abuses = as these false physicians can't work, don't pay taxes, and are a loss to their communities - no chance of Kasich reviewing that mess - he can't wrap his limited IQ around it.  The wronged physicians have the MENSA IQs, not Governor Kasich or his overpaid, overpromoted-for-the-economic crisis staff.  His Chief of Staff Beth gets pay raises, the rest of us are living on savings? or selling off of ebay.  Meanwhile, cases go on for decades at the Ohio State Medical Board; if one case doesn't fly, the 'confidential' is just changed; it's a WALKABOUT that Beth won't touch.      Thus, the Cleveland Clinic has apparently told their physicians (JUNE 2011) not to prescribe needed pain medications - so don't go there - you will be prescribed a pain consult for an ACUTE FRACTURE - even if you only used codeine-type meds once before in your life for another fracture - twenty years ago.  It's the physician treating his/her career. The  Orthopedic surgeons will want to have you use Tylenol, NSAIDs, or just suffer - even if your liver & kidneys won't take those meds, ie if you have a family problem with Tylenol-hepatitis that's too difficult for a Cleveland Clinic orthopedic to wrap his head around, or have maxed out your ability to take NSAIDS like Motrin and Aleve long ago (kidney damage).  You can't fight 'confidential' at the State Medical Board of Ohio - and the State Representatives freely admit that the 'confidential' at the State Medical Board of Ohio is constantly changed in Ohio.  No ethics, no tactic unapproved, no threat withheld, no rule of proceedings not changeable per State Senator Tim Grendell - it's all one of his macabre cocktail jokes - upright humanitarian that he is. Threats are commonplace at the State Medical Board - where physicians are told to admit the Ohio Board's allegations or have their lives destroyed and their medical care withheld - that includes routine ob-gyn care, pregnancy care, fracture care, and the care of dependents - which you have to get out-of-state or not at all.  You will die of neglect courtesy of the OSMB, so you can't blame physicians for opting out of writing for pain meds.  You won't be able to get blood work even before your medical license is suspended in Ohio - your bone pain has to be 'psychiatric' and 'making too much.'  Only after 4 evaluations might someone think of ordering a blood screen to find the cause of your bone pain or tiredness.  Physicians are the worst treated patients in Ohio.    There's no diagnosis of anything in Ohio medicine - you just need a new right Ohio psychiatrist - and this starts at the State Medical Board and is approved by the Ohio legislature.  State Senator Grendell thinks everything needs a new right Ohio psychiatrist - whatever he's on - except that it doesn't apply to him for some reason?  You can't have a child, or a family, if the Ohio Medical Board goes at you, Senator Grendell will send state troopers to your house, or your parent's house, until you cave = Grendellgate misuse of Ohio State troopers.  Every other state has to allow medical care-to-function before saying that a physician is impaired with bone pains, not so Ohio - they just don't allow the fracture to be casted until it 'ripens' to 'excresence.'  Anita Steinbergh DO loves to do this to other women - then she tells them to read ICEBOUND - to see how another woman Ohio MD took the abuse.  PROBLEM IS: IceBound author Dr. Jerri Nielsen is now however dead (2009), as the State Medical Board of Ohio wants any woman MD who disagrees with a male MD to be = DEAD.  No threat is too cruel for Governor Kasich and the boys.  But withholding fracture pain medications, hip fractures made to take Tylenol?  Mengele would be pround.    In Ohio the State Medical Board can go after a physician with 'confidential' - and then a physician's whole live is a mess - the license is never returned.  They do this to women especially - for not handling the 'boys being boys.'  In one physician case, after 19 years, the 'confidential' complaint is still 'confidential.'  The Medical Board has gone after her life with 5 evaluations that have nothing to do with her patient care - just her sex life, why she didn't like her Ohio orthopedics.  Ohio wants women flat on their back or fractured - courtesy of Governor Kasich not Representative Weiner.     It's worse than Representative Weiner, as the Ohio State Medical Board then decides who will sextext her, or who she will have to work as a condition of re-licensure, and make her 'like' it or else.  This physician has had as a condition of licensure that she refer to certain 'right' physicians, or no medical license - since 1996.  The 'right' physicians are people that no out-of-state psychiatrist would approve of her going near; forced sextexting between nonconsenting adults - or one adult & one boy.The unending evaluations of women MDs who don't 'go along,' are done by pre-approved new 'right' Ohio psychiatrists - the Dr. Resnick forensic types who wouldn't know 'normal.'  The taxpayers pays for this, and Senator Grendell has standing jokes about it - the cheating on Rorschach testing, the making up of diagnoses that don't exist (diagnoses that exist ONLY in Ohio).  Grendell went to law school with Dr. Resnick and promotes his business - doesn't anyone see this conflict of interest?  Governor Kasich is NOW presiding over the worst Medical Board in the history of the US - and every other Governor knows this but he doesn't GET IT - where cases go on for decades looking for a case - because everything is 'confidential' and there are no EXTERNAL reviews of Medical Board decisions.  Governor Kasich's secretary @ (614) 466-3555 will tell you that Governor Kasich is an expert on the State Medical Board because he got elected.  Like the Catholic Church, apparently God-infused knowledge, because of his election, & judgemental infallibility are presumed part of the office chair/furniture at 77 South High.  Yet Governor Kasich has no graduate or professional degrees to certify his knowledge, and Brad Reynolds hardly knows anything about women, or men's, medical care - he's not an MD or Public Health graduate.Meanwhile the Ohio Medical Board is a clearinghouse way to arrange for certain women physicians to have to work with certain male physicians as a condition of licensure; better than e-Harmony and free to 'friends' of Medical Board Members.  The male clients see you out the window and put in a 'confidential' bid to the OSMB.  These are the 'right' physicians; visual sexting made real.   Ohio is the only state with this type of fraud at the State Medical Board level.  But the withholding of needed pain medication to fracture patients is criminal, inhumane, and will cost Governor Kasich re-election.  No one wants a Governor practicing medicine without a degree, as in Ohio.  When the State Medical Board of Ohio goes after a physician, needed medical care for that physician is refused, or only done partially - so that the physician will admit the case even if false.  Ob-gyn care is refused women physicians in Ohio, medical care is refused, preventative care is refused - so that the physician will die a slow painful death while being harassed with 'confidential' complaints.  It's a death sentence in Ohio.Physicians have to be able to prescribe needed pain medications for acute illnesses without fear of any 'confidential' actions, or reprisals, by the State Medical Board of Ohio.The fall-out is now, as of June 2011, affecting all patient acute fractures, post-op care, and patients with painful medical illness (e.g rheumatoid, cancer).  For ACUTE PATIENTS WHO HAVE NEVER TAKEN PAIN MEDICINE BEFORE OR ONCE/TWICE BEFORE IN THEIR LIVES - medium potency pain medications are being refused.  NSAIDs can cause kidney damage, Tylenol can cause liver damage, etc, but these choices are being proferred to hip fractures, shoulder fractures, joint replacement patients, and cancer patients.  Like St. Therese, you have to die without the pain medications because of Mother Superior Kasich.  But she was a saint, and most of us are not.  Patients who have a painful condition that might get worse are advised not to undergo surgery at this time.  There's no precedent for this, but it's the overkill of the Kasich administration.  Governor Kasich needs to have  fracture and be refused pain medication, or told that he needs a pain consult, maybe he shouldn't get any blood work either.  In 2005, Executive Director of the State Medical Board Tom Dilling told one woman MD that all the blood work she ever needed was done in 1991 at the Mayo Clinic - just a paragraph handful of tests.  He was then the Executive Director of the State Medical Board in Ohio and threatened this woman MD to do whatever it took to make her family pay for another 6th psychiatric evaluation - because she disagreed with him.  That's the Ohio medicine that Governor Kasich wants to SELL; Dillingate or Whitehousegate.   									",Doctors

										My parents have been patients with Dr. Stephen Aslami for more than 10 years. Over those years they have been very good customers and have received treatment from this doctor. My parents have insurance and over those 10 years that doctor has received at a minimum $100,000.00 in insurance payments.
Whatever has been left owing by the insurance has been paid by my parents, until recently. My father is 76 and my mother 71. Both live solely on social security benefits.  They have a very high monthly cost in medications, making it tough to pay the doctor or pay for food. Thank god for the church that help them with food.
Over the last year they have been unable to pay a total of $150.00 that the insurance did not cover. They are unable to pay this amount, let all the rising costs we are all faced with. So, if you do the math my parents have been patients for more than 10 years and only owe $150.00, so basically the doctor wants to be paid his $15.00 per year that they owe. Never mind the huge insurance payments that have contributed to his wealth.
Recently the doctor has  given the law firm Olsen Shaner permission to take legal action. The bill is now over $400.00. Olsen Shaner is famous for strong arm tactics, they have been known to sell your personal non-exempt items to try to pay the debt in full. Accruing even more costs. 
Knowing my parents delicate state of health the Doctor has signed off on the debt for hard core collection efforts.  He believes it is worth collecting every last penny his former patients has, even if it means coming into ones house and taking personal items to satisfy a debt and risking the stress that it will cause his for patients. That is if the non-exempt property is worth it. 
All for $150.00 over a 10year period, basically!!! You may argue that he may have more patients that owe him money as well. That may be true, but when an account is turned to collections that debt is written off as a loss. If money is collected he can claim it as income. It's a win-win for him and a horrible loss for senior citizen patients that have been stripped of their dignity.",Doctors

										I encourage any prospective patients to stay far away from Marcene Kreifels MD and her Family Medical Center in Crestview FL. I wish I read online reviews before booking a visit. Unfortunately, all I looked for was a local doctor open on Saturdays. Shame on Me! Here is a listing of my problems:
1) My appointment was booked at 8:00am. I waited until about 11:30am before being seen by Dr. Kreifels.
2) Even though Dr. Kreifels knew I was covered by medical insurance that listed her as a network/preferred provider, she charged my credit card when I arrived. She promised to refund my payment the day after the insurance paid her. Well, two phone calls and almost 2 weeks later, no response or refund as promised.
3) Although Dr. Kreifels prescribed a medication and claimed she would call it in to my local pharmacy, she did not. I had to pick up a trial bottle from her office instead. The prescription was later called in.
4) Dr. Kreifels has failed to return a pre-authorization checklist to my prescription coverage provider so the insurer has not approved the claim. Since I choose not to pay over 4x the approved cost for the medicine, I have not had my medication in over 3 weeks. The insurance company faxed the pre-authorization checklist a second time...still no response from Dr. Kreifels. After I checked on the situation twice, I have not received a call back either.
5) On the day of my visit, Dr. Kreifels was the only employee in the office. She acted as the recptionist, check-in clerk, doctor, lab tech, etc. Instead of being professionally dressed, she had on a white Under Armour shirt. I was surprised when I learned she was the doctor.
6) Dr. Kreifels is very rude with patients. I witnessed her yelling at an elderly female patient to get back to her waiting area when she strayed away to try to find a tissue.
7) I was not given an itemized receipt for my visit listing what exactly I was charged for. I was not even given or asked to sign a credit card receipt. 
8) The only thing that worked out in my favor is that she gave me a copy of my lab results to take with me. It seems that many other patients report that Dr. Kreifels is not one to forward medical records to new doctors. At least I'll have them when I find a real doctor!",Doctors

										First i contacted Dr.Reed via e-mail to represent to him my case and to ask if he will be able to help. He is pretending to be a genital surgeon and since i have a little piece of scar tissue on my penile skin that i wanted to be removed i decided to contact him for help.He answered my e-mail almost immediately and me and my wife were so impressed because usually the doctors are busy people and we tought it will take a number of days untill he answer.In his e-mail he said he can help but for more information i have to sent him 200 dollars for phone consultation.My first bad impression was  when i asked his secretary can i send a personal check she said is much better to be a money order.So i send money order and the doctor called me.The consultation lasted no more than 3 minutes,and doctor was very polite and nice on the phone.He said my surgery is not a big deal and advised me to call Ann -his secretary to schedulle the surgery.Next day i called her and she schedulled me immediatelly no matter the fact that they pretend to be very busy and there is no openings avaliable.In order to keep the date for the surgery however she said i have to hurry with sending the deposit wich is 50 % of the price he give  you on the phone without even see you.In my case the deposit i sent is 1750.00usd.Again no personal checks(because they are easy traceble) but money orders.I didnt feel very comfortable someone to rush me like that but because this scar is very painfull i just sent the deposit to book the date.Mistake!In couple of days his secretary -Ann contacted me to let me know they got the money and she told me to expect some papers on the mail that i have to sign and send back to them.The letter they sent me was actually the so called""Arbitration Agreement""that simply ask the patient to give up his/her rights to keep the doctor responsible or to sue him in case he injure the patient.I was keep reading and i couldnt beleive my eyes what this doctor asking the patients to do!!!This is absurd.Then i relalize that probably there is so many injured patients out there who want to sue him and i started browsing the web .Believe me people i found a horror stories about this doctor.He injured so many people permanently , he ruined so many lives he damaged so many bodies.And all these people were rushed and forced to sign this agreement that taking away their rights to sue him and to keep him responsible for his malpractice.The patients even can not take a copy of their files without paying additional fee.One of these cases actually i found in ripoffreports.com.I was keep browsing the net and keep finding terrible stories about injured people, so i decided to give up the surgery.I didnt feel comfortable to go to this individual who is pretending to be a genital surgeon.I sent him e-mail to ask my money back but  he didnt answer.In his website he said the deposit is nonrefundable,but he dont have any link to this arbitration agreement so the patients are not clear what kind of documents this doctor is going to ask them to sign.Even more i didnt sign any financial agreement with him.Just because he posted in his website the deposit is not refundable it doesnt mean he can freely steal money.Everybody said that he/she was rushed to sign the papers just before the surgery without giving the patients enough time to read them.I heard about a lot of people who wanted to give up after seeing the arbitration agreement but they have already pay so much money so they were traped-nobody wants to lose money.And then the door to the hell get opened.Go ahead and read the other story posted in this site and you will understand what i am taliking about. This doctor is a simply criminal.He is injuring people because he is probably not able to do the job.And he is stealing large ammount of money from the people who paid the deposit but then give-up the surgery, pretending the deposit is not refundable.But before say the deposit is not refundable why he doesnt show in advance this arbitration agreement -because no one is going to go for any service there.He asking the patient to sign it and then  making lab rats out of them.This is so disgusting!!!If there is any lawyer or injured patient who wants to see the agreement i will gladly provide a copy.I contacted him a couple of times to request my deposit back but he is not answering anymore.I will go ahead however and will fill a smal claim court  and will sue him and i really hope that the justice will win.I have been to so many hospitals and i never have seen such an absurd document.Everybody shoud be responsible for what he/she is doing ,especially doctors.Primum non nocere(lat)-First do not damage-this is how the Hypocrattus oath states, but obviosuly so called DR.Redd forgot it long time ago.",Doctors

										In Feb 2004 I made an appt with Dr. Likeover, he was personally referred. I had one office visit with him prior to surgury. He explained he would be doing a laminectomy at l4/l5 for a 15 year old herniated disk. I never saw him again until my unscheduled follow up appointment. When i was in post op i felt a snap inside my spine at the surgery site. I reported this and was told without examination that i was fine it was the anethesia. I was sent home with no antibiotics or pain meds. I have not been on pain meds prior to this surgery, doing therapy and injections. Within 24 hours i was in such excruiating pain we called his office. They refused to see me prior to my scheduled appointment. My husband took me to their office the next business morning anyway. I was a mess in pj's and was treated as such when i was taken to a closet to be insulted by Likeover and called a druggie and was told i would not receive any more pain meds and that i was acting like an addict. I dont even drink alcohol. I went to the ER. I was immediately taken to a bed in a hallway as they had no available rooms. The packing was taken off my surgery site by a ER physician to reveal an egg size opening with infection oozing out. The doctors apologized for likeover. Treatment began right away with antibiotics, iodine packing and daily follow ups for the next 8 weeks to have packing pulled out of the wound and new packing put in with a cocktail of antibiotics. At week 5 surgical sutures (blue) came out of the wound in my spine. I have had steriod injections. Rounds of physical therapy. I have had several epidural nerve blocks. I use a tens unit. Since the recovery i have been diagnosed with Herniated Disk, Degenerative Disk Disease, Spinal Stenosis, Arachnoiditis, Fibromyalgia, Restless leg syndrome, Muscle spasms, burning in my back, shooting pains in my legs, arthritus and many sleepless nites. I have endured financial difficulty, had to live with two different family members, moved several times only to end in divorce. This man literally ruined my life.

Provo, Utah United States of America ",,(801) 357-1200,"Brent Rich Utah Valley Orthopedics bills $389 for surgery for wrapping compression bandage around arm Provo, Utah","
										On January 24th, 2011 I endoed my bike in a snowbank, broke my collar bone, finished riding my bike to the bus stop (the bus waits for no-one, whether you be animal, mineral, or vegetable), and rode the bus to Provo, Utah, where there was an Instacare I knew I could use with my plan.
When you break a collar bone pretty much all they can do is strap you into a figure eight, put your arm into a sling, and let you go.  So that is what the Instacare did.  They also urged me by way of a flier with some office details on it to set up an appointment with Dr. Brent Rich in about two weeks, so he could help me rehabilitate the shoulder joint.  
I duly made the appointment, and showed up for the first time in his office on February 2, 2011.  I waited a reasonable amount of time in the lobby (maybe 10 minutes), and then was taken back into the office.  The X-ray tech took me to the x-ray machine, and took 2 or 3 X-rays.  This took about 5 minutes.  Then I was walked back to my little room where I waited for the doctor for about 10 more minutes.  Dr. Rich came in--a very friendly, competent fellow.  He looked at the X-rays with me, noted the break on the bone (it was not hard to see), and showed me two exercises I could start doing--walking my hand up the wall, and dangling my arm down and rotating it in little circles.  I showed him that I had some swelling in my arm, and he  wrapped a compressible bandage around it.    He then told me to come back in two weeks, and left.  Total time spent with the Doctor: 10 minutes maximum.  Closer to 5-7, really.  I did not so much as take my shirt off.
You can imagine my surprise a month later when I received a statement totaling services in the amount of $655.00 for the visit.  Here is the breakdown:
02/02/2011     SURGERY        $389.00
02/02/2011     OFFICE VISIT  $209.00
02/02/2011     RADIOLOGYDIAGNOSTIC  $50.00
02/02/2011     MEDICAL SUPPLIES   $7.00
I wish I could bill $655.00 for maybe 10 minutes of work (or 15 minutes if you throw in the radiology tech's time too. However, judging from the tech's general surliness, I doubt he gets a very large portion of the kitty!)!
Now, to be completely honest, due to a contract with the insurance company, Dr. Rich did not get the full $389 for the spurious ""surgery.""  He only got $289.23.  However, the question remains: what in the above description could possibly qualify as more than just a general office visit? What action did he perform that could be called ""surgery""?
With the help of the insurance company, I challenged this charge.
The challenge was quickly responded to by the good doctor: apparently the ""surgery"" consisted of his wrapping my swollen arm with a compression bandage.  This single act constituted ""reducing"" my broken bone, and so the charge was legitimate.  
I'm glad that my wife did not charge me $389 every time she had to re-wrap this bandage during the following week!
So what are we paying for when we pay for a normal office visit?  Should this fee be considered only something that reserves a chair for us in a doctor's office for a short amount of time (about 25 minutes) without any services at all?  If I go to a hotel, $209 will pay for two nights in a fairly nice establishment, complete with swimming pools, workout rooms, and a spa.  Given this, $209 to just sit in a small, cheaply furnished room with a utilitarian sink in it for less than a half-hour seems fairly steep.  So, according to my way of thinking,  the basic office charge includes actual attention--skilled attention--from the doctor and his staff for at least a half hour  
I do not mind paying for surgery when I have received it.  If Dr. Rich had put a cast on me, or fitted me with a more comfortable circle eight (which, no doubt, would have meant an additional MEDICAL SUPPLIES charge), somehow straightened the clavicle, or put something back into a socket where it properly belonged I would not protest in the least.  
The bottom line, however, is that none of the above took place.  Absolutely no surgery was performed.  Even worse, when challenged, the doctor defended this spurious charge.  That is why I will not return to this medical practice again.",Doctors

										Dr. Maureen Perry is presently involved with a nasty, despicable child custody and visitation battle with her ex, father to her children.   She has, as custodial parent, done everything in her power to deny father, and fathers mother from visiting, communicating, prevented any communication, except in the form of a written letters, even though children were 4 and 6 years of age, which, equivically is useless for thier inability to be able to read.   In order to win tempory custody, she accused father of death threats, brought her children to a therapist, who then accused the father of ""possible child abuse"" as a mandated reporter, even though an injury to one of the children was clearly a ""small"" burn from a pan while cooking on a vacation,..  None the less she reported it as possible child abuse, which started a 19 month Child protective service investigation, and used against the father continously, and at every court date as a ""indicated"" case of child abuse under investigation. [continued below]....
									
										.......  Furthermore, Dr. Maureen Perry has indicated to the court, contrary to mental health and well being of psychological profession that it is truly in the best interest of children to have a healthy relationship with both parents..   Even though almost everyone in the educated world knows this...   She has persistently, for the past couple years spent thousands and thousands of dollars, and continuously expressed to the courts that she ""fears for her life"" to prevent father from seeing thier children.     She has also filed bogus charges in Webster, NY town court in the waning months of a restraining order she asked the court to put into effect in a further attempt to parentally alienate father from seeing their children falsely accussing father of contempt of a restraining order through 3rd party contact and stalking in the fourth degree, which father was later proved innocent of only at great financial cost of restraing legal help to defend himself.I would think carefully before using her as a personal physician knowing that she has been parentally alienating her ex and his mother from seeing thier children when it certainly is not healthy for her own children with the atrocious actions, which most people would consider ""child abuse"" in its own rights.   As of April 2011, father has not seen his children since Christmas Eve, 2008.   AS of March , 2011 court date with Dr. Maureen Perry it was her position that father should not see or communicate in person.  Only after vigorous court argumentative action by Bob O'Connell, being supported by James Walsh, childrens law advocate did Referree Thomas Polito courageously order telephonic skype communication to begin the following Sunday before Easter Break...   And once again, mother aborted telephonic communication leaving father and children with no possible contact.   Next court date is April 26th, 2011 where mothers actions shall be reported to the court.  Dr. Maureen Perry is clearly guilty of Parental Alienation, and father is pursuejng  all legal actions against her.  									",Doctors

										Skin and Beauty Center buys dead doctor's old medical practices and digs into their old files (4-8 yrs old in my case) to randomly send threatening bills and make threatening phone calls to dead doctor's former patients in attempts to collect any money they can for services performed by doctors other than them. 
This was the case with me. They claimed I owed $124 on services performed by Dr. Joel Schwartz of Burbank, who died in 2010. I was a one time patient of his, but at no time during the last few years when I was a patient or when he was still alive had his office or staff ever notified me there was an outstanding debt to be paid. My insurance company, furthermore, never informed me they didn't pay a claim and that I owed Schwartz a balance. 
More than 4 years later, out of the blue, a woman named Dora called me at work and demanded I pay up or face collections! She wouldn't even name herself so I hung up with her and later, my family members called back that day using the number that appeared on caller ID to get her name. She claimed I owed money for services performed by Dr. Schwartz that I never paid. But, she couldn't name or produce any original bills or debt record in writing to prove to me that I owed it. She said, ""we were looking at some old bills of Dr. Schwartz and you owe us money.""
I racked my brain wondering why this woman out of the blue was calling to tell me I owed money to a doctor who died last year but whom I hadn't seen in over 4 years and who never himself informed me of a debt he believed I owed him. And moreover, what was her relationship to him??!! I asked her to state the nature of her relationship to Schwartz and she refused to disclose it. I also asked her to send me the written proof, ie original bills, patient record of my alleged visit(s), any notes that could substantiate the debt and instead they just dummied up a brand new bill with misspelled procedures and faxed it to me. 
I also asked for anything from the insurance company showing that they refused to pay that claim(s) which resulted in the so-called outstanding balance due. Nothing. So I reported these doctors to the Dept of Justice Attorney General's office in California and the Federal Trade Commission, which is what the Credit Bureaus suggest you do, so that the authorities can be informed of consumer concerns such as these. 
Apparently, the DOJ Atty Gen's office sent the complaint to Skin and Beauty Center and in response I received their CCed reply, which fully skirted every Civil Code of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act violations they committed, including: expired CA statute of limitations of 4 years; failure to notify me legally of their intent and identity to collect debt; the harassment provision, which states they can't threaten to turn me to collection unless they plan to do it; the privacy provision which states they have to send me correspondence marked ""Confidential"" and they shared my patient information with my family members freely when asked, which is a violation of my HIPAA privacy rights. 
Their futile attempt to address the precise civil codes I cited amounted to nothing more than half baked excuses that deny they did what they clearly did. For example, in my State complaint, I said, they were beyond the statute of limitations to collect debt, which in CA is 4 yrs. Their response to this item was to state the date of the debt - which was within that expiry date! Also, if they claim I owe them, they must produce records to prove I owe them, with applicable dates, unpaid bills, original bookkeeping and billing documents and instead they said, they don't keep originals. So, how on earth can they claim I owe anything if they can't even show me where they got this information?! I didn't realize that ""...Cuz I Said So"" was a legal basis to a claim of debt! 
Bottom line is this is what is known as ""Scavenger Debt Collection,"" whereby a company claims you owe old debt but rarely if ever produces substantiating evidence as proof. Fight it all the way if this happens to you. And people, beware of Skin and Beauty Center - because someone named Dora or Paul may call you out of the blue and claim you owe money to them, and then they might just draw up a fake bill and try to scam you out of your hard earned money! Don't pay. If they send you to collections, file a dispute with the Credit Bureaus and force them to prove it with evidence! File a claim in your state and with the Federal Trade Commission. ",Doctors

But the frat boys in Constituent Affairs aren't going to schedule any women meeting with Governor Kasich about serious anything.  And Beth Hansen needs to listen too - but she can't find the time - too busy spending her upgraded salary?  You could hire a falsely accused MD to work for you for less Governor Kasich.  
The suspensions & disciplines at the State Medical Board of Ohio have nothing to do with Ohio law or patient care - it's just politics = money.  Will it take Mrs. Kasich having her wrist fracture miscasted, after leaving it to 'ripen' for 5 days, to get Governor Kasich's attention?  Mrs. Kasich ought to take an interest as her daughters might fracture something on the soccer field.  Medical care is a real concern instead of whether to move into the Governors Mansion  thats frivolous.  Medical care is what keeps people going, and Ive never been allowed one house, or one husband  I didnt deserve that if I didnt satisfy Dr. Nice.  How would you like that for a life Mrs. Kasich - courtesy of the Ohio State Medical Board?  If I didnt like Dr. Nice care, then I didnt deserve anything. 
Recently Governor Kasich had a problem about getting a pill-mill MDs license suspended - when he knows gosh-darn-well that the particular physician has 'friends' on the State Medical Board of Ohio, and will never have his medical license suspended - HE'S ONE OF THE BOYS.  That's just grandstanding, pretending, and simulating leadership.  It's only the women MDs that might have complained about Pill-Mill MD that will be investigated & sanctioned.  
Earth to Kasich: you don't operate a pain clinic in the greater Columbus area for 25 years without the Ohio Medical Board sanctioning it.  And with the physician complaints being 'confidential,' any damning evidence will be long gone before that file is opened for any review.  And there is no external review in Ohio of any Medical Board actions, decisions, or files - how convenient.  Governor Kasich will never have to take the blame or act to order an external review.  Looking good. . .  
Cases at the State Medical Board of Ohio go on for decades because you can't get the evidence to clear things; when one accusation doesn't 'fit, the Board just changes that file for another - my case has been changed several times in 2 decades trying to 'find a case.'  The critical/crucial files are always 'confidential' - my case file still is 'confidential.'  But that wasn't so in the 1980s in Ohio - and it isn't so in any other state in the 2000s.  Ohio is just bad government in progress.  
Instead, the Ohio Medical Board suspends the MD licenses of those women who object to the bad medical care - care that they shouldn't have to object to after Medical School - the physicians who should have warning labels above their office doors.  
Ohio has a high concentration of some of the worst MD practices in the country - despite University Hospitals, MetroHealth and The Cleveland Clinic.  In 1990-2, I ran into several of the physicians who needed warning labels trying to get some fractures casted in the greater Cleveland area - and that led to the loss of my medical license when I complained about the horrible care.  Catholic education does not prepare you for frauds, negligence, incompetence, and liars - just to be a Catholic girl who is easy (Dr. Nices definition of Catholic girls).
Any woman physician that complains about a male colleague has some kind of psychiatric problem in Ohio - or so it goes - you just have problems with men in generic terms.  Those particular orthpedics were asked for months to sit down and DISCUSS.  There were no patient complaints, no drug or alcohol abuse, and all the CME was on file.  
Then when I finally got a Fellowship in St. Louis and was starting to 'heal' in 1992, the Medical Board took my medical license so that we could all talk about Dr. Nice for another 18 years.  Carla O'Day MD & Anita Steinbergh DO were jealous - they couldn't qualify for that Fellowship.  So my life & career was trashed for the BOYS, and Governor Kasich you are just more of the same.  Not a neuron different.  The MD/DOs on the State Medical Board are not there for their medical achievements.
The wrist fractures took 2 years to heal after developing reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) - the incidence of which is very high in Ohio.  It happens after very neglected fractures, are then over-manipulated trying to salvage things.  The hand withers, loses bone density, and turns cold and blue while the muscles atrophy.  It only turned around after 4-6 months - that's why I wrote notes to Dr. Keith - I had never had such pain in my life.  He gave those begging notes to the Board saying that I was just crazy, well crazy after his care left me losing my R hand.  Dr. Keith never admitted what he did to cause the pain and problems = an experimental cast.  If it doesn't turn around, you lose the hand.  And I was 'lucky' as to that turnaround, but the Ohio Medical Board would destroy that second chance in a drunken moment.  They met in an Emergency Session and passed around the drinks until the suspension passed in my case  there was no professionalism involved.  The Hippocratic Oath means that when a physician patient is in pain, and not with a patient, that you shut your mouth and throw away the notes that detail that pain; post-operative, post-delivery, post-coronary bypass. 
That's what orthopedic care in Ohio does to you Governor Kasich - you almost lose your hand, and then when it finally starts to heal, you lose the medical license for saying something.  But I almost got out of town when the Medical Board decided that we should talk about thing for the next 20 years - Dr. Nice, and his wife, is all they are concerned about = Anita Steinbergh, Lance Talmadge, Rick Whitehouse et al.  
They didn't have a clue that I needed to get on with my life - that I was very lucky to pull out of RSD - that many patients don't and that I just BARELY did (50%+ dont).  The hand was in trouble for about 6 months  6 painful months.  But we needed to discuss that with endless psychiatrists for the next 20 years?  We needed to improve the incidence of RSD in Ohio.  But Governor Kasich and Brad & the boys don't know what RSD is or what the Medical Board does in Ohio - except spend money.  
Brad Reynolds still hasn't gotten back to me on how much my case cost the taxpayers of Ohio: two evaluations, one Hearing, and years of loss of my medical degree.  That's $1M loss in taxes alone, and President Obama is going to bail the boys out?  
In Ohio wrist fractures are left to ripen to 'excrescence,' and then casted in casts without stockingette padding so that the plaster eats through to the skin when the cast get moist - you develop a contact dermatitis with cast material degradation products.  And the orthopedics don't know how to angle, or reduce, the fracture - they just have 'Orthopedic Surgeon' on their lapels.  Then you get an 'experimental' cast - Dr. Keith at MetroHealth specializes in those - and nothing heals so you have to have a 'personality disorder' - because no one orders any blood work to find out that the fracture can't heal with a thyroid problem.  It's just Ohio medicine that Kasich is hoping to sell to the rest of the world using Univeristy Hospital/Cleveland Clinic names.  Trivisonno get real  that ain't gonna happen to paraphrase how you guys talk.
My complaint to the State Medical Board of Ohio in 1991 was to get my medical records out of an office, and get Dr. Nice to stop bothering me for referrals and personal understanding.  I met with Dr. Nice in his office asking him to get out of his head that I had any interest in him personally, my mother tried to speak with him - then I sent him over 10 notes asking that he meet regarding the patients he had referred to me about where he wanted them to go, and that he send my records and leave me alone for awhile.  HE DIDN'T GET THE MESSAGE.  
But should that have led to the loss of my medical license for having problems with men?  18 years of evaluations, lies, and nothing about my patient care was wrong.  According to the Board, I practiced better than average medical care for Ohio - but just wasn't to be allowed to practice if I disagreed with the boys. 
EARTH TO KASICH:  WOMEN MDS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DISAGREE WITH THE BOYS TO SAVE THEIR OWN MEDICAL CARE AND THE CARE OF THEIR PATIENTS.  And we can't lose our medical licenses for this as it is PART OF THE JOB.  10 evaluations of me won't change that - it's not a personality disorder.  It's my job.  I'm not a hooker, engineered to do kinky sex-on-demand or to say 'yes' to every male idea.  I have an MD, 2 Master's Degrees and a MENSA IQ.  
Further there's a THIRD NON-PUNITIVE OPTION at many State Medical Boards - just not Ohio.  Where when there's a colleague-colleague dispute over care practices, the Medical Board meets and decides how the standard should go, and if the physician letting fractures ripen might benefit from not doing that (or the patients).  Then the errant physician causing the trouble is given 6-12 months to 'get with the rest of the country' on how to treat wrist fractures, or anything else (pain syndromes).  After that, the Medical Board takes the medical license of the Dr. Nice's or the Dr. Pill-Mills - in other states that is.  No other Medical Board takes the license of the MD-patient who got the malpractice that was allowed by the boys and their friends on the Medical Board.
But Governor Kasich is too stupid to know about that THIRD OPTION for going around the Medical Board's failure to act or reform things.  And the last Executive Director of the Ohio State Medical Board - Mr. Tom Dilling - admitted in 1998 that my file was on top of the stack of probably 'false' cases, but that was 1998. 
There's a stack of cases that are false at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Speaker Larry Householder's office admitted in 2003 that if the Ohio Medical Board opened the confidential complaints, there would be a legal paralysis of business in Columbus from the number of justified suits for damages that would be filed within days to weeks - from false actions by the State Medical Board of Ohio since the 'confidential' complaint policy went into effect.  
Millions of dollars, millions in my case alone, are owed physicians falsely accused by the State Medical Board of Ohio in the last 20 years.  But my case is on the top of that list, and Governor Kasich can't find the time.  Ohio needs medical mistake laws, the THIRD NON-PUNITIVE IMPROVE-THE-CARE-OPTION at the State Medical Board of Ohio, and an end to 'confidential' physician complaints.  Or Governor Kasich, Ohio will eventually go bankrupt because of the corruptions at the State Medical Board of Ohio alone; all the gambling and casinos in the state won't be able to fund that sinkhole. 									",Doctors

										In August 2008, I returned from Guatemala with my right ankle in acast. I had turned my weak ankle and chipped the ankle bone while working in aGuatemalan village. My doctor at the time, Dr. Hummel, referred me tospecialist, Dr. Maling in Tempe.I first visited Dr. Maling on September 5th.During that visit, he was rather insistent that I have surgery on both anklesto tighten the outside ligaments on both ankles. He explained this would makemy feet tilt inward, thus lessening the possibility of twisting outward whenwalking on uneven land. He further explained each would be be operated onseparately, as the recovery time was six months each ankle, during which Iwould be unable to even step on the recovering foot. I declined for two reasons: 1. My gut feeling was this was a rather drastic first lineof action. It seemed to me that there must be another, less invasive, option totry first.2. I run a foundation and did not have a year to sit in achair. By the end of the year, my muscles would have atrophied and I may never havegotten back the aging physical capacity I now have. I have seen too manyelderly lose capacity and never regain it.  Dr. Maling reluctantly agreed to try orthotics andrecommended the Walkshop in Mesa.He was going to send them the adjustment he wanted done after he saw the MRIresults.  I had the MRI done on September 15th; I believe,and went to the Walkshop on October 9th. We were still waiting forthe required adjustments until October 15th. I made a phone call to Dr. Maling,stating that if he was no longer interested in providing appropriate treatment,to say so and I would find another doctor. He assured me he would followthrough and provide appropriate treatment. He sent the prescription that day. Unfortunately, when he provided the measurements, I assumedhe knew what he was doing. I paid the $385 for the orthotics. I wore the orthotics faithfully from late October on. MyMay, I noticed I had rather severe pain when getting out of bed in the morning.However, this pain did lessen after walking around a bit. I was getting readyfor the semi-annual trip for the foundation to Guatemala and did not think to askabout it. I was, after all, following the doctor and being safe. While in Guatemala, Iwore the braces daily and didnt seem to have the morning pain.  On July 1st. during my trip back to the USA, I did notuse the braces, as I was walking on even ground in airports. However, betweenflights, the pain was such that I could barely walk. Every time I sat down andrested, the pain subsided, but was much worse when I got up, until I walked itout.       I made an appointment with Dr. Eulano for July 29th.He took a look at the orthotics and was visibly upset. After takingmeasurements of the damage to my plantar fascia, he was ready to explain.  The previous treatment had been destroying my plantarfascia, which was now full of an extreme amount of scar tissue. I do not knowthe measurement he was using, but he explained damage up to #3 was indicationof enough damage to require treatment. Mine was measuring slightly less than#6. He further explained that every time I was off my feet, the body was tryingto heal the ripped tendon pieces and every time I got up and walked, I wasretearing them, causing the amount of scar tissue to increase.  I got a second opinion a month later and it was the same. Ihad been destroying the plantar fascia. When the plantar fascia is stretched to abnormal lengths,damage is inevitable. It is not meant to be so abused.  I am dismayed and angry that Dr. Maling did not have thisknowledge when he prescribed stretching my plantar fascia. I will be eternallygrateful for following my gut feeling, rather than his strong pressure to havethe permanent surgery. I would be in a wheelchair by now had I done so.    Dr. Malings uninformed diagnosis cost me months of painthat I am still overcoming, not to mention the $385 for his damaging orthotics.I hope some day I will be able to take a few steps without needing constantsupporting shoes. It is a nuisance when in the shower.  This doctor needs retraining and until then stopped. He issurgery happy without having sufficient knowledge to treat at least ankles.  I sent this lett to the Arizona Medical Assoc, who forwardedit to the Podiatrists Assoc. some 6 months ago. The no response tells me theyprotect their own, not the public. It has been over 2 1/2 years and I am still in pain on myleft heel. The recovering right foot gives me hope Malings damage to the leftcan be overcome eventually.  ",Doctors

										On 8/13/2010 I went to the Hospital for a scheduled bladder surgery to help with an incontinence problem that I was experiencing. I spoke to my Doctor, Angela Flippin Trainer in a pre-op conversation and she explained what would take place. She said she would probably need to remove my uterus because my prolapse was so bad, then suspend my bladder in a mesh sling. She said I would spend one night in the hospital and would need about four weeks off work to recover. When I woke up after the surgery my oldest son told me that he could not spend the night in the hospital because he was under 18, so he called his father who was at home watching our three other children including an 18 month old and a five month old. When my husband came to pick up my son he saw Dr. Flippin Trainer and asked her how everything went.  She replied ""everthing went well but she bled more than I would have liked"". In the middle of the night I woke up with a fever and  as I struggled to get comfortable (I was catheterized) I realized that I couldn't move my right leg so I called for a nurse. My right leg was swollen and I had blister like bubbles on my inner thigh and vaginal area. The nurse applied a compress and the Doctor visited me the next morning. Dr. Flippin Trainer told me she would have the urologist on duty come and look at me. later that day Dr. Rivera came into my room and after a quick exam told me he wanted to fill my badder with a dye and take some pictures with a catscan type of machine. That evening after returning from the catscan a nurse came into my room and told me I couldn't eat anything else in preparation for a second surgery the next morning. She seemed shocked that I didn't know the results of the catscan and she went and brought them to me. The results indicated that Dr. Flippin Trainer punctured my bladder during my bladder lift surgery causing the urine in my body to have no outlet. She explained that this is what caused the swelling, fever and blistering. The next morning Dr. Flippin Trainer assisted Dr. Rivera in another surgery to repair the hole that she made in my bladder, to do this they needed to remove the mesh sling that I originaly came in for. After the surgery both doctors came in to speak with me and informed me that I would need to be catheterized for another week while my bladder healed, they also said that I wouldn't be able to have my sling procedure for at least six months. I needed four weeks off of work to heal, have numerous medical bills and ended up never getting my original procedure done. It took me over six months to feel well enough to confront Dr. Flippin Trainer about what she did to me. On 3/18/2011 I went to her office to talk to her and the first thing I noticed was a new, life sized mural of herself on the elevator door leading up to her office. Her office had a few patients in the waiting room but as soon as she noticed me she quickly escorted me into a private examination room where we could talk. I told her that I felt abandoned by her after my surgery and that I was disappointed in the way she handled my care. She quickly rebutted "" Often times when a procedure doesn't go the way we want them to, patients blame their doctor"". I told her she was out of touch with reality and she was the reason my procedure didn't go the way it was supposed to. I let her know that I had numerous bills because of her mistake and her reply was ""I didn't bill you for your hysterectomy"". I then reminded her that I went in for a bladder lift. She wished me good luck and asked who my new doctor was. After I told her, she attempted to plant doubts about my new doctors character and integrity by telling me that ""he is an abortionist"". Dr. Flippin Trainer is a pro-life Doctor that needs to realize that being pro-life means more than just caring about the unborn. She did not take my surgery or recovery seriosly, she was careless and has yet to apologize or even own up to her mistake. I just had my third surgery with my new doctor and I will be out of work for six more weeks. This entire ordeal with Dr. Flippin Trainer has turned my life upside down, and has taken an emotional, financial and physical toll on me and my family.									",Doctors

										Don't get me wrong--the doctors are amazing at what they do and they probably have very little input on the practices of the billing department. But the concerns still stand.THIC's Billing Department (technically ""Midwest Pediatric Cardiology 1482 Momentum Place Chicago, IL 60689-5314"") is staffed with the most unprofessional, heartless, uncaring, rude bi**hes you will ever encounter--and I use the term bi**hes with purpose not just to throw out profanity. The women who work in this department including Julie and department head Kathy for some reason think that their sh*t don't stink and treat you like you're less than a maggot. I understand that collecting on doctors' bills is probably a difficult job as everyone wants the medical care but doesn't want the horribly overpriced charges that go along with it. In their defense, the medical community as a whole has adopted a practice of marking up its services to astronomical proportions in order to get what they need from insurance companies (being that insurance companies negotiate a % off because of the volume of patient accounts they pay for). But back to THIC Billing Department specifically.It's hard to believe Kathy is even the manager/supervisor based on the way she acts on the phone, and how she refuses to accept any responsibility for her employees' behavior. If you complain about the way someone acted on the phone, Kathy will tell you that she doesn't believe anyone on her staff could be anything less than professional and she will literally argue with you instead of just taking a complaint. I guess this explains why they don't record any of their calls.My particular incidents stemmed from inquiring as to certain charges on the bill I received. I asked for clarification on 3 items that I didn't recognize as being done at the appointment for my son. I was met with a sharp tone and scolded for even daring to raise this concern. I explained that we had been going there for years and never did I see those 3 charges on a bill, nor do I remember ever having the services performed. Julie said that doctors don't lie and all they can do is take my payment. She said I could either pay now or it would be sent to collections and that was the bottom line. They have no dispute process or investigations procedures. That's when I asked to speak with a manager and I was told Kathy would call me back. At first I didn't even believe it was a manager who called me (3 days later by the way). The way Kathy behaved on the phone resounded of the way Julie spoke to me. It was demeaning and angry. I then contacted the clinic ""administrator"" named Robert who never called me back after I left 2 voice mails on his phone number and 1 orally taken message with his secretary.I have complaints open with the BBB, the state licensing board, and the FTC. I also called all the TV stations but I'm not sure they will care about little old me. Anyways I wanted others to know what happened and I suggest you find one of the doctors who has left THIC and gone into private practice - and you use them. That way you still get the quality without having to deal with the scam artists and abusive nature that is the billing department at THIC.									",Doctors

I went for accupressure therapy for an anxiety issue I have. My first visit I called and they were nice and told me to come in for a free consultation so I scheduled an appointment and went. For a surprise my first visit they charged me $55 starter fee because I agreed to start accupressure therapy plus my first therapy so total it was $80 which I had no intention on paying since I had anxiety for being out of work. 
Anyway I agreed to make 3 weekly visits for the next couple weeks because I wanted my anxiety to go away so the first week I went 3 times. The second week I went on monday and was supposed to come back on Wed and Thursday but Wed I had a funeral to attend and Thursday I had to work late at a job I just started and I didnt want to take off work or tell them I cant work late because I just started working and i wanted to stay on good terms with my job. [continued below]....
									
										..... Well The 3rd week I went in on Monday for my therapy and they told me since I missed the previous week it would be better to start all over again and to come back a week later. She was rude to me and didnt even do therapy on me or anything. 
I thought that was a little odd but whats worse when I went to leave they charged me $60 and I asked what it was for because I didnt get therapy today.  They told me it was because I missed a day last week and I didnt call to cancel which was a lie, I called both days and told them I wont be able to make it. I saw a sign on the wall that says theres a $25 fee for not canceling so what was the other $35 for? I dont know. I was unhappy at this point so later that evening I called and cancelled all future visits. Then they mailed me a bill for $105, and for what? i dont know. This place is a scam artist and they are very rude, They are very nice at first and made me believe their stupid accupressure works, It dont work but thats not my complaint. My complaint is they took so much money from me and even billed me for no reason. I was a cash paying customer and I payed for each office visit on the day I went in, I did not have insurance.

										This doctor and his ""Bogus Detox Facility"" are truly an insult to those few doctors and detox facilities that are truly trying to help people. I paid $15,000 for an opiate detox (I have been told by others that he now charges $19,000) and was re-doped, right after the expensive rapid drug detox, with another opiate, Subutex.   It was placed under my tongue and I had no idea that it was anything but Naltrexone, the ONLY agent that should be used in a rapid drug detox situation. Of course I felt normal after detox, as all of Sponaugle's Pitiful Patients feel. We are only feeling normal because we are NOT clean of opiates, only re-doped with another. He beckons everyone to come down and see his freshly detoxed patients so they can be tricked into believing the rapid drug detox is responsible for their euphoric afterglow. The rapid drug detox is not even necessary to be re-doped with Subutex.   To me, it is completely criminal to charge $19,000  for an opiate detox, only to be re-doped with another.  If you want another opiate stuck back in your brain, for God's sake don't go to this maniac and pad his pockets.  Skip the horror of having the Sponaugle Boys and staff abuse you with their pompous attitude and just seek out the Subutex/Soboxone Pusher in your local area. It will only cost under $500 to be infected. It does not make any sense  why he continues to poke an addictive opiate down every patient and act like Mr. Innocent.   After 8 months of working hard on their wellness program, only to end up fighting another opiate addiction, I trusted no one, especially the entire cult at Florida Detox,  but through personal one on one conversations with countless detox patients from RDD Center in Michigan, I made another long trip to this Wonderful and Truthful facility for a 2nd detox.  You can find them at www.rapiddrugdetox.com and read my full testimony under the name of Carol. I'm appauled that I let myself believe the STUFF that comes out of Marvin Rick Sponaugle's website, conference calls, and Monday morning SERMON. I put myself in such peril by allowing this facility to treat a very minor detox, from a few weeks of a very low dose of a traditional opiate and also a 1.5 mg. Xanax detox and trusting that the wellness program would change my life.  I got nothing but another addiction from them.  
I have since learned the TRUTH about my opiate and Xanax detox(another $3000 to Sponaugle for the Xanax detox, when RDD Center in Michigan would have weaned me for free) and the danger I was put in by Trusting the ""Christian"" Doctor Sponaugle. Since no Doctor, upon arrival at Florida Detox, took out the time to speak with me, and let me decide my fate with Subutex, I was just cast into the crowd of Hopeless Heroin Addicts and Doped Up without my knowledge of what it was. No one bothered to explain the fact that I was not clean of opiates after a ridiculous bogus detox, nor that I would be brought down to my knees from trying to wean from the Subutex, nor that I would be seeking out and paying for another detox within a matter of months. I have filed several complaints, with the Florida Board of Health,  against Rick, the mastermind and Steve Sponaugle, the brother who does not even hold a medical license but is allowed to take over your complete health and well being.  He takes great pride in belittling you and making you feel emotionally worthless and physically ill beyond belief. I'm horrified that this JOINT can get by with this kind of abuse to one's emotional, physical and financial welfare. I was denied my medical records from Sponaugle when I legally sent for them, I was blackmailed by the brother, Steve, for a good testimony on the Vitals.com website, and I was left in the dust to find a solution to my “Slight Subutex Dependency” as Steve so casually put it.  There is no dependency with such a hideous drug.  There is only full blown Addiction. The sad state of affairs that Florida is in, with it's horrific opiate abuse and their greedy doctor abuse in writing the prescriptions, plus the deception of the pharmaceutical company that makes Subutex/Soboxone, plus the FDA that is so behind on the dangers of this drug, is one of the reasons why he continues to get away with such a crime as charging $19,000 for an opiate detox and re- doping with Subutex. Every week I speak with people that call from the RDD Center in Michigan's referral, who are seeking a detox from Soboxone/Subutex, (the very drug that Sponaugle uses on his patients) and all have been led to believe by doctors, pain specialists, detox centers and treatment facilities, that they were not ingesting anything so sinister. I say that this practice of The Quick Switch During Detox is nothing but criminal. It is called Theft By Deception, done by Con Artists all over the world.   Under law, Theft by Deception is a crime in our society.  
My hope is that this fanatical Doctor will someday be held accountable by the Florida Board of Medicine,  for all of the harm he has brought to his patients that DID NOT WANT to be re-addicted to another opiate because of  their withholding of the Truth.   If you are looking at Sponaugle's website thinking Dr. Phil condones his protocol of Subutex, just watch The Dr. Phil Show.  Each week there are many guests with drug issues, but in the last 5 or 6 years, I have yet to see Dr. Phil send One More patient to Sponaugle’s Carnival of Horrors for re-addiction. I think he feels that two of his patients were enough to subject to the Sponaugle Switch, many many years ago. No one likes to be TRICKED, not even Dr. Phil.  This is truly a Scam, Sham, Thank you mam detox facility, only in it for their own greed and to heck with those that are left with another opiate addiciton.  I hope that Sponaugle and his Flock learn HUMILITY by being Humiliated (as countless Sponaugle Patients have been) and I hope they learn HONESTY by being cheated (as they have made countless Sponaugle Patients feel).

Columbus, Ohio","
										During the 2010 Ohio gubernatorial campaign, John Kasich promised to get the bad physicians off the street, to promote some improvements at the State Medical Board of Ohio.
Other states, ie Alaska, Wyoming, etc, can use the physicians that Ohio is disciplining for ‘making too much of the bad care in Ohio; physicians disciplined beyond Ohio law for not going along with the 'boys.'  'Don’t ask, don’t tell' who complained – is just wasting money when the witnesses can’t come forward and the problems can’t be solved.  Brad Reynolds is not capable of this kind of ‘constituent affairs’ – he doesn’t know a thyroid from a rotator cuff from an abdominal external oblique muscle.  And he doesn’t care.  Physicians deserve someone who cares on the 30th floor of the Riffe Center, if only for an ephemeral moment of thought. [continued below]....
									
										.....
‘Confidential’ complaints at the State Medical Board of Ohio mean that the physician complaint has little or nothing to do with the physician's patients or patient care – just politics as usual in Columbus.  'Confidential' complaints against physicians have been done away with by every other state – because after you get a MD you deserve to confront your accusers – and medical styles, training, and expertise varies widely.  Many Ohio physicians have more training than the Members of the Ohio State Medical Board.  The US Constitution should protect from false accusations and the taking of someone’s career.  Ohio is currently the worst place to be a woman MD in the US.  
Women MDs in Ohio can be ordered to unlimited numbers of psychiatric evaluations in Ohio, at bizarre roadside stops, to discuss their sex lives - not their patient care - for not meeting male, or female, colleague needs, patient referral quotas, or covering up colleague medical mistakes.  Ohio is one of the few remaining states with no medical mistake laws, or laws mandating early referrals for ‘unanticipated’ medical results or complications.  40+ other states have MEDICAL MISTAKE LAWS including Pennsylvania - so why can't the Governor of Ohio get with the other state governors?  They all go to the same meetings.  
The endless psychiatric evaluations of female MDs for not doing the personal needs, patient referrals to the 'right' Ohio physicians, or the bonuses to the Medical Board Members goes on in no other state at the present time.  Mr. Whitehouse, the current Director of the State Medical Board of Ohio, never answers his phone about this.  The women MDs in Ohio are just endlessly harassed until they do what the men want - you can't say 'No.'  The Ohio State Medical Board is the biggest 'pimp' in the state for personal favors to certain 'right' physicians.
Governor Kasich promised in his 2010 campaign to clean up the State Medical Board – to have a plan.									",Doctors

Fond Du Lac, Wisconsin United States of America ",http://fdlpsychiatry.com/,9209239054,"Jeffrey Junig Fond Du Lac Psychiatry is negligent, and manipulative, a wolf in sheeps clothes.  Fond Du Lac, Wisconsin","
										It would take me a very long time to write my report on my personal experiences with Dr. Jeffrey Junig of Fond Du Lac Psychiatry and SuboxoneTalkZone because it is extremely painful to recount. I had many, tons actually since this man cannot be without the last word, of emails but I stupidly deleted them after I considered a lawsuit for some time. I deleted them because they enraged me so much to see and I wanted to forget what happened.
I am a young woman who was dealing with severe major depression. Traditional medicine was not working for me. That is when I found many great things written about using an off label medication for Depression that was working for some people. I also found Jeffrey Junig's blog where he speaks about the medication and on one occasion at least talked about it being legal and something doctors should consider. I was desparate, and wrote him from a Foreign country to tell him of my situation. Later he insinuated that writing from that country had made him think I was wealthy or someone important and that is why he took me on. 
Basically, he took me on as a patient. I told him I was considering treatment with the alternative medication but put it in his hands. He was my doctor and I was willing to try something else. He prescribed the alternative medication right away with some warnings at the time that I told him I was out of my mind in pain.  That is not what I consider negligence.
We would meet on cyberspace once a month or week, I cannot remember. He fixed his rate for me and never told me there was any problem with that rate, or with the other medications I was on. We proceeded with therapy. Basically, he never gave me room to be ""sick."" He told me word for word, he thought I would be his star patient. Talk about putting pressure on someone? 
I was kind and receptive during every session and respected him very much. I was very excited about the work we could do, but as soon as he hit a sore point with me, which was a flippant and I felt insensitive comment about my family, I told him so without using the word flippant or insensitive. I merely said in a tone about a half a note lower than usual that it upset me when people talked about my family. He changed immediately after that. 
One night I felt very lost and scared and I emailed him. My last doctor, who had to move out of state would have responded by saying, 'It is ok you sent me a very upset e-mail because I needed to know and see that part of what you are dealing with.' I guess I learned from her that a patient was allowed to be sick and allowed to voice her opinions to her doctor, I was spoiled I guess. I actually believed doctors who say they are different, really were. I apologized the next day for emailing him off hours and from then on he was always pushing me out of his practice. He would get very angry with me and admit ""a lousy session."" He would say that he was so used to dealing with hard time addicts that when it was my turn he didn't know how to turn down the heat and intensity. HE ADMITTED THIS. I would cry after sessions with him. 
I felt it was falling apart but I wanted to save it because I felt he had the wrong idea about me, and I was open and wanted to remain with him. I wanted our earlier days to come back and was very confused where it went wrong. 
One day I asked him about filling out paper work concerning a temporary disability. HE asked me many questions about it and I let him know it was not the same as ""DISABILITY."" I told him exactly what he would have to write if he agreed. He said yes. Soon every time we spoke or e-mailed, he was asking me the same questions. One day he even asked me my name again and what I was there for. Which was very disappointing. He gave me such a hard time about this paper work, as though I was asking him to do so much work, as though I was asking him to do the work I should be doing. The medicine was over 500 dollars a prescription and I simply couldn't afford  it. I was nothing but kind and humble to him.
It was after the dispicable session that he took blame for that I asked if I would be charged for a session that lasted 5 minutes, in which he hung up on me saying, "" I don't know, I don't know about you anymore."" Then he hung up the webcam and I began to cry and worry hysterically over our sessions, over affording my medicine. Soon he said it was because of my other medication that I had to leave his practice. Then he said it was because of money, when I challenged both things he said 
""You aren't open to change."" I can't work with you. I told him all of this was hurting me very much. He then immediately said, we only had a few sessions we hardly know each other, he didn't believe me. I then brought his contradiction to his face and asked him if we hardly knew each other how could he dismiss me on the grounds of me not being open to change? You had to know someone to make that sweeping accusation didn't you?
To make a long story short, this man is not sound of mind. I became angry then and did have some choice words for him and considered a lawsuit. I still considered one which he threatened to tell the personal things I told him if I were to pursue a lawsuit and then told me he wasn't threatening, it was just that he knows me and I am quick to jump to a decision. What? You are saying you would use my information to defame my character in court though you said you understood completely the things I told you? Wait? You know me well enough again to make an assumption about my character.
His motives and moods were constantly changing. He would not apologize for anything because he knew he was wrong and feared a lawsuit. His wife, who is his secretary hung up on me for no reason.
I tell you this man is a snake.  There is so much more that he did that was just bizarre and unbelievable.  The emails that the other person posted about him on this sight were chilling reminders of his totally unprofessional, judgmental, and intrusive manner. The man was asking for a refund point blank and Junig turned it into an argument about his character, making creepy assumptions about him and his future. This is how he is. He is abusive and it is disarming not to mention a waste of money. I am still not over this situation. HE IS A SNAKE. If you are ready to admit he is right about everything, you shall do fine. If you really want help and are sick at all, that is if you ever need him to be gentle with you or give you more than a 2 or 3 sessions to change I would go see someone else. Seriously. I am not pursuing my email host to recover the e-mails and still thinking about risking my money on a lawsuit.									",Doctors

										I went to Dr. kelly Austin because I believe in a natural approach to healing and she is close to where I work. I wanted to know why I am tired all of the time and if my hormones and thyroid are out of wack. I do not have health insurance and cannot afford it.
I was sent to a lab for blood work in August 2010. I waited for someone to call me back and schedule a follow up, but it never happened. Sept faded into Oct and then I got incredibly busy with the holidays. By the time I thought about it again, it was Jan 2011. I sent an email and finally received a call that they had ""found"" my tests. 
When I finally went for my appt the Dr. based her recommendations on tests taken six months ago and still expected me to pay for the labs. (also they had no records of me paying for the last visit, which I had to bring proof of). I then paid for the present appt and Dr. Kelly Austin suggested  I write a postdated check for the lab tests (since I couldn't afford to pay for both at the same time.) Come to find out, when I checked my bank account that next week, the office manager had deposited BOTH checks and I was overdrawn. The bank says postadating a check isn't technically legal, so they don't have to honor it.
The six month old test results showed that I was anemic, had low calcium and some hormone issues. Not life threatening, I admit, but I do not consider this Dr's. office to be very professional or responsible. They do not admit when  they are wrong and they are still making me pay for the lab tests that they lost. Why should I pay for their mistake? Now the Dr. says she will temporarily give me back the lab fees if I write ANOTHER postdated check to be deposited later. Why would I trust them not to deposit it early again?
I should not have had to call them to remind them to get my test results. I should not have had to provide proof of my previous payment. I should not have to pay for tests that are six months old. They have done nothing to try and appease me. I do not recommend this Drs. office to anyone.									",Doctors

										After seeing the job posting on craigslist, I applied for the Receptionist/Office position in his dental office. He called me back repeatedly... while i was on the phone with him... he said he was gonna call me back, not to answer, and asking me to call him back and leave him a voicemail explaining who I am, and answering all of the many questions he just left on my voicemail.
It started of verrrrry weird. But, I needed a job, asap. So, he called me back a few more times, unsure of when to hv me come in. He wanted me to come in on a Saturday morning when the office was closed.
I wish I had never wasted my time going in. I should have used my gutt instinct, b/c he is NOT NORMAL!!!  I have never had such a horrible, uncomfortable, long interview in my life!
I was there for 2 and a half hours, and could barely get out of there!  He had me follow him as he paced from his office to the front at least 10 times while asking me alot of questions, repeatedly.  There was no pt for him to pace back and forth and have me follow him. He even checked his email, and then asked me why was i looking at his email, even though he asked me to follow him!?
He asked me to fill out a paper with my name and address, and everytime i started, he'd say, ""Hold on a second, follow me..."" and then go back to his office where he has a board with confusinf info for you to learn right then, and then ask you questions about what he's written, then he ask you to read aloud guidelines for the office, and then has you open your mouth so he can check yur teeth during the interview!
He had many calls while I was there, from his wife, and he'd tell her he's fixing to leave but keeps going on and on... asking VERY personal questions, including if your married or dating, and  if you'd move in with a guy before marriage!  There was soooo many odd, personal, weird, and redundant questions, that I was freaked out!
I felt uncomfortable the ENTIRE time!
He said he'd be right back... was going to get coffee, and then come back and not have coffee in hand! He then had me read over manuals, and tell me his office MUST have $5,000 income every day.. then went on to rant about insurance companies are not our friend!  and... there are ways around it. Also, he insisted that if he hires me, I must MAKE everyone that is in collections pay him!
he said, you can't try.... that you have to MAKE THEM PAY! and that it would be worth your while???
also, he said if you quit within 2 weeks, you would owe him money!!!  
Then, he asked me to follow him...walking... over 2 blocks in freezing cold to get him coffee. (that he said previously he was going to get)
I told him many times I needed to leave, and then he'd say now hold on, wait a minute... I thought you want this job?  He also went back and forth many times, leaving me standing there, feeling uneasy and scared!  I almost had to sneak out. He asked me again, to follow him for coffee! Even though we just had went!
Finally, he told me I could start Monday... and I said ok, just so I could get out of there.
He then asked me if I could drop him to get coffee, and I said No, and I was leaving, he walked beside my car, even running up to my car on the street, to tell me directions, which I already told him I had!  
DON'T trust him as a dentist or employer!  There is something mentally wrong with this guy and he should NOT be allowed to be in business.
I left there stressed and uncomfortable... and i did a search on him and found many more similar complaints on him as well.

It will take more than Fix Ohio Now to turn around the Ohio State Medical Board  where, with a confidential physician complaint system -false disciplines and suspensions ofphysicians have been stockpiling since the 1990s (this started withGovernor Celeste). Everything'non-patient care'from missed child-support payments, to the business of not sending enough patient referrals to the 'right' Ohio physician, to a woman MD's disagreeing with a male physician about orthopedic care principles, are clogging the complaint system in Ohio. Some triage is needed. Currently only the Board Members can arbitrarily determine what to pursue withan 'investigation' - and that is 'confidential.' Further most Members are 'grade B' physicians themselves; missing a difficult diagnosis1/4 to 1/3 times on their Internet reviews - not the best to determine care standards - physicians who make mistakes.Anyone with 'friends' on the State Medical Board of Ohio can get another physician's license suspended for 'personal' - for no one knows what is really behind most Medical Board sanctions, i.e. no law firm can figure out 'confidential' regardless of how much money is spent. Some cases take years and over$300-400,000 for the physician; meaning that it costs the State of Ohio about double that with Hearings, appeals, and 'finding' another case when one doesn't work. The 'confidential' evidence can be changed - as even the State Representatives admit (Trakas). No false case is ever dismissed forlack of evidence or late filings. The Ohio State Medical Board can change any procedural rule, or ruling,until the physician's money runs dry with legal roundabout. The Ohio Court of Appeals can never get the 'confidential' to hear a case for reforms; they can only throw a case out and remand it back. Then the Board Membership is a closed club; once a Member is appointed, it takes an 'act ofGod' to get a Member to not be re-appointed. Every Member of the Ohio Senate Health Committee has to vote againsta gubernatorial choice,andthis never happens; majority does not rule here. Meanwhile,Governors keep making the same 'mistakes' over and over withBoard choices only from the Ohio State Medical Association elite. The Cleveland Clinic has not had a Member on the State Medical Board of Ohio in over20 years; huge groups of active physicians in Ohio have literally no representation on this Board currently.  One Board Member has been on the State Medical Board almost 20 years now - Dr. Anita Steinbergh - and she's not there for 'merit' as the perpetual DO token. [There are plenty of good-to-outstanding DOs in Ohio who could merit a term.] But it would help if you could speakwith her,as one woman-physician to another woman-physician should be able to discuss in 2011,about medical diagnosis in women patients. It would help if she understood the missed diagnoses, such as thyroiditis or vitamin D insufficiency,that plague women patientsover and over in Ohio. Males simply don't get thyroid or vitamin D problems. The current Medical Board President is a male PODIATRIST. Every other state has done away with this antediluvian, arbitrary, and reign of terror confidential physician complaint system  and made changes in how cases are conducted, along with a third non-punitive 'pathway' to improve medical care standards that are a source of dispute for physicians. About 40+ otherstateshave some form of medical mistake laws -- so that when patients, or physicians, facethe medical mistakes of a physician, or Medical Board --there is a timely'out.'  Currently the State Medical Board of Ohio has no 'path' to correct a mistaken suspension - no way toefficiently get a physician back without pages of ridiculous conditions (when the physician did not make the mistake). The 'goes' at a physician are unlimited; there is no double, triple or 'end'to the jeopardy.It is an outrageous cost to the state whenprofessional lives and careers are derailed for politics -when 'friends' can take a colleague's license for 'not going along'- and there is no oversight or review in Ohio of the Medical Board. The Governor literally does not know what is going on.  Most other states have a path to RESTORE a medical license after a Board mistake; and most states are liable for the re-certification, re-licensure, and the re-education courses required for this return-to-function. No one is asking for Ohio to pay for this, just tocorrect the false cases and make some reforms - to allow a stack of physicians their livesback before another 4 years. Confidential complaint systems are a brain drain, a waste of time & taxpayer administrative monies, and a modern daytrial by fire that doesnt exist in any other part of the Ohio Board system. Brad Reynolds  Constituent Affairs  will not be able to get the answers  even how much one of these cases has cost Ohio over the last decade or two. The only person with the answers is Rick Whitehouse, andits difficult for anyone to get him on the phone with the ancillary take the blame staff that surrounds his office. It was estimated by then Ohio Speaker Larry Householders office in 2003, that there were so many false physician disciplines, suspensions, and actions, that opening up these files would paralyze the State of Ohio government with justified legal cases for professional liability &damages. And that was in 2003. You cant win a case with the State Medical Board of Ohio unless you know what the accusations are and who signed the complaint. So Medical Board cases can go on for decades with certain favored law firms able to get a step forward; a step that goes back if you stop the retainer. Its a game with preferred 'arrangements' between certain legal firms and certain Board Members. Since2003, Speakers Husted and Budish have refused to address the administrative problems at a Medical Board that functions on hearsay, innuendo, and misinformation  none of which can be corrected if the crucial complaint file is confidential.Whats on the Boards website, if you judge by one of these false cases, is about 99.9% exaggeration and fabrication the physician does exist -but you cant sue the State Medical Board of Ohio and expect to ever practice medicine again. And no one has that much money. The worst case is a case of a woman physician who has had her medical license suspended for 18 years for objecting to the wrong orthopedic and medical care. [In Ohio, informed consent is not necessaryfor women physicians -we have no rights to object to the wrong care, or to choose the right care; our medical license is forfeit.] The woman MD's orthopedics either wanted to (1) wait until her wrist fractures ripened to excrescence;(2) cast with experimental casts; or (3) do surgeries with pins/plates that werent recommended by anyone outside of Ohio.Then her blood work was lost for a decade as to why she was fracturing bones in her mid-30s. Almost 20 years later, the Medical Board is still looking for a case to justify suspending her medical license for making too much of boys being boys care.' That is the top of the stack -a Governors dream case to change a whole Medical Board by showing some fraud and lack of ethics. [Earth to Governor Kasich: it will take more than an ethics directive to get ethics at the State Medical Board of Ohio.]Governor Kasich has been in office in Ohio for 20 days now  when will he get Mr. Whitehouse to answer some questions or evento pick up his cellphone?Thebest bet is that it will take more than another 20 days.     ",Doctors

They sent you a form letter telling you to use the Teladoc service less and see your in-person doctors more often. The problem is, what if you ARE seeing your in-person doctors regularly but you have a doctor who has limited hours and doesn't have an answering service? What if you're on business in another city? Isn't this the purpose of Teladoc? Apparently not.  I used Teladoc, on average, once every 2 months. Teladoc sent me a letter every 4 months telling me to see my doctor more in-person. Each time they wrote me a letter I called them or emailed them or wrote them back a physical letter explaining that I *DO* see my regular doctors often and that I *DO* update my Teladoc online medical health record with the applicable information EACH time I see my primary care doctor or have a change in health. I was doing everything right.  .....Yet Teladoc terminated my account without any opportunity to appeal or be further explained as to the reason why. What constitutes ""too much"" use of the service, and how dynamic is that rule being applied? I don't think using Teladoc every 2 months is overkill, especially when that is averaging over a period of a year.. so for a few months I might not use it at all, but in other months I might use it a bit more often because I'm traveling or my doctor's on vacation and being self-employed without insurance I don't want to do $1500 ER visits for a sinus infection.

I went to you because I had been diagnosed with Hepatitis C. You were recommended to my by Dr. Alla F. My 1st year under your care, I was on pegylated interferon and Ribavirin. This treatment failed and I was on this treatment for just over 1 year. Several months later, you started me on a new treatment with Infergen and Ribavirin . Along with this, I was having weekly injections of Procrit, taking Lexapro, and Acid reflux medication for my stomach. You kept me under this medication for almost 2  yrs. I almost died as a result. ***** Pay special to the past tens pretense of this next paragraph*****
                                                               I was newly married living in a good home. And I was the proud and established owner of two computer businesses. My credit score was 740. I had a permit to carry a concealed weapon and had no criminal issues what so ever. And I had an impeccable reputation. In Sept, Oct, and Nov. of 2007, I was expressing to you that I was having a really tough time. I had told you that there was something wrong with me and I was completely falling apart. In Dec and Jan. I was communicating to you that there was something wrong, you acknowledged to me that I seemed just a little bit mental but you just attributed it to the Interferon treatment. In Feb. of 2008, I had lost my home, and my marriage and was barely able to even walk or think straight. I called your office screaming like a lunatic and you called me back several days later and stated that you were a little concerned. Then in a hostile manner, you said,  Then just stop taking the treatment and so I did. You said that my life and mind would come back to normal in a week or 2 and that was about the last time that I really heard anything from you. As it turns out, I had a stroke in the month of November 2007. I can even remember when it happened and what I was doing when it occurred. But I did not know that what I had just suffered was a stroke. The stroke was in the rt. frontal cortex of my brain. It impacted my behavior, my memory, my balance and or equilibrium, my appetite, my sleep and damaged badly my executive function.  Although I was coming to you, and although you had promised me that when issues came up, that you would be there for me and that we would resolve them or find the solutions together. You told me that you would be there and you were not. You were too busy giving your lectures, boasting about your publications, and telling all of your patients that your books were the texts that medical students use in their classes. You did symposiums and tours and regarded yourself to me as the authority of authorities in your field. You thought yourself to be the best. I believed and trusted in you.  However, you just were not there for me. And in fact, you were using me as your experiment to learn from and to better your own personal agendas with no regard to my life what so ever. I was very extensively tested for the cause of my stroke. MRIs, Cat. Thoracic, Radioactive injections to take pictures of my brain. BP, and many more. Everything was perfect. I was never a candidate for strokes or heart disease. The direct and only reason that I had a stroke is because Dr. Caanan Avunduk did not know when enough was enough. It is the conclusion of most Dr.s that nobody should be on this kind of treatment for such a prolonged period of time. If it failed, then it failed, and you stop the treatment. I have gone through much, and I have learned much since I have last seen you. I have been through cognitive and vocational therapy.  I am on Social Security Disability for the rest of my life as the direct result of your medical practices. You destroyed my life to further your career, as you were too oblivious to concern yourself with your patient. I do not believe that you have the moral capacity, nor the compassion to be able to comprehend just exactly the damage that you caused practicing your medicine on me and using me like a lab rat as to further your own personal career. I have a new gastroenterologist now. He has been in his field even longer that you. I have been retested for everything including liver biopsies and all of the blood work. My count is 3mil and my liver is 1. It will probably be another ten years if ever I even become symptomatic. You told me I was going to die in a few years and destroyed all of my hope at ever trying to plan a life again You were wrong and cruel to say such a thing to me. What kind of sadistic person are you? As it turns out, more that 50% of Asians and Russians carry the virus. Most of those that become symptomatic do so as a result of heavy drinking. I was none of those things.In fact, I was very healthy. Most ethical Dr.s will not put their patients on this treatment unless the Hepatitis is a problem for them. In fact, I discovered that viral count or load mean very little. It is all contingent on how your body handles the viral load, and I was doing fine. I know of patients with 50mil count and they have been doing fine for years and are yet to be symptomatic. I should have never been put on Interferon and Infergen. The fact is, that at the time that I was treated, very little was known about Hep. C. It has only been recently that the numbers have been compiled and Dr.s are able to make a better overall assessment of the viruses affect on the overall population. I am sure that you know about all of this stuff, because that is what you do. So getting back to the point Caanan, I was your experiment and you totally screwed up. And your patient had a stroke. When it was brought to your attention and I wanted to talk to you, your response to me was make an appointment. To this day and it has been 3 years almost to date since I had my stroke. I have not been on any medications since I dispensed with your medical practices. I have to take melatonin and Gaba to make me sleep. My complexion and skin problems are tenacious and plague me every day. I have gobs of skin disorders now. I never had any before you used me as your experiment. I have no appetite and my brain doesnt tell my stomach that Im hungry. I used to go for days without eating until I was weak and shaking. I know that I have to eat. I force myself to eat every day of my life. I was 168LBS when I arrived in Hawaii. I am now 187 and holding. But it is an effort that I have to work on every day. I have severe sleep disorders and my body clock was wiped out in the stroke. I stay awake every night until my body just passes out from fatigue. It takes me 3 or 4 tries before I can leave the house because I keep forgetting things. I have lost the ability to learn new things like a new trade, or to read a book and remember any of it. I can watch a movie and then watch it again a few days later and I think that I have never seen the movie before. I have no girlfriends or wife or anyone because I am damaged and worthless because of how you exercised your applications of Interferon to me. I am not employable because I am a hazard to any coworkers around me. And every day of my life that passes, I think about you and what your treatment put me through. I think about how you were simply absent. I cannot forgive you for this.  You killed my mind and my brain and you destroyed who and what I was with your over dosages or over usage or abusive use of the drugs that you prescribed to me. You had me on that shit for over 2 yrs. Are you mad? Are you insane? Because I think that you are dangerous and it is my moral duty to let others know. I live in Hawaii now. I rent a small room in my brothers house. This is my 1st step to afford you the opportunity to make things right with me. I will not be securing an attorney, nor will I waste my money and time taking you to a court and suing you for Malpractice since I would probably lose. You may perceive this letter in any way that you wish to, however my question stands steady and that is,  Just how do you intend to make things right with me? You ruined my life and I will never forgive you for costing me everything that I worked so hard for. Since my behavior is not normal any more I have lost all of those who were so dear to me. I have to wonder if you even have a conscience. I have to ask myself if you even ever cared. I am plagued with problems both personal as well as physical issues due to your medical practice on me and I am asking you how you intend to compensate me for this damage? I do not have the resources to fight you in court. I make $674 a month. You caused me great harm and you ruined my life. What do you intend to do about it? As I stated, I cannot afford an attorney and the legal system is designed to protect sadists such as your self. Through my eyes, you are no different than a Nazi that experiments on people for the sake of fame and knowledge. You violated your oath to cause no harm and you betrayed the trust of your patient. You are a Dr. and you are wealthy. You have a thriving practice and you travel frequently. Your treatment took the opportunity away from me to be able to accomplish much of anything anymore.  You go to your home after work every night and make yourself a nice meal and then watch a little tv perhaps before you go to bed. I have no home I can call my own now. I have no appetite, nor do I have money to feed myself half of the time. I am unable to just go to bed and sleep. You have your life and health and future in front of you. You robbed me of mine. I do not know if this letter will carry any effect upon your conscience, but I have to at least try to see if you will offer me some help because I have no one else to turn to. You have an opportunity to help someone whos life you caused great harm to and whether intentional or not, this responsibility lies totally on your hands. So tell me Dr. Avunduk, what kind of person are you? How moral of an individual are you? How compassionate do you feel about hurting the patient that you once told and regarded as your friend? Do have any remorse or concern at all? Will you help me now that I am ruined or will you brush me under the rug and write me off as another casualty of your advancing career? I am eager to hear from you as it has been several years and never once did you ever try to reach me to ask me if I was ok. You knew what had happened and you turned a blind eye. So I am confronting you with reality and I expect a response. Please contact me a.s.a.p. to inform me of your intention. An apology is kind, but does little to help improve my quality of life. You have the means, and you have the way. Do you have any desire to make things right with this man? I am going to be alive for quite some time unlike your stated estimate that I would be dead in 2 or so years.  I have a long time to think about you every day. How I think about you is completely up to you. Lets see what you are really made of. I am most curious indeed. In finality, I have discovered through my doctor that your extended experimental treatment on me was not only unlawful but unethical as well. Patients that are to be subjected to experimental drugs or length of usage of said drugs must first go before an institutional review board for approval 1st. Also it involves me signing approval and release forms akin to the said experiment. You never did this and it violates the premises of your medical license. I strongly suggest that you react and take this letter seriously. Your response will determine my next course of action. Consider it wisely **** ON THE LAST SENTENCE ABOVE, MY NEXT COURSE OF ACTION WAS TO PUBLICIZE DR. CANAN AVUNDUKS ACTIONS AND BEHAVIOR TO EXPOSE THE TRUE NATURE OF THIS PHYSICIAN*****

Thus, anyone who files a restraining order in MA.

										I went to see a podiatrist, Dr. Jeremiah Graff in Plano, Tx at the beginning of 2010.  I had 1 toe that was giving me pain (right foot, 4th toe).  Dr. Graff told me that he would need to perform surgery on 3 toes to relieve my pain (1st, 4th and 5th toe on right foot).  The 1st toe would need to have extensive bunyon corrections that would be more invasive that the typical bunyon surgery.  He said I would need to walk on crutches for 5 weeks. I thought this was extreme since the 1st toe wasn't giving me problems, but I trusted that he knew best.  He said that he could use a very fancy stitching technique so that the scar would be less noticeable.  On surgery day, Dr. Graff was 30 minutes late, however he performed the surgery that day.  I was in terrible pain for weeks after surgery which is probably normal since this was a very invasive procedure.  However, I developed an infection that put me in the emergency room for a day. [continued below]....
									
										.....  It seems that Dr. Graff did not do a very good job on the fancy stitches that he gave me and this is the reason for the extremely painful infection that I had.  I had to make visits to the wound clinic for debris removal and no one can imagine how painful it is to let someone clean an infected wound.  Over the next several months, I have continued to suffer with pain.  It has now been 8 months and I have continued pain in the toes that he worked on.  In fact, the toes that hurt most are the ones that he talked me into doing surgery on, not the original toe that sent me to the podiatrist.  I wish I had got a second opinion about Dr. Graff's plan to operate on toes that did not even hurt.  He made alot of money on me and all I have left is a struggle to feel normal again.  I am female and I cannot wear heels or nice shoes.  I cannot run.  I do not walk properly even after physical therapy.  There is not a day that I do not have pain and the pain is way worse than it was prior to surgery.  I will always see Dr. Graff in my nightmares and remember how he stole a part of me that I may never have back.  I have recently visited an Orthopedic Surgeon in town and he will be performing a revision surgery to try and help me regain what Dr. Graff took from me.  Warning:  Do not let this podiatrist Dr. Jeremiah Graff operate on you.  You should see what he did to my foot.  									",Doctors

ANY suggestions please post on here!10/29/2010   Behavioral Concerns  Folasade P. May, M.D.Threatening BehaviorPatient (ME) was admitted for abdominal pain and diarrhea to Dr. (PCP) Private Service on Bigelow 9 on 10/27. During his admission, he has been under the care of Dr. Zachary and our AHS NP's.Patient (ME) was treated and discharged by Dr. (PCP) at 11am on 10/29. After his discharge, the patient remained in his hospital bed to eat two meals and wait for his ride home. At 5:40PM, he rose from his bed to leave the hospital and suddenly complained of back pain. His nurse went to see him and asked our floor PCA to check his vital signs given his status change.The PCA for the floor went to his room to attempt to take vital signs. The patient refused. Our PCA then stepped out of the room to make the NP (Halary Leblanc) on the floor aware that the patient ""refused vital signs.""The patient then came out of his rooms with the belongings. He approached the work area and stated to me, ""that was your major mistake."" When asking the patient what his concern was, he stated ""he did not want his vitals checked because he had been discharged."" I explained to the patient that I was not his attending of record but that we typically try to reassess patients if they complain of pain, even if they have technically been discharged. I also explained too him that our PCA was only attempting to assess him given his complaint of pain. I also explained that although I am the attending for several of the patients on the floor, I am not his attending of record and have little, little to do with his care.At that point, the patient leaned over and raised his voice in my face. Several nurses of the floor became concerned about his aggressive behavior. Peg Bartlett, R.N. called security out of concern for the safety of the care team. The security team responded and patient was escorted back to his room. He then allowed physical examination and assessed by his RN and covering NP.He was given Motrin for his pain and then stated that he would like to leave.Security was called to escort the patient to his ride in the lobby, however, the patient left before security escort arrived.PCP has been made aware of this incident.-Fola May, M.D.Internal Medicine.OK folks-- here is my letter to Patient Advocacy. You tell me what is wrong with Dr. May's note and what should I do!!!Ms. Linda Kane, Patient AdvocacyMassachusetts General Hospital15 Parkman Place, WAC 018Boston, MA  02114November 1, 2010RE: Medical Record Note, dated 10-29-10 by Folasade P. MayDear Ms. Kane:It was a pleasure to speak to you this afternoon regarding the above captioned matter. As you are aware I had received my medical records from Health Information Services this morning as I was suspecting a note about this incident.I would like to make a statement in regards to Dr. Mays note on 10/29/10, RE: Behavioral Concerns, Threatening Behavior. The following is my interpretation of the events that happened and are true to the best of my knowledge. Dr. May was the attending doctor for the inpatient service of Bigelow 9 during my stay at MGH from 10/27/10-10/29/10. I was admitted the hospital by my primary care doctor;  of Infectious Diseases on the afternoon of 10/27/10. Dr. (PCP) had told me that there were no beds available in the hospital at the time and that I would have to be admitted via the ED. I was escorted to the ED by my doctor's Administrative Assistant.After several hours in the ED and consultation with the ED attending I was assigned a room in Bigelow 9 around 10PM. Upon arrival to the unit I was admitted by Dr. Christian and Nurse Sasha. During my interview with Dr. Christian he had told me that Dr. Fola May would be taking care of me thorough out my stay in Bieglow 9. He stated that Dr. May would be interested in my health presentation due to the fact that she would be getting a new job on the West Coast in (GI) Gastrointestinal Medicine and that my presentation would be fascinating to her.I am very concerned that the note that Dr. May wrote about the incident of Threatening behavior is overly fabricated, times of incidents are inaccurate and her goal is to have me deemed as a unruly patient and that she did not care about me as a patient and wanted to put all of the pressure on Dr. Zachary. First I want to mention that on a few occasions with Dr. May she had seemed nice in her demeanor but talked to me as I was a text-book. Instead of using everyday words such as pills or medications she would say .agents referring to the medications I was taking. She also seemed to have an attitude with a lot of the other staff under her supervision which I could pick up on. There was no real patient-care with this doctor. I had a clear view of the doctors station from my room and I would say that 90% of the day she was as she mentioned to me camped out all day at the computer. I do not know how a doctor can treat patients while being glued to a computer terminal 90% of the entire day.I would like to reiterate the events of my discharge on October 29, 2010 as Dr. May seems to be very inconsistent with her times and quoting of events:1.) I was discharged to home by Nurse Dominique at around 1:23PM not 11AM, this was on the discharge report created by Dr. (PCP). Dr. May changed the times to satisfy her own judgment about my behavior and fabricated this is her Behavioral Concerns note on 10/29/10.2.) At 4:58PM as I was already discharged I was bending over to gather my green, MGH patient belongings bag and had a very sharp pain from the pain that I was admitted for radiate my back on a 10/10 scale. Nurse Dominique walked by and I had told her she said she would be right back.  I sat on the bed to wait for Nurse Dominique to come back. I was fully clothed and shoed with the green bag on the bed. At that time PCA JEN came to do vitals. At this time I thought she was doing daily rounds vital signs so I explained that I was discharged and that I did not need them done. Jen left my room and stood in front of the room on my right near the doctors station and screamed at the top of her lungs Patient in Room 962 REFUSED vitals. She made this comment about 4 or 5 times until the whole entire unit heard her and she kept looking at me as she was ready to lunge at me. Again, Dr. May has fabricated times of incident and I was generally thinking that the vitals signs were part of the daily rounds.  If I had known that the vital signs were due to the part of my pain complaint then I would have NOT refused them. Again, Dr. May and PCA Jen collectively fabricated this incident.3.) After this embarrassing moment at 5:09 PM, I wanted to just go home and page Dr. (PCP) from a more pleasant environment. As I left the room being in pain and angry I mentioned to Dr. May that what the PCA did was .a grave mistake. I attempted to leave the unit as I was already discharged. Dr. May engaged in a conversation that I did not want to have. I told her numerous times that I just wanted to go home. She refused to listen to me and went on how she was not my attending doctor and how she on multiple occasions told me this. (I only met Dr. May once in my room). She explained that Dr. Zachary was the attending doctor for me and that only he could help me. This continual discussion with Dr. May, which I wanted to end by just walking out of the unit had escalated. I do admit in raising my voice to her that I simply just wanted to leave and that since no one could help me that I just wanted to go home. She was actually smiling to the point of grinning at me while staring at her computer . I was then approached by NP, Halary LeBlanc who asked me if I wanted to get reassessed and I agreed as long as Dr. May had no involvement. At this point Nurse Bartlett came to the room as NP Leblanc was about to exam me and she said Security has been called. You are violent and I do not feel comfortable with the (NP) in the room with you alone. At this moment I tried to explain to Nurse Bartlett what happened in a calm but tearful voice and she said I do not want to argue with you, security has been called Security came (5 members of them) and Nurse Bartlett told them that he is violent and out of control. He needs to be watched NP LeBlanc explained to security (while I was in the room) that she felt comfortable with me and that Nurse Dominique would be in the room at the same time. They felt OK with that and left the unit. In this incident, both Dr. May and Nurse Bartlett had fabricated the times and incidents of the situation to meet their satisfaction. NOTE: I was already in my room and fully clothed when security arrived on the unit.  I was not escorted back to my room as Dr. May has maliciously said her note and again fabricated this to make herself look good.4) After security left the unit, NP Leblanc and Nurse Dominique came into my room at 5:32PM. I had paged my primary care doctor  to my cell phone and he responded at 5:34PM. I had told him the situation at hand with Dr. May and was upset and crying to the point that I wanted to end my health care with all providers at MGH immediately. Both NP Leblanc and Nurse (PCP) advice to contact Patient Advocacy and resumed treatment to elevate the pain and was given helpful advice for home care.  While NP was in my room at 6:17PM, I text messaged my cousin, Todd  to pick me up at the main lobby of MGH. He told me he would be there in an hour. NP Leblanc had escorted me to the elevator down as she had told me she had to see a patient on White 9, this was at 6:26PM. Again, Dr. May has fabricated the times and events that have taken place.  She said that security was called to escort me to my ride home in the lobby. (I do not know how she would know this when I had told Nurse Dominique that my friend Elaine  was coming to get me by MBTA but could not make it to pick me up and I had told her that I was taking the MBTA as I thought the case manager had a taxi voucher for me. Nurse Dominique told me that the case manager had left and I just assumed to take the MBTA). Dr. May would have no knowledge of me getting a ride home from my cousin Todd when I only made arrangements with him at 6:17PM. Dr. May who seemed to have no interest in my health care or attending me seemed to know very little about my discharge and what method of transportation was happening. She states that security was called to take me to my ride home in the lobby. I believe security was not called. Dr. May seems to have fabricated every incident that has been in this note. She has lied to make herself look good and has belittled me to the other staff and has put a mark on my medical record which makes it non-objective to other providers in the future at MGH to treat me. Nurse Bartlett has also caused the security staff with a false sense of urgency which in my mind should be treated as an inadequate call for emergency services when nothing really was at risk or an emergency. I am sure that there were more alarming situations in the MGH that needed attending too.I am very saddened, angry and in a state of shock that a doctor and a nurse would go to such great lengths to fabricate, lie and reconstruct events to make a patient feel more at ill. It seems that the Bigelow 9 unit needs to be attended to by supervisors and medical directors. I would not be shocked if this is not the first time that Dr. May and Nurse Bartlett have displayed this type of behavior towards other patients.I had a very good rapport with the nurses and staff during my stay. Most of the nurses thought I was comical and a pleasant patient. Nurse Dominique even went out of her way to buy me two Dream Bar brownies from Coffee Central that morning. It is very nice that she did this. I do not think she would have done that if I was the patient that Dr. May and Nurse Bartlett has made me out to be in the note by Dr. May.I ask that the MGH place this note in my official medical record and that it is shared with directors and administrators alike. I am also placing a CC to my other doctors and social workers within my health care team.  I am also going to keep a copy of the note and my letter in case I need to go to the ED in the event the staff reads this and has to have security at my visit.If you look through my record and talk to all of my providers at MGH I have never ever had a Behavioral Concerns in my medical record. I still plan to keep my medical care at the MGH only because I have built very good relationships with (PCP), M.D., NEUROLOGIST, M.D., THERAPIST, M.D. and SOCIAL WORKER , LICSW and would not want to leave their care.Very truly yours, ",Doctors

I was a patient for Dr. Kletz and should have walked out on the first visit but didn't.  I was seeing a different allergist in MD but wanted a local doctor to administer my allergy shots.  On my first visit i requested they contact my old doctor to get the medical records as I had received an allergy test before and was receiving shots.  Dr. Kletz insisted that I needed to undergo all the allergy testing again and they never once made an attempt to contact my previous allergist.  Obviously this was simply so they can bill my insurance company and I endured the test for a second time.  Anyone that has had this test before will agree with me that this isn't something they enjoy doing more than once. What really put me over the edge was the fact that after this test and during my allergy injections I wanted to get my flu shot.  I have excellent insurance and my insurance pays 100% for the flu shot.  I was informed that they do not bill the insurance company for the flu shot and that I would have to sign a waiver stating that I could not submit it to my insurance for reimbursement.  I talked to the office manager about this and was told that NO insurance company pays ANY benefit for the flu shot.  This is simply not true and a lie.  I called my insurance company and was told it was covered and that they suggest going to a different allergist!  I decided to give Dr. Kletz one last chance to do the right thing and was told by the billing manager that no insurance pays for the flu shot(a lie) but she asked for my insurance card to call the insurance company and ask them directly.  After waiting for her to call the insurance company she said they do not pay for it (another lie) and that I would have to pay for it out of pocket and sign a wavier stating I couldn't submit it to my insurance company OR GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR and they would submit it.  HUH???? To sum it up I told them that if they didn't want to take care of me over a $30 flu shot it was a clear example of how they would want to take care of me over everything else and they chose to lose me as a patient over this.

At Roxbury Clinic and Surgery Center, they work to treat each patient equally and we aim to please all of our patients. Safety is their number one concern in taking care of patients and secondly is that they obtain satisfactory results. It is their goal that each patient has a great experience from the time they make an appointment until the time they are done healing from their procedures. Communication between staff is very important to ensure the quality of patient care. 
Each patient comes into the office for a consultation to discuss their concerns. The area of concerned is examined and a treatment plan is formulated if possible and medically advisable. The patient then will meet with the patient coordinator to schedule the surgery and will be given a price quote. The patient is welcome to come back to meet with the doctor during my office hours if they still may have questions that are unanswered or any other concerns.
The treatment plan is advised at the time of the first consultation. If a treatment plan is not made at the first visit because of need for further information then the patient is asked to come back for a second consultation once all information has been obtained or the patient is referred out to another surgeon. Each patient is assessed and consulted prior to obtaining any treatments or services to ensure they are fully aware of their course of treatment. At the time prior to the procedure (usually the pre-op appointment), the patient will fill out informed consents and is advised to ask any questions that they may have regarding the procedure. All risks and complications are discussed with the patient at this visit as well.
In a scenario that the doctor would not advise a procedure be done on a patient, Dr. Calvert stats that he would discuss with them their goals for the procedures, look at alternatives, and try to help direct them to either a better solution for their concerns. If they are still unable to come to a resolution, the doctor would refer them to someone for more information if he did not feel comfortable doing it for them. Dr. Calvert would communicate that in his hands that it probably wont give them what they want and he would refer them to someone for another opinion who may be able to address their concerns.
After treatment, the office makes sure to place frequent follow up calls (video calls if the patient is from out of town), frequent postop visits to the office, and having competent staff that can handle any issues that may arise with patients.  They also send each patient a post-operative questionnaire that specifically addresses their care and service. The patient has multiple opportunities to voice concerns as the office is heavily staffed with nurses and/or PAs. It is not uncommon for patients to feel more comfortable addressing their concerns with the PA or nurse and therefore it is their goal to make sure that the patients concerns are addressed and proper action is taken.
Since the office has been a part of Ripoff Report, they make sure all patients are well informed and educated which begins at the very first phone call or email that they may receive from a potential new patient. They also have clarified our consent forms and policy and procedure materials that are given to every patient. Patient complaints are taken very seriously and are dealt with immediately. No matter what the complaint may be the office will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible or come up with a solution that is agreeable between all parties.
Furthermore, the office has discovered that better patient selection is key in prevention of complaints. There are many patients that have had multiple procedures from other surgeons, that makes Dr. Calvert am very careful to assess whether or not further surgery is advisable for that patient. They also have heavier screening for body dysmorphic disorder and major depression that has allowed them to save patients the frustration of having further surgery and not being satisfied with the results.
As stated above  something that needs to be repeated to those seeking any kind of plastic Surgery .. The company states that they are committed to doing whatever it takes to make the patient happy because they have always worked tirelessly to revise surgery when necessary. In knowing that plastic surgery is not perfect, they always let patients know that there is a 10% chance of revision rate on any plastic surgery procedure.

====NOW TO THE ORIGINAL REPORT THAT WAS FILED  
====Dr Jay Calvert -  Jay Calvert MD - Jay Calvert ruined my face newport beach, CaliforniaI had a bad experience with Dr Jay Calvert. He did a facelift and revision rhinoplasty. His work was horrible. The worst experience in my life. I discussed with Dr Calvert the facelift which he stated that it would be a traditional facelift and the incision would start in the temple area hidden in the hairline. He did the facelift starting infront of the ears to the jaw line. He did not do the temple nor eye area nor upper cheek area. The result of the surgery is the outer corners of my eyes were pulled downward. The scars around my ears are distant from the ears and are very noticeable. He did not even try to make the scars close to the ears (to hide the scars). The revision on the nose was a mistake. One of the nostrils is larger then the other. He did not stitch all the incision that he made around the nostril. So I have an open ended nostril. The stitches on one nostril is much higher then the other nostril. The nose bridge has many lumps. Dr Clavert said that he forgot to file the nose bridge after he finished working on it. I asked him to redo and correct the mistakes that he made. He kept staling and postponing for one year. Then he said that he will not correct it unless I pay. I guess there was a one year deadline. He is incompetent. Futhermore, I requested Dr Calvert for a nurse to stay with me post-op. He recommended a nurse who stole my pain medications, money fifteen hundred dollars, and cellphone. The nurse is a cousin of his front office staff. One night the nurse gave me double the dose of pain medication pills to sleep and the nurse and her cousin (receptionist at Dr Calvert office) came into my room. Both women uncovered me and undressed me and took photos. They used a flash light with camera. Also the nurse put chemicals on my scars so they would not heal and they turned white. The receptionist pulled on one of my scars and ripped the scar, also she had a medical knief and made little puncture wounds around my nose, also she had a small metal rod and she continued to hit the bridge of my nose.

										I am sitting here thinking of what a terrible mistake I have made by having this doctor perform a surgery on me.  I am left here baffled by what could have went wrong.  Not only is not good aesthetically, but even worse, what did he do to create such a ""discomfort""?  One side of my face is constantly hurting from my ear to my throat.  When I swallow, there is a ""pop"" or some sort of sound in my right ear.  I cannot lay on my right side because of the snapping in my neck/ear when swallowing.  As I speak, the pressure there gets worse.  I have seen, since the surgery,  neurologist, ENT, dentist, and finally my primary sent me for an MRI to rule out any tumors, sincere there are so many lumps in the area that hurts.  Since the MRI came back negative,  my doctor suggested that i see a plastic surgeon because something was wrong.   While all this began I begged Dr. Cooper to help, but it was to no avail.  He then suggested I no longer contact him.  When I told this to my primary, he was very angry at cooper saying that he had no right to abandon me.  My next step is to see a plastic surgeon that may have to reopen the right side to see what the problem is and hopefully correct it if they can because I cannot live with this discomfort and I am afraid it will get worse.  I  have read on the internet from other patients that Dr. Cooper no longer spoke with them after they developed problems  but I think he thinks like them, this will eventually ""blow over"" but ""hell"" as a better chance.  It is time for this doctor to step up to the plate and do the right thing........he needs to take responsiblitliy for his mistakes and be a man......I want this corrected  and I do not like the way he handled this at all.  He needs to make this situation better!  ",Doctors

The second time I went in it was to get fitted for custom orthotics. Dr.
 Cassidy seemed present and attentive this time. He even cracked a few 
jokes and shared a few insightful tips on running and riding - a few 
hobbies we share. Thirty minutes later I was done. The receptionist 
checked me out and said I was to pay them full retail for the orthotics,
 $375. I reluctantly paid but had my doubts since all of the doctors I 
see are preferred, in-network providers of BCBS and my out-of-pocket 
costs are either a co-pay of $20 or a contracted rate before I meet my 
deductible. The doctor and his staff seemed nice enough and said 
charging full retail is what they always do with their other patients so
 I just paid and waited for them to call to get my brand new, 
custom-fitted orthotics. They gave me a sheet to submit to my insurance 
provider, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, to get reimbursed. I submitted the 
necessary forms to BCBS and was told the following: Dr. Andrew Cassidy 
is a preferred in-network provider (a participating provider) whereby 
BCBS and the doctor have agreed to contracted rates he is allowed to 
charge his patients. He should have charged you $190.63, not $375. You 
are entitled to recuperate the overpayment of $184.37. He refused to 
comply with refund request and BCBS has since filed a grievance with him
 on my behalf. Ultimately, if Dr. Cassidy/Lone Star Podiatry does not 
agree to refund the overpayment, he will no longer be a participating 
provider and I will be out $184. I need to note that I have made several
 attempts with the doctor's office to resolve this before getting BCBS 
to intervene, however, Rose, their manager, insisted they always charged
 full price for custom orthotics to avoid dealing with insurance 
providers themselves. Since they don't submit claims to to insurance 
companies themselves ""they do not need to comply with the contracted 
rates"". HOWEVER, BCBS has since confirmed that they have indeed filed an
 insurance claim but not on my behalf but for themselves, so essentially
 they double-billed;  they billed me once and got $375 and they billed 
BCBS to get more money! And this is how they've been doing business for 
as long as he's been fitting for custom orthotics! 
NOTE: the service provider (in this case, Dr. Cassidy/Lone Star 
Podiatry) is responsible for submitting claims directly to your 
insurance provider if they are a network provider. The onus is on them 
to recuperate whatever fees they have agreed to with your insurance; it 
is never the patient's responsibility.  ",Doctors

La, California United States of America ",www.enayatimd.com,tel:(310) 551-1711,"A. John Enayati MD MPH, Century City Wellness Center Appointment was organised and arranged by Lisa Greene, Dr. Paul. S. Nassif patient care consultant working at Spalding Cosmetic Surgery and Dermatology, 120 S. Spalding Drive, Suite 315, Beverly Hills In my opinion, they over charged me; and I cannot recieve an email reply from them answering my request/question (stating individual prices for every procedure)- although their website states that the La, California"," I did not see any information on Dr. Paul. S. Nassifs website (so I assume there is no information on Dr. Nassifs website) stating that I had to carry out medical tests prior to surgery. Lisa Greene coordinated and arranged a consult for my medical test with Dr. Enayati.  Prior to flying to the US Lisa Greene quoted me a total of $700 for the medical tests, and I had to accept that quote because surgery was immediate. In my country (I was a turist/patient flying in for surgery) such medical tests are much cheaper. If Lisa Greene had told me what medical tests were required at least two days before she informed me which ones were needed (and perhaps more details), I would have had done them locally and saved money. Anyway, very few days before departing from my country, after asking Lisa Greene some times to provide me with the list, Lisa Greene told me which medical tests I required. Luckily in one day, before departing, I managed to finish the list (which is not a small list)of blood tests and HIV tests (in my country). I did not do the tests again at Dr. Enayati so Dr.Enayati did the rest of the medical procedures requested prior to surgery and he charged me $662.00 and I saved only $38 from the $700.00 quotation Lisa Greene stated. Note: To my knowledge, procedures carried out with Dr.Enayati consisted in EKG, CXR, UA and Medical clearance; and I was charged: $662.00.  To my knowledge, procedures not carried out with Dr.Enayati consisted in: CBC, PT, PTT, CHEM6, HIV Antibody, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen and Hepatitis C Titer, and I saved $38.00.  (If Dr. Enayati considers the quote and procedures not to be accurate and I will do further research and if figures need to be changed, I ll do it  because I am not a doctor to be accurate but to my knowledge I am more than sure these are the figures and name of tests) I do not know about you but I am not used to paying those prices for medical tests and for me that high price is a Rip Off which I had to pay out of my pockets. Furthermore, considering he charged me $662.00 for the other procedures, only $38 is, in my opinion, very little. I mean, I prevented to undergo several tests which in my country are very expensive; I do not know why all those tests amounted to only $38.00.     Few days later I sent them emails asking them to send me prices for every procedure they carried out on me, and they did not reply to me. Their website states that they will respond within 48 hours. The following is the email:  Dear Dr Enayati, I sent you an email 2 weeks ago regarding the sum of money requested by you and my actual payment but you did not answer me-not as indicated on your website that you will answer customers within 48hrs. Please I do request the prices for every procedure carried out on me, for example the price for a chest x-ray is: $???? Thank you I do understand that there would be some technical faults using internet communications (perhaps my emails did not reach Dr. Enayatis office) so I am using this blog to surely reach your office. I am waiting for your answer to fulfil my request: I request individual prices for every procedure carried out on me.  Apart from requesting Dr. Enayati to quote me the prices for different procedures individually, I also ask the general public, please, to inform me whether I was ripped off or not. Thank you very much. Apart from this complaint I would like to inform anyone that plastic surgery should be treated as a complex and serious surgery so I advise you not to rush and do reasonable research.  Since I do not have a contract (I forgot whether I signed one or not; however, I do not have it at hand) impeding me from posting about the doctor, I simply proceeded. On the whole, I add that I was treated well by Dr. Enayati during my visit. ",Doctors

Columbus, Ohio United States of America ",,(614)466-3934,"Jack C. Amato, MD, President Ohio State Medical Board  Fraud at State Medical Board where women MDs are not allowed to disagree about their own medical care without license sanctions for 'not going along' Columbus, Ohio"," Dr. Amato is currently President of the Ohio State Medical Board - the most corrupt State Medical Board in the 50 states ever.  'Confidential' physician complaint laws went out in medieval times, again with Hitler, and yet are still in place in Ohio - where a woman physician has to prove her innocence with her career and a trial by fire - repetitive psychiatric evaluations about her sex life - which is the only thing that the State Medical Board of Ohio is interested in with their 'evaluations.'  What Dr. Amato does with his women patients is more of the same, their sex lives and not their thyroiditis.  The Amato-Strickland-Whitehouse Medical Board gives psychiatrists & social workers plenty of business that even the current Ohio health plans won't cover.  The Ohio State Medical Board can evaluate women physicians unendingly - they call it 'goes.'  No limit to the 'goes.' In Ohio, under 'Jack' Amato, women physician MD licenses are taken for disagreeing with the 'boys' about bad care practices (which the Medical Board refuses to correct).  Physician licenses are taken without allowing them blood work if they have bone pains that the male orthopedics are missing the diagnosis for - to cover the malpractices of certain 'right' physicians = the Dr. Nices.  No other state allows the taking of a physician license without allowing that physician 'care-to-function.'  Apparently Dr. Amato's patients don't get 'care-to-function' either; he doesn't believe in the concept.  Meanwhile Dr. Amato misses the diagnosis on his women patients 1/4 times per his Internet reviews - and just covers it up in a state without medical mistake referral laws.  Dr. Amato is a grade-B physician on a 4-point scale, per his patients, with only one approved way to handle his mistakes - lying.  The lies in the complaints, and on the agendas of the State Medical Board of Ohio, are on every page and paragraph of ever case - and they are personal, not medical practice lies.  No legal verification is done on any complaint - be it from jealous colleagues or patients. Telling Lies, by Paul Ekman, discloses ways to decipher lies - but he's never an expert for any Ohio Medical Board case - too many lies.Dr. Amato is an average male ob-gyn in charge of a very average Medical Board that refuses, in 2010, to go along with rules that every other state has already adopted FOR YEARS.  Currently Ohio is the only state where complaints against physicians are 'confidential,' so that colleagues can go after you for not sleeping with or referring to so-and-so male physician who has 'friends' (Dr. Talmadge, Dr. Steinbergh) on the State Medical Board of Ohio.  It's one of the 5-10% of states that have NO medical mistake provisions whatsoever - rules that even Harvard Health Partners has; even the best physicians in the country recognize that medical mistakes happen every day on everyone, and that there is a need to deal with them appropriately so that patients survive.  In physician complaints in Ohio, NO ONE ever knows what the real issues are - for twenty years in some current cases.  The forms on the website are never made pubic so that physicians can explain - and this includes bogus complaints that you don't go along with Dr. Nice's bad judgment, feel 'sorry,' or refer to him.  This 'nonsense' wastes 6-digit sums, sums that there is no accounting for in Columbus under Governor Strickland.  But the worst is that Dr. Amato sees current patients, and does to them what he does to women MDs - destroys their lives with the wrong diagnoses and treatments - which they can't object to without being labeled as impaired, or crazy, etc.  Dr. Amato's '10% solution' to a wrong diagnosis, or medical mistake, is to have the woman MD evaluated repetitively until the Medical Board finds a case - even if the woman physician had no patient complaints - she IS a 'mistake' threatening the status quo - a whistleblower who didn't want to say anything but it was her own care.  So his patients should be cautioned to expect that if he makes a mistake, they will be recommended to psychiatric evaluations to see that they 'don't sue' him - while the real diagnosis remains untreated.  There's no patient review on him that he will about-face on a wrong diagnosis, admit the problem, and redirect the care or make a rare diagnosis.  The Rorschach test is continually misused by the State Medical Board in Ohio, under Dr. Amato, to get the women MDs misdiagnosed - the photo attached is one of the 'medical' facilities that he uses - a Cleveland shopping plaza where he can set up temporary fake psychiatry/psychology testing - under any radar of peer review.  It's a diagnostic inkblot test with no purpose, no value or validity, and no diagnostic ability except to cause trouble - it's unreliable but still exists in the box of Ohio State Medical Board tricks.  The answers are never recorded, there are never witnesses, these tests are not done at The Cleveland Clinic, and Senator Grendell thinks it's all a big joke and gets re-elected.There are no term limits to appointments to the State Medical Board of Ohio - so when you get on - like Anita Steinbergh DO - you stay for decades causing mayhem and covering the mistakes of past decisions.  Currently about 40 other states have medical mistake laws to cover mistakes of physicians and their Medical Boards - so that a mistake can be admitted and corrected - but not Ohio.  And there are piles of medical mistakes as in every math problem; both math and medicine are complicated, but calculus professors can admit a mistake in class and move on.  Ohio does not acknowledge that physicians make mistakes, even though Dr. Amato's patients review that he does so 25% of the time.  This is only what the patients perceive - not anything objective.  What he does with his 'mistakes' - at the State Medical Board, and in practice, is the problem - for his patients, his office, and his family.  'Jack' Amato not an aboveboard guy.Transparency is badly needed at the State Medical Board of Ohio.  Someone better than Jack C. Amato MD - who won't even discuss anything with the women MDs that he destroys and misdiagnoses - is needed - more ethics.  Under Governor Strickland, and the current Democratic-Budish legislature, nothing is being done about reforms at the State Medical Board of Ohio - thus continuing to waste hundreds of thousands of dollars and physician talent - talent that the taxpayers paid to train - talent that doesn't make so many mistakes as Jack Amato MD.Jack C. Amato's clinic needs a good woman MD internist - which I am.  His secretary was impressed with my credentials, but the problem is that my medical license is 'under a cloud' because I had to disagree with some very wrong male physicians who were mistreating a woman-physician-patient - me.  And there was no channel for this disagreement.  In saving myself, there was no salvage of my medical license from the 'impairment' of having to disagree with the 'boys being boys' in Ohio = Jack Amato rules.  Yet Dr. Amato needs a Board-certified woman internist badly, someone who will disagree with him 25% of the time and save a few lives.  Current patients are warned to find a physician ob-gyn with problem solving and discussion skills, someone who can admit a mistake and re-direct in time to leave you a life.This is about bad women's medical care in Ohio that the legislature under Armond Budish refuses to admit, and which the State Medical Board ignores legally.  Dr. Amato's women patients are cautioned to get help elsewhere - from a MD who can do a workup and with some problem-solving skills - skills he consistently lacks on reviews.  Dr. Amato expects women physicians to admit that they have diagnoses that they have NO criteria for, to cover his mistakes at the State Medical Board, to be repeatedly questioned about their sex lives that don't exist; he will do no less to his regular patients or family members.  Can his wife discuss anything with him? Or his secretary?  Or just their sex lives?  Dr. Amato refuses to institute medical mistake laws, and some provisions for all the mistakes that he & other physicians make on patients & colleagues - so that patients can be referred promptly and diagnosed correctly - including women MDs.   ",Doctors

										I went to My Gynecologist in September 2007 for severe breast pain, leukorrhea, lack of menses, and a few other problems.  The practitioner who examined me took one incredibly fast look and said, ""You have a raging yeast infection,"" after which, she gave me a prescription for Diflucan.  I wondered if I might be pregnant but I figured that being a gyn office, they'd automatically do a test if I'd gone in with complaints of my symptoms.  After I started taking the Diflucan, my symptoms did not improve.  I decided I'd better take a home pregnancy test, which turned out positive.  I took a second one to be sure.  I read the documentation that accompanied the Diflucan and read that it DOES and WILL cause fetal harm!!!  Because of that moron practitioner, I had to have an abortion, which cost me $445 and a lifetime of guilt and heartbreak.  I had to take an innocent little life because of HER stupid, uneducated mistake!!!  I found out later I could sue for her mistake but the attorney said she couldn't help because I had no medical evidence proving that the fetus was damaged or hurt in any way.  I said I wasn't going to take the chance of having a damaged or sick fetus so I spared it and myself the pain of illness immediately and had the abortion.  I returned to that office and my boyfriend and I proclaimed loudly to the office staff that I did NOT have a yeast infection but was in fact PREGNANT and that the nurse failed to have me tested.  I wanted everyone in the waiting room to be shocked by their incompetence.  I felt that My Gynecologist should have reimbursed me for my examination and medication costs as well as the cost of the abortion.  I believe I was informed back in college (in Florida) that if a female of reproductive age has missed her menstrual period for an extended time, no matter what the reason, it's supposedly Florida state law to give her a pregnancy test before prescribing or administering medication.  I don't know if the law has changed since then (around 1994), but there was NO REASON I should not have been given a simple pregnancy test, which would have solved everything immediately.  I am hurt and infuriated and thought everyone should know, INCLUDING the staff and doctors of My Gynecologist.  I still have to drive by that office nearly every day, so the psychological and emotional pain don't have a chance to subside.  That nurse and the staff have no idea of the grief and expense they caused me.  I'm now at God's mercy with Him knowing that I murdered an innocent life, and may He forgive me and know that it wasn't my fault.  I hope women will seriously consider my experience before ever going to those people and save themselves a lifetime of guilt and heartache.  Thank you for hearing my story.

Knoxville, Tennessee United States of America ",,895-966-7755,"Dr. Koenig AKA Tennessee Valley Orthopedics Fraud, Deception, Scam Artist Knoxville Tennessee"," This bad man, Dr. Koenig, and his partner in crime by the name of ""Doctor Reischman"" are scam artists that charged up bills and then for no reason refuse to pay the bills of over three thousand dollars to one company alone using credit card fraud. They advertised training and then cheated a second person/ student who came to them and got cheated out of his $300.00 without them ever helping him in any way. This maybe do to the fact neither man is trained to do any of this type of training. So basically they scammed this poor unsuspecting man out of his pay by lying and deceiving him into paying them $300.00 for hypnosis training that they most likely never intended to offer. These men have defrauded, committed theft by deception, and they are scam artists, liars, thieves and con men. There are charges pending against both of these so-called doctors in several states.  The one so-called ""Doctor Reischman"" is no doctor whatsoever. What he is, is a phony doctor wearing a phony doctor coat and lying to unsuspecting people who believe he really is a doctor of mental health as he advertises on his web site. You see he could not have pulled off this scam on the people of Knoxville if it were not for the help of his dishonest friend, Dr. Koenig, who paid for or should I say put up the phony money, a fraud, to get his education and his place to practice in with this doctor's patients, who do not know about the phony doctor Reischman or their scams.  These are both real bad men posing as hard working christian doctors. Do not be fooled by either of them. The State of TN is investigating and both men are due in court to answer the charges against them. Do you want your personal medical information to go to either one of these dishonest doctors who have already committed credit card fraud to the tune of thousands of dollars and cannot be trusted to even tell the truth, let alone to have your very private personal medical information? Stay as far away from these dishonest ""doctors"" as humanally possible, or you may be their next victim!!   ",Doctors

I wanted like a ""mommy makeover"" type of thing, some work on my breasts (they looked like pancakes) abdominal extra skin and stretch marks, plus some work on my face. Dr. Roark was my doctor and the first red flag should have been when we met and I was naked in the room with just him and me. I felt very uncomfortable but I wanted to look normal again so I just went with it. I paid nearly 18000$ for a concentric breast lift and augmentation, abdominoplasty, and upper blephroplasty. The day I went in the doctor stopped in for one second and mentioned something about having an ""assistant"" Dr. Brahme, when Dr. Brahme introduced himself to me I swear he was drunk, but convinced myself that I was being paranoid. After the surgery was completed I was sent home with Vicodin 5mg, and was in so much pain that I thought I was going to die. I called the office and told a nurse named ""Ruth"" on the phone how much I was hurting and she told me I should have expected that. I also told her what I thought about Dr. Brahme and she laughed and said between us that it is not the first time she has heard that and he has a problem. The pain continued until the next day when I called crying, I went in for my check up and the Dr. Roark said that everything was wonderful and I would be ""perfect."" I told him how much pain I was in and he said that he could give me a shot (which he didn't) but I would be fine, and ""most people don't complain of that much pain, perhaps your just being sensitive."" So then I felt stupid, in horrible pain but very stupid. I asked him what size implants he used because I had written on my chart no more than ""300"" and he put 375's in me. After a few days my incision began to leak, I called the office again and they told me ""that is normal"" the pain got so bad that I finally couldn't handle it so I went to the ER... I had Staph and some sort of strep in all my wounds, and a hematoma in my breast, they took off the tape on my nipple in the er and pus gushed out like a water balloon. I called the office after I got home and ended up with nurse ""Ruth"" again who said I should have used Dr. Salts. They said they would have someone call me, nobody did.I look like a burn victim, my scars are disgusting due to the infection, La Jolla Cosmetic Surgery Center has done nothing but try to sell me thousands of dollars in laser therapy to help the scars.

he will 'quarter' you and remove normal nerves for a fee - and never see you back for even one post-op visit - because someone might catch-on.  Jill Beed-Smith in the Legal Department defends him - seeing nothing post-op - that he can keep cutting without consent if he 'feels' something - which is pretty gross.  Males are always 'feeling' women's bodies and wanting to cut something off - so that can't be the criteria - but this is his practice is, up to the present day, courtesy of the MN Board of Medical Malpractice - a Board forewarned.  They debate 'change,' the MN Board of Let-It-Be, but they can't read Dr. Sarr's operative reports that muscles are then sewn together - muscles that contract in different directions?  No one has the guts to stop Dr. Sarr, or make him undo and swallow the costs of his ridiculous procedures; you agree to a five-minute procedure and he can't stop cutting for an hour or more - and this is a person not a cadaver.  And he gets the anesthesia staff to check off that you agreed to general anesthesia, and so you are suddenly put out like in date rape - anesthesia instead of a 'date rape drug' facilitating the mutilation and the cutting of everything off the abdominal wall - what you said 'No' to.  Saying 'No' doesn't matter to Dr. Sarr, the Chief of Staff or the Mayo Board of Trustees.  These are procedures that no one has seen in any other hospital - procedures which community hospitals take the surgeon off the staff for doing without consent/discussion.  The Legal Department is a joke.  There's a problem - but the MN Board of Medical Practice can't see it.  And someday some woman will die with all her muscles cut off the midline of her abdominal wall - intra-operative shock from interns & students who were asked NOT to be in the room - especially those students from other Medical Schools or countries - who haven't got a clue sometimes.  The patient does have a right to restrict the OR from people not serious about care - and if you don't know the case and have never met the patient - you are not serious - just lucky sperm (or eggs).When a parent asks Dr. Michael Sarr what he was thinking - he says he could 'continue because he IS Mayo Clinic.'  The problem is that after he cuts everything off, his residents/interns sew everything back wrong and he apparently leaves for another 'show.'  Then he lets incompetent students try to do the skin - when the patient/family has stipulated a 5 year General Surgery trained plastic surgeon - these guys have one day on the service and last night's beer on board.  The result in one case will cost two additional surgeries - and Dr. Sarr removed a 'normal' nerve in some fibrosis that he said looked like a 'foreign body.'  He removes total normal nerves, not neuromas, creating neuromas.  Don't go near Mayo Clinic Rochester for anything abdominal, and if they turf you to Dr. Michael Sarr because he suddenly has a vacancy on his surgical schedule - there's a reason for the vacancy - run.The problem is that the MN Board of Medical Practice, though debating doing something, won't do something to restrict Dr. Sarr from brutal disfiguring 'fishing expeditions' - like they used to do pelvic exonerations, or radical mastectomies - he takes all the muscles off the abdominal wall and his staff can't sew them back.  This wouldn't go on without Jill Beed-Smith allowing it, and the MN Board of Medical Practice looking the other way for his brutal procedures that never heal then.  When you've taken the muscles all off the midline and removed whole sensory nerves because of superficial abdominal pain - there's no plastic surgeon who will ever be able to put that back again, and you will need multiple surgeries to get just some 'shape' back.  The problem with the Plastic & General surgical services is that NO ONE knows how to do an exam for superficial abdominal pain from nerve entrapment in an old incision.  And these articles are all over the web to Google.  What is treated with a nerve block everywhere else, because the insurance makes the physician/surgeon document the result of Carnett's test (neither Dr. Sarr nor anyone on the MN Board of Medical Practice knows what that test is or how to do it  - check with Wikipedia) - which they don't have to do in MN before they start dangerous procedures with unqualified interns & students not even at Mayo Medical School.  When a goof is made by a non-Mayo medical student, Dr. Sarr changes the operative report that he did the disaster closure - when he most certainly didn't.  You are told one thing and get an initial operative report, then get home and get the re-dictated one.  MN Board of Medical Practice allows all manner of changing of records, multiple operative reports, at Mayo Clinic.  How can you say that you used one suture in one operative report and then just change to another suture in the OR report #2?  Musical suturing.  Which one was it?  Just a coin flip?Do not go to Mayo Clinic Rochester for any abdominal procedures - stay home.  And Jill Beed-Smith won't give you the names of the surgeons who might be able to undo what Mayo Clinic does - just because they are Mayo Clinic.  It's surgical rape, with the worst intent - $.  And MN Board of Medical Practice is ultimately to blame.The MN Board of Medical Practice does nothing to help the victims of Dr. Sarr - not even provide the names of surgeons willing to do repairs.  Maybe they all need a Dr. Sarr procedure?  ",Doctors

Internet United States of America ",www.srsmiami.com,3058652000,Dr. Harold Reed The Reed Centre Sexual Reassignment Surgeon Ruined Butchered My Body Internet," I contacted Dr. Reed in the fall of 2004 to inquire about SRS.  I spoke to him at length about the surgey to find out what was involved, and had my wife listen in on the conversation to make sure that there would be no miscommunication.  At that time I was seeking metoidioplasty and I was concerned about impairing the vagina too much because I was concerned about losing capacity for orgasm.  Dr. Reed assured me that the surgery would take away about 10% of the vagina.  There were pictures on his web site showing a successful metoidioplasty that looked like a small uncircumcised penis and I told him I wanted a similar outcome.  He agreed and I sent over $2K as a deposit.When my wife and I arrived in Miami in Jan of 05 for the surgery, Dr. Reed again explained the procedure.  This time the explanation was totally different.  He was unclear and refused to explain about the surgery.  He kept making strange statements about whether there would be anything left of my vagina, and how the surgery was going to happen.  It was not the same explanation at all but he was very condescending and made me feel like the communication was on my part.  He then had me sign a very long release of liability.  As I was trying to read it, he kept urging me to hurry up and trying to prevent me from taking my time.  He did not supply me with a copy.  The release basically banned me from suing him as far as I remember but I cannot be accurate as I only got to read it once and that was done very quickly. I felt really trapped because I had already invested almost $4k in fees to Dr. Reed, flight costs, and hotel costs.  Dr. Reed's deposits are non-refundable for any reason.Since I had already invested so much money, my wife and I talked and decided to go forward with the surgery the next day.I was out of it most of the time, but my wife told me about some troubling events that occurred during the surgery.  First, I kept moaning because I was in pain and he would not give me pain medication.  Finally, my wife told me to moan louder and that finally prompted him to give me another pain shot.  At that time, my wife discovered that I was bleeding profusely and told Dr. Reed.  He attempted to address the problem but stopped twice to answer the phone.  Finally, he sent her out to the drugstore to get medication to stop the bleeding.  As I was coming around, I was in an incredible amount of pain but he told her that he would not give me another pain shot because he wanted to go home to dinner and he would not be able to if he gave me another shot.  He had his assistant wheel me down to the hotel in a wheelchair and drop me off.I spent several days in the hotel and Dr. Reed came to check on me.  I have never been in so much pain in my life.  He never prescribed any painkillers like vicodin or anything in that family.  The painkillers he prescribed were completely inadequate to genital surgery.  Every move I made hurt like crazy and there were several times when he was changing the bandages that I was screaming in pain.After returning to my home, I had to have stitches removed from the tip of my new phallus.  This was done as an outpatient at a local clinic and was almost even more painful than my time in the hotel. After starting to heal, I became aware that my new phallus, created from the clitorus, was completely sideways.  The head of the clitorus which normally looks like a small penis was to the right of my body.  I contacted Dr. Reed but he refused to speak to me on the phone, insisting that he could not tell me what had been done to my body without my returning to FL.  I scheduled a flight and returned to FL, but Dr. Reed was unable to tell me what had been done to me during surgery.  To this day, I have never had an explanation.  However, he immediately posted a disclaimer on his web site claiming that ""torquing"" can occur as part of this surgery.  The web site also states that this can often be corrected.  My ""penis"" remains sideways.Another problem is that my vagina is pretty much entirely gone.  I had asked Dr. Reed multiple times before surgey if the vagina would be impacted and was told multiple times that surgery would take away about 10% of the vagina.  After surgery, Dr. Reed insisted that he had meant that 10% of the vagina would be left, to which I would never have agreed.  After surgery, I was contacted by another FTM contemplating surgey with Dr. Reed. This gentleman informed me that the picture of the uncircumcized metoidioplasty pictured on srsmiami.com was not the work of Dr. Reed but pictures of a colleague in another country performing the surgery.  There were no notes or any idication on the web site to indicate that this was not Dr. Reeds hands in the photo and not his patient.I contacted Dr. Reed several times via email over the course of the last 5 years.  He has emails he claims he sent me but that I never received, claiming that he offered to have someone else look at my body.  I have asked for a copy of the release I signed but was told I could not have a copy unless I wanted to pay $150 for a copy of my file.  He also ""offered"" to allow me to come to FL and have him perform additional surgery for about $1,500.  I find this suggestion ludicrous as there is no way I would ever allow him to touch me again.  My wife to this day insists that she believes that I almost died on his operating table.  The whole time he was much more concerned with his dinner than with my body.  His overall bedside manner is horrific; he has a huge ego and when he doesn't want to address an issue he basically tries to intimidate you into not asking.  Once he has your money, his attitude is completely different than the pre-paid Dr. Reed.I have undergone over 5 surgeries to repair strictures of the new urethra created by Dr. Reed.  The original surgery broke apart but a urologist near me was able to repair it.  I pretty much have to have surgery once per year to be able to urinate.  I am not able to be sexually active using the vagina, and sexual activity using my ""phallus"" is painful.  It is still twisted sideways, and there are a lot of ugly skin tabs and places where the skin was hacked away during the surgery.  Dr. Reed never could explain what he had done to me during the surgical procedure.  His attitude in emails (he has never made an attempt to call me or return calls) is basically that he doesn't care.If I could go back and not go to FL, I would do it in a heartbeat.  This surgical produre has had permanent negative effects on every facet of my life.  I now urinate much more frequently throughout the day than I ever did, and every time I urinate I am in pain, sometimes intense and sometimes not.  The last surgey I had to correct strictures made the urethra less elastic and now urine remains in the urethra unless I hold paper under it, otherwise it will drip into my underwear.Stay away from Harold Reed and The Reed Centre!  I don't know how many lives they have ruined in the last 5 years, but if my posting saves just one other FTM's body, then it will be worth it.  I wouldn't send my worst enemy to Dr. Reed.

He then interviewed me for my child custody case, gave me a series of two tests and answered them all accordingly, signed each of all of the pages of the test with my first and last name.  My background is real estate broker, mortgage broker, income tax preparer and business broker, and business administration and wife to an investment banker.  On the day we went over the report he had given me the answers I had supposedly put on my quiz. Dr. Robert Davison was dishing out answers I didn't answer on my test and said I had answered that I wanted to die and was thinking of committing suicide and didn't know the difference on alcohol abuse and substance abuse.  Also, that I was dillusional and had fits and was prone to being isolated and didn't like children.  I was so shocked and pivoted with his accusations right there in his office.  I said to myself that I am definitely being scammed on.  The doctor was unethical, falsified my answers and took the old negative reports that was done on me previous in 2000 while I was in college and used it over again in 2010 as if I hadn't done a thing nor accredited my achievements and made any kind of prosperity and money.   Dr. Robert Davison was scamming on me because I was constantly on the watch for my money.  His business practice was very deceptive in which I can prove with evidence all the things he put on his report were made up.  The report that he had created was suppose to be included with Dr. David Mann's report and they both had made up something negative which made me lose my child custody case in getting my daughter.  My daughter's condition with her father and stepmom was she was often having fainting spells and week body condition especially on her knees from making her play in basketball games and other athletic activities since she was two years old non stop and she is now 12 years old.  She is in a gym almost everynight and no exposure to any social life other than her classmates and some amusement parks.  I don't know why her health conditions got that way under her father's custody but I need her more to be with me and my husband.  When my daughter and I are together we are ordered by the court to be monitored by my husband and we don't need that at all.  The doctor I got is crazy and just got some kind of cancer when he interviewed me and spreading negative things in my life when there aren't any.  Listen to me don't go to this doctor he is very sick and wants to take it out on his patients.    I then got the summarized report from Dr. David Mann in Family Law court and I had to order for another reschedule to ask Dr. Robert Davison as a witness and find out what he meant with his report.  He again lied on the stand and said that conversation on his interviews with me that never took place that was in my initial report back in 2000 was what he used over to make me loose my case and made a fool out of me.  He didn't listen to what I said nor paid attention to me at all and made things up about me.  I am the mother of my daughter that wanted to provide a better life and get her condition to have her get stronger and me more visitations as they way life should be.   Dr. Robert Davison, overcharges,falsifies answers on psychotherapy tests, unethical practice, on his treatments,falsifies reports and makes you lose your family law case.  He's a crooked doctor with cancer.

I must admit I was a little nervous but I realized that millions have had it done so what could go wrong. I meet with Dr. Allen for a consultation and the first impression of him was that I was sort of bothering him. He was not very personable, or very friendly, but at this point I already paid $300 so I was committed. The day of the surgery arrived and I went in for the procedure. Dr. Allen performed the Vasectomy which was one of the most painful things I have ever done. The pulling part was so painful I thought I was going to pass out. Now I can take the pain, that was not what bothered me the most. My main problems were two things. 1. After the surgery, Dr. Allen put a small gauze pad over the bleeding hole from the surgery and said give it about ten minutes to stop bleeding then left the room. He gave me absolutely no follow up procedures, no instructions what so ever, he just left the room. No one ever came back, here Ii am lying here fully exposed, and having no clue as to what I was supposed to do next. After about a half an hour I finally bandaged up the best I could, got dressed and went to the check out lady. Could you imagine doing that to someone, just leaving them there and walking out of the room? 2. The second thing was the amount of pain I was in for the next 6 months. The right side of my groin was killing me. I went back to him and he said it was normal, that the clip he put on was leaking and that I shouldnt worry about it. I also pointed out that I could clearly feel the metal clips and that it was worrying me. He told me I just had to give it a year or so until it calcifies over. I can still feel the clips and it still hurts. If he would of just been honest with me. I warn you all to avoid this ""doctor"" at all cost. Nobody should ever be treated like this.

I asked them why they had to be so ""anal"" about refilling my script. Tammy, as usual abusing her power, convinced the Doctor to kick me out of their office, for using the word ""anal"". That was a statement of fact! They ARE anal about filling my script. If my refill date, lands on a Saturday or Sunday, they refuse to fill my script until Monday. They will not fill my script one second early, which IS being anal. They love to make me wait for days, to get my refill, but if I want to get back to the original schedule date; forget it. I've been with this family of Doctor's since I was a child. I've never had any problems, until I encounterd Tammy. They kicked me out of their office for using the word ""anal"". They are anal about my refills. I want Tammy reprimanded. I want to be reinstated at Dr. Marshalls office. I want my prescription filled in a timely manner, when I request them. ",Doctors

Doctor (Defeat Autism Now) for an alleged ""consultation"" where this ""doctor"" decides to tell me the Doodle is not autistic, might have Lyme disease and diagnoses him with Dandy Walker, a serious malformation of the brain by looking at the same exact MRI that two other neurologists had looked at and said was Normal. She waits until the end of the agreed upon one hour consultation to tell me this--so that I am distraught enough and crying, thinking she just cracked the case with the autism and seizure disorder--and now my son might die.  So she continued the ""consultation"" and then proceeded to charge me $500 per hour for the additional two hours she went over. She never even gave my two year old a physical examination, which the consult was supposed to include. We were also supposed to get lab testing done on my baby for vitamin deficiencies, metals, toxins, food allergies, yeast build up, etc. No tests were done. I was sent away with a brown grocery bag full of lab tests to UPS off in the mail to various States--including all the paperwork.This crack pot of a Doctor also prescribed my baby two very severe anti-seizure medications on top of the two that he was already on without ever doing any blood tests to see where his existing medication levels were. When he had an adverse reaction to the new drugs which she prescribed several days later, after our consultation, she refused to come to the phone to talk to me about it unless I gave a credit card and paid her $400 per hour for a phone appointment first. I should mention, coincidentally, it wasn't until she prescribed him these new drugs and had the bad reaction--which triggered and was the beginning of his head drop seizures.After I found out she misdiagnosed my son with Dandy Walker in an attempt to alarm me and coerce me into returning for future appointments at $500 per hour, I immediately fired her, stopped payment on the credit card and reported her to the California Medical Board.So we had to prove our case to the credit card company and justify why we stopped payment on the $1687 consultation and we won our case with them, twice. They reversed the charges. I had to get letters with the second and third opinions that NO, my son did not have Dandy Walker.  Now, this delusional, unethical ""doctor"" wants her money because she is insisting she provided ""medical care""...when she never did. I've talked with other moms who had equally and similar bad experiences with this same doctor, with misdiagnosing and continually charging a credit card on file. This Doctor preys on desperate parents looking to help their children...she has no business prescribing drugs like that during a simple office consultation nor diagnosing genetic diseases without genetic testing and counseling. Because I stopped payment, she has filed a small claims action against me.  Why should I have to pay for a purposeful misdiagnosis from a doctor who moonlights as a ""massage therapist""?  She overdosed and drastically changed the course of my son's life.  I should be suing her in Superior Court for malpractice. The red flags were there and I didn't want to see them.  The fact that her office is in her living room at her home.  The fact that I never had to wait for an appointment when getting an appointment with a DAN Doctor is know to take forever.  The fact that in the 3 hours I was there the phone never rang nor did any other patients come in.  The fact that she refuses to bill insurance and demands cash or credit card at the time of service (no checks). The fact that she actually misdiagnosed myself and my mother by just looking at us...with no physical exam, history or lab testing. Be very aware and be sure to bring your stop watch to your appointment with Dr. Julie Griffith.  The meter never stops running when you are there--not even when the Dr. needs to take a bathroom break...yes, you are paying $500 an hour for that too.

Chapel Hill, North Carolina United States of America ","www.quackwatch.com, www.quackwatch.org",(919) 533-6009,"Dr Stephen Barrett MD, Quackwatch, quackwatch.com, quackwatch.org  lied that heavy metals are present and visible in the blood, and denied that they sit/hide in fatty tissue and have to be provoked out using a chelating agent, erroneously criticized Doctor's Data Inc Chapel Hill, North Carolina"," I was doing a search for urine provocation testing on the Internet and came across an article by Dr Stephen Barrett MD of Quackwatch (www.quackwatch.com/www.quackwatch.org). It showed a Doctor's Data urine provocation test result for someone with elevated levels of heavy metals in their urine. Dr Barrett was claiming that the test result was a ripoff used to defraud patients as the results had been ""artificially elevated"" using a chelating agent and were measured against ""unprovoked"" reference ranges. He also disparaged the use of chelation therapy to remove the metals and said that blood testing was the appropriate method of measurement, and that even if this showed high levels of heavy metals, then all that was necessary was to remove the ""source of the exposure"" rather than chelation therapy.Last year (2008) I had urine provocation testing with an ND in Canada that showed that I had extreme heavy metal toxicity: my mercury and lead levels were so high that they were off the chart, and I had elevated levels of aluminium and cadmium. At the time I had MS-type symptoms, both sensory and mobility. I underwent IV EDTA & DMPS + oral DMSA chelation therapy and experienced a dramatic improvement in my symptoms that related directly to the reduction in metals - a subsequent urine provocation test showed that the CT had got rid of all the lead, aluminium and cadmium + half the mercury.I sent the results + my story to Dr Stephen Barrett and received the following reply disparaging both....""The tests you sent are not evidence that you had abnormal heavy metal levels. Nor would chelation be appropriate even if they were valid. The way to determine whether chelation is indicated is a blood test. In addition, when blood levels are high, in nearly all cases, no treatment is needed -- just avoidance of the source. For most people MS has ups and downs. You attribute your improvement to the chelation. The more likely explanation is simply MS's variability.""This is NOT true! Firstly, heavy metals aren't present or visible in the blood; they sit in fatty tissue and have to be ""provoked"" out using a chelating agent so that they can be measured in the urine, which is collected for several hours afterwards and a sample sent off to a special lab: Doctor's Data Inc, which specialises in this kind of testing and is experienced, licensed and certified. DD don't/can't use provoked reference ranges because as they quite rightly say, there is no standardization in the provocation methods used by practitioners. The true test, however, is the actual measured numeric value + one's own readings over time, which always reduce with chelation therapy.Secondly, heavy metal toxicity can cause an autoimmune reaction as in MS because they replace normal molecules in the myelin sheath, causing the body to produce antibodies that attack the myelin and resulting in demyelination. It will cause identical diagnostic results to MS - lesions on an MR scan and raised level of protein in a lumbar puncture. It will also cause identicial symptoms. Chronic mercury poisoning cannot be distinguished from MS! In addition, you can't always remove the source as this is unknown. I have no dental amalgam fillings, but I do eat a lot of tuna and swordfish + lived for many years in a property with an antiquated plumbing system that was possibly slowly poisoning me. Whatever the source, the damage was done and had to be repaired, ie the heavy metal toxicity had to be removed with CT.Dr Barrett didn't/wouldn't answer my subsequent e-mails to him asking him to explain why my urine toxic metal tests that showed my mercury and lead levels as sky high weren't evidence of abnormal levels or address the fact that heavy metals sit in tissue not blood, nor comment on the link between heavy metal toxicity & MS, claiming that ""I obviously thought I knew more than he did""! I guess this is true. How can you possibly measure something in the blood that isn't there?! Blood tests only show RECENT exposure to mercury poisoning in the last 90 days.MDs are rarely able to help people with chronic illness/diseases. They are full of doom and gloom predictions, don't look for the cause, and only treat the symptoms with drastic measures and toxic drugs that tend to suppress the immune system and make you worse.NDs and alternative health practitioners look for the cause(s) on the other hand and treat with the least harmful methods. Chelation therapy is one of the best things you can ever do for yourself - it clears the arteries of toxins and metals in a very harmless way, and is very beneficial. One of its biggest uses is to bypass the need for heart bypasses. It is, however, very suppressed by the orthodox medical profession as the drugs companies have a vested interest in diagnosing people with ""lifelong incurable progressive and debilitating conditions"" so that that they can chuck drugs at you for the rest of your life. They have no interest in finding cures at all and CT doesn't offer enough financial return for them. Stephen Barrett said in the report that he wanted the FDA to step in somehow - the same FDA that approved DMSA CT as ""safe and beneficial for use in children""!All Quackwatch does is slander and defame NDs and alternative health practitioners. I have seen report after report from them using every possible method and lie to do this.

Martin my complaint, and I emailed it to her over and over. This was done because every few months that the Optometry Board was to meet, she would claim that I needed to re-send all of my information.  The board meets at least four times a year.  I shared with Wal-Mart's corporate office in Bentonville, AR the fact that Dr. Wayland had violated the Fairness to Contact Lens Wearers Act passed in 2004 by the Federal Trade Commission.Wal-Mart denied responsibility, because their optometrists are contract employees.  Consumers have no recourse against them in that regard.  To protect myself this time I called to make sure the optometrist of my choice was licensed in Georgia, had no violations and wasn't under investigation.  Although I never received a single letter or phone call (or emails) regarding my complaint, I had assumed that Anita Martin or her supervisor Jim Claiborne processed my complaint. In a call on 12/4/2009, Jim Claiborne stated that although he hadn't read my complaint, he wanted to call and tell me the board dismissed it in 2005. Wow.  A full four years ago, I was ignored and robbed and  Federal Trade Commission law was violated, but Georgia decided it wasn't important.  Jim Claiborne did explain that the complaint, which of course was summarily closed in 2005 was sent directly to the Georgia Board of Dispensing Opticians for an additional five year wait to make sure consumers are further violated.  Per Jim Claiborne, although he doesn't practice in Georgia any longer, but if an agency never calls to ask we won't share it.  That's very reassuring.I told him that it was unfair to consumers and dishonest that these boards and their members, and the Georgia employees who work there, are cheating us all.  Stalling works in Georgia and so does neglect.  He laughed and said ""..that's the process"".  He did promise to create a letter next week confirming that they didn't do anything about these outrageous acts, from 2002 to the present.   I told him no thanks and to just keep doing what they clearly do for Georgia citizens: nothing really.Lesson: Do not get glasses or contacts from Wal-Mart or their optometrists.

I asked him what the name of the center was, and he wasn't sure so I got the phone number from him and called the center to see how they would answer the phone. The woman answered ""Dr. Ramizini's office?"" I asked ""Yes...what establishment is this?"" She said ""Dr. Ramizini"". I said ""Right, but what is the name of the center?"" She raised her voice ""A CARDIOLOGIST CENTER"". I said, ""I understand that, but what is the NAME of this Cardiologist center?"" SHe raised her voice again and was aggravated, ""Florida Heart Center, anything else?""

High Wycombe, Bucks, Select State/Province United States of America ",www.buckinghamshirehospitals.nhs.uk,1492425486,"Dr Matthew Jackson, neurologist  misdiagnosed me with MS when I had heavy metal toxicity/mercury poisoning, made horrifying predictions about my outcome, tried to persuade me to attend dangerous clinical trials for personal gain High Wycombe, Bucks"," In March 1997 I was diagnosed with MS at Wycombe General Hospital in Buckinghamshire in the UK by neurologist Dr Matthew Jackson on the basis of an MRI scan followed by a lumbar puncture. He was extremely quick to make the diagnosis on the spot without considering or testing for possible alternatives, and despite the fact that his colleague who previously examined me had expressed doubt that this was the cause and had written to my GP to say so. At the time I was experiencing some sensory symptoms including paralysing cramps in my hands. Dr Jackson told me that heat would make my symptoms worse, but in actual fact the only thing that relieved them was to lie on my hands on a boiling hot electric blanket. This was cause in itself to throw doubt on the diagnosis, yet Dr Jackson chose to totally ignore this glaring fact. He gave me a three day course of intravenous methylprednisone steroid treatment, which did nothing to alleviate my sensory symptoms whatsoever. He also gave me no warning about going down the diagnostic route or how negatively the MS diagnosis would affect my life and future. On the contrary, he actively encouraged me to do this saying that there was ""lots he could do if the diagnosis was confirmed"". However, when the lumbar puncture came back positive, he told me there was ""nothing he could do"" as I'd already had the steroid treatment, so all it achieved was to blemish my medical records. If anyone asks for permission to access these, I am damned if I allow it and damned if I don't, so I am unable to register with a GP in the UK permanently. Currently my medical records are lodged with the local health authority where after 5 years they will go off site and after 10 be destroyed so that I once again have a clean bill of health. This is my only option!In addition, Dr Jackson told me to forget my plans and dreams to immigrate. He said no country would ever want me because I'd become a burden on them. He told me that I was going to end up blind, deaf, have speech problems, and be paralysed and doubly incontinent, and that I needed to join the MS Society and get used to wheelchairs and incontinence pads. He said I had MS, I'd always have MS and I'd never be able to get rid of it. As he said this, he underlined the word ""MS"" over and over in front of me, and he laughed and told me not to ""shoot the messenger"". He then wrote to my GP and said I was confused about the disease when I questioned it.I complained to Patient Services at Wycombe General Hospital about Dr Jackson's treatment of me, but was fobbed off and told that he had ""every right to say the things he did based on my diagnosis"".On top of this, he tried to persuade me to attend dangerous clinical trials for personal financial gain (1000+ in his pocket), from which several of the participants later died from CJD from contaminated blood they were given. How corrupt is that?One of the symptoms Dr Jackson made his diagnosis on was blurred vision - he said this was the ""all important 3rd symptom he needed"". However, at Windsor Eye Hospital where I was seen, specialists looked and looked endlessly at my affected eye and were so baffled that they eventually referred me to Dr Kanski, their top guy who has operated on royalty. He told me that the 1st thing they look for/suspect in a person of my age who presents with blurred vision is optic neuritis, which is often the 1st sign of MS. He said that it's easy to pick up on and my problem categorically wasn't this. After Dr Jackson diagnosed me with MS, I went back to Windsor Eye Hospital and told them what I had and the eye doctor I'd seen there said no I didn't, yet despite the fact that she wrote to him and told him this, he refused to retract the diagnosis.In spite of Dr Jackson's negative predictions I did manage to emigrate, but I continued to suffer from sensory symptoms for the next 7 years, then in June 2004 started getting mobility problems (a dropped right leg). This started deteriorating in 2006 and a further neurological attack left me unable to walk alone and with balance problems. In January 2008 I moved to Vancouver Island, Canada and made an appointment with a clinic called Woodgrove Pines in Nanaimo, who advised me to see their naturopathic doctor, Stacy Neilson. She recommended a number of tests including a urine provocation test for heavy metals as an initial computerised test showed that these were present in my body. In N America naturopathic doctors are not peripheral and ""alternative"" to orthodox medicine like they are in the UK. They undergo exactly the same medical training as regular GPs and more with their main function to look for the cause of an illness/condition, and they share many of the same rights and abilities, eg to undertake IV therapies, prescribe medication, perform minor surgery etc. There are only 7 colleges throughout N America (2 in Canada and 5 in the USA) that are regulated by the AANMC (Accredited Association for Naturopathic Medical Colleges) and offer this specialised training. Stacy went on maternity leave and my case was transferred to another clinic in Nanaimo called Arbour Wellness, where I saw a naturopathic doctor called Heather Eade. When she looked at the result of my first urine provocation test, she said that she had never seen such high levels of both mercury and lead in her whole career - they were so elevated, they were off the chart + I had elevated levels of both aluminium and cadmium, and it was no wonder I was ill + she was surprised I wasn't worse! She prescribed and administered a course of IV chelation therapy to remove the metals from my body. It got rid of all the lead, aluminium and cadmium + more than half the mercury and I experienced a dramatic improvement in my symptoms, ie the reduction in heavy metals correlated directly to my improvement in symptoms. A few weeks prior to having the chelation therapy, I had lost the use of my left leg too + a lot of the strength in both my legs, but within a couple of weeks of finishing the chelation therapy treatment I had regained this. The second urine provocation test result showed that I needed more chelation therapy, so I went on to have another course of it. The urine provocation tests were sent to a lab called Doctor's Data Inc in Illinois, USA that specialises in this testing. It is licensed, certified and recognised throughout N America for its high credibility (trustworthiness and expertise). It is not affiliated to any particular clinic. Because heavy metals sit/hide in fatty tissues, they are generally not visible in ordinary GP blood or urine tests, but need to be ""provoked"" out using a chelating agent like EDTA, DMPS or DMSA and measured in the urine over several hours. This is a well known fact and there is a famous case of a Canadian called Ken Presner who was misdiagnosed with MS and who also cured himself of his symptoms with chelation therapy following a urine provocation test that revealed he had extreme heavy metal toxicity.Before I went to Canada I was being overseen by an ex GP who has MS himself, Dr Lawrence of Dietary Research in Wales. He used to prescribe LDN (low dose naltrexone) for me. At high doses (50mg) naltrexone is used by recovering heroin addicts, but at low doses of 3 - 4.5mg it has had amazing results with MS sufferers. However, I took it for 10 months to no avail - it did nothing for me. Even before I had the urine provocation tests, Dr Lawrence maintained that I was very untypical of someone with MS because of my strong reaction to his zinc taste test. He was so surprised by my reaction that he sent me another test via a practitioner that he was associated with. It was a blind test - I had to identify the zinc out of 3 liquids, which I did immediately. Even the practitioner wasn't let in on which liquid was the zinc taste test and was just instructed to pass the result on to Dr Lawrence. Dr Lawrence also said that my high heat tolerance was very untypical of an MS sufferer - I still sleep every night on a boiling hot electric blanket and it greatly improves/relieves my symptoms. In 2007 he wrote a letter to my then GP stating how unusual both of these were in his experience. He has tested 100s of people with MS and all of them without exception (he has about 600 on his database) have a zinc deficiency + they all have an intolerance to heat. In addition, a zinc deficiency and heat intolerance are commonly associated with MS sufferers in general. In the letter he questioned whether I could have something else other than MS and asked the doctor to conduct further investigations. In the face of the overwhelming evidence of my heavy metal toxicity, as well as the dramatic improvement I experienced in my symptoms after the first course of chelation therapy and the fact that I have not had a single neurological attack since all the metals were removed and there is no evidence of auto immune disease in my family, Dr Lawrence now believes 100% that I do not have MS, nor could the heavy metal toxicity have triggered it. He believes that I was misdiagnosed and the medically trained naturopathic doctors in Canada also told me that I was misdiagnosed. They said I had been ""overlooked"" by the medical system in the UK.I have no dental amalgam fillings and it is likely that I contracted the heavy metal poisoning from the antiquated plumbing system in the very old family property - my father also has classic symptoms of mercury poisoning including atherosclerosis + my mother died of breast cancer and my sister has premature arthritic symptoms, but was lucky enough to leave the property before they got any worse. The tendency for heavy metals to sit/hide in fatty tissues is a possible explanation as to why more women are diagnosed with MS than men, ie because women generally have more fatty tissue than men, which leads me to question how many other women have been misdiagnosed with MS at great and needless expense to the NHS and benefits system, let alone the personal effects on them and their families. Personally, the damage caused to me physically, psychologically, emotionally, financially and careerwise by the misdiagnosis is phenomenal.The similarities between MS & mercury poisoning have been medically proven. They show conclusively that mercury poisoning is a total mimicker for MS and that heavy metal toxicity is what I had, not MS. I quote....Multiple Sclerosis is a nervous system disorder that results in myelin destruction. Mercury poisoning has also been proven to cause myelin destruction!MS is very difficult to diagnose. Part of the diagnosing procedure for MS is to rule out mimics of the disease. Yet Dr Jackson DID NOT do this even though MS symptoms are identical to mercury poisoning. Chronic mercury toxicity (which is what I had) cannot be distinguished from MS. Mercury sits/hides in the tissues and has to be provocated out by a chelating agent in order to be measured.People who have been known to have mercury poisoning showed elevated levels of protein in spinal fluids. Spinal protein levels are also elevated in people with MS. Mercury has been found in the spinal fluid of MS patients. In fact 8 times more mercury is found in the spinal fluid of MS patients than in the spinal fluid of those without MS.I summarise.... Mercury poisoning causes identical symptoms to MS, and can cause lesions on MRI scans and raised levels of protein in the CSF fluid, both of which Dr Jackson used to diagnose me with MS. If heavy metal toxicity can mimic MS and is curable by chelation therapy, then testing for it FIRST BEFORE diagnosing MS should have been an automatic procedure on his part.In a nutshell, Dr Jackson misdiagnosed me with MS when I had heavy metal toxicity and without eliminating this possibility first. He also ignored my high heat tolerance and the fact that I did not have optic neuritis - 2 key factors that should have led him to doubt/question the MS diagnosis. In addition, he gleefully made horrifying predictions about my outcome on the basis of a disease that it has now been proved I never had and tried to persuade me attend dangerous clinical trials from which several participants subsequently died for personal financial gain. Dr Jackson is negligent, profit motivated and unprofessional. He has several other complaints against him for his behaviour, yet nothing has been done about it and he is still working at Wycombe Hospital.

I got my fiance a gift certificate at Shape Wellness (www.shapemed.com) about a year ago.  After redeeming it, that's when hell broke loose.  It began with a few followup calls we received from Mark McKenna, after which it led to a complete stalking case, reported with the Atlanta Police Department.  To protect her, I pulled public records from the Buckhead precinct on Dr. Stanton Mark McKenna and I couldn't believe what I found!!!  He's been arrested numerous times for stalking and he even gave a girl a BLACK EYE!  It was in the special notes section of a police report from early 2009!!!  I recently received threatening texts from 504-451-5665 and, as expected, it's registered to Mark McKenna.  DO NOT fall for the scam of this ((REDACTED)) and the trap he has created in the form of a medical practice.  He is not afraid of getting arrested.  The board will review and probably reject his license shortly.",Doctors

DO NOT USE HIM!!! Annandale, Virginia"," He was recommended by a friend. My wife and I went to see him about her getting a forehead lift. After meeting him and discussing the procedure in June 2007, we thought he was the right doctor for this procedure. July 9, 2007 my wife went under the knife. Well after my wife had the surgery and the swelling went done, my wife and I were shocked to see the result. There had been little or no change at all in her appearance whatsoever. She looked exactly the same as she had looked before going in under the knife. We were furious and very disappointed. Not only because we paid almost was $10,000 for this procedure, but my wife was also in a lot of pain for sometime afterwards. When my wife went in for her first post surgery check up, I brought it to the doctors attention that we could see no change to my wifes forehead at all. Dr. French tried to prove to us that the procedure was successful, but when he turned and reached for the before pictures of my wife he knew he had made a mistake. Instead of him showing us the before pictures as proof that the procedure was a success, he just quietly stuck them in the folder and continued the conversation with doubletalk and giving us the run around. He would not admit that we were correct and that he had made a mistake. But he stated that he would redo the procedure again and we would have to pay only for the anesthesiologist who would come out to $1,800 and the hospital stay.Now I wonder why he would want to redo the procedure. If it was done correctly the first time there would be no reason to go back and do it a second time. And nothing to redo!!My wife did not want to go through the whole ordeal again and declined his offer. What we decided to do was, file a lawsuit to recoup the monies for her cosmetic surgery, but after much consideration, my wife decided not to pursuit the lawsuit against him, but rather except the offer they had made to refund us the $2,375 to settle this dispute. When my attorney, Ed Tolchin contacted his office back regarding the settlement they denied ever making us this offer.  ","  Plastic Surgeons, Doctors "

										I recently used Dr. Ken Best for his chiropractic services because a friend of mine recommended him to me. I met him in an amazing upscale  office overlooking the La Brea tar pits on Wilshire Blvd, and was impressed by all of the fancy equipment.When i sat down to talk with him he went off into a 30 minute rant about some other service he performs called Thetahealing, which apparently is the use of prayer to cure cancer - I started to get the feeling that he was less of a doctor and more of a nutcase, but felt compelled to stay a little longer just to hear humor him. I stayed for the entire speech, and even let him do an initial exam / chiropractic adjustment on me. BIG MISTAKE. Apparently he is about as competent as a chiropractor as he is sane. I later found out that the only reason my friend had recommended that I see Ken Best was because they were involved in some kind of relationship - GO FIGURE! Only in West Hollywood...

Keller Northshore Hair Transplant Deerfield NorthShore Hair Transplant Complaint and Rip-off.  No Results.  Biggest Mistake of my life. Deerfield, Illinois"," I had a hair transplant procedure done by Dr. Richard S. Keller at North Shore Hair Transplant Specialists, LLC, which is located in Deerfield, IL. That was the worst decision that I ever made. I am so disappointed with the final results and all the pain and suffering that they have caused me.When I went  to North Shore Hair Specialists, LLC. for the first time to have a consultation, North Shore Hair Specialists LLC. representatives showed me pictures of prior patients with their past and present pictures. I told them to show me pictures of people that were in the same condition that I was before the surgery and there results a year later. By looking at those pictures, I was impressed. The pictures of those patients showed a full head of hair after the surgery. I asked the representatives how many strands they had added on those people and they told me that it was close to 2000. From looking at the density of my hair from the back, they assured me that it would produce more than 2000 strands. They also told me that any additional strand after the 2000 mark that they add will be free. When, I met with Dr. Keller, he assured me that he could get more than 2000 strands added to my head from looking at the density from the back of my head. He also told me that there would be no problem covering the entire bald area of my head with hair. After hearing all of this, I came to the decision of having this procedure done.Was that a huge mistake. After the surgery, they brought to my attention that they only put a little over 1700 strands on my head. They only covered one-third of my head. The density of t resemblance  he hair is noto what Dr. Keller showed me and what I was promised. If you take a look at my head where the hair restoration was performed, you can still see all the bald area. The bald area stands out more now.I went back after the surgery for follow up and always brought up the question: Where is the hair that you promised me. I even challenged Dr. Keller and his representative to use my before and after pictures on their advertisements and website, but received no positive response.  Now they want me to come back for another Transplant.Dr. Richard S. Keller, his staff, and North Shore Hair Specialists, LLC. are a disgrace to the hair restoration profession. I would strongly discourage anyone from going to Dr. Keller.  It will be the worst decision of your life.  ",Doctors

Lara Hastings is shallow and divisive, forming her thoughts as fits her
deranged whims and dismal and distorted psychoanalytic world view. Lara
Hastings needs a long and extended detox period to come to reality, something
we dont know if she has ever known. I know parents who have been harmed by Lara Hastings and she is going to get what comes around from what she has sent
around over the last several years. Lara Hastings sees no good especially when she is doing someone a ""favor"" by crafting a bad report on the opponent. When doing a colleague a ""favor,"" Lara Hastings goes into her counseling session with the end in mind and builds her case to come to that desired conclusion. Lara Hastings seems to have the ability to
contrive a thousand negative things out of one little act or gesture and
completely over-react to something between a parent and a child. Lara is very inequitable in that she only hears from one side of the situation and forms her opinions and reports accordingly. Has Lara ever heard the phrase ""There are two sides to every story""? That common sense wisdom would do her better than her degree obviously. Lara Hastings never
seems to be able to factor in the overwhelming affect of the PAS (parental alienation
syndrome) of the conservator parent which in itself leaves her inept in
discerning correctly. It seems obvious that Lara Hastings has no healthy
relationships to speak of in her own personal life nor does she have any personal parenting
experience which should in itself disqualify her from making assessments of
parents and children. Parenting isnt learned in psychology books that were
written to justify the existence of a profession or professional qwacks. Its
all for greed, with no regard to the lives they are grinding up in their murderous
mill which is enacted with the stroke of their keyboards. Reaping is a law that
comes around and sadly, Lara Hastings has got some reaping to do for her unfair
and untruthful dealings. Counselor Lara Hastings has been known to do favors for
others by building biased reports. This is criminal.Common sense goes a long way in life and Lara Hastings seems to lack it.
Lara Hastings gave over $1,800 to the Obama campaign which alone classifies her
as a person who has no clue in life. I guess you could say that the dishonest
vote for their own kind. Any person who cannot see how dishonest Obama is,
hasnt an ounce of insight into human beings, so how in the world can they see
into the lives of those they observe in counseling sessions? The majority of those who voted for this man have since regretted it
due to his not keeping any of his promises, the ones he made in order
to get their vote. Lara Hastings cannot be trusted as a credible witness. I want to highly suggest that you avoid Lara
Hastings Psy.D. She tries to come off with a professional demeanor as she hides behind her
degree and clinical experience. Lara puts herself off as being fair while hiding her murky, miserable disposition
behind a thin veil. Lara Hastings doesnt think twice about trampling the
rights of parents by making up things about them which in turn destroys their
relationship with their children. This is nothing short of pure evil. At best
Lara Hastings has a slanted, skewed outlook and tries to justify her existence
by how much wrong she can come up with, even though most of it is merely imagined
in her own darkened mind. Lara Hastings degree didnt teach her honesty,
integrity and respect, because thats a decision the individual has to make and
Lara has not decided to do so yet in her life and is leaving behind her a trail
of broken lives. Anyone with insight beyond the surface can soon see these
things for themselves in Lara Hastings. I want to encourage you to have nothing to do with Lara
Hastings Psy.D. of Dallas, Texas. Degrees don't mean anything if a person isn't honest. Lara Hastings is a doctor of destruction who does nothing to help bring healing and bring families together. Instead, she extracts every iota of imagined evil and wrong that she can possibly dream up out of situations.If you have been maligned by Lara Hastings of Dallas, Texas, please speak up so others can be warned.

										I have been a patient with this health care provider for about 11 years.  When I switched my insurance companies I found I had a co-pay of about 20 dollars a visit. Each time I went in I would see ""Co-pays due at time of visit"" signs through out the office. I came prepared and was never asked for the co-payment, I would then ask and told over and over ""I cant give you a total I have to wait for the paperwork, dont worry wait for the bill."" I dont have much money so I kept asking to pay only one time was my co-payment accepted. Later I was told I had a couple outstanding bills, I went into billing after being told I couldn't be seen until I had made arrangements, I filled out paper work and was happy to find my bill was reduced to 38 dollars and I had a clean slate. Months later I was told they had missed bills and I still had a balance. Never once was I told I took both my kids to be seen I was being seen over 3 times a month. So once again I go into to the NEW billing department made arrangements AGAIN started to pay and low and behold I find that the office had closed for a time. I tried calling the billing office in Angles Camp no response. I got a bill for over 2,000 dollars so I called again only to get messages that they were on a furlough. So I waited.....and once again was bombarded with calls requesting money, I was in the middle of a series of appointments for my dental work when half way through I was told to make a payment or they couldnt fix my teeth one of which they had pulled. I had just paid 40 dollars and was only asked to pay 20 a month, I had made my commitment I was shocked while they made a scene of calling Tamera to open my acct. Since then I have been cornered during my childrens well child check ups, Had phone calls over a 9.86$ bill. They sent me to two collection agency's as well as continued to call me themselves.  I was told they were trying to see who could and would collect first. This company goes above and beyond to make your life horrible if you owe even a penny. If it wasnt for the doctors and nurses I would have never put up with this.

It was a bluff and it worked. They obtained this information by FRAUD and I believe that a crime has taken place.
Furthermore, a letter was written for Jones by his attorney. In it, she stated she (Keisler) should be granted access to the children's records, and that ""No other person other than their mother should be granted access to such records without a proper notarized authorization signed by me or her."" This necessarily precluded my husband from gaining access to these records. I was never told until recently that I could have signed so that my husband could obtain access to his account.

										THIS SO-CALLED PSYCHIATRIST IS CRAZY!!! 
I REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE GIVING THE VERY LENGTHY DETAILS BUT I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT OUR LAST MEETING.  IT TOOK ME AWHILE TO REALIZE THAT HE HAD ME COME IN TO SEE HIM FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN TO ABUSE ME AND THEREBY ""GET RID OF ME!""  DURING THIS ABUSE, I REPEATEDLY SAID THAT, ""I DID NOT COME HERE TO ARGUE WITH YOU.""
I WILL TELL YOU THAT DURING EACH OF OUR MEETINGS, HIS PERSONALITY WAS DIFFERENT, (BUT CONSISTENTLY UNCONVENTIONAL, AN UNDERSTATEMENT!, BARE FEET! 2 HRS. RE. CHAKRAS, AND MUCH MORE). 
ANYWAY, ON OUR LAST MEETING HE REFUSED ME FURTHER TREATMENT FOR NO LOGICAL REASON. TWICE, I ASKED HIM IF HE COULDN'T AT LEAST REFER ME TO ANOTHER PHYSICIAN TO HELP ME WITH MY MEDS, (I WAS OUT OF 3 OUT OF 4, NO, I'M NOT CRAZY, JUST DEPRESSED.)  AND TWICE HE RESPONDED IN A CRAZED SADISTIC MANNER, ""NO, YOU'RE SCREWED!""
ONE OF THE MANY RIDICULOUS THINGS THAT HE ATTACKED ME FOR WAS THAT I DID NOT TAKE MY VALIUM CORRECTLY.  HE HAD PRESCRIBED ""UP TO 3 10 MG. VALIUM PER DAY AS NEEDED.  MY RESPONSE WAS THAT I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WAS ""BAD"" TO TAKE LESS THAN 30 MG. PER DAY.  GOOD GRIEF THAT AMOUNT WOULD HAVE KEPT ME ASLEEP 24/7!!!
EVEN THOUGH HE REFUSED ME ANY CONSTRUCTIVE HELP AND EVEN THOUGH I MADE IT CLEAR THAT VALIUM WAS ALL I HAD LEFT OF MY MEDS AND PLENTY OF IT AT THAT; TWO DAYS LATER, HE OKAYED A REFILL OF 100 10MG. VALIUM, KNOWING FULL WELL THAT I WAS FEELING SUICIDAL!  
HE HAD ATTEMPTED A VERY DANGEROUS TREATMENT ON ME, (AMPHETAMINES AND A MAOI), THAT NEARLY KILLED ME. WAS THAT PART OF HIS ERRATIC BEHAVIOR?
HE REFUSED TO RETURN MY VERY DISTRESSED PHONE CALLS, (FOR 2 AND A HALF WEEKS), UNTIL I INFORMED HIM VIA ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGE THAT I HAD CONTACTED THE STATE MEDICAL BOARD.  HE THEN SENT A CERTIFIED LETTER ON THE SAME DAY THAT INCLUDED A PACKFUL OF 'COVER-MY-REAR' LIES.  I WAS LIVID!
IT IS AGAINST THE LAW FOR HIM TO LEAVE ME WITHOUT A REFERRAL AND TO REFUSE TO PROVIDE ME WITH MEDS UNTIL I CAN MEET WITH THE NEXT PHYSICIAN.  THIS IS REFERRED TO AS ABANDONMENT. 
I SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION, I AM NOT DELUSIONAL.  I BELIEVE WHOLEHEARTEDLY THAT THIS MAN IS SERIOUSLY ILL.  HE ALMOST PUSHED ME TO SUICIDE, (WITH WHAT I'VE MENTIONED HERE AND MORE); I'D LIKE TO STOP HIM BEFORE HE DOES SERIOUS AND/OR IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO SOMEONE.  THE STATE BOARD TAKES 3 TO 6 MONTHS FOR A REVIEW AND OF COURSE THEIR BIAS, (MOST ESPECIALLY IN A PSYCHIATRIC CASE), IS TOWARDS THE PHYSICIAN.

They told me the charges would be cleared.  Due to the fact that I had my GP and a Specialist who attended me through emergency service and surgury.
The bill was for March 15,2001.
In January we received another bill stating that no attention has be paid to this charge.  Dr. Slutsky's billing complained ""No reply to United HealthCare claim Zero payment"". Service at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital.
Again, I called an 800 number on the bill and Marie told me she would look into the matter and get back to me.  The Hospital has no record of this doctor.

										Let's see, where to begin. I was injured on the job. A very well qualified doctor gave me an impairment rating based on injuries sustained on the job.
The beloved State of Texas (creeps) worker's comp. disputed the rating (their right) and sent me to THEIR doctor who gave me a very low and different rating. His words were the injuries are pre-existing. Now, granted ALL the doctors that I have seen and all the diagnostic tests clearly show that they are NOT pre-existing.
I am now having to use an attorney to fight this creep. His assistant even had the gall to say that no one ever comes out of here with a rating higher than a 15%. Now the state has to pay more if a person has a higher rating than a 15. 
It is quit clear to me that this Doctor Howard Bernstein out of Houston and travels all across Texas clealy works in conjunction with the insurance company.
I even found a site where the doctors are TRAINED to be against the patient. What kind of scam is the workers compensation of Texas running anyway. Blows me away.
I will continue to fight this and will post names addresses phone numbers etc later.
If any of you out there are injured in the state of texas, if the name of this doctor ever comes up and you have to go to him, either ask for another one, take a friend or take a tape recorder. This guy is a sorry excuse for a doctor.
He doesn't have the knowledge to evaluate a fly, let alone a real injured person. That reminds me of an old saying, ""those who can do, those who can't do impairment ratings"".
FYI: These doctors get a thousand dollars a pop for this. Can you imagine, seeing 10 patients a day? That's $10,000 a day. Do the math.

Two min. later they call us ,at this time my husband has not eaten in 28 days nothing but milk(due to severe thrush). 
I'm having my husband genetically tested. His mental stability is maintained by meds.They denied him his meds and two hours later i went to the restroom when I get back I get told that my husband is being put in a stress center.They told me there was no reason for them to admit him medically.
Iguess not being able to eat becouse of the thrush for 28 days and the spinal headache wasnt enought.They denied him his meds for two hours and then he started talking out of his head.

I signed a paper to have my local GP sent the test results. They did not send them. My file was sent to medical records (as though I was never there). I personally had to call the medical records office at the clinic and ask the person in charge to fax the recults to my GP. They could not do that until I signed a release (which I signed when I checked in the clinic at the betginning). So, I call my local GP and they faxed a request to the medical records office and got the results (I could have had these tests done locally, duh!).

He puts patients on heavy narcotics then abruptly stops treating them. His staff is rude and hostile towards patients and will not relay any message to the doctor regarding your care. 
He sees workman's comp patients, and his treatment is heavy narcotics but he doesn't cycle patients down, he just cuts patients off, stops treatment and will not help to find alternatives to help.

I faxed Dr. McEachern a record release form the day before discharge, and the attending physcian even called his office to make sure the records would be forwarded to the new doctor asap, so she would have accurate information about my son's ongoing conditions. We were told by his office staff that there would be no problem.
Upon getting to the new doctors office, we were confronted with a fax from Dr. McEacherns staff, stating that the records would not be forwarded because of an outstanding balance on our account. THIS IS A TOTAL LIE!!!!! There is and was no balance on our account, it is a ploy by Dr. McEachern to ""GET BACK AT US"" for firing him.
Withholding medical records of a sick infant for ANY REASON, is both unethical according to the AMA and illegal according to state and federal law. My son can not to this day get the proper medical care because of the information Dr. McEachern is withholding for no reason! I have reported him to the AMA and The Department of Health Professions for his unethical and illegal accts.
It is my opinion that NO ONE should trust in this doctors medical care if he can't even follow the first line of the oath he took ""FIRST DO NO HARM""

										Glenn Kawesch is a ruthless dishonest greedy LASIK surgeon.  He declares everyone a perfect candidate just so that he can get his dirty hands on your eyes and your wallet.  He was disciplined for Medicare fraud back in 1997, but that did not stop him from his greedy ways.  LASIK came along and he found a new cash cow. He has been brought to court more than 20 times and he has settled a lot of them to keep things quiet.  
The Attorney General of California and the Medical Board wanted to revoke his license but a judge who did not know how many victims' lives he had ruined decided to give him the benefit of the doubt.  So now he continues his rampant surgery.  It used to be maybe one person every 10 minutes like cows heading to slaughter.  When I went to him he assured me I was a perfect candidate, that LASIK was better for me than PRK.  
Then right after the surgery when I had terrible headaches due to dry eyes they did not do anything. I had to figure everything out for myself and it was a very terrible experience I do not wish for anyone.  He also assured me that the LASIK flap heals in 24 hours.  Well Glenn Kawesch, if it did heal in 24 hours how the hell were you able to lift it back up after three months. Liar. Cheater. Stealer. Mangler.  
You do not deserve to be called doctor.  Remember the Hippocratic oath?  Do no harm?  Yeah right.  Glenn Kawesch has also had his offices searched and investigated by the IRS.  He has also been scolded by former San Diego Mayor Susan Golding for improperly using her image for his marketing purposes.  
Oh yeah, I almost forgot how his salespeople use hard sale tactics to close the deal on you when you are still deciding whether you even want the surgery or not. I believe Glenn Kawesch has also been part of a paternity suit.  His methods are so incompetent, and careless and show no regard for the welfare of his patients.  All he cares about is the welfare of his bank account.
If you ever ever come across this guy, stay away. Go to the more reputable clinics like the Shiley Eye Center is San Diego.  But most of all, think twice about LASIK eye surgery. There are other alternatives like PRK that might be better for some people.
Glenn Kawesch's assistants don't look like doctors, they look like butcher's assistants, or a pirate's gang.  Caveat emptor.  BUYER BEWARE!!!

Phoenix, Arizona U.S.A. ",,602-254-5777,"Dr. Norman Fernando - Norm M. Fernando MD Pulmonologist Threw me out after 2 visits, Refuses to give me or the police my medical records ripoff Phoenix Arizona","
										I was referred to Dr. Norman M. Fernando, M.D. when I had a bad cough for over 3 weeks, and a positive skin test for tuberculosis. My first appointment with Dr. Fernando was April 16, 2004. When he first came into the room, he started off by saying ""I thought I saw someone beautiful in my waiting room"".  He made more comments about my looks throughout our visit. He asked if I am married. If I am happily married. 
Dr. Fernando seemed very personable, and had a lot of time to spend with me. He told me about the medication Isoniazid, how it used to be used in sanitariums which housed people with tuberculosis, to treat them for depression. Then they saw that the medication was curing tuberculosis, and they still use the medication today. He told me about a lady he knew in medical school who took the medication. She was very nice when he met her. But when she was off the medication she turned into a witch. 
It was nice of him to calm me with his stories, but I was more interested in talking about my health, my positive TB skin test, my asthma, the side effects of Isoniazid, which he prescibed to me for 9 months, and my cough and other symptoms. He had me lay down and he felt my stomach. He commented on how nice and thin my stomach was. Then when he pulled his hand away, his hand brushed against my left breast. I don't know if this was an accident or intentional on his part. He pulled up a chair and sat closely while we talked. He asked if I ever had a peak flow breathing test and I said no. He said he would not do it that day because of my cough. He said he would do it our next appointment. 
I knew a lot about TB before I went into his office because I had already went to the Center of Disease Control downtown looking for answers, and I had done some reading online. He asked me if I was a nurse, or if I had ever been one. I said no. I was still very worried about the positive TB skin test. I already had a chest x-ray which showed I did not have active TB. Dr. Frenando explained to me I came in contact with someone who had active TB and I breathed it in, and that's why he was going to give me Isoniazid for 9 months. There was a chance that TB could become active if I didn't take that medication. he said my cough was either a bad virus or an upper respiratory infection, and he gave me a sample pack of  Zithromax Tri-Pak. He did not tell me that hepatitis is a possible side effect of Isoniazid, I found this out online after our visit. He did tell me that he would have my liver checked on my next appointment in 6 weeks. He asked if I had ever been on Methylprednisone. 
I told him I was taking it at that time, from my primary care doctor, and I had taken it in 2003. He asked if it worked. I told him it worked in 2003, but this time it wasn't working. He said that was strange, because it usually helps asthma. He asked me the dose. I told him the 4mg on a card. He said he did not like those. He told me to continue with my inhalers prescribed by my primary care. He did not mention my nebulizer, I don't know if he read that I was using a nebulizer. I returned May 28 2004 at 2pm. This time my son was in the waiting room. I did not want to talk beautiful this visit. 
When Dr. Fernando came into the room he said, ""I thought I saw someone beautiful in my waiting room"". I said 6 weeks was long for me to wait, I have been in distress. He said all you have to do is call. I said ok. My memory is not so good so I wrote down all the problems I have been having related to my breathing. I started to tell him that I was sick all of April with the virus or upper respiratory infection we talked about at our last visit, and he did not remember me being sick at our last visit. 
Then he started to get angry. The papers I had with me were my own personal record of what has been happening regarding my health. I only wanted to read him my symptoms. He said he is not going to listen to 3 pages of ramblings. He took the papers from my hands and said he was having them photocopied. I asked him to please not have them copied but he left with them anyways. 
As he was leaving the room and shutting the door I could hear him say, ""Oh boy! We have a real crazy in here"". I wondered if my son in the waiting room could hear him also. Then Dr. Fernando returned to the room without my papers. He asked my symptoms, but I was sort of in shock that he would take my personal papers and call me names, and I was crying. And without my papers I couldn't think of my symptoms anymore. All I could say was I get short of breath when I walk my dog. I couldn't think of any more at that time. And the doctor seemed to get more angry, like I was wasting his time. I wanted to tell him the order that my breathing trouble started. 
In 2003 I had pneumonia, then in April of 2004 after the virus or upper respiratory infection went away, my breathing never returned to normal. This really made him mad. He quickly rushed me back for an x-ray. Then a lady came in and did the breathing test. I was still crying. The doctor came back in to tell me my breathing is better than a normal female of my age, and commented on my age. Saying you're 30? Wow!! Then, the x-rays were ready and he showed me. He said no scarring. He said I never had pneumonia in 2003, he said I was lying. (I have the x-rays with me right now from the Urgent Care that show I did have pneumonia in 2003.) Then he said he is writing a letter to my primary care doctor that he will not see me anymore, and they will have to find me another pulmonologist. 
I went back into the room. I asked if he was going to talk to me anymore and he said No. So I got my 11 year old son from the waiting room wondering if he heard anything that happened and we left. I never got my liver checked that day. 
On June 14 2004 I went into Dr. Fernando's office to get my medical records. The lady at the desk told me ok and to have a seat and wait after getting my name. I waited 10 minutes. Then she called me back up and said it is their policy never to release records to the patient. I told her it is the law. She told me it is up to the doctor and she took my phone number and told me Dr. Fernando would call me. I called the police to ask what I should do. The dispatcher told me to wait there. She told me not to go inside Dr. Fernando's office anymore. She said it is illegal for the doctor to keep my records from me and she said she will send an officer out right away. She said my call is top priority, other than emergency calls. I waited over an hour and a half outside and it was 107 degrees. 
The police came, and the doctor refused to give them the records. The police told me Dr. Fernando told them I could go to my primary care doctor and they would give me the records. So I drove to my primary care doctor, and they said it is illegal to give me records from a doctor that is not in their office.  They told me if he wants to do things that way, I will have to submit my request in writing. 
So I called the police and told them what happened. the dispatcher told me the HIPPA laws are new, which might be why the officers did not enforce them and make the doctor hand over my records. She told me to return to outside of his office and wait again. I waited as long as I could, almost 2 hours this time. I could not take the heat anymore, and I returned home without meeting the officers there. The dispatcher told me I could have an officer get my records for me Monday - Friday 9am - 7pm. It did not have to be that day if I had medical problems and could not take the heat. 
So the next day,  June 15 2004, I typed a letter and printed it out, requesting my medical records. I stopped at a store and made copies. I called the police because they told me not to try to go into the doctor's office alone. When the officer arrived, he went into the office, I waited outside. he came out and told me that Dr. Fernando is not going to give me my records. Then a lady came out and she was very angry. She said that I  have had the police call Dr. Fernando 4 times and this has to stop. The officer told her I didn't have the police call him. The lady told me and the officer that all I have to do is go to my primary care doctor and get my records. 
This made the police officer mad at me. He said why don't I just do that. I told him I already went there and they can't give them to me. Dr. Fernando has to give them to me. The officer said that Dr. Fernando had a change of heart and I should just go to my primary care. When I tried to hand the lady my letter requesting my medical records, she pushed it back at me. She would not accept it. Dr. Fernando told the police officer he is refusing to see me because I am not sick, there is nothing wrong with me. The lady then said I can't have access to my medical records because Dr. Fernando thinks I have a mental problem. 
During May 28, 2004 visit, I wanted to talk to Dr. Fernando about a borderline EKG that I had done not long before my visit with him. I was concerned this might be a reason for my shortness of breath. He listened to my heart for about 10 seconds, maybe less, then he said, ""That's what I thought, you're too young to have heart problems"". I also wanted to talk with him about a brain tumor or cyst I have recently been diagnosed with, to see if this might be a reason for some dizziness I have been having. 
After everything that took place, I didn't want to talk about it anymore, but I had the report sitting next to me. He picked it up and looked at it. He said, ""Oh, this is just about your brain lesion, I don't need this"". And he put it back down on the table next to me. Also, on June 15, when I was standing outside with the police officer, Dr. Fernando sent a lady outside to tell me not to call the police anymore. She said right in front of the officer that Dr. Fernando thinks I have a mental problem. 
This was very embarrassing to me. I don't understand why Dr. Fernando did not give me his reason for denying me my medical records in writing. This was a private matter to me. I was not expecting a confrontation with anyone from his office. I waited outside on the sidewalk, not on his property. And I did not park my car on his property. I did not enter his office anymore after Dr. Fernando's secretary told me she would not give me my records. The lady that Dr. Fernando sent outside to talk to me also told me in front of the officer that what I had with Dr. Fernando was a consultation only, Not a regular office visit. I asked why he was prescribing me tuberculosis medication and giving me antibiotic samples at a consultation, and she talked loud, so the officer could not hear me, when I tried to speak. The officer said that Dr. Fernando told him I never had tuberculosis. 
I tried to explain I only had a positive skin test, and what the lady at the Center for Disease Control told me about having latent tuberculosis not active tuberculosis, but the lady talked real loud, so the officer could not hear me. The officer just repeated that he is the doctor, and he said I was not sick at all. Dr. Fernando revealed my private medical history to the police, who were just there to help me get my records, and made speculations about my mental health, or if he did read what I filled out, he revealed my private medical information to the police. He kept sending me to my primary care office to get my records from them, knowing that my primary care doctor cannot give me those records. He told this to the police also, several times. I had the letter requesting either my records, or a written statement why Dr. Fernando was denying to give me my records, but instead, this lady that Dr. Fernando sent out of his office pushed my letter and would not accept it, and told me and the officer I had mental problems and that's why Dr. Fernando will not give me my records. I would like this statement in writing from Dr. Fernando.

										My seriously ill mother was recently dumped by her team of physicians simply because they are tired of the inconveniences of dealing with her nursing home. They had heretofore been my heroes, treating her successfully for decades and extending her life beyond my expectations. Suddenly, they jettisoned her, (my notice was an impersonal letter) and then me (also a longtime patient) because I sent a letter of complaint. They simply told me to call the Academy of Medicine to get a list of new doctors.
Whatever happened to the concept of dedication, loyalty and lifelong bond established between patient and physician? Below read the heartfelt letter I sent to the doctors.  I also filed a complaint with the Ohio State Medical Licensing Board.
Northwest Ohio Medicine, Inc.
Drs. Horowitz, Markowicz and Bourey
Dear Doctors,
I write to implore you to consider the plight of your longtime patient, my mother, and to reconsider your decision to discontinue caring for her. Your blanket policy of discontinuing care to all nursing home residents unfortunately impacts my mother (and, by extension, me) in the most serious way possible.
You have treated my mother successfully, to say the least, for decades.  That you would jetison her now, at this stage in her life when she needs you most, is unthinkable to me. You are literally my peace of mind. Although I have long distrusted the entire medical community, you three physicians have stood apart as heroes (and I do not use that term lightly) to us both.  To say that you have saved her life on occasions too numerous to count is an understatement.  
In the decades of care you have provided her, you have extended and improved her life beyond my expectations.  For this, you know that you have my deepest gratitude; however, if you were able to accept my continuing expressions of thanks and love in those previous decades, I believe you should, sadly, be able to bear my sincerest expressions of despair and desperation at these moments of abandonment and betrayal.
You alone have the most intimate knowledge of my mother's serious and complicated medical conditions, including CHF, stroke, breast cancer and bipolar disease.  Even if another physician could be aprised of her conditions sufficiently (and please note that none I have contacted thus far are accepting new patients), none would be remotely acceptable to me at the time when she should find herself needing critical hospital care.
I would also like to remind Dr. Horowitz that at the time of my mother's first, and very serious heart attack, it was you who advised me to remove her from her apartment and place her in Darlington House. This I did immediately, with the understanding that she would still be receiving treatment from you all.  The Jewish community has abandoned my mother through the sale of Darlington House and the quality of her care there has declined enormously.  Now you have declined to treat her, and I feel particularly saddened and bitterly dismayed by our community's betrayal of its elderly. What would you have done, Dr. Horowitz, if your mother had faced similar circumstances?
As you know, my mother is quite ambulatory (thank you) and can still visit you in your offices. Whatever inconveniences you may have experienced due to nursing home protocols can be bypassed, I believe, by me, her closest local caregiver holding Power of Attorney. Those inconveniences to you are a matter of life and death to me. I ask that you at least discuss with me possible options for our circumventing the nursing home issues so that both you physicians and my mother and I can go forward for the remainder of her life.
As an added factor you might consider that I, too, receive primary medical care at your offices and have done so, gratefully, for years.  As you may recall, my conditions include high blood pressure and depression, perhaps due at least in part to the long-term care of my mother and, recently, high stress. 
I have lost weight, added Prozac and counseling as my treatment and am doing my part in my own health care; you must do yours. I can assure you that, with the need for me to change careers at age 50 due to circumstances at the University and the dissolution of a 23-year marital relationship, you have added yet another major stressor to a life already in crisis.  I remind you that your decisions affect families, and their health. First, do no harm.
You will forgive me if I do not see my mother as simply one of your many nursing home patients, but as the dearest and most important person in my life. She is, in fact, the sole reason I have stayed in town for my adult life, in order to insure the very best care for her, compromising my own career. As her strongest patient advocate, I can only prevail upon you each personally to look inside yourselves and make a well-deserved exception to your policy in my mother's case. Certainly, desertion of long-term, dependent patients in the last stages of their lives was not the reason you become physicians.
Most sincerely,
Shelley

										Approximately 6 weeks ago we had to move my Father into an assited living facility. The facility requires the person's doctor to fill out several (nine to be exact) pieces of paper with the patient's medical history, lists of medications, etc. Dr. Pennelle filled out these papers so my father could move into the faciclty.
Now my Mother has decided that she wants to move in with my Father at the facility. The same set of 9 papers was taken to Dr. Pennelle's office to be filled out and returned to the assisted lving facility. 
I was informed that Dr. Pennelle now requires $197 BEFORE he will fill out the papers. The reason I was given is that it is time consuming to fill out the papers and the doctor could be seeing other patients during that time...
When the papers we filled out for my Father, there was no mention of a $197 fee. I was told that was on oversight on the part doctor's office and we were lucky. 
My OPINION is that the doctor is trying to get an extra $197 to fill out papers that he could easily have a staff person fill out, he could verfiy the information, then sign the papers and fax them in to the assisted living facility so we can let my Mother live with my Father for the last few years of their lives.

										In the summer of 2002 I had recently moved to Georgia and needed to go to a doctor. I went to Ben Thomas because he works mainly as a walk-in clinc and he accepted my insurance. My responsibility was a $10 copay. About a month later I went back, paid my second copay. 
The next month or so I found out that I was pregnant my morning sickness was severe. I went to Ben Thomas a few more times. I paid my copays. He never remembered who I was. He would always say I was dehydrated or almost dehydrated and to go to the ER. In May of 2003 I went to his office for a severe cold/flu. He gave me a breathing treatment but never bothered to tell me that insurance would not cover it. I received this bill in September. 
That was ALL I OWED. I payed the bill at the beginning ov November it took them a month to actually cash the check. When I called at the beginning of November I suddenly owed $655 for past appointments. Some of the appointments were supposed to have been over a year before. I had insurance I paid my copays. They had a new billing manager who said he guessed that they didn't submit the bills to insurance. I called the insurance company about the 1 date I could get out of him. They had never heard anything of it it had never been submitted. 
If the doctor's office doesn't submit the bills to insurance in a timely fashion it is supposed to be their own fault and their write-off. Of course NOT THE CASE WITH BEN THOMAS!!! They are holding ME responsible for their mistake. The billing person was rude. He said that if insurance won't pay them, it's my responsibility they want their money and they'll get it. He was supposed to send me a breakdown it contains no dates of cervice, nothing about what services were except for the final May appointment. 
Some of the past appointments must have been recently submitted to insurance and were paid but I still owe almost $500 for the others. I have no idea when the appointments were or what they were for.

										I woke up one morning to find one of my eyes very bloodshot and red. There was no pain involved whatsoever. I phoned my family doctor, who told me it may be a ruptured blood vessel. This was not a big issue, but get it checked out at an eye doctor. I got my referral. I phone a local optical doctor, one I had visited a few years ago, as he is close by. The girl who answered said, that with all the dry heat, it was probably just a ruptured blood vessel. Forced dry heat in the cold weather does this. It looked bad, no pain. There was nothing that I could feel or see in that eye, as in a forgein object.
Tuesday, I went to Dr Mellish's office. I spent about 2 minutes in the waiting area. Then, the dr called me back, said ""Well, there is nothing in there, if there was, it's not there now"". I knew that ! He did not , I repeat , did not, touch the eye with anything, surgical or not. The whole visit lasted maybe 6 -10 minutes.Then, he told me to use these eye drops. He told me he would administer 2 doses at that time. He did only one. Told me to come back in a week. I , at that point, scheduled an appt to get my eyes examined for new glasses. This was for the following Tuesday.
Okay, this visit, he took about another minute to look at the eye, still no surgical or invasive treatments used. He said,keep using the drops, you were lucky there was no infection. Infection ? The issue cleared itself up totally by Thursday of the first weeek. I asked why I had not gotten what I came for, my eye exam . He forgot, so then did the exam.
I picked out frames, fitted, billed, the whole nine yards. Vey expensive, but they were what I liked. Between the time they called to tell me I could pick up my glasses & then, I got a BIG bill from Blue Cross, where the office did not submitt a referral. This did not surprise me, but the charges did. I paid my copays, for each visit, totally $60. The office charged for more than one visit on one day, maybe the exam. 
What really got me was that they charged for eye surgery. I was nuts with anger! I had NO surgery what so ever. I phone BC/BS and told them. They said he was charging for removal of a forgein object. He himself told me there was NOTHING there.I refused payment on the deposit for the glasses, seeing how he got $539 for something he did not do. I will NOT pick up the glasses. I will never go there again. This man obviously makes his money from ripping off the health system. He got all he will get from me.
I did inform BC/BS of this matter and they said to rport itto them. I hope he will not continue to be paid for services he did not perform. This is why our insurance is so high ! As far as I care, the office can ""eat"" the cost of making the glasses, as they were paid for them MANY times over!!

										Dr. Zia failed to submit my office visits to my insurance company and repeatedly billed me for them - which I paid.  Then, after about one year of silence, I received a notice from a collector that I owed $146 - which I paid.  At no time did my insurance company ever receive a claim, and Dr. Zia is one of their ""preferred providers,"" thus putting the responsibility for filing on his shoulders.
About a year later, when applying for a loan, I discovered that I had a $7 non-payment notice on my credit report owed to Dr. Zia.  I contacted Dr. Zia and the collection agency, who stated that the amount was paid in full and they would clear my credit report.  They agreed to take that off my credit report.  Then Dr. Zia stated that I owed another $113 - in spite of the fact that I hadn't visited his office in over two years and that I had settled my account with the collection agency.
In writing, by fax and certified mail, I asked Dr. Zia to provide an invoice and copies of my medical records as evidence that I actually owed that amount.  In addition, I asked that Dr. Zia refrain from further collection activity until I received those items.  The evidence was never received - not even an invoice or statement (he has repeatedly refused to issue copies of my medical records for my own use) - and Dr. Zia reported me to another collection agency within the day.  Furthermore, Dr. Zia asked the the collection agency to list the claim as several years old.  I promptly paid the $113 to clear my credit report, but still have not received any evidence that I actually owe anything.
At this time, I have no evidence that I owed the money, although I have paid it.  Dr. Zia has never sent an invoice, a statement, or supporting evidence in the form of my medical records.  And now my credit report shows that I paid a debt several years late.

										I was referred to Dr. Ross in 1999 by a Dr. I saw at a clinic, who said she was a friend of his girlfriend's from med school.  She examined me and said she would let  me know the results of my tests in 2-3 weeks.
Two weeks later I got a call and her nurse told me over the phone that there was something wrong with my pap smear, that I had moderated displasia and that it could become cancerous.  I think this should have been my first tipoff to the level of professionalism of this office - generally when the doctor has ""bad news"" in the past I've been advised to make an appointment to discuss the results - not just told over the phone.  I had no experience at all with an abnormal pap smear, so to me it occurred that I was being told I might have cancer - in a phone call.  
I was told to make an appointment for a biopsy.  Another ""cancer"" word!!!  And I still haven't spoken to the doctor yet.  So I didn't know what to say, so I asked if I could talk to the Dr.  After a few moments they put Dr. Ross on the phone.  She told me I needed to come in for a biopsy, so I did.
Once she finished with the biopsy, she told me that they would call with the results, again.  This time Dr. Ross herself called and said they didn't get it all when they did the biopsy and that they would have to do the LEEP procedure.  I asked if it was painful and she said, ""No, we will inject your cervix with a painkiller.""  I freaked at the thought of someone sticking a needle into my cervix.  
Instead of saying something reassuring (as my next Dr did), she just interrupted my sobs and said, firmly, ""If you want, I can prescribe you a Valium to take before you get here.""  I've never taken a Valium so I didn't know what to say.  I was also a bit shocked that her voice and words did not convey any compassion.  I was still in a daze, not sure whether I had cancer or not & not able to get a straight answer, when chose to switch Drs before having the LEEP performed by Dr. Ross.

										My wife had medical services performed by Wall Medical group on July 31st 2002. Because insurance benefits could not be confirmed at the time of the visit, $100 cash was paid. Later in early in 2003, I sent a letter to our insurance carrier, requesting payment for the cash payment we had to make to the office at the time of the visit.
Unfortunately, rather than sending us the payment as requested, the carrier sent the payment directly to Wall Medical Group. This was confirmed by a provider benefits letter dated 9/18/2003 that we received shortly thereafter showing Wall Medical Group as the payee on the check.
I first contacted the carrier to see if they could correct the problem, but they said it was now out of their hands and I had to deal directly with the payee. I contacted Wall Medical Group via phone and spoke with Lucy in billing. Several months later and countless phone calls of empty promises later, I still hadn't received the payment due to us, $90 ($100 minus $10 copay ).
I then started my letter writing to Wall Medical Group. Each of 3 letters went unanswered by C Allen Wall and his office. I have sent copies of all necessary paperwork, even though they have this same paperwork already, proving that they indeed owe me $90, yet my requests are ignored.

										First of all, I never believed that three children from the same family could all need amphetamines and are all ADHD. I believe that much of a child's behavior is cased by environmental factors and possibly affected by diet. I see medicating children as a last resort and I find it incomprehensible to ignore the input from one parent, when diagnosing children.
Clark was disciplined by both the California and then the Nevada Medical Board for serious allegations of criminal sexual child abuse of his young boy patients in what he refers to as ""hot tub therapy.""  The accusations and decision are available from the California Medical Board and are graphic.  Of course he insists that he is innocent. Clark did not go to trial, but instead settled the matter agreeing to certain terms.
Clark was ordered to undergo psychiatric care and agreed to 6 years probation and was restricted from being alone with young boys.  Probation was recently lifted.
In my case, he interfered with my parental rights for about 5 years by assisting my ex-spouse in alienating my children from me and keeping them all on drugs.  One of the children now has had serious drug abuse problems, which arguably may be a consequence of long-term use of prescription amphetamines.
In short, Clark was another player who ruined my life and possibly my children's lives. My children are grown now and we will never get those years back. They are gone forever.

										I am here to tell you about my experience with a getting a hair transplant from Dr. Stephen B. Anderson. 
Keep in mind that this is only my side of the story... as Dr. Anderson is a coward and hides behind his lawyers, he is not enough of a man to tell his. I do not think he even knows what the truth is anymore, or just does not care.... 
I am not writing to tell you how satisfied I am obviously. No, people who are happy with a hair transplant (and some actually are), do not want to say that they had it done. Likewise, most people with bad results would prefer not to talk about it also. 
 I have been trying to come to grips with what has been done. What gets me is that it seems like no one really cares about what this poor excuse for a doctor continues to do to people. I have contacted lawyers, medical boards, the BBB. No one wants to do anything about it, as doctors keep the bad things they do out of the publics notice as much as they can. They would hate for a bad apple to ruin the whole orchard!
When started researching the Internet on Dr. Anderson, I was both relieved, but also very saddened to see that I was not alone in being what I will refer to as a 'victim' (not patient) of this guy. 
There are people all over that have had the same thing done to them. You see, a hair transplant doctor can do a plain lousy job time after time. Yet, as long as there is no infection, there is no law suit. You have to sign a 'no guarantee' release form before they will operate. 
 I understand, this is to protect the doctor. But, too many doctors with no morals such as Anderson are just plain taking advantage of this. They do not have to put any effort into there results. By the time the patient knows they were taken, they doctor has already been paid. 
I read story after story that was all to close to mine. Why no one will step in and stop this amazes me. I have tried every resource I can think of, all I have heard is... ""I am sorry to hear what he did to you."" 
  Let me tell you my story.... I am now 36 years old. I started to lose my hair in my early twenty's. In 1996 I went to see Dr. Stephen B. Anderson www.800theface.com and his Northwest Hair Transplant Center in Bellevue, Washington. I was very clear when I told Dr. Anderson, ""I want to have my hair look like someone in there 30's, not 50 's... I want it to cover."" 
 He did not say he could cover all my hair loss, but he said ""You will be happy, we can make you look good."" 
 I was quoted by Dr. Anderson 's assistant that the cost would be around $5000 to $6000.
 I went to Dr. Anderson for four procedures, including a 'scalp reduction'. By the time it was done, the total was over $10,000. I was told at that point to wait while the transplanted graphs came out of their 'dormant'stage from the 'shock' and started to grow. It has been over 6 years now, and at best maybe 10% of his transplants grew. 
 Doctors have been doing transplants since the early 1970 's. The only problem they had back then, was making the hair not have the 'corn row 'or 'doll' look to it. 
 They have come a long way since then, but the transplanted hair growing was never an issue. But, for Dr. Anderson it seems to be.
  If I was the only one this had happened to, I would write it off as my body 'rejecting 'the grafts. But, as it happens my friends brother went to see Dr. Anderson about the same time as myself. 
 He was told basically the same lies that I was, that it would cost much less and have far greater results than either of us had. The only thing either of us have to show from his work is very bad scars. When I go out in public without a hat, I often get asked if I have had ""brain surgery."" 
 So you might ask, ""why have we not gotten are money back?"" Well, Dr. Anderson hides behind his lawyers and his 'no guarantee' release that everyone must sign before he performs surgery. This allows him to say ""Well, I do the best I can."" 
 If I got his best, I would hate to see his worst! I can only say I am glad for people that he does not do any life saving surgery...

Ever since my mothers initial complaint on the Office worker, ""Cynthia,"" my mother had nothing, but difficulty/grief. She would leave several messages for her doctor and there would be, ""NO"" call back until I sent a FAX.
It is now clear that this office worker, ""Cynthia"" deliberately made my mothers $60.00 billing late, which allowed her to send it directly to, ""Collections"" without anyone at Nervepro notifying us before hand.
My mother sadly suffered another attack, which is very sad to see.  I called Dr. Cleeremans office immediately and asked to speak to the doctor at once.  The office worker was very nice and stated that he had an opening and that we should come down and see the doctor in person if this was the case.
Approximately 20 minutes later, ""Cynthia"" contacted me and stated that my mother COULD NOT SEE the doctor due to the fact that she had not paid her bill. I asked her how much was the bill?  She answered, ""$60.00""  I  responded, ""No problem we will pay it IN FULL when we get there.
Cynthia replied, ""Not gonna happen, I already sent it to collections, you're gonna have to wait until tommorrow until they are open, take care of your bill and then you could see the doctor.""
I responded, ""My mother is extremely ill, we already have the an appointment, I'll give you $1,000.00 in cash and you could take what you need.""
Cynthia disgracefuly responded, ""No, you can take care of your bill  tomorrow with collections and then call and make an appoinment, besides Dr. Cleereman's is Chief of staff and will be in meeting all afternoon, he doesn't have time for you today."" THEN HANG UP THE TELEPHONE (CLICK!!!!!!!!!)
I took my mother to the Emergency Room and found a better doctor and staff.  
To this date my mother still has problems with her credit report over a measley $60.00 that Dr. Cleereman's office employee put on there in an act of malice.

										I went in for a back injury, and he didn't do any X-rays or anything, but instead handed me a prescription for Oxycontins (for the day) and morphine (for the night).  It wasn't long before I was addicted to them.  He then supplemented me with Vicodin.  When I asked to go off them, he put me on a ""taper"" including time-release morphine and Percocet.  Finally I had to enter a treatment program to rid myself of the narcotics.
It wasn't long before I found out my neighbor, who goes to the same doctor, has been a narcotic addict for about 2 years now.  He had to go to a drug treatment program as well.  They recommended he take only ibuprofen for pain in the future.  When he went back to Kapanjie, this doctor gave him time-release morphine AND Percocet (""don't take these more than necessary"").  
Since this time, I've talked to a couple of his other patients and learned that they are ALL on painkillers for problems as varied as headaches and ulcers.  There is nothing in the medical literature to support this, and when I read some literature on how doctors are supposed to address back problems, the first line of defense is NEVER multiple narcotics.  Especially as mine wasn't that bad (i.e. not a herniated disk or anything).  
I believe Dr. Ted Kapanjie uses narcotics to hook his patients into coming back.  He has a thriving business.  Doctors who know their patients are addicts should never give them narcotics to take home with them.  Dr. Kapanjie does more harm than good and should be examined by the medical board that certified him.

Miami, Florida U.S.A. ",,305-412-2800,"Dr. Jacqueline Redondo, M.D. Dishonest, Unethical Billing of Her Patients-Incompetent Office. Miami Florida","
										I went to Dr. Redondo for treatment in April, 2002.  TWO YEARS later I receive a bill from her for $1200.  I had United Healthcare at the time, and Dr. Redondo is an in-network provider for them which is why I went to her in the first place.  My United Healthcare plan covered 100% except for my $10 copay.  
It turns out that Redondo's office is so incompetent, in my opinion, that they didn't file the claim within a YEAR after the ""treatment"".  That's what I was told by United Heathcare. Therefore, United Healtcare did not pay for the claim, according to them.  So, Redondo began charging ME, her patient, for the bill and even submitted it to a collection agency.  
I called United Healthcare and they said that Dr. Redondo was in violation of her contract as a provider for United Healthcare by charging her patient.  I got the Miami Herald involved and they told me that upon investigation, they had reason to believe that Redondo was doing this to a large number of her patients.  I called Redondo's office and was told, ""You're going to pay for this and there's nothing you can do about it!!!""   
After dealing with it for five months, United Healthcare told me that they finally threatened to drop her as a provider and she stopped trying to charge me.  In my opinion, Dr. Redondo has no conscience or sense of ethics and is only in it for the money.  She knew she was not supposed to charge me, her patient, and was supposed to work it out with United Healthcare (I know because I told her in a certified letter), but she chose to continue charging me anyway.  She made a clear and conscious decision to do this.  It appears to me that her greed got the best of her.  
By the way, did I mention that the $1200 was what she charged me for putting a splint on my broken pinky finger?

His report is full of lies.. even the dates of my surgeries he can't get right..
After seeing him and getting OTHER doctors to show he was wrong, that worked. But now, the insurance company wants and is forcing me to go back to him so they can listen to his lies (which he has been proven wrong) and take me off of my workers comp SIBS.
Last year this man alone made 906,000 paid to him by the insurance company (public record) and the yr. prior, 968,000.
So, you can see he is in the control of the insurance company and will try to take all legitimate workers off of their deserving income.. just to make himself look better and to pad his wallet.
Texas workers comp people, beware and try to get another doctor.. better yet, file here it DOES WORK.

Chicago, Illinois U.S.A. ",,800-621-8335,"American Medical Practice For Physicians The American Medical Association for Physicians Have Deceived and Lied To Asthmatics ripoff Chicago, Illinois","
										All Physicians try and deceive asthmatics as a rule and general practice too asthmatic patients. This has been going on since the introduction of car A/C's made asthma a mainstream disease in 1955. It's an physician's preoccupation with the law that has driven doctors to deny the existence or cause of car asthma. Making bold statements instead claiming asthma to be an allergy. 
Asthma is not an allergy, it is the the result of inhaling a gas called phosgene gas from car exhaust pipes. The damage done to your lungs is called Asthma. I believe asthma to be of serious damage to your lung cells. Still experts refuse to believe any damage exists to lung cells, and would have you believe damage was done to your immune system instead.  
No one seems to know what damage is done at the atomic or sub-atomic level to individual lung cells. Like any cut, laceration, or open wound the body is constantly fighting these damaged cells producing a thick pus that chokes off and prevents the flow of air inside the brochile tubes. 
Doctors haven't been able to view cell damage using today's best microscopes, so they really don't know what causes asthma. Instead they postulate about asthma helping some patients to seek the law, while leaving most patients dumb founded and too confused to seek out help in the matter. I believe this to be a back door to avoid lawsuits, and any finger pointing by law firms.
I had asthma shots as a 2 year old until I was 10 during the 50's and 60's. My doctor never bothered to mention to me that asthma is caused by car exhaust. Leaving me to run out and catch more fumes, not to mention my father's early death(39)from yes asthma that he didn't know he had. And I say this because my father and I would make trips inside the auto dealer's garage to have metal sliding boards welded. And that is to the best of my knowledge how my family met it's early demise.
That's a rip-off to watch me cry week after week as an infant who wasn't ever asked how his breathing was. And then for the doctor to act like I'm taking money out of his pocket by asking him to stop my shots. So he never warns me how to stay clear of repeated asthma treatments or what leads to asthma like car fumes. 
Doesn't your dentist advise you too brush and floss to keep from getting cavities? Don't doctors warn patients about obesity, diabetics, smoking, etc...? Well this courtesy isn't extended to asthmatics. Instead we're lied to and told not to smoke which more times than not led most asthmatics to experiement and try smoking. 
I think doctors have cheated and abused 20 million americans in this respect. Doctors have left asthmatics at the mercy of wolves without anyway to become productive citizens. Asthmatics can't run, walk for distance, or hustle for a living, they can't even join the army.
I had never had asthma most of my life. I say this after smoking for 20 years, running 10 miles a day for 2 years, and enjoying 10K road races inspite of being labaled asthmatic in my youth. After coming down with asthma at 35 I've been forced once again to except asthma and anything and everything the AMA throws in my face. I find this to be mean spirited and self-centered if not inhumane. 
Especially after spending every other summer getting 18 shots in one arm as a child. I wast petrified by the thought of shots in my youth. I'm a man not a child, I should've be told the truth somewhere along the line about asthma by a doctor. It should've been a health discussion at least once in my life. I should've had a decent shot with a lawyer at my employeer. But I was lied to, confused and confounded, and forced out into the streets with the worst disease any young person could ever imagine. What's the big idea? Make a little garage business of your own down the street?
Tortured by sneaky businessmen with asthma, lied to by doctors and lawyers excusing my asthma case, abused by fellow workers and bosses making sure I inhaled, kicked around by local government and police, and left jobless without compensation since 1989 without any legal help or explanations. 
This in a country I went to war for in 1973 getting orders too Thailand while lawyers and doctors learned how to duck such things. I also pulled duty in the Middle East, and was the first to go to war pulling red-alert duty against Iran in 1976 as a crew-chief in the Air Force while my detachment was getting it's butt kicked out of Tehran Iran.
I wasn't to bad a guy to not get a job with the military then, but when it came to asthma nobody ever offered any help. Matter of fact veterans worked me over real good trying to prevent me from going to Thailand in 1976 using a variety of tactics that caused both physical damage and property loss to me. As I was the last one with orders out of this country during the Viet Nam War era. At best I was totally confounded by others and laughed at for admitting I took asthma shots on job applications. Asthma was a starting point by most to heckle and abuse like I wasn't good enough for them.
Having asthma has meant living a lifetime with alot of frustration and disappointment among other things like poverty. My grandfather on my mother's side was a car dealer salesmen most of his life, and this man didn't extend his blessing or offer any insight as to my asthma. What a world we live in!

Imagine your Liver growing a large stone because you have a starchy diet that is protein poor. And the stone inturn causes kidney infections which if left untreated will ruin the kidneys and kill you. What I am trying to point out is that internal organs unlike external skin doesn't always heal. 
Hearts can become clogged and some hearts form a growth or mass inside the heartchamber itself. The same is true of other organs. 
With asthma this disease is sort of like a combination of these things as a thick pus chokes off and prevents the flow of air inside the brochile tubes. It doesn't have anything to do with what we typically think of as being an allergy. Exercise not air-born pollen stimulates attacks or asthma spasms which are brought on my stretching the injured lung fabric.

They've tried to harm my body at fast food stores with more posionings, and assaulted me with ninja sticks and car accidents. They've made numberous threats about speaking out about asthma, saying they'd have me squashed by a trucker on the highway. And had at least one trucker shadow me down the main highway. Automotive employees and business owners have stalked me through college classes and disrupted those classes. They stalk me intown reminding me of what I am. Small business people representing the company I worked for have moved next door and tried to nail me on several fronts. They've sent several mexicans to bother me.

Plano, Texas U.S.A. ",,972-867-1222,"Jerome S. Schechter; North Texas Orthodontic Associates, P.C. Orthodontic Medical Malpractice. I reported this doctor to State Board of Dental Associate in Austin. Plano Texas","
										I am writing a letter to report a strong case of Orthodontic Malpractice.  I have been a victim of irresponsible/illegal treatment provided by Dr. Jerome S. Schechter, an orthodontist.  I have reported doctor Schechter to the State Board of Dental Examination located in Austin.  Among all malpractice cases, orthodontic malpractice is a kind of small one because nobody dies from it.  But still, it went into Informal Settlement Conference in Octorber 2003 after investigator investigated the case.  Dr. Schechter was required to show up in the conference, and he showed up with two attorneys.      
My teeth were in a good shape and bites comfortably when I started seeing Dr. Schechter.  After two and a half years treatment, the situation of my teeth was getting so terrible that several dental related doctors persuaded me that an Orthodontic Surgery might be the only solution.  The Surgery cost is between $30,000 to $50,000 depends on the surgery doctor.  
After I checked with various orthodontists and dentists, I was told that my teeth should be much better in both biting and looking if a proper treatment has been performed.  I have to quit the treatment from Dr. Schechter, at that time, I only have one left side tooth roughly touched (not in biting), the rest teeth are even not touched at all.  My upper molars were moved forward too much which is the biggest problem most doctors considered it a permanent damage in my life.     
He estimated my treatment time as 15 months long, I actually spent 30 moths under hime.  This kind of orth damage cannot be caused in a short time, it has been caused by continually malpractice during two and a half years.  Several orthodontists refused to take my case without the Orthodontic surgery.  There are also other doctors suggesting a very new technique called power Implant (implant several nails into my mouth roof and teeth bone to move those teeth which have been moved forward by Dr. Schechter back to their original place) might be able to pull my upper molar teeth back, but it depends on each person~{!/~}s bone condition.  If the implant won~{!/~}t succeed, it will be a life time problem. 
Also, this new technique is not so mutual in U.S.  I have several other doctor~{!/~}s evaluation reports to prove what I stated here.     Doctor Schechter should take full responsibility for the condition of my teeth.  All problems can be avoided if he spent time preparing the case and followed proper treatment procedures.  He even did not take any current X-ray or model before he started the treatment.  He ruined my life, made me have to ware the braces from 30 to 36 years old even if the implant can correct my teeth, and I have to suffer all those procedures and pains of the treatment.     
I~{!/~}m not the doctor.  I don~{!/~}t know exactly what~{!/~}s wrong with my teeth after being treated by Dr. Schechter except I know it~{!/~}s far from normal good teeth.  I totally depend on his knowledge.  I was confused so much that I have to take advice from other doctors to know exactly what~{!/~}s wrong.  What made me feel worse is every time when I mentioned other doctors~{!/~} opinions to Dr. Schechter, he came up a way to fool me.  
Every time when he told me: ~{!0~}I will correct this problem later~{!1~}, I was waiting for that happen.  It is a mental torture.  The truth is:  The molars can never be able to be moved backward after they are moved forward because there is no tooth after it.  The worst thing is:  Dr. Schechter continually uses a retainer to move my right molar forward more (there was a space between two molars at that time, he requested dentist to pull one of my tooth out).     
Dr. Schechter~{!/~}s behavior is un-forgivable because he never cares about the permanent damage he caused on a person~{!/~}s life.   Now, I know why he kept delaying my treatment time:  Texas law protects the doctor if the patient does not suit the doctor within 2 years after damage being made.   When I waked up and started to talk with the attorney, I was told the time is a big problem.  Also, this kind of malpractice is not very profitable to the attorney, most attorneys do not want to spend time on this kind of case.
Then I reported him to the dental peer review in Dallas,  Dr, Schechter replied Peer Review that he would like to refund everything to me if I stop any further legal action (that mean I cannot suit him, actually, it~{!/~}s also the way of peer review to protect the doctore), I refused.   I reported him to the State Board of Dental Examiner in Austin.  My case went into Informal Settlement Conference after investigation (a lot of cases cannot get into that point).   Dr. Schechter brought two attorneys with him to the conference, and I just showed up with my husband (I~{!/~}m not required to show up).   I don~{!/~}t know how to evaluate the fairness of the state board.  
But after this case, I feel the orthodontist can actually do anything to damage a patient~{!/~}s teeth and the board will try best to help him.  The board will find any excuse during the long treatment time, and if one excuse can be found, the case will be dismissed.   The State Board first listened doctor Schechter~{!/~}s report, then my report.   But the State Board asked me some questions, seems I were a defendant, those questions are all asked by standing on Dr. Sechector~{!/~}s side.   The State Board didn~{!/~}t ask Dr. Schechter any question by standing in my side.   
The panel~{!/~}s leader is a doctor too, honestly speaking, the panel is trying to help the doctor as much as they can.  As an immigrant in this country, to suit a doctor is very difficult for us.  I don~{!/~}t have an attorney help me, I cannot speak the native English as good as Dr. Schechter, I even cannot find a doctor standing up to show on the conference and help me because most of the orth. Doctor in Texas knows Dr. Schecther.  All the factors made this case so hard to be fair.   And this system supports the doctors like Dr. Schechter to continue his malpractice as he want.   
Finally, the State Board offered me that the Board can push Dr. Schechter to fully refund my money paid to him (the board is not allowed to force Dr. Schechter refund more than what I paid) but I have to dismiss the suit.   I said No, I cannot dismiss it, I want him to be punished as far as I suffered so much, but I still want my refund.   The State Board wouldn~{!/~}t force him to refund me money if I don~{!/~}t dismiss the case.   The State Board dismissed the case finally without refunding me anything because I didn~{!/~}t dismiss the case.   The case number I will put on this report next time.     
I want a full refund of the amount I paid Dr. Schechter because he didn~{!/~}t provide the service described in the contract.  But after the State Board dismissed the case and I ran out of my two years suit time, Dr. Schechter refused to refund me a penny.  I have hired an attorney to write a letter to the State Board and CC~{!/~}d to Dr. Schechter, he still didn~{!/~}t refund me anything.  Of course, Dr. Schechter never mentioned to cover the treatment cost to clean up his mess at all.      
I~{!/~}m still warring the braces from anther doctor.  Now I have four implants built into my mouth.   But the progress is very slow and most of time no progress.   I would like to report all those suffering to the public.  I feel the justice system has potential problem.   I would like anybody to contact me about the detail of this case, I would like to prevent this kind of malpractice happening on any of you.    
Thanks.

										Hi, I don't know if this is the proper forum or not, but if not, please pass this on to the proper people who can handle this.  I've been a patient for about the last year to year 1/2 at the following:  Physicians' Alliance, Ltd.  Mountville Family Practice Associates.  Located at:  2 College Avenue, Mountville, PA.  17554.  Phone#: 717-285-3144 and Fax #:  717-285-3529. The doctors name is:  J. William Parke, M.D.  I currently am unemployed.  I have been attempting to get some of my more expensive prescriptions filled right throught the Pharmacuetical Companies as I can.  This requires an Advocate on the part of this Mountville Family Practice.  The Advocate in this case is a nurse called ""Debbie"".  I got most of my prescriptions the first time (not all), but when trying to get refills on the one I had, PLUS, getting the ones I never got in the first place, I got nowhere and no one even attempted to help me !
I called this ""Debbie"" about 1 1/2 months before my pills (that I DID have) were to run out so that it wouldn't be inconvenient for everyone at the last minute.  Each and EVERY time I called and asked for her, she was never in.  The reason I got more than none, was the she was on vacation, or it was her day off, or she just plain wasn't there.  I could never reach her.  In finally having to go in to see the doctor, and AGAIN, paying another fee for nothing, me and my husband explained to him the situation.  Nothing got done about it.  We also spoke to the office manager ""Jean"" who was nice to our face and that was about it. Still nothing got taken care of as far as my prescriptions went.  At this point, both me and my husband were, at the very least getting upset and this is why:
I take Nexium.  There is NO generic.  It costs me over $500 which I can not afford each month.  I also take Allegra-D which there is NO generic for an also an arm and a leg.  I also take just regular Allegra.  Again, all the same.  I take Nasacort, again, the same situation. Plus I take Prozac which is the ONLY on that comes in generic form and is more affordable.  But when it comes down to it, depending where you go, my medicines cost WELL over $1500 dollars.
I've explained this to this so called Dr's office to no avail.  And now that I have had to become somewhat aggressive in getting my pills (since aI am running out with NO refills) they sent me the following letter which I will copy here.  It says:  Ms.Stacy, it came to my attention after our recent visit that on more than one occassion you have been upset with our care and then reacted and basically were verbally absusive to my staff. Let me interject  something here.....at NO time was I verbally abusive and neither was my husband. Additionally, I had to call this Advocate ""Debbie"" twice a week to try and get her on the phone which I never did.  The letter goes on to say:  I think at this point it would be best to have you find a different medical provider and he signs his name J. Wm.Parke, M.D.  What can be done about this situation ?  If they would have gotten off their butts and at least made a phone call to the Pharmacuetical Companies, this all would have been taken care of a long time ago.  But no one did a thing. And ""I"" am not a physician so I can NOT call these people and do the thing myself.  Believe me, if there was a way I could do it, I would have by now.  It is NOT Ethically correct for these people to do this to me when all we were trying to do was get my prescriptions.  Can something be done about them ?  Something needs to be done about this ""Mountville Family Practice"" in Pennsylvania and the sooner the better.  It maskes me wonder how many other people they have done this to ???  Can you please respond as soon as humanely possible ?  I live in Marietta, PA. 17547.  Thank you for your time.

										Regarding Dr. Eve Bruce
For 1 1/2 years I have had terrible experiences with a doctor, Eve Bruce, who performed 3 surgeries on me.  And I now know my problems with her will not be resolved unless I take some action.
In February 2003 I paid Eve Bruce $2570 to simply take a little fat off along my jawbone and just under my jawbone.  My face had never been touched by any previous surgery (please check with Eve's ""before"" photos of my face).  The surgery created unsightly depressions in my face.  
I went back in June 2003 to straighten out the holes in my face and also paid her another $3500 to touch up the gouges left on my stomach and thighs and knees by another doctor.  I had yet another touch up in early 2004 for the problems unfixed on my body and continuing problems with the holes she had created on my face.  I was charged another $300 to have this additional surgery at the Maryland Cosmetic Surgery Center, in Lutherville, MD.  The surgeries, unfortunately, we all failures (see photos).  Nothing was corrected on my face and body; as a mater of fact, more holes resulted on my thighs, no correction on my knees, new gouges in my buttocks, left leg and stomach from the second and third surgeries.  
I did not wish to go any further with this if Eve Bruce returned my money.  This whole business has been incredibly stressful and I want it behind meand to think I paid all that money to be stressed and disfigured!  I am simply asking for the return of my money and interest for the dismally failed surgery in the sum of $6070 with interest, $2718, total:  $8788.  I requested the total be received by November 15, 2004.
My odyssey with Dr. Eve Bruce began in February 2003 with the first surgery on my chin and jaw.  I had spoken with Eve several times about what I wanted done, the last conversation only minutes from the surgery.  I had repeated over and over, ""I don't want any fat taken off my face; I like my cheeks the way they are.""  I even demonstrated ""only along the jaw"" As she began taking fat out of my jaw, she went way up into my right cheek, up to my cheekbone! I was surprised and remarked -- in front of the staff in the operating room-- ""I don't want you to go into my cheeks.  You're cutting into my cheeks.""  She remarked, ""I'm not taking any fat out of your cheeks I'm just feathering.""  She continued to ""feather"" both cheeks up to my cheekbones and as a result has disfigured me.
I have been the object of Dr. Eve Bruce's malpractice and every day I suffer from what she has done to my face and body.  It is clear to me now that she is incompetent and did not know what she was doing when she operated on me, then had no idea how to fix it.

										THE HAIR LOSS SOLUTION -
 WOULD YOU GIVE 20 YEARS TO CURE YOUR BALDNESS?  
Spend the money and take the time the time it takes to read THE HAIR LOSS SOLUTION by DR.ERNEST PRIMEAU.
It's the most off the wall method for hair re-growth and hair loss prevention you will ever see. You'll be able to be supplied in snake oil for only $180.00 a year.
If you are worried about hair loss, what is ten minutes of reading and $15.00?
In THE HAIR LOSS SOLUTION, one of the most unusual text ever written, you will discover an inexpensive and simple idea from an age-old man. You'll learn the most bizare ways to attempt to prevent and treat hair loss, including the patented 'Pluck-n-Grow' method and how to properly use hot caramel.
This is not a quick fix by any means, it can take up to twenty years to see any results. This is not an infomercial, those cost too much money. It is a way 'outside the box' analysis of the problem, and the most ilogical methods for treating it with snake oil *(that may cause adverse side effects, use at your own risk). It is an opportunity to change your looks, for better or for worse, and possibly your life dramatically.
THE HAIR LOSS SOLUTION does not require the purchase of expensive lotions or hair pieces *(If you are looking for hair pieces, let me recomend www.farrellhair.com ) 
 All the ingredients you need for Dr. Primeau's snake oil mix are some common household items and a little of your time. Best of all this remedy has something other methods do not have-ONE ON ONE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DOCTOR HIMSELF!
 It is true, it has not yet worked for the Author, or for any of the others who have wasted thier time and money. 
To their amazement, Dr. Primeau's remedy did not yield any of the results they were promised, but as Dr. Primeau keeps saying, ""good things come to those who wait"" and who knows... maybe YOU will be the first sucess story!
 THE HAIR LOSS SOLUTION is different because it explains by going around in circles, an unproven way to try to re-grow hair. But most importantly, you have no body hair when you are done. You will have a chest of a young boy in no time, and that my friends IS a promise!
 As many men loose hair in the first place, they get very desperate and try just about everything and anything. So why not give THE HAIR LOSS SOLUTION a try?
If you have hope to re-grow your hair, or make sure you keep the hair you already have, ten minutes of reading is all it takes....Though the method will take a lifetime to work *(if it ever does for you).
TESTIMONIALS
Maisie Dowell, St. Petersburg, Florida, ""Since November 1989, I have watched Ernie Primeau, whom I have known for over ten years, try to grow more hair on his head by using a method that he claims he discovered. I swear that he is bald as a baby on top of his head, so if he has any results someday, I will sure know it. So far, nothing, but Ernie tells me his method takes time.""
Homer, Pinellas Park, Florida, ""I started with 3 hairs on my head, now I have four!  Dr. Primeau is true medical a genius, he should be awarded a nobel prize or something.""
Tyrone Z. Tampa, Florida, ""I began a procedure to re-grow my hair that I had lost to male pattern baldness. The procedure was shown to me by Dr. Ernie Primeau the first week of January, 1995. By March 1st, 2000 though I could not see any results. Ernie told me though that he could see that the process was working. Nine years later, I am still waiting, but as Dr. Primeau says, ""you're hair did not fall out overnight, it is not going to grow back overnight either.""
 The process is slow, so you really have to commit to it. I know Dr. Primeau has been commited!"" BEFOREAfter #1After #2

										We bought two underarm permanent hair removal certificates from Dr. Malouf in March 2004.  The certificates entitled us to twelve months of hair removal (I also bought a third for upper lip and chin hair removal).  Before I bought these I called and spoke to Kim, his assistant who would do the hair removal, and was assured that any unused portion of the certificates (I only had upper lip hair for example and no chin hair) could be used for any of her (not the doctor's) other services.  This was fine with us.  We started our monthly appointments in May and began to loose the hair as we expected.  
At our seventh appointment on November 23, 2004, Kim was not there and we were told to wait an hour for Dr. Malouf as he wanted to check Kim's work.  He arrived and proceeded to remove the ""stubborn"" on my daughter hairs by raising the number on the machine by incredible amounts.
My daughter's underarms were so sore she was crying for a week afterward and had trouble with many activities for two weeks.  I refused to let him hurt me.  We were told that we were not welcome for the last five visits left on our certificate by Nicole, the office manager.  We were told that the certificates were costing Dr. Malouf too much money and that they were a mistake.  We were told that anything Kim had told us was a lie.  Of course after this extremely painful experience we did not want to return either.    
I should tell you that my daughter is a martial artist, in JROTC, very strong physically and almost never cries for any reason.  Peter Malouf DO's behavior was appalling to me.  I think the Fort Worth community should be aware of his practices.

After finally seeking another opinion, am not on any drugs nor did I ever need them.  Covert diagnosed me as ""ADHD, Depression, Dillusioned"" introducing me to an anti-psychotic drug and threatening me that if I did not continue his services, I should be dropped off at the closest mental instistution immediately.   
Dr. Covert used this ""Drug Dealing"" businesss to create a drug dependance on me while draining my bank account for over $12,000 cash (2 x week @ $200 = $2,000/month). Sessions lastes anywhere from 3 min to 15 minutes and were for life advice.  I don't know why I was even put on any drugs and had to go back to him. I was impressionable and naive at the time. 
I urge any current patients to stop visits to him IMMEDIATELY before you go broke!!! I have heard of one lady who spent over $56,000 is still trying to pay her debt off from him.  He used brainwashing tactics of self-doubt to keep patients to keep going to him and that is flat out WRONG! I would file a malpractice lawsuit and according to a leading Houston Psychologist would win, however the personal damage of taking something like this to court is not worth the dollar amount I would receive.  Thus, am using my experience with him to inform others before they are abused, mistreated, and misdiagnosed.

While a malpractice lawsuit is winnable, would take years.  My best defense is to warn others of his malpractice, especially those such as Ms. Newton, Houston, who he has testified against in our state's courts and is now facing the death penalty.

Charlotte, North Carolina U.S.A. ",,704-3934808,Charlotte Pediatric Clinic - Carolinas HealthCare System ripoff dishonest fraudulant and illegal business practices Charlotte North Carolina,"
										On January 12th my wife called the office of Charlotte Pediatric Clinic for my son, whom had a cough.  She was referred to them by a friend of hers.  She told them that she was currently using a pediatric doctor that charged $80 for a regular visit and was told that they charged the same.  She was then told this again when she went there and had to fill out paperwork as she was a new patient.  She finally got in to see the doctor for all of 2 minutes.  He wrote a prescription for an antibiotic and as she was leaving she was told that the bill was $160.  
The person in charge of billing stated that they charge $160 for new patients.  This is definite fraudulant business practices - baiting and switching (telling someone it is one price and then screwing them with a higher price later).

Leawood, Kansas U.S.A. ",,913-491-3999,Headache & Pain Center Canceling Insurance Particpation ripoff Leawood Kansas,"
										I had been referred to the Headache & Pain center in Leawood, KS by a friend/neighbor for treatment of a pinched nerve in my upper back. We selected the H&P center based on the fact that they were a preferred care provider in our medical insurance network. The specific doctor that we worked with, Dr David Bankston, was also a preferred physician in our network which qualified all treatments for the highest level of coverage.
I scheduled an appointment and started to receive treatment from the center on 5 separate occasions over the next two months. Each of these visits were covered by our insurance provider and we promptly paid our copay and all other bills on a timely basis. 
On Oct 11th at the final treatment for the pinched nerve, I let Dr Bankston know that I was no longer suffering any pain from it. I did however have some pain in my shoulder. Dr Bankston recommended that I receive an MRI to be sure there were no further injuries. We checked with our insurance carrier as we could not afford the $1,500 or so in charges and found that we would only be charged the copay as in our other visits. The MRI was scheduled for and completed on Oct 18th.
After the MRI was completed and billing was processed a few weeks later, we were notified by our insurance carrier that Dr Bankston had let his participation in our insurance group lapse on Oct 15th. This meant that he was no longer a preferred physician. As an out of network physician all copays and deductibles from the Oct 18th appointment were now negated and we would be responsible for all charges for the MRI. 
We were not made aware of this fact either prior to, the day of or following the procedure. However, the day of the MRI, the H&P Center did take our insurance card and copay amount but did not see fit to tell us about the changes in Dr Bankston's status. The insurance company said that it is the responsibility of the physician and the billing office to notify all patients of a change such as this. I do not fault the insurance carrier in this instance.
We have since tried to contact both Dr Bankston as well as the billing office at H&P but to no avail. They only ask if we are ready to settle in full. When we begin to explain the circumstances and seek resolution we are told that the claim has been passed on to their legal department and is out of their hands.
We did issue payment for all bills that would have been outstanding had insurance been paid so there has been no financial gain for us in not making payment. 
However, today, 5/12/06, the sheriff delivered to us notice of a lawsuit claim against us by the H&P Center for the amount of $2,800 as well as all legal costs associated with the collection. 
My wife and I are 45 years old and we stand proud that at this point in our lives, we have never had to be a participant in a lawsuit or legal action and have never been in court other than traffic court for a moving violation. This is not how we settle disputes.
I just want to know how this could happen and what we should do to prevent it from happening again to others?

										I am a patient of Boston Medical Group. After my initial examination and purchase of their medication, I was required to order refills throught their toll free number 1-800-616-1526.
The telephone call center which takes your phone order is located in Costa Mesa, California. When ordering a refill of your medication, you are required to provide all personal details and credit card information including the 4 digit security code. Please keep in mind that I am a very intelligent consumer and I protect my credit information very carefully. I never give out this type of info to anyone, but BMG refused to fill my order without all this critical info.
One day following my initial phone order to Boston Medical Group in Costa Mesa, I was contacted by the Nordstrom Department Store - Security Department. They called me to inform me of a fraudulent attempt to use my credit card to order gift cards and have them delivered to a DHL facility located within minutes of the Boston Medical Group in Costa Mesa, California!! 
I immediately reported this crime to Eric Mungia at Boston Medical Group who refused to accept any responsibilty or initiate an investigation. I also made a report to the Police Department and cancelled my credit card.
Several months later, I needed to again re-order my medication and called BMG and spoke to Manager Eric Mungia who guaranteed me complete patient confidentiality and that my credit card info would be 100% secure. I placed another order and once again they insisted on all my personal info including my new credit card number and security code. 
Once again, following this second transaction, my identity was stolen and the suspects attempted to make purchases through Nordstrom and an on-line jewelry company!! I was forced to cancel another credit card and report the matter again to the Police Dept. I spent countless personal hours completeing my own investigation because Eric Mungia again refused to help me. I was told that Tom Messinger was in charge of the Costa Mesa office and that he refused to lead any type of investigation. My investigation revealed that on the same day that the suspects tried to order more gift cards from Nordstrom, that also tried to use the credit info from another BOSTON MEDICAL GROUP VICTIM who lives in Illinois. Based on the investigation, the Police department indicated in their final report that BOSTON MEDICAL GROUP WAS THE POINT OF COMPROMISE in these crimes.
Seven weeks ago, I wrote a very lenghty letter and mailed it certified mail to the President of Boston Medical Group, Dr. Daniel Ha. Not one single person has contacted me to address my concerns. I refuse to be victimized by this organization and I want to alert any other customer of BMG of this serious issue.
I have filed a formal complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services. They have indicated that they will investigate Boston Medical Group for violating the Federal Standards for Privacy and Individually Identifiable Health Information. I will use the internet and media to expose this issue and warn other consumers. I also intend to file a civil lawsuit against Boston Medical Group. 
Please read the disturbing complaints against BMG filed in this forum by their own employees. If you are a former or present empoyee of BMG I would love to hear fron you. If you are a customer of BMG and think you may also be a victim, I really want to hear from you.

										I have no complaint regarding the quality of medical care at this office. I do have a strange story to relate though.
Strange story:
I had seen Dr. Carolyn Ross for about 3 years. She was my primary health care provider. I am an admitted cancer-phobe (who isn't?) and somewhat of a hypochondriac. However, treating illnesses of the mind, anxiety, and/or actual physical maladies are all the responsiblity of the general health-care provider. I never hid my issues and was always open with Dr. Ross.
During the time of 2005-2006 I was a no-show for exactly ONE appointment (out of probably 6). It so happens I has having some difficulty with my job at the time and I had to pick priorities. I also re-scheduled an appointment several months prior to this incident.
This is the backgound info. Now to the incident:
I made an appointment to investigate hundreds of tiny red bumps on my legs that clearly are not bug-bites. The spots appeared to be VERY slowly fading away (2 weeks) so I called and cancelled the appointment when they opened their office on the day of my appointment. They called me back a short time later and informed me that due to cancelling on the day of the appointment, combined with the SINGLE no-show they would never see me again. 
I said ""Really? No letter? No explanation? No nothing? I was just trying to be polite and free up appointment space for someone else. I can certainly come in and show you the red spots I have.""
They responded ""The appointment slot has been filled already.""
I responded ""Then what is the problem? That is why I called. So you could fill the spot. I was being polite. Now you refuse to provide me with additional medical care, ever, for any reason.""
They said it was ""the doctor's decision.""
What a load of crap.
Be warned: If you go to this office, the quality of the health care appears to be good. But beware of pissing off anyone or missing any appoinments. She will pull the rug out from under you and refuse to see you ever again. I would recommend going somewhere else.
Typical doctor power-trip. Grrrrrrrr.

										During first week of April 2006, I was researching breast augmentations on the Internet.  I had decided some time back to finally undergo the procedure, but needed to learn about the different techniques, recovery times, costs, and so forth.
Shortly after beginning my research, I was contacted via email multiple times per week by a group calling itself Doctors Say Yes, doctorssayyes.com.  To say these guys were persistent would be an understatement.  I finally called them on May 16, 2006 and spoke with Tara Cunningham.
I was told that the company name was My Choice Medical of California, a company that provides financing of plastic surgical procedures as well as referral to highly qualified and board certified plastic surgeons.  I allowed them to run my credit information, and I was told I qualified with a  $999 down payment ($490 before and $509 at initial surgical consultation), and $249 monthly for 36 months.  I was also informed that should I choose to seek care elsewhere prior to my surgical consultation appointment, all monies would be refunded.  If I attended the surgical consultation and chose to not undergo the procedure, I would be refunded all monies paid, less $49.99 for the doctor's time.
This information is later confirmed by Grace Wagner, both by voice telephone and by email.  Ms. Wagner then called me a few times after that date to confirm I would make the June 29, 2006 appointment with a surgeon.
I did make my appointment with Jesse D. Mitchell, MD, but he wasn't even in town that day.  I was seen instead by Mani Nambiar, MD, who represented himself as a cosmetic surgeon.  We discussed methods and techniques, recovery times, and so forth.  He also noted I had a latex allergy, and asked what kind of reaction I get when I come in contact with latex.  Of course, the reaction is serious, hence the allergy.
I next spoke with Kate, one of several consultants I would meet with.  She had me pick a surgical date while she obtained from my credit card the balance of the deposit due ($509, for a total of $999).  I explained that Dr. Nambiar required I get a mammogram, due to my age, smoking, and long term hormone replacement therapy.  Hence, a surgical date was set for July 25, 2006, giving me enough time to complete the mammogram as well as some pre-operative lab work.
On July 17, 2006, all my lab work was completed.  I was also required to purchase a breast strap ($50) and medications ($100?).  The total costs of the lab work (not covered under the agreement, it turns out) and medicines and strap came to $220 out of pocket.  During the lab tests, a woman named Nila expressed concerns over my latex allergies, and ask a gentleman in the office about it.  The man told her it was not a problem, and that they just need to order disposable materials and supplies that were non-latex.
On July 19, 2006, the mammogram was done.
On July 21, 2006, an attempt was made to cancel or postpone the surgical date.  The claim was that they had yet to receive the results of the mammogram.  When I contacted the hospital where it was done, they said it is up to the doctor to request the information be sent by a specific date, and that if the doctor doesn't do so, it could take up to 10 days. The doctor's office was informed, and my surgery was scheduled for 7:30 am on July 25, 2006.
On July 24, 2006, at or about 9:30 am, I was called by Nila again, this time to inform me the surgery had been cancelled due to my latex allergy.  When I asked if it would be rescheduled, I was told no.  When I requested an immediate refund of monies paid, I was told no refund would be given, since I had signed a contract saying that I would forfeit all monies paid if a cancellation occurred, regardless of who cancelled or the reason for the cancellation.  For the remainder of the day, I could not get anyone to return my calls.
On July 25, 2006, I contacted Dr. Mitchell's office demanding an explanation and refund.  When I was told at 8:30 am that no one was in yet (other than the person answering the telephone), I gave them 30 minutes to return my call or I would begin taking legal measures to prosecute those involved for fraud.  About 40 minutes later they returned my call, but by this time I had called My Medical Choice of California, PMC and told them what was going on, and was on hold, so I bounced them to voice mail.
While on hold, I learned that the surgeon who was to operate on me was prohibited from performing surgical procedures as one of the many restrictions upon his license.  I also read the transcripts of the medical board's decision, and learned that the doctor had acted in a way contrary to the safety and well
being of the patient, causing her serious harm.  It was further determined that the doctor had actively sought to disguise and hide the seriousness of his actions.  I even learned that this was not the first incident of its type with this doctor, as multiple law suits are on record with the Riverside Superior Court
On July 26, 2006, I was told at 2:15 pm that I had until 3:30 pm to get to a Dr. Robinson's office in Orange, CA, a surgeon who was willing to see me right away and get me in for surgery.  I arrived at 3:10 pm, and completed any paperwork they required.  Unfortunately, I was never allowed to even get a glimpse of the doctor.  I was instead greeted by Kate, who told me that I would not be able to see that doctor because he was too expensive. for me.  She told me she would arrange for Wallace Goodstein, MD or Alex Kim, MD to see me, both of Beverly Hills, CA.  The tentative schedule was for mid September 2006.
That night, I ran both names through the state medical board database.  Dr. Goodstein apparently has multiple findings of negligence, gross negligence, incompetence, and failure to maintain accurate and adequate documentation against him, and is on probation for 5 years as a result.  Mr. Kim shows no professional license of any kind issued in California, not even as a nursing assistant or home health aid.
On July 27, 2006, Kate contacted me to say she had not been able to schedule me with Dr. Goodstein.  I explained my findings, and told her I wouldn't take an aspirin from him given the public information about him.  I also told her that Mr. Kim was not a doctor or any other kind of licensed or certified health care professional, at least not in California.  I explained that I wanted my money back, and she said she couldn't help me.
I then called My Choice Medical of California, PMC, and spoke first with Stephanie, and then Dana Tucker.  I explained to both what I had been through, what I had learned about the doctors, and so forth.  I insisted they refund the monies paid to date, minus the $49.99 for the initial consultation.  I told them that I was uncomfortable dealing with them because at least 80% of the doctors had serious legal and ethical issues, one of whom may not even be a doctor to begin with.  A random sample of 28 plastic surgeons taken from the yellow pages and within 100 miles of my home determined that only 3 had previous legal or ethical issues, with only one having been in the last 10 years (9 years 6 months ago).  That puts the disciplinary rate at roughly 10%, compared to My Choice Medical of California's rate of at least 80%.
I was told by Ms. Tucker that she would have to speak with her supervisor, because they have a zero refund policy in the contract, regardless of what the circumstances are.  She said, however, that it would be her strong recommendation that I receive a full refund as requested, given the circumstances and what I learned.
Given the number of times I have been lied to and so forth, I seriously doubt I will see anything refunded without a judge ordering it.  More likely, this is a stall tactic to keep me from contacting my bank to dispute the charges made against my credit card for the down payment.  So, I have contacted my bank, told them what is going on, and they have filed a dispute against the two charges for a total of $999, and issued a provisional credit to my account.  They have also advised me to close my account at the earliest possible convenience, and to reopen the account under a different number.  This is due to the fact that they required my banking information to automaticly pay for the balance of the procedure.
The following is a matter of public record on the doctors My Choice Medical referred me to.  In some cases, transcripts are available to the public, either online or by mail (fee).  Court records on these individuals is available from the various courts, except for Mr. Kim, the unlicensed doctor who appears to not exist.

										The office is open until 6pm during the day, but the only person at the office is the secretary.  The doctor is there three days a week from 6pm-9pm.  If you leave a message with the secretary for the doctor (Dr. Michael Brown), he never returns your phone call.  It is hard to reach him at 6pm, because that is when most offices are closed.
The secretary has no knowledge of anything.  If you speak to the office manager, he will tell you that he will call you back but he never does. Patients call for weeks trying to get there test results, prescriptions, questions answered, appointments scheduled, etc.  But it does not happen.  The doctor tells you the day of your appointment he will do something, but he does not.
Pharmacists, several professionals, and patients have the same complaints.  If you mention the name of the practice around town people laugh, because they are aware of how awful the practice runs their business.
It is unfair to the patients and professionals to constantly call and the doctor does not respond.  You can call for weeks or a month at a time and no one returns your call.  Patients till this day are waiting on prescriptions to be wrote and test results to be given but the doctor is unable to be reached.  These are sick patients and it is very unfair.
I would not recommend this practice to anyone.  They are very unprofessionl.

New York, New York U.S.A. ",,212-7720505,"Robert V. Cattani, M.D. Butcher Surgeon in Posh New York City Neighborhood New York New York","
										In 2002, I went to Robert V. Cattani, M.D., in New York City, for a consultation for a rhinoplasty to correct damage caused by a childhood accident. After a thorough interview, we agreed on the date for the surgery. He was very kind, and put my mind at ease.
The surgery went off without a hitch. However, a few weeks after my bandages came off and the swelling went down, I realized something was wrong. The left side of my nose had ""collapsed"", the nostrils were very different, the tip looked like it was sliding off one side, and was literally JUTTING OUT from my face.
I made an appointment and showed Mr. Cattani what was happening. He pooh-poohed me, saying that it was fine, to give it a few more weeks and that if the tip was still jutting out, he would inject the cartiledge with steroids to bring it down.
I was horrorfied, and got a second opinion from another surgeon who is tops in her field, and who I didn't see originally because of the high cost. She warned me that cartiledge isn't ""brought down"" with steriods, that the damage was permanent, and that only surgery would correct it. He had taken too much material from my nose and weakened the structure, causing the deformity.
Of course I was now scared to ask him to fix his mistake, as he had pretended nothing was wrong and so therefore showed himself to be unscrupulous, not someone I should trust to put me under the knife again. So I went back to ask him to please return my money to me so that I could fix his mistake. He saw me again, heard what my second opion said, and after an examination (where he remained silent and no longer pretended nothing was wrong), he said that he was going to consult with a ""colleage"" to get a second opinion, and would get back to me.
SECOND OPINION?!?! I acquienced, thinking that his conscious would get the best of him and that he would, in the end, do the honorable thing and refund my money. He insisted I take a few pictures for his 'colleage' (i.e. lawyer), and said he would get back to me. He didn't. He never got back to me, even after I repeatedly called and sent him letters. 
Finally, after 3 weeks I went to see him at his office in person, and he had his secretary tell me that he was busy, that I'd have to call to make an appointment.
Four days later, I received a letter from him, WARNING me that if I returned there, he would call the police. I couldn't believe this man called himself a doctor.
He is a con-man, incompetent, and unconscionable. I never got it fixed as the surgery is now more expensive than it would have been originally, because it now requires reconstruction. I just hope and pray no one else gets dupped into allowing this butcher to take a scalpel to their body.
Please beware of this man. It is frightening that he is still in business, just because people assume that the office he holds for consultation is in a posh neighborhood and so therefore he must be good. He's not. He's a monster.

(((ROR redacted address,email, and phone number for security purposes)))
September 6, 2006
To All Concerned:
This letter is to inform the news media, general public and more importantly, women who use the birth control pill Levlite 28. 
In February 2006 my wife Veronica was sent by her doctor to see an OB-GYN Dr. Diane Brinkman at the Austin Regional Clinic in Austin, Texas for imaging of a Fibroid Tumor. My wife at the time is 52. During my wife's visit Dr. Brinkman recorded my wife's medical history which aside from the tumor was very good health. My wife advised Dr. Brinkman of her complications with her monthly cycles and the doctor gave my wife 30 day samples of Levlite 28.
No verbal or written instructions given. No verbal or written warnings of this drug were disclosed by Dr. Brinkman. After about 3wks of using L28 my wife developed symptoms that appeared that she was in some type of cardiac distress and was rushed to the hospital. She was placed in intensive care for several hours and was diagnosed with massive blood clots in both legs and lungs. She was hospitalized for several days. The damage now is that now my wife must remain on blood thinners for the rest of her life.She cannot lift anything over 20lbs. She must wear a medic alert bracelet at all times.
She is easily fatigued.She suffers from chest discomfort and chronic leg pain. She cannot work ever again. (She was earning $600.00 p/w before this happened)
She has been diagnosed with Depression & Anxiety
The family discussed this matter and we decided that someone must be made accountable for this and we agreed that Dr. Brinkman in our opinion was negligent and careless with dispersing this drug to my wife. I did extensive research on Levlite 28 and all the appropriate warnings are posted online and with pharmacies that sell it. However samples are not accompanied with warnings and if that is the norm then the responsibility should be with the medical professionals that supply the product to their patients. But what is disturbing about his case is that my wife should never have been given this drug due to her age and history. My wife has never used birth control pills and was not educated properly on the risk. Other doctors and her current cardiologist agreed that this was improper. 
We at this time have sought legal help from several firms in the Austin area only to be denied because of reasons that mystify us. We are told that Levlite 28 is considered a low hormone, low risk drug and the doctor is not responsible for giving verbal warnings and other law professionals are just interested in going after the drug manufacturer.  Whatever the reasons, my wife is suffering and her life has been changed from someone that was working, shopping, physically active with housework, caring for her grandchildren, etc. Now she mostly sits at home with extremely limited activity. 
We have discussed this case with family members, friends and strangers and all are outraged and urge us to get legal satisfaction but lawyers are telling us that there is no case or they are not capable of pursuing this case. Well I will not accept this, nor will the rest of our families.
So we intend to advise the local public of Dr. Brinkman's casual issue of Levlite 28 and the risks, we will advise all local & national news agencies and hope they will spotlight this incident and investigate any incidents that mirror the events mentioned above. And we will also spread the events in this letter on the World Wide Web especially to women's magazines and health websites, and all blogs and bulletin boards that appropriately address medical issues for women. We will also advise all consumer groups and regulatory agencies about this matter as well.  (For instance Rip-Off Reports.com) he most important point is to alert the public so no other woman will suffer due to reckless medical consultation or practices.
I and the rest of the family would like to acknowledge and thank the staff at the(((ROR redacted competior's name))) Rund Rock, Texas for their outstanding care, professionalism and support for my wife throughout this crisis. You represent what other medical centers and professionals should strive to be across the USA!

										I went to Skinovative in Chandler and paid almost $3,000.00 for a Thread Lift. I literally threw $3,000.00 in the trash. I went through major pain swelling and bruising all over my face including a black eye for over three weeks and I still have terrible pain in my hairline area. 
Worse, there was no improvement whatsoever in fact it has disfigured my face. Now I have noticiple  lines in my cheeks three on one side and 2 on the other. These are lines, lumps actually from the Threads protruding through the skin and one side of my face droops worse than before the procedure. 
Dr Nelson the butcher who proformed the procedure even agreed that no lifting occured when we viewed the before anfd after photos. I was not looking for dramatic results. I look young for my age 55 because I had a mini lift 10 years ago and needed only minor lifting for marionet lines.  This is what they advertise ""It will soften nasolabial folds, as well as marionette lines. ""Those patients who have already experienced a face-lift may benefit from the Thread Lift to restore the waning results."" That is false advertising it is just not true.
They advertise the Thread lift as: ""An innovative, minimally invasive procedure has recently been introduced and is an exciting alternative to standard surgery. The ThreadLift? (also called a ?Featherlift?), is a revolutionary, non-invasive procedure that uses fine surgical threads made of prolene (a plastic, non-absorbable suture) to lift the droopy areas of the brow, cheeks, jowl and neck. Think of it like a tiny, sophisticated shoelace that corrects the unwanted sagging that areas of your face have developed over time. In only 60 minutes, you can achieve approximately 50-60% of what a standard facelift can offer you for substantially less cost and almost no recovery time."" I looked like a truck hit me for four weeks. It was very painful!
That is what they advertise, don't believe it! When I confronted the Dr. he offered me no compensation or resolution. He offered to put filler in the marrionette creases as a consolation. He became suddenly very unfriendly and curt. He stated I cannot sue because I signed certain papers and that there was no garuntee of results, then he made several outrageous lies regarding what he told me before he performed the procedure. 
Dr Nelson is a butcher with no morals and Skinovative is a dishonest and makes fradulent claims about the threadlift procedure. Don't let them rob you be forewarned, so you don't go through a horrible and costly expierience like I did. I now have to go through the expence of having the threads removed and hope that thepain goes awaty with the thread lines protruding out under my skin.

On February of 2006 he went back in to lift the left side and remove the left-over scar tissue on right side.  The result was fine on the right side, but he left side was not only 2 inches lower (as before) but there was a huge indentation on the front of the breast and I was in terrible pain on that side.
On June 16, 2006 he went in for the 3rd time to correct the left side calling the procedure ""raise left breast crease"". The result was a new incision at the base of my left breast, no correction on the indentation of the breast and to this day terrible pain.  I will not call or go back to see that person.

This Doctor would use patients to get paid via there insurance companys even when the patient didnt truly need to be seen and when the patient would arrive, on some occasions I wouldnt even be examined. This Doctor would make repeaded mistakes such as writing prescriptions on the wrong type of script paper, forgetting to write the dates, forgetting microgram or MG on the script etc etc which would only result in one thing, I couldnt fill my scripts & had to drive ALLLLLLLLLLLLL the way back to the Dr.s office only to be told she has gone for the day already or, I would have to wait in the waiting room for her to correct her mistake.
The problem with all that is it was a HUGE inconveinance to me and it was ALWAYS something. Always.Stiles-Walker has a way of manipulating the conversation & deflecting any responsibility off her & placing it somehow onto the patient. I recall a time where she DID NOT write the correct script & I happen to catch it before I left her office & she stated to me ""These papers I write scripts on are very expensive & I will not be re-writing a new one"" and she ""scribbled"" on it & left her initials so the pharmacy would know its ""ok"" which only resulted in me eventually having to drive back to her office & getting a new one well it would have been prevented all together because I caught the mistake before I left that day.  I got sick & tired of being inconveinanced &^ having to come back and forth due to not my mistakes and errors, but her mistakes and errors and to me, this shouldnt be constant like it was. Mistakes happen, but with her it was CONSTANT!!!! 
Gas and time are precicious to me & she just didnt seem to care. I got sick and tired of having to be ""seen"" in her office over n over n over n over n over again for absolutly nothing, or the SAME crap that she just seen me for a week before...Why am I here ??? She writes th e WRONG prescription & I get it home and see its WRONG (again) & call the office to tell them that she accidently wrote the WRONG script and I was told ""The Doctor needs to see you""!!!! Im like ""What? you gotta be kidding me-I was just there for the same crap""!!!!! (But see, going to see her twice in a row like that she gets paid by my insurance company so it works out great for her) SO because of her incompetance,ignorance and just flat out not paying attn to what the patient says (me) she writes me the wrong script and once again, I pay the price because I have to drive all the way out there, sit and wait to be seen (And i was just there for the same exact crap) and then get called into the examination room and she DIDNT EVEN EXAM ME THIS TIME!!! WHAT!!!! Thats proof she just wanted to get paid for the office visit!! I mean think about it now folks...Here is a Doctor who works like 10 hours a week...she has got to get her money from somewhere and for quite sometime, I was her bread and butter!! She has got me into so many bad positions it aint even funny!! Once she said she would refer me to the E.R. and like a dumbass I beleived her (because she was my Dr.) and so I ended up going to the E.R. and my insurance didnt pay for it because the hospital NEVER received the ""referral"" from my Dr.s office so this means that the hospital is sueing me!!! I told my Dr. about it and she insists that I bring in the paperwork from the hospital stating they are sueing me....Does she not beleive me? Im lying about this? Shoot, had she been RESPONSIBLE AND COMPETANT ENOUGH to have provided the referral in the first place, there wouldnt even be paperwork from the hospital collections for her to even insist that I show her!!! But see, u cant tell her that !!!! 
This Doctor has the whole ""God"" complex....Alot of Doctors do. She is ALWAYS right and you are ALWAYS wrong,period,end of story!!! I actually got into the habit of ""proof reading"" and ""double checking"" her homework meaning when she would give me my scripts, I would make damn sure she dotted all her T's and tittled all her I's because I knew there was a 95% chance I would leave that office and something would be wrong wrong wrong wrong!! She would also ALWAYS find a reason to make me come in to be seen even though 3 weeks before when I was in her office she would tell me ""lets skip one month and u just come and get your scripts and come in to see me in 2 months"" but when I would call about some refill (non-narcotic) and a repeaded medication (nothing new) she would make me come in to be seen!! 
Now I used to think it was because she cared about her patients but I know differently now because if she cared, why did she NOT examine me every single time then? Make me come out there, wait in the waiting room, call me back there, leave me in the waiting room for 20 mins (which thats fine I understand that, thats all Dr. offices :)) but then when u finally come in u dont even freaking examine me, u just write a script out and throw it my way? Why did I come then? She could of called that script in because I already had a script for it, but it was the wrong application thats all, it was the correct medication and everything just wrong application plus it had several refills on it so I know she could of called a script like that into the pharmacy but if she would of done that like that, she wouldnt of GOT PAID for the office visit and trust me, she isnt into ""listening"" to what u got to say on the subject because remember, she is always RIGHT and u are WRONG!! 
She wasnt the one constantly being inconveinanced...I was. Also, I know for a fact that she has discussed me with OTHER patients because I have been told these this and I am filing a complaint about this with the Attorney General. Also, some of the things that I was told that she said in reference to me isnt even true....She embellished the truth about things and left things out!! Do I recommend this Dr? Hell no!! Not unless u mind driving to their office not once, not twice but ""4"" times for a tooth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If u dont mind being used like she used me, then go!!! If U got all the time in the world to proof-read her work and constantly be seen for things that u shouldnt even be seen for and then u dont even get examined when u are there then YES, I highly recommend this woman.
 P.S. oh...I will save that for the Attorney General.

Chandler, Arizona U.S.A. ",,480-855-7546,"Skinnovative Laser Center Thermage treatments are a complete ripoff!!  They keep no records of their ""mistakes"" like causing a drooping eye from WRONG placement of BOTOX!!! Chandler Arizona","
										Skinovative Laser Center boasts on their website and in their brochures about a new skin tightening procedure called ""Thermage"" claiming to grow new collagen which tightens the skin and reduce wrinkles.  They say that results peek in about 6 months.  There has been absolutely no results, and it has been 7 months.  This treatment is a complete rip-off.  
I have been getting botox injections for 2 years prior to my experience with Skinovative Laser Centers.  A few weeks after my Thermage treatment, I went in for botox for my lines between the eyes (that I have had done several times before at another laser service) and Dr. J.D.McCoy gave me injections where I had never had them before. Before he injected me I asked why he was putting the injections right above my eyebrow and he said, ""This is a great spot for lifting your brows.""  
The next day I woke up and my eyelid was drooping, and as the day went on it got worse and worse.  I called him and asked him about what was going on and he wanted me to come in.  When I did (Mind you I live in Cave Creek and they are in Chandler) he told me that he had never had anyone's eye droop and wrote me a prescription for eye drops to help open up my eye (So I could see).  At that time he told me my next Botox treatment would be free and guaranteed it would not happen again, and that he was sorry.  
When I went to fill the prescription the eye drops were $160!  This condition lasted about 5 weeks!  After doing research on the internet I discovered that giving injections where Dr. McCoy had given them to me was in the ""NO ZONE"".  I felt wronged right then, and the only reason I didn't file a complaint then was his offer to rectify the situation and offer my next treatment for free.  
Six months went by and I called for my free treatment and Dr. McCoy no longer works there.  I told the current manager, Lynn, about what had happened.  She told me she he didn't work there anymore.  I told her to contact him and remind him of who I was to jog his memory.  She told me after pulling my file that there was nothing indicating anything like that in the file.  I told her I could proove it by showing her the receipt for the eyedrops and the drops themselves perscribed by Dr. McCoy.  
After a couple of weeks of her trying to contact him, she finally called back and informed me that he said he never offered ma a free treatment, because that was against the rules of Skinovative Laser Center.  
Basically I think Skinovative Laser Center should be held accountable for the promises of their employees, their actions and the services and results they are advertising.

They said:  ""Why did Dr. Goco FAIL TO SIGN IT?"", ""Its been sitting here on the manager's desk for two weeks.""   and failed to pay me the $100. He caused me anger and depression for months! upset my friends who I told about it, Lied & deceived me.  He claimed we had not discussed the ""upper lids"" the year b-4, which was a blatant lie, so he could 'jack up' the price $200 over the year b-4.

										The receptionist told me that the office visit charge would be $50.00, or higher, if lab work and X-rays were done. I scheduled a 2:30 PM appointment, for treatment for a upper respiratory infection.
Upon arrival, the doctor was alone, with no one else present. He asked for my debt card and driver's license, which I submitted. The doctor asked me to verify my debt card pin, after he swiped the card in the reader. I typed in my pin, thinking that it was for verification only.
The doctor handed me a receipt for $120.00. I asked him if he had just debted my card for $120.00, and he replied, ""Yes."" So, by fraudulent means, the doctor took $120.00 from me, without my clear authorization.
Since I felt so bad from the respiratory infection, and must not have been thinking clearly, I allowed the doctor to examine me for the $120.00, instead of asking him to refund my money.
After a quick examination, of under five minutes, the doctor tried to charge me an additional $125.00, to write two prescriptions, for an antibiotic and an expectorant.
At this point, I accused the doctor of fraud and demanded a refund of the $120.00. He replied that the $120.00 charge was for the examination only. He would not write the prescriptions unless I paid him an additional $125.00!
See for a local news story: http://www.wate.com/Global/story.asp?s=5673091
I have submitted a disputed transaction to my bank, with the hope that I can get the $120.00 back.

										I went to this urgent care facility because it was the only near by medical facility that was open late at night on the weekend. I was having severe back pain and could barely manage to even get there after using what was left of my pain medication, which was prescribed to me at that same location about 1 year before for the same problem. When I arrived I signed in and waited, and waited, and waited. It was about 6 hours until I was finally ""treated"". Dr. Kristina Masuga MD was the doctor treating me and asked about my back. I told her that I had been diagnosed with mild curvature of the spine in the past and have back pain and spasms about once every year. She looked at my back and thought it looked straight and thought I was making this story up. She recommended an x-ray ($263.00) to see if there were any other possible problems. I agreed to it because she is the doctor, she is supposed to know what is best. She got the x-ray back and said everything looked ok. After asking if I could at least have something for the pain she declined to give me anything stating that it wouldnt be right because she couldnt find anything wrong with me. I insisted there had to be something causing the pain and that I should get what was given to me on my last visit (muscle relaxer, and pain killer) because that is what helped last time and she refused. I wasted 6 hours of my time $499.90 for the total visit cost to have some doctor that thinks she knows everything tell me the pain was in my head and I should see a specialist. If she was unqualified to diagnose a back problem she should have turned me away before running up 500 dollars in medical expenses. Besides where would I find a specialist willing to see me at 10pm at night on the weekend. Thanks for nothing Dr. Kristina Masuga MD. Maybe you should try beleiving your patients about their pain instead of thinking everyone is just out to get high on pain killers. Next time I have a need for pain killers or medication, instead of waiting 6 hours and spending $500.00. I will just spend 3 hours driving down to Mexico and $50.00 buying all the meds I need. I hope one day you realize just how much pain a bad back can cause and then you have a fellow Dr. refuse to write you a prescription because he thinks your making it all up.

They make you watch a video about people who have lost weight (their marketing tool) - and then they talk to you about your weight history and a little bit about what the program entails.  Not until you've been there for an hour or so do they SPRING the news on you that it costs $2600 to join this 3 month program!  The $20 per pound is only good up to 30 pounds, so you can recoop $600 of your money.  It's a scam.  Their defense to this when questioned was that the flier doesn't say the program is FREE!

										I went to this OBGYN because I was pregnant and this is who my insurance at the time sent me to. Everything was fine until my daughter decided it was time she was ready to come out, I was due Oct 17th according to the doctors, even tho according to my last period I was due September 15, It was my first pregnancy so me and my hubbie decided to trust the doctors, I had originally been seeing the downtown office doctors and we moved and the Germantown office was 20 minutes closer to where we were moving to. When I was going to the Downtown office I never saw an actual Doctor it was always interns and always a different one each visit which made me nervous being a first time mother and all.
So we asked for a transfer since we were moving and wanted a closer location thats where the office in Germantown comes in. We started going to this office and everything seemed to go fine. I was seeing Dr. Anand and I really liked her. This all occurred in 2002. On October 15th I had a Doctor\'s appointment I had been having contractions since about 230am that morning and I went to my appointment like normal and told Dr.Anand and she was like ok if the baby don't come by this weekend we will do and inducement Tuesday morning I was like ok fine I was 1 1/2 centimeters dilated she said . Well my contractions were 6 minutes apart and my water bag was leaking I know it was leaking because I was staying extremely wet (hope thats not to graphic I apologize if it is) Well Dr.Anand sent me home. I went home still having contractions but I was listening to the Doctor. Wednesday I was still having contractions and when my husband got home from work we went to the hospital. The contractions were 8 minutes apart and I was less than 1 centimeter dilated the doc at the E.R. said, and my doc wasn't on call it would be a different doctor from the medical group who would be delivering my baby if it was decided to go on and take her. I was throwing up & extremely dehydrated and it was the 16th of October now remember I was due October 17th, well they sent me home and told me to just relax I was a first time mom and I was over exaggerating, and of course that ticked me off but what was I suppose to do ya know, well on October 17th, I was at home with my mother there with me in case anything happened and I needed help because we had just moved about a week before and my hubbie was still moving everything from our old house to the new one. well I went into full hard back labor ( all of the contractions were in my back) and they were 2 minutes apart. my parents lived a block away and so my dad came and got me and brought me to the hospital, I believe it was 10 pm at this point, well we got to the hospital around 10:30 pm, they put me on a fetal monitor, (the nurse did) and around 11 pm a doctor Dr.Hsu (pronounced sue)came in and in a very calm and quiet voice told me they had to do an emergency c section because every time I had a contraction the baby stopped breathing, and I was less than 1/2 a centimeter dilated I was literally closing up and they never found out why. 
(btw this is the first time I had even talked to a Dr. since I had arrived in the maternity E.R.)We were at Methodist Hospital Germantown, The Dr. left and I was wheeled into surgery at 11:55 pm on her due date my daughter was born from an emergency c section 7 lbs 7 oz 21 1/2 inches long. This was a Thursday night, well they sent me home Sunday afternoon and told me to come back in on Tuesday October 22nd to the doctors office for a check up we went and since my normal Dr. had not delivered my baby I had to see the Dr. that did which was Dr.Hsu. Well Dr.Hsu had cut me from hip to hip on my bikini line for the c-section and she had used copper studded staples (im highly allergic to copper)which I put in my forms when I filled them out for the Dr.\'s office. Well Dr.Hsu didn't stay in the exam room with me long she went and got my normal Doc Dr. Anand to come in and remove the staples and talk with me about how to clean my incision and what not well a nurse came in to remove the staples, and she apologized every time he removed one cause having staples removed really does hurt. Dr. Anand came in when the nurse was done to look at my incision, she said it was healing up fine but there was one spot on the left side of my incision that was red and she wanted to go ahead and put me on antibiotics so it wouldn\'t get infected, we left went and got the prescription i took the antibiotic and went to bed that night well the next morning my daughters pediatrician wanted to see her since she was an emergency c section, we got dressed to leave and when we were walking out the front door we smelled this horrible smell which we thought the baby had filled her diaper and my hubbie noticed my pants were wet well we thought i had an accident cause we were told it could happen after having a baby with everything moving back into place, My hubbie went to change the baby I went to the bathroom and when i pulled my pants down the smell hit me and knocked me to my knees, There was so much infection coming from my incision it was green puss pouring down my leg that my hubbie called the Doctors office they wanted me to come in immediately my aunt was in town so she came and got the baby and brought her to her doctors appointment while my hubbie brought me to my Doctors office, we got there and Dr. Anand met us in the waiting room with a wheel chair and immediately wheeled me to an exam room she looked at the incision and told us that it was definitely infected and she wanted to open it up and see how deep the infection was and that if it was to deep that I would have to go to the hospital to get it cleaned and fixed, she gave me 2 Valiums and it took 5 nurses and my hubbie in there to to hold me down while she took a pair of scissors to reopen my incision to look at it and she determined that it was not to deep that she could clean it and fix it , she used saline solution and packed it with gauze and wanted this done 5 times a day , it took me 5 mos of home health nurses coming everyday and my hubbie cleaning it and packing it before it healed, and many many visits back to the E.R because new puss pockets kept coming up and they had me on 3 protein shakes a day to increase healing before it completely closed back up. I got pregnant again when my daughter was 6 mos old and it wasn't planned we had new insurance so we used a new doctor and because of the births being so close together he only wanted to do a c section when he did the c section it took an hr and a half longer than it was suppose to because he was trying to fix the incision and there was quite a bit of scar tissue, he had to remove before he could even perform the c section This was march 1st 2004. my incision never got infected he checked my incision on every visit to make sure it wasn't being to stretched by the pregnancy he was wonderful, i did keep a yeast infection on the incision during my 2nd pregnancy and he stayed on top of it. Til this day I am still having complications with my incision, If i move the wrong way or stay bent over to long even during intercourse with my husband the left side of the incision hurts where the infection was the deepest which is where the red spot was at when I was first put on the antibiotics , it has made life difficult . I cant sit on the floor and play with my kids cause If i get up wrong it pulls my incision , on my period all I do is hurt on the left side of my incision, there are some days I hurt so bad in my incision that I cant move and it makes my life hard because I have 2 small children and I am a stay at home mom, I have tried getting disability because of this and have been denied I am in constant pain. 
I have had ultrasounds down and all kinds of tests have been run and no one can seem to figure out why I still hurt like I do. I have contacted lawyers regarding this and have been told by them that there is no medical malpractice here, that I will just have to live with the pain and have been told by many doctors that the reason my incision got infected is because I am overweight and had a stomach when my daughter was delivered (please tell me what female has a flat stomach after having a baby)I did gain weight while pregnant which is normal and I am having a very difficult time getting the stomach off I have just recently gotten feeling back in my lower stomach and around where the incision is at and its 2007, I have been told that there is no reason for my incision to still be as sensitive as it is. I am tired of not being able to live a normal life, because of the constant pain that I am in all of the time so if anyone has any advice or anything for me I would greatly appreciate it because I am tired of hurting. I don't know what the statues of limitation are on something like this I was told by 2 lawyers it was 6 mos after it happened and I don't believe that, personally I think they just didn't feel like being bothered, I don't know. So with all this said I hope someone can help me out here with what I should do now, any and all comments emails etc are welcome on advice. I advise friends and family to not use this medical group because of this incident, and have met others in life and online who have had this same problem with this hospital and with this medical group this is a very prominent medical group in this state and its obvious that they don't care about the lives of their patients, I could have died because of this and it seems that no one cares..

										Well I needed my medical records for a particular reason I spoke with this nasty old bag named Florence Kra in the billing department about retrieving my medical records.  She was really nasty and stated until unpaid ""no show"" office visits are paid then she will not release the requested documents. See, in order for you to cancel an office visit without being fined a $25 fee, you must call within 24 hours to cancel wich i did. This old dirty rag named Florence Kra said that its noted in the system what time patients called. she is a liar and this office always get over like that.  She also stated that her office is ALWAYS right and PATIENTS are always wrong and they cannot be trusted. DO NOT trust this office. They PAD there bills and refuse to fix them. Also if you want any documents out your fie, ANY and ALL fake charges they put in your file must be paid first.  Also i left several messages for this doctor to call me back and he never once returned my call. This office is HELL on earth. DONT GO HERE.

Henderson, Nevada U.S.A. ",,702-990-4530,"Dr. Claudia Katherine Vogel Of Endocrinology Beware of Possible Death-Causing Negligent, Abusive Doctor Claudia Katherine Vogel of Endocrinology and Bull-Dog Office/Medical Assistants. Expulsing Patients out of office base on skin color and insurance. Henderson Nevada","
										I am writing this letter concerning the discriminating treatment I received from the Office of  Dr. Claudia Katherine Vogel of Endocrinology located at 100 N. Green Valley Pkwy., Suite 340 Henderson, NV  89074.
On Friday March 23, 2007 I called Dr. Vogel's office to schedule an appointment to review my thyroid levels in order to get a renewal of prescription.  All the endocrinologists that I have been to in the past require that I get my blood tested prior to the visit so that they can prescribe the correct dosage of medicine.  Therefore, I wanted to speak with Dr. Vogel to discuss arranging this prior to my visit.
However, the treatment I received on the call was shocking to say the least.  I spoke with the receptionist named Shawne who was very impolite and was not willing to schedule an earlier appointment in order to get my prescription.  My thyroid pills were about to run out and I cannot miss one day of my medicine so this was a pretty urgent request. 
Since she would not consider my position and I was at her mercy, I was willing to go without the medication and take an appointment that would have caused me to become irregular in my medication.  The appointment would have been in late May, Two months from the initial call.
 However, I did request that the doctor send me the TSH Rx for my blood work so that I could at least have the lab work taken care of ahead of time before my visit. She told me that the doctor was not in the office in which I said 'please take the message for her and have her call me' in order for me to ask the doctor to send me the blood work Rx, but she decided to transfer me to a nurse named Hilary, explaining what I needed and that I would like to speak with the Doctor.  
Hilary was adamant about how she will not give the doctor any message and that I NEED to come in to see the doctor in order to get the paperwork, and when I asked to speak to the office manager she told me that they do not have one. At this point I could not get a word in with her.
The tone of the conversation became even more disturbing.  I explained to Hilary that my employer would not allow me to miss so many days of work and that the Dr. usually makes arrangements to allow me to get my blood work before my visit, but she still refused to take a message.  I also explained that my Thyroid condition required that the Dr. check my levels as soon as possible because the prescription she had me fill was about to run out.
Again, I was told the same repetitive line, 'The Doctor is not in the office today', which I understood.  At this point I was so aggravated that I was willing to make the appointment anyway but I still wanted to speak with the Doctor.  Hilary continued to refuse to take a message for the Doctor.  She also lied and said that the Doctor did not fill prescriptions over the phone.  I have proof that Dr. Vogel has done this for me in the past and that was not even the issue here.  All I needed was a prescription authorizing blood work prior to my visit so that she could correctly adjust my medication.
As you can imagine, my frustration was growing and I asked her 'has your office ever gotten a law suit for treating your patient in this manner?' she said for me to 'GO AHEAD AND CALL A LAWYER!!' and hung up on me. And then within 10 minutes she called me back to say that the Doctor was discharging me as a patient and they were cancelling any future appointments.' How can a Doctor give a nurse such authority to treat her/his own patient in that manner?  
I am infuriated with the situation especially when Dr. Vogel herself had told me that if I ever had any questions for her, that I should call and even if she was not available, that I could leave a message and she would return my call.  I resent the fact that Hilary blocked my patient right to have Dr. Vogel call me and that I was discharged attempting to stand up for my patient rights.
I am writing this letter with the hope that I will be able to see some kind of Justice in this matter.  I appreciate your time in looking into this case.

										Dr. Ashraf and began a new fee chart that is unfair and not right to all.  Any type of witten paper including perscriptions, there is a 15.00 charge.  According to Pacific Care my insurance copany, this is a office visit co-pay.  Tis is all fine and good if she is also paying for our perscriptions to.   I have one perscription that is a class II narcotic for a specific condition I have which is Narcolepsy,  This has to be wriiten every time and reported to DEA.  She charges me 15.00 to write this perscription and then I have to pay to co-pay at the pharmacy for $10.00.  I am in essence paying twice for the drug  for my narcolepsy,  DextroAmphedamine.  On 10/17/2007, I had a Jury summins  I needed Dr. Ashrtaf to sign.  I was a ecuse due to the Narcolepsy and for P.A.D. (Peripherial Arterial Desease).  I was also to be  charged 15.00  for this.   So I am payinga co-pay to Dr. Ashraf and then to the pharmacy for the drug,  This fee frenzy to me does not sound ethical or right.   Binging on disabiliy,  Social Security  SSI my income is somewhat limited and medications in my case can get expensive.  I'm not sure what is right in this case but part of it seems very wrong.

I called to make an appt for a new cast to be put on and I was questioned very rudely about how the cast came apart and was told I'd have to pay for the new cast because they doubted CHIP would cover the cost. 
I asked if someone there could call to inquire about whether the 2nd cast was covered, and was told, ""you can make that call if you'd like, but we won't"". I was transferred 3 times before Marsha, the office mgr told me I should have gone to another dr if I didn't like the service I was receiving.

										My family physician, Dr. Sylvia Keresztes, has been providing her services to my family for as long as I can remember. Many people who know her are taken aback by her lack of bedside manner and gruff exterior. I am one of those people but because of the doctor shortage have not been able to find a physician willing to take on the care of myself and my three young daughters. 
Recently, my children and I made a move 1 hour north of the city we lived in and I informed her that I would be making the trek back in order to keep my physicians. Apparently, because of her age she forgot that I informed herand felt jilted. Further exhibiting her unprofessional attitude, this so-called physician  decided to close the files of myself and my daughters without informing us, choosing to no longer see us as patients.
I had a severe kidney infection in need of antibiotics and my daughter was sick with a fever and terrible cough...when I called to make an appointment I was told that she was no longer my doctor and that I needed to find another physician in the city where I lived. She then abruptly, hung up the phone.
What is the re-course for this type of behavior? Can this doctor be held accountable for so blatantly dismissing and turning away my family when they were in need of medical assistance? Surely, something can be done about this. Otherwise, what's the point in keeping family physicians and their practices in business...why not use a walk-in clinic for any medical needs?
I am frustrated and disgusted that a practicing doctor can treat people in this manner...what is my family to do now?

										My mother went in for sinus surgery on 9/4/01. This doctor broke through her ethmoid bone (this bone separates your brain from your sinuses) and suctioned out part of the frontal lobe of her brain. During this he also passed through the eye orbit. 
The ripping out of her brain tissue, caused bleeding in the brain, resulting in a stroke and coma. She was airlifted to another hospital where a drain was put in her head for the blood. She was in and out of a coma for 1 week. When she woke her short term memory was GONE! 
I'll spare all the details, but it took lots of rehabilitation and working with therapists to be able to instill coping techniques of writing everything down and even now, 6 years later she does not have any short term memory. She is alive though...we are thankful for that. 
We did attempt to sue. However, the doctors insurance filed bankruptcy. Our attorneys then went after the doctor but of course he filed bankruptcy. Funny thing is only his attorney, our attorney, and mom's case was listed on the bankruptcy papers. He had transferred all his assets to his wifes name. 
Our lawyers were so certain we'd win in the beginning, they did not hold mom to the bill of 50K they had racked up preparing the case. 
I filed a report with the medical board once the case was closed and have not received a response. The doctor is still in practice and my mother's life will never be the same. Fair isn't it?

Clearwater, Florida U.S.A. ",,904-796-7705,"Dr Mark Sanchez - Dr Edward Zbella ""The Worst Tubal Reversal Surgery"" Absolutely Devastated! Clearwater Florida","
										I had a tubal reversal surgery done on 10-13-2005 in Clearwater by Dr Mark  Sanchez and Dr Edward Zbella.  To my findings from my gyn on 8-27-2007 my tubes were ruined after this surgery. The Drs gave me a consult the day of my surgery describing what method of tubal reversal they would perform on me (even drawing me a diagram showing how they would reconnect my tubes ); however, they performed a total different surgery without me or my husbands consent.  Dr. Sanchez states  when he went in I had a totally different tubaligation done from what my previous DR. described in his op notes. However, Dr. Sanchez failed to order my pathology report which would have given him the true diagnosis of what tubal ligation was performed on me. This particular information he needed was included in the pathology report.  By not finding this out caused my surgery to fail and the Dr performed a total different surgery on me.  I did not get a surgery reconnecting my tubes, instead I got a total different surgey. I would not have opted for this type of surgery considering the success rate.  I would have selected another option, being I was a self pay. This cost me $6500 plus room and board and a lot of pain, anxiety, and false hope, and 4 weeks off from work because I did not heal to where I could go back to work in 10 days.  
I am devastated because my fallopian tubes have be ruined from this surgery.  I have scar tissue from the type of surgery he performed and my tubes are now completed blocked, both of them beyond repair.
I have tried to work this out with the Dr. asking for a refund of some sort so that I can visit another infertility doctor for an IVF procedure or to see if this procedure somehow can be corrected by another doctor; however after a second opinion by a reputable Dr.  in Kentucky states it is almost impossible to correct because Dr. Sanchez  did not perform the procedure correctly from his findings.  Dr. Sanchez  will not give me a refund just a $3000 credit to use he services again for IVF.  I was quite uncomfortable because this DR did not give me any followup care or not even a phone call at the hotel after my first surgery.  I had a empty feeling inside as if I had been robbed.  Anyway, I did not know where to turn because I am still desparate for his services which will cost me and additional $8100 for IVF with the $3000 credit they are giving me, totally $11,100 for IVF.
After a lot of praying my partner encouraged me to go ahead with this doctor since I have a credit with them. I was scheduled for  injections to start my IVF procedure on 12.17.2007 and had completed all my   labs requested by them costing me additional fees.  Being this Dr. never  gave me and my partner a consult. My partner had a few questions wanting to know what is expected of him as far as what labs/test will be needed from him because I did not really know being I had no consult. So, I gave the nurse Tracy his number to call him and answer his questions ABOUT  THESE SPECIFIC TESTS. As she spoke to him,  he said she was very nonchalant  and cold to him with no type of compassion. He described feeling as if he was being hustled by a used car salesman.  He says he has never felt so uncomfortable before by someone he was going to be paying some of his money to.  He also stated that she told him that I was married, and that my file states I am married to D... R He advised her  that that is my file and this is something she should have questioned me about.  Anyway after this he definitely does not want to use their services and I now have to seek another IVF Doctor which I am sure is the best decision. Now, he is not comfortable either.  Also, for the record I am not married my husband is deceased!! Which is in a letter I sent to them on 8/27/07 when I found out the devasting news from my HSG.
My questions:
Am I entitled to a full refund from my surgery?
Are they liable for destroying my tubes by not ordering my pathology report (which includes the information they needed) being they were performing a surgery?
Is this breech of confidential information in my file about my marital status?
 Mind you I wrote a letter to them stating my husband was killed in a car accident,  I am widowed. If I was her main concern, she would have known that because all this information is in my file from a letter I sent then on 8.27.07 Please advise me of these issues.  I don't know what to do. I still desparate seek the services of an infertility Dr. but I have money tied up with this doctor who will not give me a refund to move forward. I am 38 years old and  I need to do these services as  soon possible  if I plan to have another child. What do I do from here

It is very upsetting that people get decieved in such a way by a so-called professional about going to get lasik with a physician who on top of it is NOT BOARD CERTIFIED.
He is such a liar, he claimed to have a equimpment that was not out of the market. Zyoptix 100.. when in fact.. I could see in his ads where this have been altered.
Why doesn't he writes a disclaimer like lawyers, cpas, or FDA Do when they are not bonded, or certified, or approved respectively??
He should state in his ads: ""Dr. Pena is NOT a BOARD CERTIFIED Surgeon by de American ophthalmology Board"" 
or something in those lines.
Deieving advertising should be called on him. 
1. DaMarcus Ware NOT having lasik with him
2. No such thing as Zyoptix 100 TM
3. NOT BOARD CERTIFICATION clarification.
How can you trust your eyes to a Dr. that did NOT pass their boards???

										Supremely bad customer service at doctor office of Michael Jakobsen... poor doctor review all the way around, this is a bad review starting with Dr. Michael Jakobsen, his head nurse is rude and he never listens, he just does his own thing, i told him exactly what was wrong because i had been seeing and talking with another doctor about my issue weekly for about 3 months prior, a problem i've had for many years as well, i had been referred by another doctor and had a scan of my nasal passages and the other doctor conferred that my right nasal passage was narrow, so which one does the doctor check? he doesn't even read the report (even though i had it faxed ahead of time from the radiologist and put in a personal request with his head nurse to go over it before i had arrived, she managed to talk with me before i made the appointment which lead me to believe she was a good communicator - that couldn't be further from the truth i found out, watch this-> ) Dr. Jakobsen didn't even read it when i was sitting in his office!! he scans it like a tabloid at the grocery counter and also he washes his equipment that he puts up your nose and recycles it?? the nurse told me that after she put something in my nose, how gross!! no i don't mean the scopic, i mean a sinus cone, a throw away cheap little 2 inch rubbery nasal washer to open your nasal passages at night.
His staff are very pushy and don't get back to you at all about anything. the doctor's voicemail is extremely unfriendly and so is his head nurse, they tell you how it is and that's all you get believe me!! good luck trying to contact the nurse or doctor before or after your appointments to ask them something, it's not going to happen!! then their front desk just keeps pushing you to leave messages, and round and round you go....and going back to Dr. Michael Jakobsen, so he doesn't even read the report, doesn't confer on any of the things the doctor who referred me to him was thinking as the cause of my illness, and then he tells me he wants to do a surgery and doesn't explain how it will help me. I go home kind of baffled, I call the head nurse and leave a message for her to please let me get in touch with Doctor Michael Jakobsen for my complaint because I didn't agree with his recommendation and I wanted to ask before my next appointment if he could reread the radiology report and think of other solultions. The nurse didn't get back to me that day. I called again the next day and left a message to speak with the doctor right away. No answer. Then the next day she calls me and says ""your voicemail is really long, make an appointment if you want to speak with the doctor, click. on my answering machine"" (even though her voice message is twice as long as mine - and I did manage to point that out to her on my following message to her - on her voicemail of course, no one is ever in Dr. Jakobsen's back office to handle phone calls if you actually need anything, and the desk operator is in the other room and the front desk appointment setter just transfers you to the operator) so then i reschedule and see him again without getting to talk with him beforehand.
At the new appointment with Dr. Michael Jakobsen of Head and Neck Surgery Adult and Pediatric Otolaryngology currently at 26726 Crown Valley Parkway Suite 200 Mission Viejo, CA 92653, 949-364-4361 i explain to him how he didn't really view the nasal passage that was narrow according to the radiology scan last time and so he just takes a one second peak then puts me in an mri machine in his office and comes back with the same explanation about a surgery that doesn't sound right for my illness and i told him that but he didn't seem listen and he did not offer any other suggestions. He puts me on a form of medication and leaves the room. Then I had two last questions about 3 minutes after he left because a nurse walked in to explain the medication, so i ask the head nurse right after the explanation to please have Dr. Michael Jacobsen in Otolaryngology (spelled incorrect on purpose - i want everyone to know about my love for you buddy :) before I i leave, the nurse says she will try, i sit in the office and wait a half an hour, i see the doctor walking 5 feet from my office back and forth into the rooms next to me, the nurse keeps coming over and closing my door, how rude is that? i kept having to open it, like 3 times she did that. 
anyways, the nurse refuses to get him and finally after 30 minutes of me sitting there she says if you want to see him you'll have to wait for his next 4 appointments, it will be about 1 hour, i say, i only have 2 questions, it will take about 30 seconds, she says sorry! The woman's name is Clara. well.... here's your christmas present Clara, no need to apologize for your poor neglect, here you are, and you're sooooooooo welcome, DON'T SEE DOCTOR MICHAEL JAKOBSEN. WORST DOCTOR IN CALIFORNIA!!!
But that's not even the half of it, dr jakobsen's office was the worst, but then... that was until they stooped even lower! which is what landed me here.... so i go to the pharmacy...
i got the message, she doesn't give a rip about my time, i decide to leave, doctor jakobsen's Otolaryngology office in Mission Viejo then i take my prescription and go see the pharmacist, walgreens, they inform me that they'll have to notify the doctor to get authorization for the prescription dosage, which they did, then i come back to walgreens a couple days later and find out my prescription is not covered by my insurance so i ask walgreens pharmacy staff to put in a new request from the doctor to have the generic form prescribed to me, which walgreens had in their supply and was the same medicine, so i wait a few days and call walgreens, they sent two faxes to Doctor Jakobsen and no response, i call and leave a message with the head nurse the next day and get guess who? no response. then a day later i call back and get in touch with a different nurse who transfers me to someone in the back who apparently handles prescriptions, long story short, 3 weeks later=no response.
Do not get confused over this guy's inability to speak with you and to understand what pain and treatment you need. This is one of the worst doctor experiences i've ever had. Do not see Dr. Michael Jakobsen!

										I was made to visit Dr. Dale M. Jacobs when I was a little girl and I want to say that he didn't help children at all, he just scared us.  
At his office in Summit, NJ, Jacobs had a picture of black snakes on the wall.  This is in a child psychologist's treatment room: a creepy picture of SNAKES on the wall.  I said I didn't like it.  Dr. Jacobs told me the snakes represented penises and if I didn't like looking at a picture of snakes, it meant I was ""afraid of sex.""
I was just a kid.  And I didn't like snakes.  But the number that the ridiculous Dr. Jacobs laid on my head was that the snakes were ""actually"" the male anatomy and not to like snakes meant I didn't like sex, which I wasn't even old enough to be having.  I was only in junior high!  
After that Dr. Jacobs would taunt me, ""You're afraid of sex, you're afraid of sex, you don't like the picture so you're afraid of sex.""  Then he'd laugh this snorting little laugh.  It was freakish.  If he pulled a stunt like that nowadays, he would probably be arrested.  But nobody stopped the bum back then.  Jacobs' favorite topic of conversation, with me, was sex.  He got all bent out of shape when I said in my religious culture we don't have sex until we are married.  
You've got to wonder why. 
You've also got to wonder why a doctor would go out to galleries and look for pictures of snakes to hang up on the wall in the room where he treats kids in the first place.  And why he would subsequently sit there and taunt us about it...
What kind of a ""healer"" needs to do something like THIS to a child?

Also at this time I received an expanation of benefits from my insurance and of course they paid for one visit but not the other and I dont blame them.
I called Dr. Dranciks office and their expanation was I asked a question that did not pertain to my visit. that question was- could you give me a refferal to a gynecologist because mine left the state.
So my husband decided to call them they told him I asked a question that did not have to do with my appt. they told him I mentioned that I had a headache which I did not.
Next my husbands union called they told him I went over my 15 minutes. so they charged me for two appointments. This is unethical. 
I called the BBB but I have not heard from them in months Is it wrong to talk to your doctor? this is really unethical!
also I'm getting alot of different excuses for this charge which is it ya know.

My practice was 90% elderly patients. I provided free transportation and made home visits. In 1996, I was featured in USA Today newpaper as one of the few doctors doing home visits on Medicare patients.
Most of the claims were denied as not medically necessary. I sent patients to get xrays or lab or consult with specialists, they were paid.
I met with BC. We reviewed 11 claims that had previously been denied to find out why. Answer:  ""Progress notes not signed"". I was told to sign and resubmit them. I did. They denied them again as not being medically necessary and/or no documentation received.
We applied for group number and got it. I was not on the initial application. We billed without me on the new group and they paid 98% of the claims. I was added to the group, billed claims, and 100% were denied.
I closed my practice in 2001 and filed a civil suit in 2003. Three trial dates have been cancelled because BC Motion for Summary Judgments. We are now in the appeals courts

										I had to leave my fiance' in Texas while I went on what was to be an six month assignment to a nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Shortly before I left she made me aware of the fact that while I would be away she would be having minor oral surgery performed. When I returned six months later I found that my fiance' had lost almost forty pounds in weight and hardly had enough energy to get herself to work each day. I noticed every morning now that upon awakening, she would go through about 30 minutes of gagging and coughing. Finally, after about two weeks, I took her to the hospital here in Bedford, Texas. 
It was here where we were introduced to doctor Stehpen Ferney and his associates. During her first visit to Harris Methodist Hospital, my fiance' was told that she had gastro esoghageal reflux disease (GERD) and that this had caused a condition known as Barretts esophaus. Doctor Ferney had performed an Endoscopy on her esophogaus to dilate it to relieve her gagging which he said was being caused by her not being able to swallow. 
I want to add here that while I was working in Pa. I lived in Maryland and during my stay, my fiance' flew up to see me for a weekend and while she was there we went to dinner one night and she complained that the meal had a strange taste. I had ordered the exact thing and it tasted fine to me. When I returned to Texas later I found out that now my fiance"" had lost her taste. 
While she was in the hospital my fiance tried to explain to doctor Ferney and to anyone that would listen that she had lost her taste and that she didn't have GERD. She didn't have the symptoms of GERD, but she would feel relief when she layed down....the opposite of what one feels when one has GERD. I along with my fiance' tried to explain to Doctor Ferney that she was suffering from an acute problem with her sinuses, and that she could not taste anything properly anymore and that this semmed to have started after her oral surgery. All of this fell on deaf ears. She was released from the hospital.
To make a long story short, my fiance' has been admitted to the hospital three additional times. Two more times to Harris Methodist, and once to Baylor Medical Hospital in Grapevine, Texas. It was at Baylor where her gallbladder was removed. The surgeon that performed the surgery warned us that he felt that the surgery was not necessary, but he was only the ""mechanic"" when it came to these things. He was only carrying out the orders of doctor Nackley, an associate of Doctor Ferney's. My fiance had no symptoms that would have made it necessary to remove her gallbladder. This is an example of the incompetence of Doctor Nackley. 
In the report issued by the Digestive Health Associates of Texas, Doctor Ferney states that a Doctor Gordon Luc had approached my fiance' one night and had recommended that a colonoscopy be performed and that she had refused. I myself was present when Doctor Luc came into the room and I was present for the entire conversation. Not once did he ever bring up the topic of a colonoscopy. The only subject that he talked about was how one needs a lawyer to be able to understand the insurance claim forms that American Airlines uses for it's employees. My fiance' is an International Advantage Reservationist for American. This statement by doctor Ferney is an outright lie by either him or Doctor luc. My fiance' allowed a doctor Nackley to perform a colonoscopy on her. 
Unfortunately, she woke up about half way through the examination. The only thing that doctor Nackley said was to wait until it was over. Another example of Doctor Nackley's incompetence.  I have every intention to bring these ""Charlatans"" to justice, but being completly ignorant as far as what my options are I do not know where to begin.
As of now My fiance has over $100,000 in medical bills from all of these incompetent idiots and she still is suffering from no taste, she is on the verge of anorexia, and still, there is no medical person able to do anything for her.
We went back to the oral surgeon who has helped us get an appointment with a Stomatologist. Where this will lead to, who knows. All that my fiance' and I can say is...If you are ever in Texas.. NEVER get sick or have any type of surgery performed  because you never know what it may lead to....And judging from what we have seen here, there is no one in the medical community here that has been educated in modern medicine. All they know to do is prescribe drug after drug, but none of them know how to look for a CURE!!!

Doesn't get much worse than this! Tampa Florida","
										This office cannot possibly be a REAL doctors office! Once you get past the plush decor of the lobby, the office staff really makes this place more like a walk-in clinic with gum smacking, magazine reading, and eye rolling office assistants!  Fortunately my issue is not personally with Dr. Frazier although I have heard from other patients that he is an arrogant jerk.  My problem is with the attitude of the office staff so I guess Dr. Frazier is the issue since he runs the place... 
A real doctor's office cares about their returning patients or at least ACTS like they care. Waiting 40 minutes in the lobby before being called for a scheduled appointment would not be that bad if I actually got to see the doctor!!! Forty minutes after waiting, I was told by the office assistant that I would need to call my insurance to confirm authorization to be seen!!  First of all, I have been an established patient at this office for 3 years.  Secondly, since when is it a patient's responsibility to call from the doctor's office for authorization?!  I called my insurance from their phone but was on hold for 10 minutes. When I politely asked the girl behind the desk if she could wait on hold and speak to my insurance while I went in to be seen by the doctor, she told me it was against office policy and she continued flipping through her magazine! Meanwhile, I was burning up with 102 degree fever and wincing from the feeling of razor blades slicing my throat each time I swallowed!  I immediately cancelled my overdue appointment as a result of her unprofessional attitude, went down the street to a walk-in clinic, and was seen and treated within 10 minutes after walking through the door.
Prior to my own incident, my wife had one of her own.  She went in for a scheduled appointment for her allergies, saw a nurse practitioner who gave her some samples of some medication, and a prescription to fill once the samples ran out.  At the check out desk, my wife was $17 short of the bill.  At the time, the office was not set up to take credit or debit card payments and my wife did not have her checkbook with her so my wife requested that the remaining $17 be billed to her by mail.  They told her it was against office policy to bill for payments and that she would have to pay for the entire visit or they would not release her prescription to her!  Mind you, we've been established patients for three years!  It's not like my wife was going to skip town over a $17 balance!      
Another problem I have with this office is that you never see the same doctor or nurse practitioner! You will see one person for one appointment and for your follow-up, you are scheduled with the next available person! How much quality care can you get with this inconsistency?  Shouldn't the same doctor follow you to promote continuity of care?! 
My mother in-law is a drug representative and told me that this office is the butt of jokes within New Tampa's pharmaceutical circle. I will no longer see this doctor or any of his associates. My wife and I will be finding a new doctor. My brother in-law and his wife are patients at this office also and are in the process of finding a new primary care doctor because of their own bad experiences. 
I was not aware that this office had such a bad reputation but I am glad I found out! If you are looking for a caring and thorough physician AND office staff who will actually give you the quality time you deserve and are paying for, DO NOT make this office your primary care office!

										I was a patient of Dr. Bromley's for many years. I moved out of state so he is no longer my doctor but I must say that he is a wonderful doctor, very attentive and takes the time to explain things to you. He was very helpful to me during very difficult times in my life and always answered my questions thoroughly. Unfortunately, you must be careful of the office staff. Please make sure to save all receipts for cash payments. I have never had a problem with paying what is due but when my insurance switched, my copay changed and I was unaware of it. I then had a $55 dollar balance. I drove to his office during a lunch break, withdrew money from an ATM just a few buildings down from his, payed my bill in cash, was issued a receipt but I did not save it. Months later, the office said I never paid it. I even told them that I had my bank statement showing I withdrew money right down the street which is nowhere near where I lived at the time. They told me 'oh well, we have no proof that you paid it'. Someone in that office pocketed the money and now I have to pay the bill again! It is a shame that his employees are stealing from him and his patients. He needs to take another look at who is handling his bookkeeping.

										I had been a patient at this location for about 5 years.  My doctor leftthe practice last February.  I picked another doctor here new to the practice.
He had me paying for Lab work for the same test 3 times but he never increased the medication that would chnage the result until I had wasted my money the 3rd time for the samre blood work.
He would dicsuss medical conditions and treatment with me but have his nurse do paper work for totally the opposite.
He would tell me he was ordering certain Labs and send me for something totally diffefent than discussed.
He would leave information off  my forms for me to get my medication.
If the form was complete the prescription would be missing.
The office became too cheap to mail my papers.
I would be in his office with him all of 15 minutes I was charged $159.00.
The office manager Arlene appeared to be a man in drag.  She did not respect the privacy of the patient.  I was in the waiting area she and the secretary was discussing me all loud with others in the waiting area. All of my business was all over the office.  The man Arlene wrote the letter but had Barnakass sign it.
The words used is wwe, us, and our.  Sound loke more than one person to me.
Dr. Baraankass demanded I get a nerve study for $550.00 out of pocket, (no insurance). I refused to pay this amount just to receive pain pills. 
This office and doctor on 2/14/08 mailed me a letter dismissing me as a patient.  The reason  ""deterioration of the patient and physician relationship.""
Was I to efficient?  Wanting thing done properly?  In a timely fashion?
Since the first doctor I was seeing there left the new doctor and staff  their service was less than satisfactory.
This office and doctor refuse to service me as a patient beacuse of my race or ability to pay 100% for poor service.  I believe this in my heart 100%.
God is so good, I had been searching for another doctor before I had any knowledge of this letter.  God was preparing me.
I don't want to a patient there with inadeguate service and incompetent doctor and staff.  Every process was always incomplete, and I did complain.

And all he said was that she had to go to pain management.  Til this day, I still haven't received an answer as to why a Dr. is allowed to refuse help to a patient, especially my daughter who needed it so desperately.  I thought they took an oath, no matter what race, religion,poor, it doesn't matter.   Why, because it wasn't their daughter or sister or mother.  I would appreciate if anyone out there could help me, a Lawyer maybe, if not, i'm going to keep writing to everyone until I get an answer.   A law has to be changed to that no Dr., under any circumstance, has the right to deny a patient help, and if they do, they lose their license, especially if the patient dies.  She didn't die from any-thing they did, it was the lack of help, which I know if she would have had, she'd still be with me here today.  I hope everyone reads this story, because I don't think another parent should go through what  I have to live with every day of my life, when I know she could have been helped.

										I was hired in May 2007 as a check out person for a very successsful family physician. Almost immediately there was strong criticism regarding absulutely everything I did. Virginia on a regular daily basis would go to Dr.Burford and undermine me. I was not fast enough, not smart enough, I was old school.Even called my ex husband to find out if our son was really ill . This was the norm.
As a single Mother who desperately needed the job, I put my best foot forward and tried to turn the other cheek.
The physician even told me she had mental issues and he was going to make her get some couselling.The harassment continued. Not one pay check was ever correct. She shorted hours. I would stop and purchase office supplies on my way to work.   She would refuse to write me re-imbursement checks. Even went so far as to have me plan and pay for a staff members going away party.
I supplied receipts for everything and she stated the Doctor would only pay $20.00. It was constant and it was daily. By this time everyone in the office was quitting and I was one of the two originals left. 
The physicians billing had been a problem from the begining of her managing his practice. On one of her good days she asked me would I be interested in taking over his billing and I could work from home. This was an answer to a prayer not to have to deal with her .
In all of my years of being employed I had never dealt with such a situation or a person such as her. I was even diagnosed with high blood pressure while working for her.She had never posted any insurance checks to the accounts. She would just tear the checks off and deposit them and throw the numerous Explanation of benefits in various folders through out her very un organized office.
The job was quite a challenge, but that was my strong area was AR.
So I was suppose to of been paid a commision as well as an hourly rate. I had a two week transition. I worked too many hours to count. I would even stay up many nights and post checks to get those out of the every way.
I went in the office on many weekends. Remember I was told from the begining I was suppose to get 4% of everything I posted.To date I've never been paid a dime for three long mos worth of work.
Every time I brought it to her attention she would fabricate issues to the Doctor in hopes he would fire me.
I discovered in November she had gone in the computer system and changed my work over to her log in and took credit for everything I posted.Yes I did do back up. I have copies of my daily work reports, They have never even owned up to the fact of her taking credit for my work.
The physician is her brother and they've had numerous issues with her and various other employess. She owes me $3500.00. I lost my home to foreclosure. I was suppose to be paid in November for all the work I'd done.
She said to me "" the first month you work is for free"" Like a billing company. I had refinanced my house to payments I thought I could afford. To be told , there is no money for you. The physician said he would pay me in January. He's foreclosing on his house.
Where does that leave me? I didn't sign a contract. It is her word against mine. The Doctor is aware of her rip off but has not settled with me. She has even had the nerve to bad mouth me to new jobs. The un employment office said I needed to get my benefits then turn her in to the wage and labor board.
No body cares about the injustice and plain out theft done to a struggling single Mom by a Bi-polar former boss who just happens to be the doctors adopted sister who has a serious case of entitlementitis.The physician did not know his own software. FIRST PROBLEM.
This situation exploded the first week of December. My son went without Christmas and we lost our home.

My foot swelled 4 times what it should have been and my son took me to the emergency room at St Francis Hospital in Peoria il. They gave me a doppler test to see if there was a blood clot and there wasnt any. My leg was red half way up and I asked If I had infection and they told me to go see the ortho doctor the next day and when i went to his office he wasnt there and i was refered to his college and I asked if I should get some antibiotics and he said it would make it worse. 
I went home and I was in horrible pain and the swelling was getting worse so I went to see my family dr and she had me get a nuclear test that showed I had osteomylitis bone infection. I had to take shots and antibiotic pills for almost a month. I was having horrible pain again and called the orth doctor and his nurse said I couldnt get an appointment he was going on a 6 week vacation. I asked who was taking his place and she said no body. I got mad and told her I had to see him before he left. He agreed and when he came into the room he said I heard you had fire works with my nurse and i SAID yes I did. He said well I will xray your foot to appease you. 
When the xray was done He looked on the screen and then at my husband and said I have never seen this happen the bone did now grow to the plate. He did not put pins in the last 2 toes and my foot is deformed and because of the neglagence of the doctor I had to spend 8 months in a wheel chair just for bunion surgery. He was very rude to me. I heard that his nurse does not have a nursing degree. I called several lawyers and they would not take the case because they were golfing buddies with this doctor. I feel that I had a mal practice suit that I could do nothing about. I am so mad and hurt by this. I was so depressed while I was in the wheel chair I will never forgive this doctor.

										My 18 year old son went to subject health care provider and was seen by Dr Larry Feiner complaining of a minor hearing loss following a flight from Utah back to Phila., PA.  He had no prior history of ear infections, ear problems during or after flying commercially and is in perfect health.  
He was granted a quick appointment and was seen by subject doctor within 2 days after calling their office.  The doctor performed a series of hearing tests, suctioned some water from his ear and prescribed a generic steroid pack (cost of $5.00).  I am happy to report that this doctors treatment resulted in a speedy recovery but an exceptionally high bill for a short office visit (approximately 30 minutes)with a routine diagnosis and treatment.
I am now particpating in a consumer driven health care plan provided by my Fortune 500 company employee benfits.  This plan comes with a high deductable in hopes that covered plan particpants seek out the best value realtive to health care provider services.
Dr Feiner's bill for this short office visit totaled $680.00  His contract with my insurance company resulted in $350.00 discount leaving me with an actual charge for this visit of $330.  
Simply put, his service and treatment were effective but the cost to have this simple diagnosis and treatment performed were just too high.  I did write to Dr Feiner expressing my opinion on his high fees and I recieved a written response from his office manager stating that they only charged what my insurance provider allowed for these services.  Somehow this office believes that if the insurance company agrees to pay they will charge as much as they can.  I'm sure that's the real reason they actually charged $680.  
I would not recommend this doctor to a friend as I believe many qualified ear doctors in my locale could have done the same thing for far less money.  We are consumers and we have a right to begin questioning fees that we are charged through for those of us fortunate enough to have health care coverage.

My vitals were taken and my BP was too high for treatment so I was sent home and told to come back in two weeks. I came back in two weeks only to be told my BP was still too high, so I was given a letter to give to my PCP to be released for treatment. I took this document to my doctor and he advised me that my BP was too high so he wouldn't sign the letter. He advised me that I should come back to him after receiving BP medicine in 3 weeks to see if it had dropped. 
Well, I went back to my doctor and it had dropped considerably. I then tried to take my signed document to FIG and was advised that they had declared bankruptcy. I never received treatment and when I went to the website as directed to see what consumers should do for refunds, there was nothing listed! WHERE'S MY MONEY!!! I just want my money back.

Phoenix, Arizona U.S.A. ",,602-242-9218,"Dr. Charanjit S. Dhillon, M.D. You may be the victim of Dr. Dhillon's fraudulent billing practices Phoenix Arizona","
										If you've been a patient of Dr. Dhillon, you are very likely the victim of billing fraud!
I was a patient of Dr. Dhillon and began to suspect he had inappropriately billed my health insurers. When his office ignored my concerns, I filed a complaint with the Arizona Medical Board. The board investigated and unanimously voted to issue a Letter of Reprimand to Dr. Dhillon, concluding:
1. Dr. Dhillon's conduct constituted unprofessional conduct pursuant to Arizona law
2. Dr. Dhillon charged a fee for a service not rendered
3. Dr. Dhillon obtained a fee by fraud, deceit or misrepresentation
4. Dr. Dhillon failed to make my medical records available despite receiving proper authorization to do so
5. On at least 50 occasions Dr. Dhillon billed brief 5-10 minutes rechecks as comprehensive physical exams 
6. Dr. Dhillon has been placed on probation for one year, during which time he must take an approved course in proper billing and coding. 
    By using inflated CPT codes, Dr. Dhillon would bill a brief 5-10 minute recheck as a comprehensive physical exam. When questioned, he claimed that he was simply ignorant of the CPT coding system, which is the universal standard for medical billing. I'd find that story easier to believe had he not been warned by the Arizona Medical Board against overbilling patients in 1995.
Another tactic Dr. Dhillon uses is to require ALL accident victims to sign a lien in order to be treated. This was ridiculous in my case, as I had excellent medical insurance that paid all my bills. Six months after he had stopped treating me and his bill had been paid, he filed a lien against any future settlement I might receive from my motor vehicle accident. When I discovered the lien through an Internet search, I asked his office to provide a complete detailed billing statement. The lien statement showed I had a balance of over $3000.00!! He had failed to credit me for ANY of the payments made by my insurance company and had added an 18% annual interest charge to the entire balance. 
I suspect that had I not protested, he would have attempted to collect the entire amount from my settlement. I also suspect there are many other patients who have been similarly scammed.
If you suspect you have been victimized by Dr. Dhillon, ask for detailed billing statements and check any ""Explanations of Benefits"" you may have received from your medical insurer. If you were charged $175.00 for a 5-10 minute appointment with Dr. Dhillon, you are very likely the victim of ""up coding"". Even if your out-of-pocket losses are minor, everyone suffers when scrupulous doctors engage in billing fraud. 
Patients must help stop this man from using the practice of medicine to swindle patients and insurers!

Tampa, Florida U.S.A. ",,813-977-2090,"GMS-A Primary Group Practice Drs. Frazier, Weissman, And Ford Ultimate Arrogance and Complete Disregard for their Patient Tampa Florida","
										I first went to this clinic to get a complete physical. As part of the physical, I was told that my cholesterol was slightly elevated above the norm (it never had been in the past). Dr Ford immediately wanted to put me on a cholesterol reducing medication, and I told her I would rather try to control it with diet instead. Although I know many drugs work wonders, I am very wary of the knee-jerk reaction some doctors have to prescribing drugs. She said, ""I'll give you two months, then come back and get the drug."" No encouragement, instead the attitude was ""You'll fail, and then we'll put you on the drug.""
This was in December, and I did not go back in February. I did modify my diet so that i ate more fruits and vegetables, less bread etc etc. 
In the meantime, I developed an increasingly deteriorating eye condition which started out as ""iritis"" then ""uveitis,"" ""pars planitis"" and then an inflammed and swollen retina. I had been under the care of an ophthamologist in Ft Myers for six months, but was unable to continue driving there, so he told me to find a retina/vitreous specialist in Tampa to treat my worsening eye condition.
At the time I was insured by Av-Med, and I knew that my policy required a specialist referral. Therefore, I knew I needed a referral from GMS before I could see the retina/vitreous specialists. I called GMS and they said ""You don't need a referral."" I replied, ""Yes, I do, Av-Med requires it-please look at my card, it's right on the front of the card."" Response: ""No, you don't need a referral, the rep told us so--let me transfer you to someone who can explain to you about referrals."" Next person: ""You don't need a referral"" Me: ""Can't you call Av-Med to confirm whether I do or not?"" Reply: That's not our job, we don't call insurance companies; they call us."" Me: "" I have a very serious eye condition which needs immediate attention. My eyes are red and imflammed and I have been diagnosed with a serious retina/vitreous condition which needs immediate treatment."" Response: ""Well you will have to come in--you haven't been here in a year"" Me: ""I was there In December and had a complete physical exam-this is the beginning of August: that isn't a year."" Response: ""Too bad, you have to come in, and then the Doctor will explain to you about referrals"" Me: ""Do you not care at all about your patient?"" Response: ""We see you didn't come back to get your cholesterol medication-we care more about you than you do."" Me: "" But I have a serious eye condition that needs immediate attention--doesn't that mean anything to you.?"" Resonse: ""If you want a referral you will have to make an appointment and come in."" Me: ""And what are you going to see me for?"" Response: ""To explain to you about referrals""
At this point in time, I was legally blind due to this eye condition and really did need to see the specialist immediately. It could also have deteriorated to the point that it would have permanently affected my vision. I called the Retina/Vitreous Specialists in Tampa (great people and doctors). They asked me to see if I could get a referral from the ophthamologist in Ft Myers, even though he was not my primary care physician. I did that, and he personally wrote a letter to GMS castigating them in very professional, but uncompromising terms, about their failure to care-- disregarding my need for a referral.
I had also confirmed with Av-Med that I indeed needed a referral for the eye specialist.  Av-Med asked me if I wanted to file a report against them, and I did.
The end of this story is the best and most unbelievable part. I received a letter in the mail (a few days after they had received the letter from my eye doctor in Ft. Myers.) informing me that they were ""removing me from their practice"" and I could only see them in an emergency during the next fifteen days, and after that, never again. Naturally I read the letter in disbelief and then started laughing hysterically. What a joke! As if I would ever go back to those arrogant, insensitive, condescending excuses for doctors!
Just in case you're wondering why they would go to these extremes: I was never rude to them, I never called them names or cursed (I don't) even though I certainly felt like it.
This group of doctors has brainwashed themselves and their staff into believing that they are ""above"" their patients and all their little problems. Their obviously expensive lobby and office with costly framed prints says it all: We are important and you are not.

										I am the boyfriend of one of Dr. Carole Howard's patients.  I have sat in on 2 of her appointments and now i refuse to allow her to return to this heartless woman. My girlfriend has a very bad condition and has to to get ultrasounds for them to see if the condition has changed at all.
Dr. Howard does NOT record any findings in her reports.  She said that if she ""lost weight"" that the condition would just disappear.  Her condition is Ovarian Cysts.
They would not just ""go away"" by her losing weight.  She doesnt even do full exams when she is supposed to.  She shows up to the family clinic in sweatpants and a hoodie.
She never smiles, she never jokes, she is just all in all a rude, uncaring, and terrible doctor.  If you are looking for a kind and caring doctor, allow me to refer you to any other doctor in the tulsa/broken arrow area.  they are all kind, caring, and arent rude when you tell them what is wrong with you.
Dr. Howard doesnt listen to what the patient tells her and she doesnt keep up with their charts.  Heres a scenario that my girlfriend went through, my girlfriend (lets call her C for the protection of her name) C went to the Emergency room for heavily bleeding and severe pain.  Dr Howard's nurses recorded it in her medical charts and as Dr Howard was reading over the chart she just blew right by it, and when C asked her about it she didnt even know what she was talking about.  Not to be rude, but she either needs to take a few of her happy pills or get out of the profession.
A large amount of her patients are not happy with her level of professionality.
One more thing, She doesnt call any of her patients to tell them what the findings were in their tests, she has her nurses call them when most doctors, that i personally have come into contact with, call their patients personally and dont treat them like they are just a paycheck.  And, that is all she treats her patients like, get them in then right back out so she can get paid.  Thats all.  My Doctor that i go to calls personally, cracks jokes with you, lightens the moods, and always has a smile on her face.  Shes the exact OPPOSITE of Dr howard.

All assocciates get it for $29 and month as long as you sign up for it with in a certain time frame. They give you 10 days or you have to pay what they charge the public $52 a month.  My son was very ill and when I called so they could find me a Doctor in my area, 3 days went by and I had to call THEM back.  When they did find a Doctor in my area, the Doctor was not accepting their plan.  The person I spoke with at ASI got angry and said I didn't ask for who they told me to, which they never did tell me there was anyone special I needed to speak with.  I gave up and took him else where.  Well, come to find out about it, the Urgent Care Clinic in which I took him had the SAME family plan there for $18 a month that uses the Galexy Network.  I dropped the plan right away from ASI and they STILL continued to take out the $29.  They are NOT the cheapest like they say they are.  What a bunch of fonys!  It's all a gimmic and a SCAM!
What got me is, when I signed up with ASI they knew that I was a single mom and wanted to stay at home and work so I could be with my son.  I was told I could make $200-$400 and week just working part time or if I chose I could make $500-$800 if I worked full time.  I spent MORE time away from my son working for them and I was in the same house!  I put in endless hours promoting their scam plans and calling people to recruite them to work.  I just quite because I did not feel right having to lie to people just to get them to work for a company that would only take advantage of them and use them for FREE advertisment and get paid only $20 at a time or nothing at all for endless hours of work.

It appears to me that the accounting department DOES NOT keep accurate records and then sends you to an unscrupulous collections agency.

										Expectant Mothers Beware!
In September, 2007, my wife became pregnant. We were concerned at that time because my wife had been consuming alcohol, and on occasion smoked Marijuana. My wife and I began receiving prenatal care at Sun Health OBGYN in Sun City, AZ, through Dell Webb Hospital.
As concerned parents, we shared this early exposure with our doctor, Dr. Narinder Brar, D.O. We opted for a high risk ultrasound and began regular prenatal visits. Most of our concern was that of paranoid parents concerned for the wellbeing of our unborn child. Our family were like millions of other expectant parents who consumed these substances without the knowledge of a pregnancy. Once we found out we were expecting our child, obviously my wife and I stopped all substances that would interferre with the normal development of our child.
During the pregnancy, my wife and I operated our two businesses in Surprise and Sun City, Arizona. She made all her doctors visits during the pregnancy, which is required 12 prenatal visits. As owners of two businesses in Arizona, my wife had to cancel and reschedule 7 of her appointments, but she received all necessary prenatal care and visited the doctor the required 12 visits.
On or about May 21, 2008, my wife began going into labor, dialating 2 centimeters. We obtained a 3D ultrasound which showed the baby was further along than predicted by Sun Health OBGYN; the baby was full term. My wife and I visited Dr. Narinder Brar, D.O. when labor began. Dr. Brar refused to induce labor and told my wife that if the baby was born now ""he would be premature and in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.""
We took the medical advice of the doctor, Dell Web Hospital, and Sun Health OBGYN, and waited another week, while my wife remained 2cm dialated and our child full term. On a visit to Dr. Brar on May 25, 2008, the baby had turned and went into a breach position. The failure of Dr. Brar to properly induce labor on a full term pregnancy caused an emergency C section on May 28, 2008.
Dr. Brar scheduled my wife's C section on May 28, 2008, at 8am PST. We arrived at the hospital at labor and delivery and the staff wondered why we were there. Apparently, Dr. Brar, who was also the on call doctor that day, had scheduled my wife's C section for 12 noon. Although the scheduling mix up was in itself petty, that was enough to set me off. That morning I lodged a complaint with Sun Health OBGYN, Dell Webb administration, and labor and delivery. As an irate expectant father, I felt this to be medical malpractice and an unnecesary medical procedure. The baby was full term the week before and in place to be delivered. I complained ad nauseum.
At 12 noon our baby boy was born healthy and full term. We couldn't have wanted for a more perfect baby. I was going to let all complaints go as I was just happy to have our new son.
Dell Webb Hospital, Sun Health OBGYN, and Dr. Brar had another agenda. Apparently, they took my threats of medical malpractice seriously and went on a smear campaign against my family and my wife to protect themselves from a lawsuit for an unnecessary medical procedure: an unnecessary C section. Sun Health OBGNY, Dell Webb Hospital Administration, Dell Webb Labor and Delivery, and Dr. Brar smeared my family, my wife, and my new born son to avert attention from their medical malpractice. 
I wish I hadn't complained and kept my mouth shut. But my anger did not justify the malicious treatment my family received at the hands of these ""medical professionals""
My wife had not been using any substances after she learned of her pregnancy. This was known by Dr. Brar and the medical staff. Substance use was no issue in the pregnancy.
Then the cover up began.
During the C section, Dr. Brar prescribed morphine to my wife, which is common place with these types of procedures. Immediately after the operation (not before), Dr. Brar ordered a drug screen of my wife. My wife came up negative for all substances, except for ""opiates"". The positive test result for opiates was from the morphine prescribed during the operation. The staff at Dell Webb Hospital knew this was from morphine during the operation, but used this test result to call Child Protective Services for drug exposure to our child. Further tests showed THC in the baby's feces from the first trimester of the pregnancy, which Dr. Brar, Sun Health OBGYN, and Dell Webb Hospital knew would be present since september. 
Obviously there was no previous issue with fetal exposure as the hospital nor Dr. Brar made any reports to CPS prior to the C section. Basically, Dr. Brar, Labor and Delivery, and Dell Webb Hospital knew they had opened themselves up to a possible medical malpractice suit so they fabricated a false positive for opiates in order to call CPS on my wife.
It gets worse.
My wife attended all necessary prenatal visits to Sun Health OBGYN. As we own 2 businesses in Arizona, we worked 12 to 16 hours a day running our businesses. 12 prenatal visits are required during pregnancy. With our family's busy schedule, my wife had cancelled 7 appointments and rescheduled during her pregnancy. 
In an effort to deflect attention from the potential medical malpractice suit I was threatening, Dell Webb Hospital, Dr. Brar, Dell Webb Labor & Delivery, and Sun Health OBGYN reported to Child Protective Services that my wife had missed 7 prenatal appointments, which they indicated was neglect. What they failed to put in their malicious report was all appointments were rescheduled and my wife made the necessary 12 prenatal visits.
Sounds peculiar? It gets worse.
At a CPS meeting regarding our child I learned Dell Webb Hospital also reported that I was drunk in Labor and Delivery and smelled of Alcohol. Funny thing though, I am not a drinker. CPS knows that, the hospital knew that, and everybody who knows me knows that I don't drink alcohol (minus holidays).
That was reprehensible. I am not a drinker and to accuse me of this in a CPS report is unprofessional, satanic, malicious, and merits investigation of all medical professionals associated with my wife's labor and delivery.
I warned the staff of the hospital to stop the malicious smear campaign. 
Now it's my turn. This is only the beginning and I am going to pursue damages for the medical malpractice and the emotional trauma this has caused my family.
Since these malicious attacks, my wife slipped into severe depression and my family has suffered greatly. As a direct result of this campaign, my marriage has began to fall apart and my wife and I have began fighting over petty things, to the point where professional services has to be involved. These stressors did not exist prior to these attacks by Dell Webb Hospital. Consequently, the depression and anxiety this ordeal has caused my family has warranted services for my family from CPS for anger management, counseling, and addiction counseling.
The emotional pain and suffering caused by Dr. Brar has caused my wife to begin drinking again and has created hostility and anger issues with me that has warranted our need to receive psychiatric services.
For all expectant mothers in Arizona...BEWARE! Do not receive or attempt to receive prenatal services through Sun Health OBGYN and do not trust the care provided by Dell Webb Labor and Delivery. 
According to the staff of Sun Health OBGYN, Dr. Narinder Brar, D.O. has had multiple complaints from her patients for similiar issues. The nursing staff tells of personal problems at home with Dr. Brar. As a husband of a patient, I feel Dr. Brar should leave her personal problems at home.
This smear campaign to avoid a possible medical malpractice suit is dispicable. Any parent who uses any substance that could hurt an unborn child should always feel free to report this to their doctor. These behaviors reinforce attitudes with expectant mothers to keep these behaviors away from their medical providers for fear of reprisals. Our case is one example why many mothers do not share with their doctors fully what substances their unborn children may have been exposed to. Our family was punished for providing proper prenatal care in a timely manner. Doctors should not conduct smear campaigns against patients for fear of a medical malpractice suit. That is, after all, why they have insurance.
I warned the staff of Dell Webb, but that warning fell on deaf ears.
Now it's my turn.
This is only the begining.

The office personnel inclusive of Dr. (if you can call him that) Bittner is unprofessional and thoroughly deceptive; preying upon people who want to help themselves look decent. 
The manners that were displayed to me throughout my time spent there were non existent topped with a malicious tinge. 
The environment screamed ""I am taking your money and you as a narcissistic person deserve it!"" 
The nude photos of me were taken as a rapist would assault - perhaps to post on websites if you were to send in complaints. 
The disfigurement I now endure is quite extreme. Whereas prior I was able to wear shorts - now I can not.  
Dr. Bittner did not do the surgery. His unqualified assistants did.
Dr. Bittner has a deceptive process where his staff pulls you in to the surgery room, has you undress in front of 3 men and 1 woman in my case. Then he takes pictures and makes unflattering unprofessional comments. The process hits you so fast that you don't know what is happening...YOU BECOME A VICTIM....LIKE PERHAPS A RAPE VICTIM...
Please beware of not only this farce of a doctor, but others that prey upon you similarly.
Know your environment and go slow, research not only the doctor, but their medical facility. Check their affiliations and get recommendations. Word of mouth is better than other doctor's opinions where they partake regularly in ""reference reciprocity"".

										I was referred to Javier Escalera, a CPS psychiatrist, for a court mandated psychiatric evaluation due to a custody case involving my 7 month old son.
I had already had a psychiatric evaluation done at the homeless shelter I'm currently staying at, done by a Dr. David Flume.  He simply said I have adjustment disorder due to current stress in my life and suggested in the treatment plan that I get on case management to help obtain stable housing and employment.  This evaluation was done on 11/30/2007.  He said I needed to be on no medication.
This other psychiatrist, though, Javier Escalera, not only suggested that I need to be on a couple of big gun psychiatric medications, but said in his report that I have a mood disorder NOS(not otherwise specified), psychosis NOS(not otherwise specified), and a personality disorder NOS with schizotypal, dependent, paranoid and antisocial traits.
He also said that my 7 month old son is mentally retarded(He is of at least of average development from what everyone can see) and that I'm fat, ugly, overweight, dirty and wore oversized clothing.  
He also got my children's age and birthdates wrong in his report and said I had a history of abusing methamphetamine.
He said that I should be court ordered to take big gun psychiatric medications and should be in a psychiatric hospital.
The ONLY one who needs to be in a hospital, preferably the state penetentiary, is Javier Escalera for his extremely biased and poor evaluation.
So be forewarned everyone:  WATCH OUT for CPS and this stupid, lazy, crazy looking, brainwashed twit.  He should lose his medical license for giving people inaccurate evaluations like this.  If he doesn't, hopefully enough people will read this report and know the truth about this individual and what Child Protective Services is really like.

										Background info on me... I have been to 3 different surgeons, have had numerous surgeries over the past 2.5 years, no one knows why I keep getting recurrent abscesses but I am very scared as to why this is happening as I am healthy otherwise.
I have a surgeon I have been seeing for the past year and a half or so who has performed a fistulotomy on me and numerous drainings (I had previous surgeries with other doctors).  I couldn't take it anymore and asked him to refer me to someone else.  Dr. Weiss at Cleveland Clinic.  I have the beginnings of another one so I figured this was the perfect opportunity.
First of all, over the phone they told me to use enemas before I came in, I found that unusual as none of my other doctors have ever asked them.  I told them I could not as I was working and could not do ""that"" at work.  They told me to come in early and do it there.  Turned out that I did not need to, thank God I did not follow her instructions.
Next, Dr. Weiss was very rude.  Even though I was an hour early he flew in and began talking to me while he was on the computer with his back turned to me.  I told him I had an abscess and he immediately told me that I probably had a fistula.  I explained to him that I did not as I had my last fistulotomy surgery last year and have had a few abscesses since then and under each examination I did not have a fistula again.  I told him I was referred for a 2nd opinion and he said, ""Where are your operative reports?""  I explained that they were faxed last week.  I tried to tell him all of the past things since he didn't have the paperwork in front of him and he acted as if I was annoying him.  He seemed angry that I did not have these reports ON me, when I am sure his very disorganized office staff lost them.
He decided to examine me while they found the paperwork.  He was very rough with me and hurt me.  He couldn't even find the abscess, I had to tell him where it was.
He told me I would need a sonogram, I told him that I already had one (by him...I have been to CC in the past but couldn't remember the name of the Dr who did the sonogram.  I figured back then the sonogram doctor was just rude because he was doing something for another Dr...little did I know...).  He asked about MRIs and colonoscopies which I've already had done.
They would not find the paperwork, so he told me that he would have to put me under anesthesia and try to find the fistula.  I have been under anesthesia so many times and asked if there was something else he could do, like maybe perform a blood test to see if I have a disease or something (I've been reading up on autoimmune diseases and one of the symptoms is infections that do not heal).  This was the kicker- he said with an attitude-  ""What disease do you think you have?""  I said I don't know and could only laugh because he is the doctor shouldn't he know that!!!
So he quickly told me he was putting me on antibiotics and flew out of the room before I could say a word.  When the nurse brought me the scripts I explained to her that he flew out of the room before I could tell him that since I have been through this (a million times) before that I need prescription pain meds and that yes the pain is not horrible today but it will be unbearable in a couple days and I don't need to waste money going to the ER (today is Thurs so I will be in extreme pain by about Sat or Sun).  She said sure and came back in and told me that he said to take Tylenol and if the pain is that bad I should have ""the surgery""!  What ""surgery"" he was talking about I have no idea.
I will be calling my original surgeon tomorrow and telling him not to refer anyone else to this horrible man and am waiting for the hospital to get back to me on who I can direct my complaint to but I just wanted to put this out there.  DO NOT GO SEE DR ERIC WEISS if you are having ANY rectal problems, even though Cleveland Clinic is supposed to be a very good hospital!!!  They obviously are not if they are employing jerks such as these.  NOW I have no solution to my problem and don't even have pain meds to get through the hell I am about to go through.

										My son received a one inch cut over one eye near the eyebrow.
I went to this cosmetic surgeon, on the advice of my dermatologist. 
I asked the surgeon how much the repair would cost. He told me not to worry that he would take what the insurance pays.
He sutured my son's cut, which took 10 minutes, without exaggeration. He sutured it alone without an assistant, in a room that just had a table and no other equipment. The cut took about 9 stitches.
I recieved a bill that stated he received $2700.00 dollars from the insurance. Which I thought was excessive. I continue to read the bill and he states I owe another $5000.00. In total he wants $7700.00 dollars!! for a ten minute procedure, that required 9 stitches. I was flabbergasted!!
I told him he was crazy and that I would not pay another dime. I also said that with the $2700.00 I thought he was grossly overpaid. Forget $7700.00!!
Well he has now put me in collection and threatining to ruin my credit. I guess I have no recourse to this unscrupulous practice. My credit will be ruined. But to everyone out there considering to use his service. Beware, he is a rip-off!!!

										My mother was a patient of Dr Gregory Lang. My mother needed a refill on a prescription, and without seeing my mother for nearly three months, and no appointment scheduled, Dr Lang gave my mother 10 months worth of refills. I thought that was not appropriate so I wrote a letter to Dr Lang explaining I was not happy with him giving my mother 10 months worth of refills without seeing her first. I explained that I have Power Of Attorney and I carefully monitor my mothers medications. 
Approximately one month later my mother saw Dr Lang. Dr Lang mentioned the letter I sent. Ignoring my request, and forgetting that my mother already had 10 months of refills, Dr Lang then wrote another prescription for my mother, same drug, and 10 months worth of refills. This allowed my mother to double up on the same drug for 10 months by having one rx filled at one drug store and the other rx filled at another drug store.
I live in the Los Angeles area and travel north to check on my mother 3 or 4 times a month. Luckily I own my own business that allows me to do this. These damn doctors are nothing put a group of pill pushers. It's not easy for me to control my mother's medications when you have a jerk like Dr Lang who gives out rx's without any consideration for the health and well being of his patients.

										To whom it may concern.
On Sunday June 15th,   my 3 years old son Ilan broke his arm and was rushed to urgent care in West lake California . The doctor at urgent care took 2 x rays and advise me to see an Orthopedic doctor the next day as my son needed a cast on his arm. The doctor at urgent care also provide me with a list of doctors in my neighborhood to contact for that. I picked the first name on the list, Dr. Tjerk F. Bury, called the office and asked the person who answered the phone, Jill, if they do treat kids, she said yes and asked for my insurance information over the phone. She also said they do take Blue Cross and they are Blue Cross providers. She also said that she has to check my insurance information and will call me back in few minutes to let me know if there is any problem. She called me back and booked my little boy for the same day to apply the cast on his arm.
When I walked into Dr. Bury's office I realized that I am in a plastic surgeon's office. I was a little worried and asked Jill  if she is sure that they treat kids and if  I am in the right office for my child.  . She said Dr. Burry is also hand specialist, I was concern that it will may cost me more, my child needed only cast application that was not necessary  for him to be seen by hand specialist. Jill smiled and said don't you worry, we do treat kids and we will charge your insurance .
She charged me $25 co pay before we walked in to see the doctor.
Dr. Bury looked at the x rays that I had from urgent care and said yes its broken, lets put the cast on 15 minutes later he walked me to his receptionist, Jill, and asked me to come back in 4 weeks. I booked my boy a 4th week appointment and was ready to leave the office when Jill said it is $500 for the service.   I was shocked and asked her what? $500 to apply the cast on? Is this is the allowed amount by the insurance?
And she said yes, Dr. Bury is  a plastic surgeon so we have to charge you for surgery. You have to pay it now.  She also said different surgeon office may charge me $2000 for that!!!!
I was shocked, I told her that she did not indicate that when I was not sure if this is a right office for my child for that purpose, she kept asking for the money right now and she said I can't leave without paying now! I had my 3 years old screaming in my arms and rather than arguing just handed her my credit card so I can leave and deal with them later, she also said this amount include follow up visits and cast removal. I asked her why I have to pay her for all that now? Why she can not charge me just for the cast application?  She said that some patients  do not come back , and they go to different office to follow up so they want their money now! I told her that I am definitely not coming back and will not pay twice to remove this cast in 4 weeks. She said this is your choice but we have to charge you anyway. She also said that they charge the whole amount in advance before they submit that to the insurance because people usually don't pay their bills!!!
I find that very humiliating  and  after checking with my insurance company, I am now aware that only allow $88.22 for cast application.
To add insult to injury, on July 19th  I received the claim from my insurance company --  Dr. Bury charged my insurance company $1,505.00, the bill included $995 for surgery -- he NEVER performed surgery on my son!!! My payment responsibility according to the claim is $620.07 when I was told at his office by him and by his receptionist Jill that the $525.00 that I have paid include also the follow up visits. Dr. Burry was also paid by my insurance $137.24 . Jill said that any payment they will receive by my insurance will be send back to me, since I paid $525.00 in advanced. I did not receive a phone call or a check from them. 
I feel totally mislead by Dr. Bury's office.  Why didn't his receptionist/assistant Jill tell me that it will cost me that and why she didn't tell me that I will have to pay it the same day of the service, she checked my insurance information before she booked me, so she knew I did not meet my $2500 deductible, why she didn't indicate that too?  In addition, I don't understand why I have to pay Dr. Bury for service he didn't provide my son with. 
Also, in mid June, my son was going to water camp and I don't understand why he didn't offer water proof cast for a 3 year old in the beginning of the summer. When I called Dr. Bury's office the day after he put the cast on my son's arm, Jill said that they don't have waterproof cast.
On July 14th  I visited   pediatric orthopedic doctor for my little boy to remove the cast and of course had to pay again.
I feel mislead, ripped off and humiliated and requesting a refund of $525.00 back on my credit card, and have Dr. Bury re-submit the claim to my insurance for the correct service he performed on my child using the correct code for cast application (code # 29105, using 1 roll for child arm) plus $35 office visit (my co-pay). Of course I will put the correct fair amount back on my credit card.
I would appreciate you looking into this situation.

										I signed up with a representative by the name of Steve DeDominick on September 7, 2007.  I paid $5000.00 for a guaranteed 36 leads over 2 months and they said the company had a guaranteed 10 months to deliver the full amount of leads which would have been 72.  It has been over a year and not one lead.  I called the company twice in the past year and Natalie Hoffman told me thye were still shopping for air time as the Cicnnati market was very expensive.  Since they had 10 months there was little room to argue.  I pulled the contract out today and called all the phone numbers I had and every sigle one was diconnected or temporarily out of service.  If anyone has an attorney or anymore information please feel free to contact me.  I am giving the Rip off people authority to share my email address with anyone who is in the same boat as I am.  I am calling the BBB and filing a complaint with them and will file a complaint with the attorney general and see wht can be done about getting the company closed down for good.  All I have read is about how money was paid but not one lead.

										When I first contacted Archer he was helpful.
Once he had my money things changed.
The test kit took weeks to arrive.
I sent it back to the company.
The results then took several weeks.
Archer then refused to interpret the results.
I contacted the BBB.
They didn't want to know.
Archer misled them - they fell for it.
I believe he is an educated man.
But he has difficulty explaining simple ideas.

Stellato MD Will dump you as a patient, even a physician-patient, when you have additional trouble or nerve inflammation in an old incision that he was the last surgeon into; can't diagnose or treat conservatively nerve inflammation in an old incision - has Dr. Shuck call you. Cleveland Ohio","
										Dr. Stellato will do a surgery to remove old sutures and then drop you when nerve inflammation develops in the incision - telling you to go elsewhere - even a physician.  Can't handle ANY slight complication and leaves you begging because it's always best that the last surgeon handle the complications - in this case it was him.   
I've known Dr. Stellato since medical school days, and he gets arrogant, self-serving, and cruel at times - can't see that he hurts someone, talk things out, or have a cup of coffee or tea with someone to discuss or argue things through.  All that I said to him was that I was sorry that his father died and he looked too tired, and that I should come back in several months as what I had wasn't urgent and it needed further discussion.  So he got mad at me, and said that I stood him up for a scheduled surgical procedure, that I had cancelled with him because I couldn't get there with a family member to be with me - it wasn't personal, but he takes everything PERSONALLY.  Takes things personally, and totally out-of-context, and leaves you to be butchered by the next surgeon who doesn't know the case.  Wouldn't speak with my mother even when he did the one surgery to remove old sutures - just walks away in a cloud of ego.  And my mother is a former RN.  
And I helped his RN wife when she was going to deliver their first child; sat with her awhile after doing the History & Physical for the chart - she was alone in a room by herself because he doesn't realize that he leaves people to manage on their own while he climbs career ladders or writes ridiculous books about going to Weatherhead School of Management - which he did so that he could get the Chief of Surgery position at University Hospitals = calculated move.  He didn't know or realize that his wife needed him that night or felt lonely and scared - waiting for a C-section.  And he didn't the get the Chief of Surgery position at University Hospitals, but it had nothing to do with his Business School Degree or book on Amazon - has to do with his not being able to talk to people = students, residents, fellow colleagues. . .But a Chief of Surgery who can't straighten out a nerve inflammation problem in an old incision, who runs away at the first complication, who can't stand up for a patient or a friend for one minute without caving thinking only of his own career advancement?
He knows where to find me, and he let a physician get butchered by another physician who took advantage of the situation when he walked away. Has to have Dr. Shuck call you; just like a baby.  Has no ability to follow-up.  BARIATRICS patients beware, find a surgeon who will follow the care and any complications and get that IN WRITING (like his book) = don't count on 'good behavior' and ethics.  He's not even a friend when you try to be one to him; and I've tried for over 25 years.  You can't please him, and you can't get him to care that what he does to you makes the difference between function and non-function or that he needs to tell you the truth honestly and straight-out; not all politically correct.  Totally surgical hot stuff, not made for human interaction or common sense.  Maybe if he stood up for something, or followed through, or had a grain of integrity and stick-with-it ability -- then maybe someone might WANT him as CHIEF OF SURGERY.  He has no definable personality that you can count on if there's a problem; it's all blah and plastic.  Maybe someone will do what he did to me to a family member of his, and then maybe he might listen, care, or learn compassion = some humanity = the missing link.

										In three years Dr. Tottori has never, ever found the cause of my symptoms or offered a valid solution for them. Today he freaked out on me because I mentioned nasal spray. After waiting for him in the exam room for an hour he finally came in with another doctor with the intention of running me out of there. He began interrogating me about nasal spray. Didn't mention anything about my allergies, asthma, meds, nothing - just nasal spray. 
He basically forced me to leave being very confrontational and having his buddy there for back-up! What kind of allergy doctor DOES that? C - R - A - Z - Y ! ! ! I left there feeling very angry because I was treated so badly. I plan to file a formal complaint.
Of course the nurse asks what you are there for and how you are presently treating it. I had mentioned something to the nurse about having used nasal spray. I guess that's all the doctor needed to hear, because when he finally did come in (I think he was waiting for me to just leave) he just seemed to want to be very rude, arrogant, and argumentative. What a goof! I was there with legitimate allergy, sinus, and nighttime asthma issues seeking a solution and relief, but he insisted that nasal spray was to blame for all of my ailments. He just kept saying ""you're screwed, you're screwed"" and ""you're wasting your time coming here"". I was trying to tell him that I just moved to a new place and I have been barely able to function for the past few days. I wanted to talk to him about immunotherapy or shots..something that might help with my allergies. He just cut me off and said ""No, you're problem is the nasal spray."" That is such bullshit!!! I didn't start going there because I had been using nasal spray, but because I had sinus troubles. I had only begun to use it after running out of Rx and realizing that it worked much better. It's not like I didn't ever give other remedies a chance either. I have tried everything out there to find relief. That's why I went to the doctor!!! And all he could tell me is that my problem is the nasal spray? I have not used nasal spray for long periods of time on the doctors advice giving other remedies every chance, but nothing offered significant relief. That's why I went to the allergy doctor, to find a solution. The only thing they ever did was give me an Rx for Allegra D and Nasonex. That's about it. According to them I guess those two things cure allergies as long as you don't ever use nasal spray. Cuz if you do...you're screwed! Don't waste your time with this clown! Find yourself a REAL doctor who actually spends time with patients to find out what's wrong and find the cure, not just treat the symtoms!!! As other have suggested on 'insider pages' about him..I too tend to agree that he must get some sort of kickbacks from the drug companies for writing so many Rx's of their product. I guess there is no money in cures, only treating symtoms. Funny thing is I am still trying to figure out why he did what he did. My thought is that as a cash patient, they only ever charged me twenty bucks for a visit. Come to think of it, I was the only cash patient on their roster that day. With an overload of patients, I guess it would make sense to only keep the ones that you can gouge like crazy. And I'm sure that that's really the only way the drug companies can track how much of a bonus he gets. Wow, don't doctors take some sort of oath or something? Totally unethical! Yes, QUACK, you wasted my time! You have no morals and NO character. And if I ever get the pleasure of making you as uncomfortable as you did me, I will oblige. You know what they say about karma...

Colonial Heights, Virginia U.S.A. ",,804-526-8640,George & Puthumana MDs No response with request for records. Colonial Heights Virginia,"
										After several difficult visits to these two doctors, I decided it was time to change doctors and found one I like. After my first visit with him, I stopped into the office of Doctors George and Puthumana personally and requested my records be sent to my new doctor. The office staff asked me if I was changing doctors and I said yes, I was investigating that. She asked me how many pages of my records I would like to have sent and I said, ""how about the past year?"" I did not visit the doctors that many times and mostly, I needed to have two recent blood workups sent to my new doctor. She said OK and after signing the request form, I left. 
Life is busy for me with lots of travel and I am also getting ready to relocate. I began waiting for my new doctor to call me after reviewing my records. I waited two weeks and called my new doctor. They never received the records. When I called the George and Puthumana office, they put me on hold twice, the first time was for about 15 minutes. I finally called back about a half hour later and asked to know why they had not sent my records. After another wait on hold, the receptionist came on and said that I would have to pay $25 for my records to be sent.
The last time I had an appointment in this office I waited for an hour to see Dr. George and finally, left after paying $15 copay already. When I had a serious issue that required a visit to the emergency room, I was told to follow up on the next Monday with my physician. I decided to drive down and be at their office first thing in the morning. When I did this, the receptionist was obviously upset and told me that they do not take ""walk ins"" She finally scheduled me an appointment after lunch, knowing that I lived 35 minutes away and would just have to wait for the appointment. 
When Dr. Puthumana came into my appointment, she exhibited negative attitude and was very flip with me regarding the emergency room visit. She acted like I was being overreactive. She ordered more blood tests (after ordering some the week before). I waited about 5 days to hear from her and never did. When I called to get the results, she couldn't come to the phone and I asked why she had never called me. They said she'd tried my office phone, because on one of my calls I'd given it, and when she couldn't get me, she gave up. It is always very hard to get through to this office for appointments. 
These doctors are in this business to make money and not to care for patients, that is my experience with them and I think others ought to know.

Dr. Michael Sarr,"  Dr. Michael Sarr  Mayo Clinic 200 First Street SW 
Rochester, Minnesota U.S.A. ",,507-284-2511,"Dr. Michael Sarr Dr. Sarr does abdominal wall 'exploration' operations for possible 'neuromas' to remove normal nerves for student 'shows,' leaves you needing >$1000 in plastic surgery and in pain for the rest of your life. Rochester Minnesota","
										DR. MICHAEL SARR will schedule abdominal exploration operations for 'neuromas' if you think there's another old suture in an abdominal incision causing nerve or tissue inflammation & irritation.  Dr. Sarr ARROGANTLY won't do any scans or studies - as he's too busy playing games/jokes with the medical students (guys mostly).  The operation will be mysteriously scheduled for the next day, and he'll have special 'clearance' arranged to railroad you into tomorrow's suddenly open slot.  You will tell him that you refuse anesthesia, medical students and residents - and he'll arrange that they have anesthesia drug you 20 minutes before the procedure and the resident, who never saw you before in her life (Dr. Baghai), will start the procedure and make a mess unlike anything you've ever seen done in surgery in the continental US.  And you've told him 3 times that the resident is not to touch anything - but she can WATCH.  But Dr. Sarr wasn't listening and thinks everything is a MAYO DEMO.  
When Dr. Sarr doesn't find a suture or abnomality, as he didn't study the problem, but took what you said at 'face' value (as a possible 'guess') to schedule the procedure - instead of closing and doing the missing workup - he will proceed to cut every abdominal muscle - claiming that he feels SOMETHING - and then remove a inflammed normal nerve as a pathological 'geewhiz' specimen, claiming that he also sees some FOREIGN DEBRIS which never shows up on the pathology report.  He can't admit that he didn't do the HOMEWORK and so your abdomen is cut up until he finds some excuse to stop - and the Mayo administration thinks this is ok.
It's all a medical student and resident show at Mayo Clinic Surgery for the poor sucker patient, and the procedure Dr. Sarr does was never discussed, and no one will tell you how many of these he has done or the long-term results.  None of the patients seem to be seen back post-operatively, and Mayo Clinic never notices this.  
This procedure was never mentioned when you spoke with Dr. Sarr.  The patient is seriously hurt, and Dr. Sarr is just a bundle of laughs and one-liners - he conned you.  And you've of course said that he is not to touch the abdominal muscles during the procedure, but he doesn't care as he wants to impress the students, the resident, and the OR staff by dissecting and pulling up every abdominal muscle.  And the anesthesiology guy only saw you 20 minutes before and said he would 'watch' you - you never said the words 'agree to general anesthesia.'  And he doesn't watch you - he lets you get BUTCHERED.  Anesthesia won't question the lack of workup or studies on the chart either.
You will never again be without pain, and plastic surgery won't be able to fix what he, the resident, and the untrained medical student did to you - for a retained suture that in every other institution is under local, without a farce, and without a DR. LOVE PROCEDURE for improved life satisfaction.  Now when anyone touches you, you will be in extreme pain.  [Dr. Love was an ob-gyn in Ohio who did special gynecological operations to enhance sexual pleasures.]  Dr. Sarr does an abdominal exploration, for an old suture, cutting the fascia of every muscle, with no emergency or study of the problem, and leaves you disfigured, mutilated and in literal shock.  He then tells you to go to the hotel and never sees you in a post-op visit.  Dr. Sarr tells you to 'write' him a note about how you are doing.  And when you contact him that things look very bizarre, he cancels you as a patient.  And Mayo Clinic defends this, but no one knows how to 'fix' the Dr. Sarr procedure back to the normal abdominal wall, and no one at Mayo Clinic can explain why he did this to you.
The incision won't heal as the Medical Student apparently spit into it (you will smell of his black cologne as if he massaged you and groped you), the muscle fascias will rip apart, and contacting the State Medical Board of Minnesota will do nothing to Dr. Sarr or Dr. Baghai.  Dr. Baghia, wherever she is these days, can't cut/sew or make a surgical decision, and no matter how stupid did what Dr. Sarr told her to do in those days.  The muscles won't ever heal well, and no one will understand why Dr. Sarr did this procedure to remove a 'normal' nerve.  Especially as Mayo Clinic in Rochester has every consult, scan and endoscope available - but they don't use them - at least not DR. SARR of the exploration operation.
Mayo Clinic has promoted him to Chief of General Surgery and lets him do these procedures without question - though you can't find out anything about them as to statistics.  Jill Beed, the Chief Legal Counsel, just thinks he's 'wonderful' - obviously has a 'personal' adoration for Dr. Sarr.  You'll TRUST Dr. Sarr because the Mayo Clinic name is behind him, and it was just supposed to be a procedure under local (if Angelina Jolie can deliver twins awake, why can't the Mayo Clinic just check part of an incision for sutures/scar tissue under local?).  As your parents think this is just a 'local procedure, they didn't take a flight to be there.  Dr. Sarr will then lie gangbusters to your parents after he tells you that he removed a quarter size NEUROMA.  Dr. Sarr will produce two versions of the operative report so that you can't figure out what really happened, and then threaten your father MD.  If anyone is to be under GENERAL ANESTHESIA, then some family member should be allowed or REQUIRED to be there - especially if the procedure is NOT AN EMERGENCY.  But he doesn't think in any common sense way, allow family to be there, or plan anything except to cut everything.  Maybe his daughter will have to be cut up like this before he stops doing this to other people's daughters.
Why the rush, the short-sell, the multilation for student pleasure?  Dr. Sarr tells the students that they have to get you back to . . . and you have told him 3 times that this is not to be a MEDICAL STUDENT DEMO or circus - but they don't get that message and have a field day touching you.  Mayo Clinic will not stop students & residents from attempting procedures that they don't know how to do, on patients they have never seen and know nothing about.  The students & residents don't read the chart.
Patients are advised to steer clear of Dr. Sarr, Dr. Baghai and the Mayo Clinic.  Definitely don't trust them that ANYTHING they say is TRUE, take a bodyguard with you to all encounters, and insist on a written consent form.  Because Jill Beed has arranged that there are no written consent forms, anything that Dr. Sarr says or does is allowed.  Dr. Sarr is the Dr. Love of Minnesota and the students shouldn't be around any patient procedures in the main hospitals - there are plenty of clinics (and dogs) to practice in.  The doing of procedures that were never discussed needs to stop.

Sarasota, Florida U.S.A. ",,941-955-1822,"Palm Beach Rejuvenation Of Sarasota Dr Robert Carlson This ""doctor"" should have his licensed taken away! Sarasota Florida","
										I too went to Dr. Carlson after reading Suzanne Somers book about hormone replacement. (I might add that I will no longer respect anything she says)
I spent over $6,000 with this doctor.
I had insurance, but he wouldn't accept it.
That's fine for office visits, but I never understood why he wouldn't write prescriptions out so I could at least use my insurance for that part of the treatment. Later, after reading through the lawsuits brought against him for selling illegal steroids and his affiliation with Signature Pharmacy, I see that he was all about $$$!
I can't even put into words how this Doctor used and abused me! I saw him in Best Buy one day, I don't think he saw me. My whole body started to shake. I felt like a person who was raped and seen their assailant out and about, enjoying their life. I thought I would pass out, my husband had to take me to sit down.
I would have a VERY long post here to write down all of this doctor's evils. I would strongly advise anyone considering this doctor to find someone else. 
Dr. Carlson does NOT care about you, he just wants your $$$
The staff here will seem friendly at first, but don't cross them or complain. Then, you will see the true colors come out. One staff member was fired.(she didn't agree with their motives) I bumped into her at a store. She told me all about the staff and doctor and that my treatment wasn't right. Nothing I didn't know already, but it felt good to have someone finally admit it.
I am now facing a side effects stemming from the HGH injections he had me taking. I have growths on my vocal chords, a common side affect from HGH.
At 44 years old, I am dealing with insurance companies not wanting to give me a policy because of all my pre-existing issues and prescription history.
The worst thing I ever did was believe a doctor simply because they are a doctor! Do yourself a favor and read and research on your own. Don't just listen to a doctor and don't just take what they prescribe you. I wish I could turn the clock back and do this myself, but that's not possible.
I can only warn people now to stay away from Dr. Robert Carlson. If you have extra money you want to throw away, then this is your guy.
Don't take any of your loved ones to him either.
I took my daughter to him as well. She was only 20 years old, but having problems stemming from PCOS. Dr. Carlson put her on thyroid medicine and we sent her back to college. She called me with chest pains and heart palpitations. I told her to stop taking all meds and took her to our regular family doctor. I showed him her blood work. He said she was one point away from what the ""normal"" range was for thyroid. He said she had no problem with her thyroid and the medicine Dr. Carlson put her on, was giving her the heart palpitations because she didn't need it. I guess he just needed a little more at that Signature Pharmacy profit money.
All I can say is that judgement day comes for all and he will have to answer for his greedy ways. 
As far as Sarasota goes, I've been to Dr. Daniel Watts, Dr. Vincent Stenger, and Dr. Carol Roberts. All in desperation to replace hormones that were taken from a needless hysterectomy. They all want to put you on lots of injections and prescriptions, most not covered by insurance. They will all make it sound like you will have drastic down fall if you don't follow their orders and scare you into trying to afford the meds. After many months and lots of out of pocket money lost, I never felt better.  None of these treatments made me feel better. Again, if I could turn the clock back, I wouldn't have let them remove my ovaries. You just can't replace your hormones like the natural ovaries did.
Unless you have cancer, don't let them take your ovaries!
This is the only reason I posted on this website.
If only one person reads this and avoids what happened to me, then it will have been worth it to have posted here.

Rome, Georgia U.S.A. ",,706-2321300,R M PEDIATRICS - DR. RAJ MINIYAR False Advertising That Cost Me Big Bucks Rome Georgia,"
										I have two children, age 6 and age 1 who have been going to Dr. Miniyar all their lives.  Recently (in November of 2008), a teacher from the Montessori School of Rome that my 6 year old attends noticed that he has been having trouble hearing.  We reported that to Dr. Miniyar as well as mentioned our own observations that my son has been turning up the TV and had trouble hearing us at home as well.  We let the doctor know upfront that there was a problem with my son's hearing.  His ears were hurting as well.  Dr Miniyar advertises his practice as 'the child's one stop shop for all the healthcare needs,' and he also mentions a 'state-of-the-art hearing test,' that can be performed right there in his office.  With that information in mind, we agreed to the hearing test even though we knew that my son's hearing was down.  This so called state of the art hearing test consisted of a handheld machine, bigger that a thermometer, that the nurse had put into each one of my son's ears: the machine beeped a couple of times, and came up with ""Refer"" on both ears.  Per the machine's instructions, we were referred to an Ear, Nose and Throat Specialist who was able to help us with a more in depth hearing test and diagnosis.  It is also worth to mention that I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield Preferred Insurance plan which is very generous in the extent of coverage.  A few weeks later we received a bill from Dr. Miniyar for $75.00 for the hearing test for my son with a handwritten note (nice personal touch!) that said my insurance did not cover a hearing test in a pediatrician's office.  I called the office and tried to resolve this as well as get an answer to the following questions:  A. Why do you advertise as a full service doctor if insurance will not cover certain procedures?  B.  Why did you not inform us that insurance may or may not cover the test.  C.  Why did you perform the test knowing that the best answer you could give was 'Refer?' and the hearing test would have to be repeated?   D.  Is it really worth $75.00 for a machine to beep 4 times and spit out 'Refer'?
In conclusin, R M Pediatrics and Dr. Miniyar specifically are a ripoff practice that advertises services which will not be covered by insurance.  You would be better off taking your children to an Immediate Care or Urgent Care facility or your own general practitioner.  If you are looking for a Pediatrician in Floyd County, GA, please take Dr. Raj Miniyar off your list.

I had a double masectomy and a tram for a repeat of cancer following me. i had interviewed several doctors and i did not want plastic so two doctors had reccomended and had heard of this Dr.  i met with him he seemed very positive he could do this surgery and i was assured ""anything i did not like, he is a plastic surgron, thats what they do he could fix or adjust anything"" Well i will spare anyone who reads this my horror story but i will say this. After numerous attempts to get him to ""fix anything"" he stated ""no, i won't"" now is this because i have medicare because no one will insure me because of my pre existing condition or is it because he is lying.
I called the office manager and asked How much will it take for him to fix me. (scars that i was told they could revise and other things on my breast that are painful and dis satisfying) she stated he does not take cash?? What??
OK but while in a waiting room i heard them taking cash for a proceedure it sounder like part of it was covered and part of it they would have to pay for.
I am running around trying to find a surgeon who will take my charity case and put him to shame but i am yet to find one.
I asked him how could you do this to me? no answer. I am so dis satisfied and disappointed in my trust i believed and put my woman hood in his hands. Why, how, why, i have seen women who have had this surgery and are proud to show their results while i have to painfully daily hide mine and cry.
No one should have to live through life and suffered what i have. I have nothing but not nice things to say and proof on my bare body to show. so sad so sad. i am to young to have suffered cancer this many times and to think they would not only be taking the bad out but supposivley i get a free ""tummy tuck out of it"" i was told.
I have a HUGE scar across my belly not bikini are either.  Ugh frustrated!

The doctor refused the renewal until I saw him again.  I tried making an appointment on December 29th to renew my prescrition and handle another medical problem.Couldn't make an appointment as no doctors were available.  
Thus I've been off synthroid for about two weeks and if I crash the famous phrase of CNN is ""so what"".

Lubbock, Texas U.S.A. ",,806-744-7223,Grace Clinic Billing Catastrophe! Lubbock Texas,"
										Prior to my visit at Grace Clinic, I contacted my insurance and notified them of my pending visit. They confirmed that as long as my office visit and any lab work or other services were billed on the same bill, the insurance would pick it up.
When I arrived at Grace Clinic, I asked this question over and over ""would everything be billed on the same visit and same bill"". The response I received, at least three times from three different people, was 'yes'. 
Since everything was done on the same day, on the same visit, on the same campus, and since I had received reassurance from everyone I asked, I assumed the bill would be taken care of by my insurance. 
Two months later I received a bill for $260 from Grace Clinic for the blood work done on that visit. 
When I contacted the clinic, they notified me that the nurse practitioner is not allowed to order blood work. The orders came from her Dr., so the exam and blood work were billed separately. They then stated that only one claim per doctor can be filed. So, according to her words, even if I had seen the Dr. for the visit and he had ordered the blood work, I would still end up footing the bill because only 'one claim per doctor'. I explained that no one had notified me of this prior to getting the lab work done (as I hadn't wanted to do it since blood had been drawn earlier that year), she said it was because most people didn't know about that claim rule.
So now, here I am stuck with a $260 bill because they put qualifications on my visit and refuse to bill the exam and blood work on the same ticket.
For all of you that have insurance out there, make sure to get everything IN WRITING!!! I will no longer go to the dr's office to get anything done other than an exam. You don't have health insurance, you get screwed over - you have health insurance, you get screwed over. Doesn't make a difference, you still end up paying out of your pocket.

Dr Tom G Mayer,"  Dr Tom G Mayer  5701 Maple Avenue, Suite 100 
Dallas, Texas U.S.A. ",,214-351-6600,Dr Tom G Mayer Ignored and was abusive Dallas Texas,"
										Our aunt and mother was sent to Dr Mayer to evaluate injuries she recieved at work in 2005 and 2006. He was told she also sustained a concussion on May 12 2008 in which caused Aphasia and she always has a patient advocate with her. He was also told that she uses the cane,walker or crutches due to falling from her left knee popping out and that when the shoulder moves something pops and she has no feeling in her legs. He was also told that on several occasions she has been almost like paralyzed from not being able to feel her body shoulders down. Dr Mayer ignored all this info told to him.
Dr Mayer refused to let her advocate in the room with her and failed to look at her left knee and right shoulder at the first visit and proceeded to write a report saying there was nothing wrong and his rehab program (which he owns this rehab and is a work comp rehab only from what we could tell) would help her. In the meantime my aunt went to a Dr on her health ins and was told that yes there is a problem and the knee needed surgery and that the right shoulder never recieved the proper care. Dr Mayer had his therapist do a eval but due to the noisey enviroment she was not able to function and was told they would reschedule the visit to where there would not be so much going on. Dr Mayer was also told this is a issue with her but in his report he writes she has phobias which if you know a person with a head injury you will know this is a common issue with them and being overstimulated is not good.
Dr Mayer and the Work Comp decided for the patient to go to Dr Mayers Rehab and she was put in a hotel room alone. She was not provided with a handicap room nor did she have any way to provide food for herself. As this was a large hotel and she had no clue on how to get to the lobby. The first morning she fell in the bathroom this was on Oct 29 and recieved another concussion in which as of today has increased her problems. This fall also created more issues with her shoulder and neck. The surgery for her left knee had to be cancelled but was done on Nov 14th
The patient went back to the pain management Dr and she told him the shoulder and neck were bad and asked who she needed to call as no one would call her back. He sent her back to Dr Mayer on Jan 6. The patient at this time had her Mother and Daughter with her for advocates and also had the report written by the speech therapist in which went into detail about her communication problems which does include getting confused and using incorrect words. Dr Mayer again refused to let them remain. He did not eval anything only grabbed her right arm with a lot of pressure and poked at it. She told him he was hurting her and was causing her to have the tingling and numbness because he was moving the shoulder toward the neck. Dr Mayer said he wasn't and added more pressure in which was not needed. He then proceeded to tell her nothing was wrong with her and she was hypersensitive to pain due to being a drug abuser (which is way not true as we have the proof of that) He did have her family come into the room when he was saying that part. Dr Mayer also told them he would call the police if they did not leave as the patient was requesting to see the pain Dr. After they left the patient was complaining of the pain in her shoulder and elbow along with the numbness that was increasing.
That evening upon changing clothes the patient noticed many red imprints where Dr Mayer had his grip and poking into her shoulder. We did make pictures of this. Naturally most of these red marks turned into bruises. There was no reason for the Dr to have a grip on her right elbow to leave bruising and there is a concern he hurt the ulnar nerve as her right hand has started to claw (she had surgery on this in 2007 and it was fixed).
This patient has been in PT and examined before and never had a mark on her. To this date she has not been evaluated for the injuries even after a fall in March 2008 in which the therapist reported it and to date has been ignored. We were told that this Dr Mayer was to eval her right shoulder,cervical area,lower back,right hip,left knee and right knee but did not. No X-ray,MRI or EMG has been done since. To be fair to Dr Mayer the metal in her shoulder would impede a proper reading of a MRI. But for the lower back and hip there was never a EMG done since the fall March 2008 there has been nothing done to see what is going on.  The Private Dr is trying to get to the bottom of it but it is a work comp injury and Dr Mayer is getting rid of her for the system. There is no way you can make a honest diagnosis when you do not look or listen to the patient. Incorrect he looked at her once to hurt her.
FYI all visits were recorded either by video off a cell phone and recorded by digital recorder. The patient was not aware of this the family did this due to Dr Mayer's actions and for her protection. He violated her rights and left physical damage to her.

My insurance carrier pays for all my cleanings in which Dr. Livy Stoyka was listed as a provider. I left there with a cleaning and a $75 bill for required Dr. services along with a treatment plan for $3600. When I asked the front desk lady about the additional fees, the Dr. yelled from a room in the back tell him if he doesn't want to pay his bill we'll just send him to collectionsI don't give a s**t! After I picked up my jaw from the floor, I nicely asked again because it was the first time that a Dentist office had charged me for Miscellaneous items when receiving a cleaning.  She came out from the back room screaming at me telling me to get out or she will call the police! I calmly asked her if it was alright that I just pay the bill first and I will take up the rest with insurance. She then proceeded to pick up the phone and call the police. 
As I was leaving she yelled that's right get the f**k out.  As you can imagine I was in shock as I didn't have clue what just happened.  I went home and notified my insurance carrier and they stated that the additional fees were inappropriate and that I should have not been billed for anything.  A relative of my wife who works in the local clerk's office found that there were 2 mental health complaints against her. I thought that maybe she was just having a bad day, but it seems to be deeper than that.

Littleton, Colorado U.S.A. ",,303-730-3332,Doctor Tameira Hollander Obtained court order to shut my blog down through perjury Littleton Colorado,"
										I'm looking for an attorney to represent me, as my main website and blog were ordered removed by the Arapahoe (Colorado) district court.
Dr. Tameira Hollander sued me because I had posted a LINK to John Bailey's website.  He is the husband of her former patient Barbara Bailey and he claimed that Dr. Hollander almost killed his wife.  To support his allegation, he had a number of webpages with extremely detailed information and documentation.
Mr. Bailey's website was so convincing, I posted the LINK at my site with my comment:
A great site and fantastic example of how everybody should DOCUMENT and PUBLICIZE their complaints!
The Baileys immediately deleted their website when they were served, but I refused to remove all references to Dr. Hollander.  Dr. Hollander is apparently NOT capable of typing her own email address correctly and despite my requests for SPECIFIC allegedly libelous statements, she submitted none.
The allegations against me are entirely fabricated and despite my request for comments to Dr. Tameira Hollander's attorneys and my repeated requests to provide ANY documentation to substantiate their allegations, I have received NOTHING. 
They are monitoring my NEW blog about the litigation and to date they have NOT submitted notice of any incorrect statement.  Everything at my blog is ACCURATE.
I am posting all communications with Dr. Hollander's attorneys, Irving Johnson and Lauren E. Dorweiler with Pryor Johnson Carney Karr Nixon, P.C. in Greenwood Village, CO at the new litigation blog.
They agreed to stipulate to extend my time to respond to the complaint to 2/12/09 and I hope to find an attorney not only to get the TRO vacated, but to LITIGATE the ISSUES:
1) Dr. Tameira Hollander's PERJURY (she verified the FALSE allegations in the complaint under oath)
2) Their process server / Peeping Tom's trespassing on my property and TERRORIZING me.  I decided to arm and defend myself against future intruders, but I still have nightmares and I'll probably have to move or spend at least $20,000 on security.
3)  While I'm aware of the lawyers' ""privilege"" to lie (the litigation privilege), I sure would like to see some repercussions against attorney Irving Johnson for  filing this harassment complaint, KNOWING that the allegations against me were false.
He wrote to me prior to serving me that he wanted me to remove Tameira Hollander's name from my sites.  Posting someone's NAME is NOT libel and neither are my TRUE statements.
Essentially, he conspired with Dr. Hollander to attempt to threaten, harass and abuse me until I agree to rewrite history and delete all references to Dr. Hollander from my sites.  Naming me in this lawsuit is pure malicious prosecution.
4) I also find it suspicious that the judge ordered the removal of my site without ANY evidence whatsoever.  
If this judge did nothing wrong, the RipoffReport site could be ordered removed too.   I think there's at minimum the appearance of impropriety and I wouldn't be surprised at all if the lawyer and the judge are friends.  
If they aren't friends, WHY did the judge order my blog removed without any evidence of defamatory statements?
This order doesn't pass the smell test and I think they expected me to cave in after being served like the Baileys .
Of course their strategy backfired, as you will notice if you search the web for ""Tameira Hollander."" 
If you want to send a message to  judges, lawyers, doctors, scammers and incompetent professionals of all sorts, PLEASE link to this RipoffReport from your sites and repost it at other free speech and complaint sites.  
I want to make this THE free speech case.

										My experience involved a referral, just like the other report on this site.
I first went to this clinic to get a complete physical. As part of the physical, I was told that my cholesterol was slightly elevated above the norm.The doctor immediately wanted to put me on a cholesterol reducing medication, and I told her I would rather try to control it with diet instead. Although I know many drugs work wonders, I am very wary of the knee-jerk reaction some doctors have to prescribing drugs. She said, ""Ill give you two months, then come back and get the drug."" No encouragement, instead the attitude was ""You'll fail, and then well put you on the drug."" 
This was in December, and I did not go back in February. I did modify my diet so that I ate more fruits and vegetables, less bread etc etc. In the meantime, I developed an increasingly deteriorating eye condition which started out as ""iritis"" then ""uveitis,"" ""pars planitis"" and then an inflamed and swollen retina. I had been under the care of an ophthalmologist in Ft Myers for six months, but was unable to continue driving there, so he told me to find a retina/vitreous specialist in Tampa to treat my worsening eye condition. 
At the time I knew my insurance would required a specialist referral. Therefore, I knew I needed a referral from GMS before I could see the retina/vitreous specialists. 
I called GMS and they said ""You dont need a referral."" I replied, ""Yes, I do, my insurance requires it-please look at my card, its right on the front of the card."" Response: ""No, you dont need a referral, the rep told us so--let me transfer you to someone who can explain to you about referrals."" Next person: ""You dont need a referral"" Me: ""Cant you call my insurance to confirm whether I do or not?"" Reply: Thats not our job, we dont call insurance companies; they call us."" Me: "" I have a very serious eye condition which needs immediate attention. My eyes are red and inflamed and I have been diagnosed with a serious retina/vitreous condition which needs immediate treatment."" Response: ""Well you will have to come in--you havent been here in a year"" Me: ""I was there In December (this was 7 mo later) and had a complete physical exam-this is the beginning of August: that isnt a year."" Response: ""Too bad, you have to come in, and then the Doctor will explain to you about referrals"" Me: ""Do you not care at all about your patient?"" Response: ""We see you didnt come back to get your cholesterol medication-we care more about you than you do."" Me: "" But I have a serious eye condition that needs immediate attention--doesnt that mean anything to you.?"" Response: ""If you want a referral you will have to make an appointment and come in."" Me: ""And what are you going to see me for?"" Response: ""To explain to you about referrals"".
Very Important:At this point in time, I was legally blind due to this eye condition and really did need to see the specialist immediately. It could also have deteriorated to the point that it would have permanently affected my vision. 
I called the Retina/Vitreous Specialists in Tampa (great people and doctors). They asked me to see if I could get a referral from the ophthalmologist in Ft Myers, even though he was not my primary care physician. I did that, and he personally wrote a letter to GMS castigating them in very professional, but uncompromising terms, about their failure to care-- disregarding my need for a referral. I had also confirmed with my insurance that I indeed needed a referral for the eye specialist. My insurance asked me if I wanted to file a report against them, and I did. 
The end of this story is the best and most unbelievable part. I received a letter in the mail telling me not to come to come back--they were kicking me out of GMS. Mind you, I was NEVER verbally abusive or rude to them at all. Just unbelievable frustrated.

										I've had similar experiences as the previous posters.  I probably visited them ten times and never saw the same doctor or assistant.  
When I called in to get a refill on a non-narcotic, non-controlled prescription they insisted that I came in for yet another office visit.  When I went in all they asked me was what I was there for, I said the refill and they wrote it for me.  All they wanted was the fee for the office visit.  My copay is only $20 but who knows what they actually charge my insurance company.  That's the reason healthcare is so expensive now.
The straw that broke the camel's back was the referral situation that others have commented on.  I had talked to them many times about my allergy issues and they never suggested seeing anyone about it.  Finally I decided on my own to call an allergist and found out I needed a referral.  Since I had talked to them about the condition before I didn't think it would be a problem but of course they insisted on yet another office visit.
After I explained the situation they still wouldn't help me so I stated that maybe I needed to find a new PCP because it didn't seem like they were to concerned about my business.  Like others I received the ""We will no longer provide care for you"" letter a few days later.  I already found a new PCP by that time and now my only regret is that I have to request my records from them and they might take satisfaction in thinking that they dropped me first.  Stay away!

I have seen many Dr's and they all agree I have brain damage from this. I moved from Longview to be near my daughter and needed a new Neuologist, went to Dr Robinson. 
She did an MRI and compared it to the other one. She wrote ""abnormal"" on it, telling me there were more white spots on it. I asked her to fill out my disablity paperwork and she said OK you can pick it up the next visit. 
The next visit she did not say anything about my condition, she had the disablity forms in her hand and threw them in my lap. ""I am not going to do this, you are a fraud, you need a Psychiatrist not a Neurologist."" I have been followed by a Neurologist since my brain injury. She was red in the face and got right near me. ""I have morals, I will not commit fraud"" This was in a raised voice, then she stormed out as I was trying to ask her something, went in her office and slammed the door.
I have asked the clinic manager many times to have another MD review my records and requested an apology from Robinson who clearly has issues. Nothing yet.

										I too wish I would have found this website link to My Choice Medical before I used them.  I had originally planned on getting both a breast augmentation and a tummy tuck. I was going to get them a couple of years apart due to finances.  Even though My Choice Medical offers $99 down that was hardly the case.  My credit was bad yes, but that is the consurmers they are trying to attract.  I had to put almost 50% down of my surgery which I did over several months.  
At the dr's visit I spoke and was examined by the dr who seemed bored and disinterested.  I was with him about 15 minutes tops.  The next hour and almost a half I spent with the rep from My Choice Medical.  I signed all the papers and gave her $1000.  I had already put down $500.  I left feeling uncomfortable but felt it was just becasue I'd never had plastic surgery before or dealt with that sort of finance company.  
My hardest desicion was the size.  I am very petite, 5'0 and did not want to be too large.  I expressed this to the dr.  I wanted to go with a 325cc but was talked into a larger size.  I was told I would regret not going larger after the surgery.  So finally I decided on a 360cc.  I called to notify the dr's office of my decision.  The day of my surgery I was still concerened and asked the dr directly if he had the 360cc implants.  He said he had both.  360cc and 390cc.
I told him I want the 360cc again.  When I came out of surgery (which hurt several times throughout the surgery) my first question was the size of the implant and was appalled to find out he had used 390ccs.  It was over what could I do?  I noticed a few days later the placement was very different.  One sat very high and the other very low and heavy.  
I did call the dr's office and was assured it would settle in time.  It never did.  This was in 2006.  I went ahead and in 2008 have my tummy tuck with another surgeon who did a beautiful job.  He noticed my implants and asked me what had happened.  By this time I had gone through the depression and anger of it that I had wasted my money.  I was actually happier with my small proportionate breasts then with these huge implants that did not fit my body frame.   
One sat high totally above my nipple and the other was low and to the side.  Even though the size bothered me I would have been able to live with it had they not looked like they did.  The surgeon explained to me what could be done very briefly but in detail.  It made sense to me and I was motivated to get it done.
I called My Choice Medical and spoke to Rhabia Khan who I had spoken to before about the tummy tuck and mentioned the botched breast augmentation.  Of course she seemed very sympathetic and promised she would see what could be done for me.  I was approved for the tummy tuck and the breast revision.  However they ended up losing the paperwork which I had at home.  
I was at the dr's at my pre-op when I found out.  I couldn't go home and get the paper fax it to them and get it all done before my lunch hour was up.  So I went with just he tummy tuck.  I never heard from Rhabia Khan again.  
Now four months after my tummy tuck I called My Choice Medical again and was advised to go see the original surgeon.  Of course he took no responsiblity for it saying he gave me what I asked for.  I reminded him I'd asked for 360ccs and he gave me 390ccs.  First he said there was not that much of a difference then he said it was actually a range of 360-390.  This was the first time anyone ever said anything about a range.  
I was told 360 OR 390 never a range.  But he inisited that is the way it works.  That he got a 360 and filled it to 390.  Then why offer 360ccs?  The surgeon who did my tummy tuck told me if I asked him for a 360 then that is what he would fill it to.  Anyway we went back and forth about the size.  But when I asked him about the placement he really had no answer.  In fact he insisted that even though one was high and he could reposition it he said the other one was just fine.  It so obvioulsy not fine.  Hanging down and to the side so much I could feel it rub my arm when I walked.  
After the visit I called My Choice Medical and Danielle said she would call the dr's office immeditately and call me back the next day.  That was Monday.  I called throughout the week and was put off until finally Friday I again spoke to Danielle.  She gave me a price but told me they were bought out by another company and no longer offered financing.  Yet it is all over the website today.  As I'm sure it will continue to be.  Yet she apparently wanted for me to pay them the entire amount before the surgery.
Fortunately at this point I had already decided to just save it up over several months and let the other surgeon do it.  Although he could not offer me a discounted price, he did offer sort of a layaway with no interest.  It will be worth the wait.
My issue is of course with the original dr but also with My Choice Medical.  I was so confused at the first visit and wanted to ask questions but all they were interested in was taking my money.  Once they had that, it was very difficult to get hold of them.  I even had the rep from My Choice Medical suggest a larger size to me when I was trying to make a decision.  I thought she was the dr's staff and later realized she was not.  
Then all this week they put me off until today.  Probably because I kept calling all day.  Danielle also told me that they had dropped the surgeon that did my tummy tuck because he was not board certified.  Yet they are the ones who approved him for my tummy tuck when I refused to go back to Dr. Davis for it.  
They pretty much tell you whatever to hook you and get your money then they just want you to go away quietly if you have any problems.

										On my way to Phoenix Children's Hospital I called and asked if the hospital was a preferred provider for Blue Cross and Blue Shield Insurance and was told yes.  However during our son's hospitalization unbeknownst and unauthorized by us his parents.  Our son was seen and treated by numerous doctors who were out of our network and non-participating providers.  We were shocked when the bills started pouring in.  What should have cost us a co-payment and a 10-25% co-pay ended up costing us much more with all the out of network charges. 
I think it is ridiculous that the hospital allows doctors to practice under the guise that we (Phoenix Children's Hospital) accepts Blue Cross and Blue Shield) but our doctors do not!  I think is unreasonable that these doctors will not plan allowances as reasonable charges.  The worst of these doctors was Phoenix Children's Medical Group.  I spoke with the doctors billing department who would not budge on the unreasonable billed amounts.

Gold River, California U.S.A. ",,916-631-1536,"Ann J. Peters, MD,  MD Longevity Overcharges For Services & Products Gold River California","
										I'm sure Ann J. Peters, MD is a very capable doctor.  However, she does overcharge for her services.  Please note, many doctors (and specialists) who believe they provide an above and beyond standard of care may charge more for their services and that's fine.  This is not the case with Dr. Peters, she overcharges for services.
I was looking for a hormone replacement specialist to guide me through menopause.  Had I researched her (who would have thought to do that with an MD?), I would have not gone to her.  There are other excellent MD's who provide the same care with substantially lower fees.
Prescriptions are ordered through an out of town compounding pharmacy by her, not the patient.  A pricing example: Testosterone - Dr. Peters' price $76.50/month and my local pharmacy charges $17.75/month for the identical product.  I called her pharmacy, they quoted me $37.50/month.  This means she upcharges $39.00!!  With my six prescriptions, she was upcharging me almost $200 per month.  And that's in addition to the 6 month management fee of $1,000!  She would not allow me to use a local pharmacy.
Can doctors buy prescriptions and resale to patients?  What about sales tax??
The second month she was three days late in sending my prescriptions.  Furthermore, she sent two additional items (anti-aging face cream) that I didn't order.  I had to send them back for a refund to my credit card on file at her office.
She requires a comprehensive hormone profile done by a blood test.  I very much appreciated her thoroughness!  But again, you can only use the one laboratory she was contracted with.  I could not use my insurance.  The lab would bill her and she would bill me.  I tried to find the pricing differental but could not.  I'm sure she was upcharging on the bloodwork.
The third month she billed me for bloodwork BEFORE she sent the paperwork to me to have it done!  That's when I cancelled our relationship and requested my $1,000 six month fee returned.  She did return my money.
Lastly, her website says she will provide a ""diagnostic report"" for you to submit to your insurance company for reimbursement.  My insurance company would not accept it and, therefore, I was not reimbursed!
Again, I'm sure Dr. Peters is a very capable doctor.  She just charges too much.
Thankfully I have found an excellent MD who is a hormone specialist and works with bio-identical hormones.

When I showed up for my appointment my previous x-rays were not there because Dr. Stoyka wanted to do new x-rays.  I reminded her of the promise of her office to use the x-rays from my previous dentist.  She refused on the grounds that ""It is difficult to read x-rays from another dentist"".  My previous x-rays were not outdated and were done digitally.  She insisted again on her own x-rays.
She then refused treatment, yelled, screamed, cursed and threw me out of the office.  I have a witnessed as to her unprofessional behavior.  She seems to be mentally highly unstable and I am surprised that she has a medical license.

Chicago, Illinois U.S.A. ",,,Dr Dean Toriumi adds bulky unneccessary grafts to noses that not only make your nose looked like it was carved out of wood but also ruins the main function of the nose to breathe Chicago Illinois,"
										I went to Dr. Toriumi for a revision rhinoplasty after consulting with 5 top doctors in the field of rhinoplasty.  I concluded that since he was the top rhinoplasty surgeon in the world that he must be the best.  On his website, his pictures of his noses looked very natural and not done at all.  All of the doctors including Toriumi believed that my nose was not in that bad of shape but just needed a little tweaking. 
I did not get a little tweaking done to my nose.  I got a major overhaul.  Dr. Toriumi's method is to replace everything whether it works or not.  How would you feel if you took your car to get a tail pipe fixed and you got a completely different engine?  This is what he does with noses.  The noses he makes are large and not tapered to the individual.  Small features do not look good with large noses.  He does not take this into consideration.
A doctor's number one responsibility is To Do No Harm.  Dr. Toriumi causes irreversable changes to the nose.  He tells you this after you tell him all of your problems that you are having after his surgery.  Many other surgeons will not operate on a nose that has previously been operated on by Toriumi because of the extensive grafts that he puts into your nose.  He leaves you feeling hopeless because he tells you no one can fix it and if they try your nose will fall apart. 
I cannot breathe out of my nose properly anymore.  The skin on my nose and pores have stretched beyond their compacity.  I have constant pain in my nostril from a graft poking through.  I have extra rib cartilage stored in my head that still hurts and makes it difficult to wear glasses.  Worst of all is that my nose looks hideous.  Dr. Toriumi does not care about any of these problems.  He does not care about you period.  He is rude, manipulative, and treats you like a child.
This was the absolutely the worst decision I have ever made in my life.  My face does not look anything like it use to.  I do not wish this on anyone.  At one time, I think Dr. Toriumi was a great surgeon but not anymore.  He treats his patients like lab rats experimenting different techniques.   Funny thing, I actually think lab rats have the better end of the deal particularly if your results don't turn out well.

Many times, when I called during his regular business hours, no one would answer. Therefore, I left more messages.

I had the sugery in June of 2006 and immediately developed a hematoma at the surgical site and 2 or more DVTs in the left leg. I was told that followup surgery was necessary to repair the hematoma. Before followup surgery however, Cape Coral Hospital and SWFNA inserted a filter in my vena cava to catch any breakaway DVDs during surgery. 
After the second surgery, I was weak and in a lot of pain. Numerous MRIs indicated an infection had set up residence in my spine. My surgeon dismissed the radiologists' assessment and said that my pain was caused by inflamation and sent me home. Three weeks later I was rushed back to hospital and put on massive doses of anti-biotics. I was severly septic.
Dr. Correnti's refusal to recognize that I may have contracted an infection during my first stay in the hospital left me permanently disabled and almost cost me my life.
I fired SWFNA and hired a new team of doctors who saved my life. I stayed in the hospital for four months and went through two months of physical therapy.
You may be wondering if I sued SWFNA, Dr. Correnti and Cape Coral Hospital.
The answer is no..
Cape Coral Hospital is protected under Florida's sovereign immunity laws and Dr. Correnti has no malpractice insurance. Lawyers told that in any other state I would have had a good case, but not in Florida. Thank you Jeb Bush.
I lost my ability to walk unaided, my job and my house. My medical bills exceeded $400,000.00.

Know I was not going to be paid for training, I went in for 2 days - a total of 8 hours of shadowing and learning without getting a penny. Kathy then told me to come in on Monday to start. She told me what the pay would be ($10/hr) and knew that was too low for me. My first day there she told me she was going to give me $12/hr knowing that I needed it. She also commented that the other receptionist, her daughter, only gets $10. I am not 18 like her daughter and I have a college degree!!! But unfortunately with the economy being so bad now, you take what you can get. It seemed like a nice office with nice people so I wanted to give it a shot.

I asked about overtime if I work over 40 hrs. Kathy told me they don't ""do"" overtime. I then said ok so I only want to work 40 hrs - I don't want to go over if I'm not going to be compensated for it. On Saturday - my friend went in to observe a procedure because they were looking for a nurse so I referred her. My friend called me after and told me they were training a receptionist. Well, Lo and Behold...I got a call from Kathy at about 6:30 at night on Saturday - letting me go OVER VOICE MAIL!!!! She told me it wasn't going to work out because I didn't want to go over 40 hrs! I was completely blindsided by this because all week she said I was so wonderful and they were blessed to have me!!!!!! I am disgusted by her unprofessionalism. She told me on the message that I could come in and get my pay during the week. Then, she wouldn't answer my calls but she responded to my texts. She told me pay day is Friday. I reminded her of the voicemail she left then said she'd talk to her boss. Then she had NERVE to text me that my first week is supposed to be training and UNPAID! I was told the 2 days were training and I was starting Monday! 
I will be going in today to get my pay and surely give her and the new receptionist a piece of my mind! Also, during a patients procedure - the doctor had the 18yr old receptionist help out during the surgery - she's not even a certified nurse or medical assistant!!!!

Dear Urology Assoc. of Silicon Valley,			
I found your association on Health Net's website showing that you are an in network provider.  I went to your office and gave the receptionist my Health Net card that she copied and I then filled out the insurance paperwork for my procedure.  After being notified by your association that I had reached my deductible with my insurance, I decided to go ahead with the procedure on 9/23/08.  A few weeks after my procedure I received a bill from your association for $1057 (of which I have paid in full only to avoid a mark on my credit) stating that the doctor from your association that performed the procedure was one of the doctors that was not in the Health Net network.
Two questions;
1. Why, when knowing full well that I am with Health Net, would your association assign a doctor to me that is not in the Health Net network ?
2. After putting me with a doctor that is not in the Health Net network why was I not notified of this BEFORE my procedure ?
Due to the obvious unethical action (and possible illegal) taken by your association,
I am requesting for the full amount of $1057 to be paid back to me immediately.  If full payment is not received within 10 days of receipt of this letter I will be pursuing this to the fullest extent of the law.

She told me, no other money is due not even the co-pay, but I gave her the co-pay anyway and told her to send it back if they did not want it.  On my card it states 25.00 co-pay for all visits.

										Beware of this doctor.  My experience with him was very bad.  When I called to interview his office on his qualifications, the receptionist, Barbara, reassured me that Dr. Ourmazdi was a pediatric neurologist.  I was very adamant of my search for a pediatric neurologist.  She kept telling me that he was.  
As weeks went by after seeing the doctor several times and subjecting my daughter to various tests, he recommended us to a pediatric neurologist at UCLA.  I asked him why and the answer was that he was not actually a pediatric neurologist.  It always felt like it was all about the money and his billing process.  It was never about getting my daughter the proper care.  We went to see the doctor at UCLA and that doctor confirmed that Ourmazdi was not one and that the tests that our daughter was subjected to were unnecessary.  He put our daughter through a weekend of sleep lab which had nothing to do with her seizure disorder.  
After seeing this doctor at UCLA, he referred us back to a local doctor in Ventura who is a board certified pediatric Neurologist.  The new doctor said the same exact thing as the other doctor in UCLA told us.  That the tests that our daughter were subjected to were totally unnecessary and that he has been known to do this just to bill the insurance company.  
After paying all the other tests and office visits and after he billed our insurance company for all other charges, we refused to pay the sleep lab that he subjected our daughter to.  The 2 other doctors vouched for us that these were unnecessary procedures.  He has subjected us to harassment and ruined our credit by having collectors call us every day and reported the unnecessary bill to the credit bureau. This is his way of forcing you to pay for something that is not due him.
I just want to let people be aware so that they do not experience the same trouble that I went through.  He is very unprofessional and lies about his credentials.
After all the bad experience that I went through with Dr. Ourmazdi, I am still very happy that I got my daughter under the care of the world's best pediatric neurologist, Dr. William Goldie in Ventura, CA.  He has the best bedside manners and our daughter has been seizure free for 6 months.  Thank God for Dr. Goldie's honesty and integrity, I can feel comfortable that my daughter is in good hands and is not being subjected to unnecessary procedures.

Now to date I am very unproportionate and even more self concious of my figure and have a very low self esteem because of this.  I cannot get my money back but I also dont have the money to do anything else to correct the problem.

										My wife has been to numerous so-called 'doctors' for the cause of her extreme pain. I'm not going to say the cause here because it gives away too much info. But after she went to a particular ""doctor"" Miller in aberdeen, wa, we were both extremely disgusted. He talked so fast she could hardly understand him, and he acted the whole time like he could care less about her problem and just wanted to get her out of there and get the next patient in. He refused to help her with anything for her chronic pain and instead insinuated that she might be a ""drug addict"" just ""faking an act"" to get some sort of 'doctor-prescribed-high""! That is such an unbelievable unfair and downright RUDE thing to do to a suffering patient that has suffered from the same thing for 35 years of her life! I have had to sit and watch her suffer day after day because of these quacks that act like she's just a druggie or something and refuse her treatment!  He actually asked to SEE HER TEETH! What does that tell you folks? He's looking to see if she has any signs of the telltale teeth of a crackaddict! Unless of course he's going to say that he's also taking up dentistry now? The guy doesn't know the first thing about neurology! HE SUCKS! He couldn't even read the MRI correctly, and failed to see what TWO OTHER DOCTORS SAW!!!  
She has been getting strokes from the pain that actually caused her blindness in one eye and that guy has the audacity to accuse her of being a ""druggie""? Who the hell does he think he is?
And then when I had to go to him he had to put tiny needle in me to test something and because the area was numb from an injury he said..."" geez, for being sensitive to needles you sure don't seem to feel it much!"" What is wrong with the guy? How can he NOT understand that the whole area was numb from the injury as I had ALREADY TOLD HIM! What, is he hard of hearing too? Does he think that just because there's druggies in the area that means that everyone that comes in there are all druggies? There's druggies EVERYWHERE DUDE! Get a clue!  YOU SUCK! You don't know crap about your profession. Do the public a favor and get out of the business because all you're doing is wasting patients time and money.

Actually even offered to pay what the normal consult fee would be had they not been doing a free consult promotion.  Just deduct that fee from the $2700.00 I paid and reimburse me the difference.  Was told that since I did not call in the 3 day ""cancellation period"" I was SOL.  Funny how they only give you 3 days...just the amount of time for a check to clear.

This is not to complain about Dr. Greene's ability as a surgeon, just to be clear. 
     My complaint is that I was lied to and I feel that his staff members had more than sufficient time to inform me of this insurance issue prior to my office visit and prior to taking my $210. I feel that they get you into the office just to try to sell you on paying for the surgery out of pocket.

We agreed to a follow up appointment and explained we no longer have dental insurance, would be paying diretly and need to know what will be required in advance.
I sat in the waiting room for the entire appointment and Dr. Calleia took it upon himself to fill both teeth without consulting me. I found out only when I stood up to pay the nurse?  
Not wanting to make my daughter uncomfortable needing dental work, I waited till getting home and called to notified them they should have discussed this additional work with me in the waiting room before causing me to incur additional expenses without my consent.  
I requested they issue a credit for the difference in the 2 procedures (sealing vs. filling) and said I will glady pay what the sealing would have cost that I previously agreed to.  Dr. Calleia did not apologize but agreed to this.  
When the credit card statment arrived ""surprise"" NO credit for the agreed $110.00 upcharge.  I spoke with the office manager who claimed they didn't have the credit card number to issue a credit?  You mean the one I just used to pay with?  They clamed to have issued an office credit but produced no documentaiton to support this and nothing ever arrived in the mail as you would expect from someone who intended to validate they honored their agreement.
These are challenging times for many families and we want to do right by our children.  Upselling someone you know is paying with cash (without dental insurance) is no way to show you are the kind of ""trusted professional"" I want to be associated with.  Shame on you!

The charges from Dr. Gihan was not paid by insurance company because they were not having registration under panel with our insurance company. Now, it seems that there was a change in specialists at Anaheim Memorial Hospital and the new specialist for Anesthesia was not registred under panel of our Insurance company, which is widely known and accepted insurance company. My wife was alone there in hospital when the staff present decided to call this specialists to give anesthesia to the patient. She was not informed that our insurance does not cover the services by this specialists. Moreover, she was not in position also to make a decision in this regard, nor the staff present at hospital were able to offer a choice as they have to use service of the consultant available. 
We were not aware of this problem untill we received a bill from respected Dr GIhan G George for an amount of $1,520. We called up them, the hospital and our insurance company and come to know that there are several such incidents happend during those days because the Specialist was not registered under panel with the insurance company. We understand that they did the registration under panel after the date of treatment to my wife. We requested our insurance company to accept their claim and also explained the Dr of our financial situation and the insurance company has paid substantial amount of it, now pending is $229.52 as per their statement. 
The specialists office is keep on sending us reminders and calls to pay $229.52 failing which they will refer our case to a collection agency. We feel that had if they have taken care of the insurance requirements full payment was supposed to be paid by our insurance. We do not have so much resources so that we easily decide to pay this. Currently we are not having any health insurance for us.

I visited this place just for a routine physical examination, and instead I ended up paying for the whole examination price in advanced because they told me you have to leave a 'deposit' for the service in advance, in case the insurance won't pay for the service, they call it 'deposit' I trust on them and agreed to pay the 'deposit' for more than $400, and they promised to give me my deposit back as soon as they receive the check from the insurance. After a month, I received the insurance statement  and I almost got heart attack they overcharge to my Insurance lots of money and then when I called to office to get my money back, they were giving me thousand of excuses for not refund my 'deposit'. I was just asking my 'deposit' back . After a formal conversation with the ""manager"" from who I just received insults, an non stop yells, she is not a professional and doesn't know how to treat people. I was calmed down, instead of being me the upset person.

										I went to southwest washington medical center for excruciating pain in my body caused by a pinched nerve.  That's when I met the Dr. from hell called Dr. Rosande.  He could care less about my pain but was more concerned as to why I didn't have a primary doctor and my age.  If I had a primary doctor I would have still ended up in the ER because it was a weekend.  And what does my age have to do with a pinched nerve?  Anyone can have a pinched nerve at any age.  He just doesn't like old people.  This doctor had an attitude when he came in my room and unloaded on me with disrespect and rudeness, which reflects on his up-bringing and parents.  I did not go there to argue about a primary doctor or my age.  I could care less what he thinks about either one.  He was hateful and would not give me the right strenght of pain killer to relax the muscles that was pinching the nerve.  I believe he did this to force me to see a doctor, well it didn't work.  He used my pain to try to blackmail into his agenda.  And all his discrimating remarks about my age.  I was well able to pay for the treatment with my insurance.  He is a control freek.  He is the most despicable, dispassionate person i have ever met and he shouldn't be a doctor.  He acts like he got his training in one of those death camps in Germany or Poland.

										Dr. Brian Shrager is a very dangerous doctor with poor self-control and questionable skills.  In fact, he lost his license in Pennsylvania.  My doctor advised me to not refer anyone to him because of his past record in Pennsylvania.  Some doctors think they can simply move to another state and acquire a clean record.  Patients need to know a doctor's past and this should include all pertinent information from other states in which they practiced.   Please read below.  This was taken from a state government website, not a website financed by this doctor with patient-victim money.  
I have also heard from physicians in New Jersey that Dr. Shrager is reckless.  I wouldn't want to be asleep under his control!  No one wants a doctor whose high on drugs.  Rumor has it that Dr. Shrager was likely fired from his last job in Florida and his last job in Pennsylvania.   Rumor also has it that he has hired PR reps for the internet.  Don't trust this shady drug abusing doctor, unless you don't mind being operated on by a doctor whose under the influence.  If you need a good doctor, my doctor recommends surgeons at UPenn or Johns Hopkins.  
The Pennsylvania Board of Medicine imposed the following sanctions: 
Brian L. Shrager, license no. MT-046026-T, of Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, was automatically suspended based on the fact that he was found guilty of a misdemeanor under the Controlled Substance, Drug, Devise and Cosmetic Act. (8-13-02)

Newport Beach, California U.S.A. ",,949-720-1400,Dr. Richard A.  Weiss botched eyelid blepharoplasty. Used me as an experiment.  Lied about his asian eye lid experience. Newport Beach California,"
										Dr. Richard A. Weiss of Newport Beach is not a comestic surgeron anyone should use. I seen comestic surgery in the first place cuz I am born with an extra crease fold that is near the inner corners of my eye lids.  I wanted to use eye liner on my eyes and wasn't able to because of this extra crease.  I have a picture of me that clearly show the crease that I am talking about. I was not unhappy about my almond shaped asian eyes, just didn't like the extra crease on the inner corners of my eyes.  
   You need to see all those surgical scars he left on my eyelid creases and all over my eye area from 1992 when I was only 27 years old.   You would think that he advertised honestly, but not.  I am currently working on getting some photos of my blotched eyes for people to see.  I am so glad that there are websites nowadays that allow patients to expose doctors for what they did without informed consense or detailed knowlege of what an inexperience doctor can do to your face.  
At that time, this doctor told me he had worked on asian eyelids and he sounded really confident that he can do the job.  It is a nightmare from then on.............. I believe he used my face to experiment on.  I only realize it this year.  Back in 1992, I read brochures from many doctor's office that stated eyelid surgery will leave  a hairline scar not very noticeable on your eyelid creases.  There was no internet in the early 90's for the general public to use or get information from.  
So, I am not as lucky as some of you nowadays can get information off many websites and having websites like this to air the truth about bad doctors.  I got many surgical scars from my eyelid crease to my hairline (so much more on my left eye than my right eye).  He stitched me up so tight that I am left with winkle looking creases and  surgical scars outside of my creases (you will need to see a picture of me, then you will see how bad it is.  At a distance it looks like there is a map to the side of my eyes due to so much surgical scars).  
My crease has bumps and lumps along with zig zag stitch marks.  If you ladies sew, then you will understand better what I mean.  (example:  the skin around your eyes are very delicate just like silk fabric. If you snag it, it looks really bad and you won't want to wear that item anymore.   
Anway in April, I notice my right eye brow is lower than my left eye brow cuz I started to use eyebrow pencil to put some colors into my brows, so I decided to plug out both of my brows.  I wanted to pencil it in instead.  I then realize both of my eye brows also have surgical scar that was covered by my  eyebrow hair.  So what the F*ck did this moron do to me? Why is there surgical marks there.  According to all the information I found on the internet recently , stitches should only be on the eye crease fold. I have it all over the place.  
Dr. Richard Slasher A. Weiss gave both of my eyes a different shape and size too!!!  My eastern asian eyebrows should not be sagging at age of 44.   I come from a family of many siblings and I am the second to the youngest.  So if this is not a nightmare for you, then go and have him to do your eyelid surgery or any other type of surgery.  Don't say I didn't warn you ahead of time.  I am posting this cause I don't want anyone to live their life with all the  noticeable surgical scars that I wear on my face each day.   Have their been information that inform me that this kind of blotch job can happen, I wouldn't have got it done from him or anyone.
I also know that their will be a lot of fake comments posted not by patients to defend this Dr. Slasher's reputation.   Wait until I can post pictures  for you to see.  Pictures speaks louder than any positive comments posted for this doctor.  I believe in Karma and I know God or some higher power will make him pay one way or  another.............

										I got my implants put in by this doctor late in 1990.  I asked for saline and he placed gave me silicon implants.  Doctors order two pairs of implant because when one breaks or leaks during surgery, he will  have another pair to used.  I paid for 2 pairs of Saline Implants.  He is very dishonest knowing that I have concern about silicon implants due to the high pubicity of some patient's claim silicon leaked after implantation caused health problems.  
This doctor used a spare pairs of silicon implants left over from another patient.  I only saw one set of implants at the operating table.  When I went back for my follow up and asked his Nurse named Vangie (this is in 1990) what brand of saline did they used on me and that is when she told me they used an implant that is 1/2 silicon and 1/2 saline.  I told her I did not ask for that and I went to other plastic surgeons to ask if there is such a mixture for implant and they told me ""NO"".  
THe doctor is a crook and the nurse is a lair.........  What a team!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ever seen I got the implants I get on getting really bad rashes on both of my breast and it never stop until I got them removed.  Also when I got them remove they weren't the size of implants I asked for either!!!!!!!!!!
  I also got eyelids done by him which is also blotched. He told me he will fix them, but I have to wait like 3 to 4 months to see the finally result before he can fix them.  I believe him and went back and he told me my eyelids looks very good and they look so nature.  I was so pissed.  I am eastern asian have double eyelids and went to him because I wasn't happy with the extra crease fold on the inner corners of my eyes.  He told me he can do what I ask.  Little did I know that he didn't have the right experience to do that kind of surgery.............
Beware this doctor and his nurse Vangie (a philiapina nurse -- very pretty) both are  crooks and lairs..............   I have nothing to gain, and hope you people are aware of such evil people...............

										In mid 2008 I supplied Mountain View Pediatrics (MVP) of Flagstaff, AZ.  with authorization to retrieve medical records for my son from doctors that has seen him in Bullhead City, AZ. On March 30, 2009 Christopher Becker, office manager for MVP,  emailed my sons medical records for a MVP doctor's visit on 03-30-09. At that time, I notified Becker of the authorization and again of the doctors that has seen my son, 6 year old boy and that I did to allow his office to be in the loop of his medical history.
When I found out the mother (Suzanne De Vivo) did not inform MVP of the other Doctor's. I informed MVP that she had known due to the health insurance is through her employer Southwest Windpower. This mother has been in complete contact with the ER (WARMC) and Doctors here in Bullhead City, AZ. I felt this has become a bigger issue now. 
Dr. Tuckman of MVP and I spoke in great detail about my son and his history. I told this Dr. Tuckman of the ENT (ear nose and throat) Doctor that saw my son in 2008 along with an ER visit, The ER follow-up Doctor and the Doctor that has seen my son on a regular basis. This mother, Suzanne M. De Vivo of Southwest Windpower has not told MVP about any other Doctor or Medication issues my son has or had.
He currently takes Singular for allergies. Suzanne M. DeVivo knows of this, my son will tell she has given him the chewable tablets.
On April 25, 2009 Christopher Becker writes an email informing me that if I want to see my own sons medical records I have to fill out a release form. Since 2006 I have personally taken my son to that office and now they want me to sign a release, after Mr. Becker had already released records to me.  Christopher Becker violates HIPPA laws and asked me to back date a form to 03-29-09, I filed a complaint instead.
Christopher Becker already violated hippa. Over the phone he asked that I complete the form to cover his butt, due to how he already sent and does not have a release on file.
On 04-20-09 Mountain View Pediatrics prescribes Amoxicillin to this child after this practice had received letters and papers from other doctors about not prescribing amoxicillin and the two antibiotics that have worked. This child has experienced adverse reactions to Amoxicillin as a toddler and at 5 years old, now again at 6 years old.
This father informed Dr. Tuckman and this practices office manager and sent via email the actual letter from another pediatrician that was mailed to them in 2008.
It was asked that a new prescription be written, it was never followed up on. This child was removed from his school the following day for vomiting. No follow up was given to my son by the mother. She continued the medication and even sent a note for me to continue it.
This boy suffers from allergies; in 2006 the same practice was at odds with this father over allergy issues with the same child. Dr. Feldman of Cottonwood, Az. diagnosed my son with allergies.
Suzanne De Vivo, Herodotus, Travis had already caused the handicapped birth by not obtaining prenatal care for Madison D. Travis.
You cannot treat allergies with antibiotics unless the allergies goes unmedicated. Suzanne M. DeVivo has not told MVP about this childs allergies.

After calling her office to confirm with her staff that Dr. Jozewicz suffered no physical injury from the accident, its clear that this neurologist is desperately in need of $$ to take more ski vacations and sue other small ski shops in hopes of settlements to feed this neurotic habit of hers.

I had the procedure done and went for my check ups like I was suposse to do and on the day of my 3rd check up I showed up and the whole place was empty, carpet and all. I called the number and got their answering service and they told me they had no idea where they were.I don't feel any professional dr should do that. Also talking about being professional... my sister was waiting for me in the waiting room while I was getting the  pro lipo done and Dr leff came out and one of the women who worked there sat up on the counter and gave her a shot of botox right there in the waiting room. I think that is preety nasty and very unporfessional!!! ok on to the rest of my complaints.
The whole reason I got the pro lipo instead of regular lipo was because the scars were supossed to be smaller well they weren't very small and the whole time I kept telling Dr leff that the one  incisions was infected. Dr leff told me it wasn't so I took his word. Well I went to my family doctor after awhile and he told me it was so he gave me some cream for it. After they took out the stiches that scar was very very big compared to the rest of them.During the whole recovery time they told me to use perixside on my stiches which my 11th grade son was telling me the whole time would make my scars worse (which again the reason for the pro lipo was because of smaller scars) and of course I believed the doctor instead, then after about a month in a half the doctor said to stop using it that he had just found out it made the scars worse. Now if my 11th grade son knew that then I feel a dr should have known from the start.Also I didn't expect to come out looking like a barbie, I had VERY realalistic expectations but after the procedure I did everything the dr had told me to do, I exercised and ate right and I had gained 20 pounds instead of loosing it. I did not loose ANY inches what so ever in any of the 3 spots I had it done. I look worse then I didn before I had this done. NOw I am more self concious about myself then I was before I had it done.

That was followed by 3 failed TURP Prostate operations I was told were ""definitive"" treatment for an enlarged prostate. I only ended up worse than I had been with resulting problems I had never been warned about and had not had before. I had to have additional surgery by others to fix part of what he caused and some of the damage will be permanent. 
I was embarassed by insulting language  about my physical condition he used in the presence of his female nurse who was later my student. He did not bother to ever wear a surgical mask when operating on me and because he did not fully check to see if I was numb before operation one, he actually inserted instruments into me and began to cut when I could fully feel what he was doing.
 He never offered any information about where I could go for help after my problems came despite me asking 13 different times. I wasted more than a year before getting  the help I very much needed. When I first went to him what I thought was confidence I now think was ARROGANCE and what I thought was knowledge I think was merely RHETORIC. He collected three surgical fees for doing the SAME operation 3 times and none of them fixed my problem. He appeared to have NO CLUE about sexual counseling after I was injured.

										I CAN'T BELIEVE HE STILL HAS A LICENSE!!!!!!!!!! I am a Registered Nurse who saw Dr. Schmidt in the ER at Cox South Hospital,Springfield, MO in excruciating chest pain, radiating to my jaw and  arm.
The EKG and cardiac monitor showed significant changes.My father died of a heart attack when he was 55.
Dr, Schmidt refused to even do a physical assessment telling me that his refusal was only because I was a woman in my 40's.He was  stupid enough to say,""If you were a man the same age with these same symptoms I'd jump all over it."" He then became so verbally abusive it was repugnant saying I seemed like someone who was wishing to have a heart attack.
I was treated for(in lay terms) the kind of cardiac spasms that cause a heart attack,in another ER that night,later hospitalized for it and am still on medication under the care of a cardiologist . Before this incident I worked at the Cox South ER  and had filed a sexual harassment complaint against another ER doctor there.
Please draw your own conclusion about whether Dr. Schmidt's gross misconduct that he knew or should have known could have killed me was a  retaliation. Dr. Schmidt and Cox South both billed my insurance after I had withdrawn permission for them to do so,and when I disputed paying the balance they filed a small claim to try to collect it.

										I was lured to this company through www.cathysteeth.com (apparently there are many variations of this site all doing the same thing) with the hopes of finding an inexpensive yet reliable teeth whitening product. They offer a free trial of the product for only the cost of shipping. First of all, the product doesn't work. I called to cancel within my free trial period only to find that they had already charged me the full price of the product ($78.95) not once, but FOUR TIMES for a total of $314.00. Needless to say I was furious. When you call the customer service number you get an overseas call center and speak to someone who is completely uncooperative. I am filing a complaint with my bank in hopes that I can get the charges reversed. I hope that this posting will keep someone else from getting taken.

										i am in my fifties. i have been hit hard in the past few years financially with health care issues. i owed a hospital bill that i was unable to pay at the time. the bill went to franklin services. i had already paid some on the bill when i got a call from a mr. holt. he informed me that he knew i had recently went to work for new employer. he threatened me with calling my employer. 
i had already made the huge mistake of giving them my bank account number on my first payment. i agreed to pay $500.00 at the end of the month. he had told me to call him four days before the end of the month if i could not make the payment. i was able to afford the $500.00 so i did not call him back. i had intended to call the following week and set up payments for the remaining amount.
when i checked my account he had taken the full amount. i was overdrawn by $600.00 with other outstanding checks that had not cleared. i called several times and got every run around that could be imagined. needless to say i could hire an attorney and sue them, but the cost would be more than what they took. 
i had been up front with these people and wanted to resolve the matter. they chose the most underhanded illegal way to handle this as possible. franklin services are no different that your common everyday thief. by the way, the original name i was given, tim holt, could not be reached, but two or three of his brothers work there along with some aunts, uncles, and his grandmother. a family affair. i hope they all sleep well at night.

Cincinnati, Ohio U.S.A. ",,614-326-2672,Central Ohio Primary Care overbilling for medical service Cincinnati Ohio,"
										I received medical services on May 19, 2008.  I have written documentation from the insurance company that I was insured as of May 14, 2008 and that the doctor was sent an explanation of benefits for the proper amount.  
This billing company waited almost a year to submit this claim!  They submitted it incorrectly so the insurance company said the service was rendered before I was insured.  I spent months going back and forth between the insurance company and the billing company trying to figure out why it was so easy for me to get correct information from the insurance company, yet the billing company kept claiming that the insurance company denied the claim.  
Today I finally might have figured out the problem with the help of the insurance company:  the billing company used the wrong account number.  I called the billing company to let them know.  they tried to refuse to write down the correct account number!  The woman on the line said they can only store my current insurance account number in my file.  I said, ""You're not changing my file right now.  You're writing down information about my complaint and you'll write down the proper account number so we can get this resolved!""
On the surface it might look like procrastination, laziness, and a simple error.  Unfortunately the reality is that if I don't pay they'll send my bill to a collection agency.  The collection agency will eventually put a hold on my credit line and ruin my credit.  The reality is that they are billing me an amount greater than what I owe and that is stealing.  They are trying to take it based on force, the force of them being a big unstoppable health care industry company.  That is a crime.

										Dr Jones said he expected that he could help me regain an active life through surgery and a year of physical therapy and modified activity. He damaged the nerves in my shoulder, but did not seem to care nor remember from visit to visit. 
All went well until less than two years after surgery when I began to experience a great deal of pain. He spent ten minutes with me and concluded that I should cease (at 33 years old) all activities that involve using my shoulder from YARD WORK to my other light exercises and NO fun. He said I should expect that and we accomplished our goal of stabilizing my shoulder, however that was not the goal we discussed before hand. He does not remember anything we talked about!
I could have saved myself the time, pain, money, time, money, and been inactive without the operation! Now he acts like it is a foregone conclusion that I should sit on my rear-end forever popping tramadol pills. Again, why bother with the surgery? It hurt less before the procedure than it does now. 
Now he says that we accomplished our goals. He says that it is now stable, but what good does that do me if I have to modify activity to almost nothing and hurt a lot? He can't remember what he says, then asks the same questions every time you see him.
If you are considering letting this man cut you, think long and hard about what kind of support you may need in one or two or three years. If you want someone to keep caring and treating you if you need it, then GO ELSEWHERE!

										Here's one for you. Can you believe there are doctors in New Orleans who won't take cash paying patients? Serious! My wife attempted to schedule an appointment with a Dr. Alexis Waguespack located at 120 Meadowcrest St Suite 300 Gretna, LA. She is a spine specialist without a backbone. Their number is 504-392-7123.
Though we are of very comfortable financial means and had the ability to pay Dr. Waguespack, they actually refused to see my wife. When I called the office to question them and offer a couple of thousand dollars as a 'deposit', the receptionist started yelling at me. WE DON'T TAKE NON-INSURANCE PATIENTS.
What a piece of work this Dr. Alexis Waguespack is. I mean to leave a patient hanging at the door with MRI's and Xrays in hand? Unconscionable. A complete violation of the Hippocratic Oath every physician swears. I suppose if Dr. Waguespack can't bill exorbitant fees from the insurance companies, it's not worth doing.
Thanks for joining the ranks of the greedy over the ranks of the people who you were sworn to treat Dr. Waguespack. If we had been asking for charity, I'd understand it.  We were walking in with full payment.

Plano, Texas U.S.A. ",,972-620-1700,Robert Wilcox M.D. Plastic And Cosmetic Surgery Center Of Texas Botched Breast Lift and Removal of Implants Plano Texas,"
										I had saline breast implant surgery in 1999 in Singapore.  In June of 2005 one of  the implants ruptured.  I went to Dr. Wilcox for advice and treatment.
He suggested that I have the implants removed completely and a Anchor Lift done.  He assured me that I would be very happy with the outcome and size.  He did a great job in ""selling"" the product for a little more than $7500.00 which I paid upfront.
I had the surgery the 1st week of July and returned for each check-up.  I had several surgeries in the past and never developed scar tissue so I thought this would be the case also.  
He left the drains in for almost 2 weeks and instead of stitches, he used metal staples.  
Once the staples were removed (about 10 days post operation) I began to notice that there was scar tissue forming around the incisions.  I pointed this out, but was told, it would get better.
After 3 months I was left with horrible red scars which formed a half circle under each breast and pain.  I was also larger on one side and the nipples were not equal and was not happy at the size (I had downsized from a D to what I though would be a full C, instead it was a B).
I complained again and was told that he would do scar reversal and new implants for a cost of an additional $8000.00.
I did not trust that he could perform another surgery, so I declined his offer.  He had already be paid and botched the job.
Over the next year, the pain was constant, especially at night.  I had several other doctors opinions, but none was willing to point the finger and I sure did not have another $8000.00.  I filed a complaint a year later with the Texas State Medical Board, complete with photo's and a statement from the friend who had gone with me for all of the appointments.  Even though the Board reviewed the case, they ruled  he was not at fault.  I am now left with horrible red/blue raised scars that are still painful.
I'm amazed that he is still in business!

He said the clerk would refund the copayment i'd made. I went to the front desk and told the clerk, but she said she would send a check in the mail instead of applying the credit back to my card. That was three months ago. I have phoned the doctor's office numerous times and left voice messages. They have not returned my calls. They still owe me 40 dollars for my copyament. I found out that my insurance did not cover the doctor. I received a bill from them, for the two sessions I did not receive from the doctor, and they have sent the bill to a collection agency which theatens to charge interest for non payment.

When I was called in the doctor was very rude and obnoxious. He didn't even get up to greet me. He was just sitting in the corner like a goat. He introduced himself as Dr Zemel and asked me what is my name. I said Gabriel. He replied : Gabriel what!  You don't have a last name? He shouldn't have asked for my name since he had my paperwork front of him. 
This doctor doesn't know the etiquette to shake hand with the patient when he introduces himself or he just very prejudice since I'm not an orthodox jew, like himself. After this horrible introduction he asked me so many ridiculous questions. When I tried to explain my problem he always interrupted me. He said he is not interested in my stories. 
He was questioning how come after so many treatments from my doctor  I'm still not getting better. He just said he will cut me down, since I'm not getting better. I tried to explain my back is getting better, but my arm still not functioning to the full capability , but he wouldn't listened. He was very pushy. He said after 1 year of treatment I should be better. 
I told him my accident happened on 11/22/2008 and that is 6 months prior to this visit, not a year. It took him a good 5 minutes to understand that. This doctor definitely has some kind of problem. To my best judgement this doctor shouldn't be able to practice medicine whit this attitude.

										My wife Marie Horton recently went to Next century Dental with a toothace.  After three attempts they found the tooth that was causing the problem and fixed-it...this is after 3 root canals and one cap. This is over the past three months. All along we were told that they accepted CIGNA Dental Ins. 
We just found out today that they do not accept CIGNA dental and we have been ripped-off for $1000 or dollars in discount fees and they want us to pay a balance of around $196. They offered to write-off the $196, if we agree to continue going to their practice (beginning 2010, for supposed work they beleive my wife needs.
We were told numerous stories; such as we would get reimbursed by GINA for $1000, that we owed the practice...we never saw the check it went to them...never once did anyone say that we were not covered by CIGNA - they actually called CIGNA while my wife stood by and heard a conversation between the Next Cenrty Dental personannel and CIGNA discussing our deductible and what we owed and the discounts to be implied. And that he one thousand dollar check would come straight to our homr...we would then reimburse Next Century.
Now all of a sudden, as of today, June 9, 2009 - Next Century is telling us we did bot have coverage wth CiIGNA, which means we did not receive any discounts on services.
We have basically been threatened that they will write-off"" our balance for $196 -- this is after we have paid them up to $3000 in dental work (no discounts applied, despite out being led to belive they woulfd be), if my wife promises to come back next year for more dental work.
My wife does not want to go back -- it took the dentist Dr. Hwang 3 root canal attempts and months of antibiotics to finally get rid of a 3-4 month old toothache...
We are seeking another dentist and want to go on record that Next Century has inadequate staff and is a rip-off practice, jusdt looking for ways to make money and do work that may or may not be necessary.

Belton, Texas U.S.A. ",,254-933-4040,"Dr. Steven Sewell & Scott & White Hospital Dr. Steven Sewell knowingly ""killed"" me without missing a beat Belton Texas","
										Dr. Sewell is a very dangerous man. He is methodical, cunning, devious, and prays on the elderly that look for the old timey doctor that will let you come into his office rather than go to the cold uncaring emergency room that lets you sit for 12 to 14 hours at a time before you get to see a doctor. The problem with Dr. Sewells method of old doctor treatment is he only cares about the money not the patient. And I will prove that to you now.
When I first started going to Dr. Sewell back in August of 2008 on my very first visit he actually prayed with me and my care giver, yes that's right prayed! But he forgot to use his stethascope to listen to my vital signs all he was interested in was pulling the wool over my eyes which he did very well. I have to admit his cunning really fooled me and I'm not easily fooled.
Through the year he continued to do some pretty suspecious things for example he never had me on the exam table and checked me out. Now that might not sound like a very important thing to anyone else but to me it's very important.  I am a 55 year old woman that has had 3 open heart surgeries, I also have lukemia because of the bad combination of medications that the doctors have given me I am anemic and I am on a heart transplant list or at least I was until they discovered the lukemia now I am no longer a canidate thanks to the glorious doctors and their wonderful way of making me their own personal guinney pig with the new drugs  that come out and I got to try for them. But that's not all. He told me not to go to the emergency room when I had chest pains any more. Now I'm not sure how stupid I looked to him but when he said that I deceided I better start carrying a tape recorder to my visits with me cause this man was a real jerk. 
So at my next visit I wanted to confirm what he had told me about the emergency room thinking maybe he was just in a bad mood or something but when I ask him he confirmed in no uncertained terms that I was not to go to the emergency room for any reason but to come to his office. He also told me I needed to get on a more spiritual plane. When I ask him to please go over my medications with me because there was something I was taking that was making me itch and I needed him to help me find that med. He told me he didn't have time to write them all down and he would go over it the next time. I ask him what I should do about the itching his words were ""don't scratch"".
The itching got worse and it started causeing hugh bruises on my upper legs so at my next visit 5-21-09 my caregiver and I went to Dr. Sewell's office and my bloodpressure was taken and it was 50/38, needless to say that is extremely low so low even I know an ambulance should have been called but instead Dr. Sewell and several of the doctor's in the clinic that practice with him were fixing to go to lunch and to hurry and get me out of the way he had the nurses, which I also hold responsible, give me 5cc's of ativan IM which caused my blood pressure to spiral out of control so fast that I don't even remember leaving his office. My caregiver got me home and put me in bed and stayed with me until my husband got home as soon as he got home he knew something was desperately wrong. I was freezing cold and he could not get me to wake up. So he got me in the truck and rushed me to Scott & White Hospital Emergency Room.
In the ER they did all they could but my kidneys went first I went into complete kidney renial failure then all my other major organs started going one by one they put me on a lung machine and I slipped into a coma. I was in a coma from 5-21-09 to 5-27-09 when I finally woke up. 
That doesn't sound like a long time to you but to my husband that sat there watching his wife literally dieing it was an eternity. It is a terrible shock to wake up and someone ask you do you know where you are and you don't, and then ask you what day is it and you think it's friday and it's actually tuesday of the next week. A very horrible feeling comes over you and this empty sinking feeling sets in and you know how very very close death was to your door.
I want to get Dr. Sewell out of the medical profession he does not deserve to pray on the sick and the weak by using their faith in God as a weapon against them. He needs to be stopped. I don't believe for one minute that I'm the first one he's done this to nor do I believe that I will be the last.  I also believe that he has actually killed people with his careless medical practices. 
I want to hold Dr. Sewell and everyone in his employ responsible for what happened to me and I want to hold Scott and White Hospital responsible for hiring such a high risk doctor and I use that term lightly when all I had to do was call Hillcrest and I found out why he was fired from their employ so why didn't Scott & White check out his resume or maybe they did and hired him any way. If that's the case they should be held as much responsible as Dr. Sewell.
Something has to be done about Scott & White and all their employees they are a monopoly now and do we all want that kind of treatment to look forward to when we get sick? I don't. I want to know when I go to the doctor he/she is not going to try to kill me but try to help me, the same with the hospital. It's really not that much to ask for, what did they go to college for anyway?

										I went to dr. suspecting a sinus infection. I had to go see someone, since I was unemployed (which I told woman at desk) with no insurance. He spent 15 mins with me doing a typical ""screening"" (coded it something more expensive) and then told me I had a sinus infection! When I went to pay the bill, $197! I told the receptionist I was unemployed and couldn't afford to pay that much...especially with no insurance! It was pay, or get charges filed against me.
I could barely put food on the table, in fact I had to use the church's food bank several times because I am a single mom...so how would I pay for that?? When I asked to work out something, NO WAY. I wrote a check, then when I got home I thought it over and rescinded the check. 
When the OM called me about it (after they got it from their bank), I explained the situation...she said she would talk to Dr. and get back to me. She did...he said NO CHANGE. Then they added a fee to it, so the bill is now $225!
Later they put my bill into collections, without notifying me or anything.

Orlando, Florida U.S.A. ",,,Orlando Regional Medical Center Pathology Department Florida Pathologists Join Ranks of Leading Human Rights Abusers Orlando Florida,"
										The pathologists in the United States have now joined ranks with leading criminal human rights violators in psychiatry to implement the use of pathological education to enslave, torture, and murder medical activists. Dr Shuan Li, the Director of Residency Training in Pathology at Orlando Regional Medical Center in Orlando, Florida and his associate, Dr Baro, who was Residency Director when I successfully did my internship in their department, have brought a rigid Communist styled ideology into the medical education system by intentionally ignoring my credentials and accomplishments because I do not blindly support the tyrannical trend in modern orthodox American medical education of using medicine, law, and psychiatry to brutally destroy the interests of sane social activists. Dr Shuan Li and Dr Cesar Baro have clearly been using their positions in Florida to enforce brutal and life threatening blacklists of well qualified colleagues who do not share their rigid ideology of using the medical sciences to destroy instead of to heal as manifested by their ignoring my desires to return to specialty training when I returned to the United States with my immigrant Vietnamese wife and our two children after years of fighting to survive a brutal blacklist of all of my professional and financial interests by the Communists. The Communists also literally tortured me daily with intense electromagnetic waves blasted into my brains in retaliation for my harsh criticisms of the mental health care practices and policies of the Communists. I was not certain if I was going to survive to get my wife and kids out of the brutality of the Vienamese Communist system only to find the government of the United States had sold me out to the Communists in acts of appeasement and has adopted the same rigid mental health care practices and policies. The ""Fathers of American Pathological Tyranny"", Dr Shuan Li and Dr Cesar Baro, have apparently effectively set the stage for other American pathologists to join this direction in American medical-legal tyranny. It is possible these doctors have also been acting in such repulsive manners in order to protect one of their colleagues from possible professional disciplinary actions. Years ago when I was an intern in their department at which time I performed my required duties very well Dr Cerezo ranted and raved at me like a wild maniac with two weeks left in my internship that perhaps I should walk out the door and not finish my internship for no good reason at all. Dr Cerezo appears to have acted to protect the reputation of his US military physician colleague, Dr Jack Edeiken, the criminally insane radiologist who masterminded ""The Texas Torture Case"" with the criminally insane psychiatrist, Dr Pearlman, in Houston years later. Dr Edeiken had messed up many of my career interests and my mental health with incompetent advice and this coupled with his questionable personal lifestyle habits left many of his colleagues scrambling to cover for him since Dr Edeiken was a Chairman of Radiology at Jefferson Medical College prior to being retired early and accepting a staff position in Houston. Dr Edeiken was not well liked by most of the younger radiologists at Jefferson over the years due to his autocratic manners and they worked aggressively to have his Chairmanship taken away from him. Dr Edeiken was very bitter about this until his death from lung cancer several years ago.

Yuba City, California U.S.A. ",,530-671-4182,"Doctor Peppercorn And/or Advanced Dermatology & Laser Center Of Northern California, Dr Peppercorn could leave you scarred! Yuba City California","
										Years ago, I made an appointment with Dr Peppercorn asking for some antibiotic injections into each side of my nose, where I had been told I had an infection by another doctor.
Instead of seeing the doctor as I had requested, his PA (I believe Linda Nelson) walked into the room, took one look and told me I definitely had cancer in those two areas and they needed to be excised immediately.  She promised that the incisions would be invisible and that no one would know the difference once healed.  After making the excisions, she then stated that if it were cancer, it would not malignant and could have waited - a total reversal of her prior urgency.  They turned out to be exactly just what I had thought they were - an infection in the sweat glands, not cancer.
When the bandages came off, I found myself with two angular scars slanted outward from my nose on each side an obvious deep holes where she had used the wrong type of stitches plus, pulled them too tight.  Upset, I called asking to see Dr Peppercorn himself.  
While waiting for him, I overheard one of his other employees mocking my complaints based upon the sort of job I had.  Stating that since I had a job such as that, what difference did it make what my face looked like, which I found very embarrassing and outrageous really.  I had an interim job after resettling from out of state and not a job I intended to stay in for long.  In fact, since having the incisions made, I had already found another job working in big ticket sales and with the public.
Brushing that aside, I then faced Dr Peppercorn who questioned why I would allow his PA to cut on my face as though it were my fault for allowing her to do so and then, stated that the large holes from the stitches were really just enlarged pores - obviously untrue.  Then, upon my stating that the outward angular incisions had changed the outward appearance of my nose, he agreed, telling me he would do what ever necessary to make me happy.  He offered me dermabrasion, laser and/or surgery.  Suggesting I start out with dermabrasion and work up to surgery if I were still unhappy and whenever convenient for me.
Though uncomfortable with the entire place due to how I had been treated, I attended just a few sessions however working out of town, it was very inconvenient for me and bc the scars were not that bad, I eventually let it go, figuring if that were as bad as it got, I could live with it.
However, as the years went by and my face began to age, I started noticing the scars deepening, the 'pores' widening until now, I actually have people asking me why I have them.  I had 2 different surgical nurses tell me in the last 6 months that the stitches used were obviously of the wrong sort.  
Though it used to not be such an issue with me, with the passage of time and the way the scars have been affected by aging, it has become something I cannot look into the mirror without seeing.
Because Dr Peppercorn bills himself as being exceptionally ethical and top of the line, I never worried that when I was ready, his offer to use laser or, surgery to correct his PA's mistakes would still be valid.  It was just a matter of when and if the mental impact of the scars became unbearable for me, I had thought.
However, having called his office today and informing the receptionist of my problem and who I was/what had happened to cause the scars, I was first told she would have to call me back and then, upon calling back, that Dr Peppercorn's word had expired with the passage of time and he was no longer willing to correct the scars created by his overzealous PA.  
I am very disappointed bc throughout the years, trusting that he would make good on his word when I was ready, I've never made one derogatory remark concerning this situation to anyone, feeling it would be corrected when and if I decided the advantages of ridding myself of the scars outweighed the disadvantages of taking time off for laser treatments or, while wearing bandages on each side of my face for a period of time again.
I, now, want to warn others seeking facial treatments of not only the ineptness of the PAs Dr Peppercorn employs, but also the fact that he isn't good for his word and any type of issue arising should be handled through the normal legal avenues, as he cannot be trusted.

										On the first week of June 2009, I called Dr. Laila Nayab from Tustin, CA for an appointment and asked how much it was for the first visit and Kim told me there was no charge on the first visit.  Then without letting me know Dr. Nayab charged me $160 for the first visit, and an estimate of over $4,000 because I have $5,000 credit line with Care Credit.  I left without getting adjusted because Dr. Nayab wanted $75 per adjustment and $60 for acupuncture.  I told her I did not want any adjustments and left, after I paid her the $160.  I sent Dr. Nayab an email explaining to her why I did not become her patient.  Kim, her receptionist told me to pick up the X-Rays.  I called on June 29 and told them I was going to pick up the X-Rays on that day or the next day by 9 am.  Kim said ok.  I stopped the next day to pick up my X-Rays and Kim told me they did not have them.  Dr. Nayab said she did not know I was going to pick up the X-Rays.  Both Kim and Dr. Nayab lie a great deal.  I then left to my new chiropractor's appointment without the X-Rays.  My new doctor told me I did not have to bother that they would request the X-Rays by a fax, and did.  They were in contact with the new office and agreed to mail the X-Rays.  It has been nearly a month and Dr. Nayab has refused to send the Physical X-Rays she reviewed with me.  I have had several appointments with 2 doctors, without X-Rays.  Today I got a nasty email from them.  I then called them and they accused me of NOT calling an then told me never to call.  I'm an accountant and a 66 year old senior citizen, and have lost a lot of time.
Beware, not all chiropractors are honest nor have the best interest for our health.  It is illegal for Dr. Nayab to refuse my X-Rays.  I have been going for treatment with my new doctor for almost a month; however, Dr. Nayab would care less that I get my deperately needed X-Rays to my new doctors.  The following is a culture issue not a racial issue.  I have dealth with two chiroproctors from Iran and one boss, and both times I have been seriously ripped off and ""burned.""

The local collier county police dept continue to protect this sexual predator.
All anyone has to do is look into his back ground to find he's a women abuser, chronic liar, sexual predator and stalker. However the letters M.D behind his name serve as a shield for this psychopathic behavior.
Never dated this man, never socialized with this man, nothing was done to seduce this man.
This man became obsess with destroying my family.
When I went to work at the willoughs of Naples as a registered nurse.....I was escaping the stress of critical care nursing ...I had no idea I would end sexually assaulted and stalked.... for approximately four months ( LEONARD LADO) a psychiatrist on staff whispered inappropriate sexual word in my ears .. Constantly went out of his way to touch and feel where ever he could ...I was constantly invited to his office...all of this was reported to the administrators ...however nothing was done. 
This mad man showered at my house requesting an all night "".which I ignored  ...he went on talking about his multiple failed marriages and bad relationships ..After about 1hr of listening to his problems.... he left. Soon after I started receiving explicit sexual phone calls ...i.e.  ""My penis is bigger than the average you know"" I might no look like it but am a black man would you like to see"" .....In one phone call I was offered $2,000 per month for sex in return ....the phone calls kept coming ....request for phone sex was a frequent. I have changed my phone number 4-5times a year since 2002 my initial contact with this sex predator ...I even changed job several time and asked him to stop calling , but the calls came more frequent  both in Spanish and English...my self and my children were constantly followed ...and harassed by him or his friends ...
The local police (Tim Smith) said he would have to physically harm me or my family before they could do anything. The EEOC (Latoya Allen) was useless
Incompetent and the waste of my time and intelligence. 
I was able to find work immediately in NY.  With out this man following me and lying to prospective employers.

The ""Fathers of American Pathological Tyranny"", Dr Shuan Li and Dr Cesar Baro, have apparently effectively set the stage for other American pathologists to join this direction in American medical-legal tyranny. It is possible these doctors have also been acting in such repulsive manners in order to protect one of their colleagues from possible professional disciplinary actions. Years ago when I was an intern in their department at which time I performed my required duties very well Dr Cerezo ranted and raved at me like a wild maniac with two weeks left in my internship that perhaps I should walk out the door and not finish my internship for no good reason at all. Dr Cerezo appears to have acted to protect the reputation of his US military physician colleague, Dr Jack Edeiken, the criminally insane radiologist who masterminded ""The Texas Torture Case"" with the criminally insane psychiatrist, Dr Pearlman, in Houston years later. Dr Edeiken had messed up many of my career interests and my mental health with incompetent advice and this coupled with his questionable personal lifestyle habits left many of his colleagues scrambling to cover for him since Dr Edeiken was a Chairman of Radiology at Jefferson Medical College prior to being retired early and accepting a staff position in Houston. Dr Edeiken was not well liked by most of the younger radiologists at Jefferson over the years due to his autocratic manners and they worked aggressively to have his Chairmanship taken away from him. Dr Edeiken was very bitter about this until his death from lung cancer several years ago.

The confirmation e-mail was very convincing as well requesting that I wait 6-8 weeks for my product. Little did I know that 6-8 weeks of waiting bypasses any expiry date for eligability for complaint to get a refund. I paid through Pay Pay and their time frame, I found out later, is 45 days.
Future referance, complain on day 40!!(or sooner) I'm very disapointed as I'm on a fixed income and don't usually order things on-line. I did research on this company before purchasing and could find NO complaints anywhere so I figured this was a great go-ahead.

Yuba City, California U.S.A. ",,530-671-4182,"Doctor Peppercorn And/or Advanced Dermatology & Laser Center Of Northern California, Dr Peppercorn could leave you scarred! Yuba City California","
										Years ago, I made an appointment with Dr Peppercorn asking for some antibiotic injections into each side of my nose, where I had been told I had an infection by another doctor.
Instead of seeing the doctor as I had requested, his PA (I believe Linda Nelson) walked into the room, took one look and told me I definitely had cancer in those two areas and they needed to be excised immediately.  She promised that the incisions would be invisible and that no one would know the difference once healed.  After making the excisions, she then stated that if it were cancer, it would not malignant and could have waited - a total reversal of her prior urgency.  They turned out to be exactly just what I had thought they were - an infection in the sweat glands, not cancer.
When the bandages came off, I found myself with two angular scars slanted outward from my nose on each side an obvious deep holes where she had used the wrong type of stitches plus, pulled them too tight.  Upset, I called asking to see Dr Peppercorn himself.  
While waiting for him, I overheard one of his other employees mocking my complaints based upon the sort of job I had.  Stating that since I had a job such as that, what difference did it make what my face looked like, which I found very embarrassing and outrageous really.  I had an interim job after resettling from out of state and not a job I intended to stay in for long.  In fact, since having the incisions made, I had already found another job working in big ticket sales and with the public.
Brushing that aside, I then faced Dr Peppercorn who questioned why I would allow his PA to cut on my face as though it were my fault for allowing her to do so and then, stated that the large holes from the stitches were really just enlarged pores - obviously untrue.  Then, upon my stating that the outward angular incisions had changed the outward appearance of my nose, he agreed, telling me he would do what ever necessary to make me happy.  He offered me dermabrasion, laser and/or surgery.  Suggesting I start out with dermabrasion and work up to surgery if I were still unhappy and whenever convenient for me.
Though uncomfortable with the entire place due to how I had been treated, I attended just a few sessions however working out of town, it was very inconvenient for me and bc the scars were not that bad, I eventually let it go, figuring if that were as bad as it got, I could live with it.
However, as the years went by and my face began to age, I started noticing the scars deepening, the 'pores' widening until now, I actually have people asking me why I have them.  I had 2 different surgical nurses tell me in the last 6 months that the stitches used were obviously of the wrong sort.  
Though it used to not be such an issue with me, with the passage of time and the way the scars have been affected by aging, it has become something I cannot look into the mirror without seeing.
Because Dr Peppercorn bills himself as being exceptionally ethical and top of the line, I never worried that when I was ready, his offer to use laser or, surgery to correct his PA's mistakes would still be valid.  It was just a matter of when and if the mental impact of the scars became unbearable for me, I had thought.
However, having called his office today and informing the receptionist of my problem and who I was/what had happened to cause the scars, I was first told she would have to call me back and then, upon calling back, that Dr Peppercorn's word had expired with the passage of time and he was no longer willing to correct the scars created by his overzealous PA.  
I am very disappointed bc throughout the years, trusting that he would make good on his word when I was ready, I've never made one derogatory remark concerning this situation to anyone, feeling it would be corrected when and if I decided the advantages of ridding myself of the scars outweighed the disadvantages of taking time off for laser treatments or, while wearing bandages on each side of my face for a period of time again.
I, now, want to warn others seeking facial treatments of not only the ineptness of the PAs Dr Peppercorn employs, but also the fact that he isn't good for his word and any type of issue arising should be handled through the normal legal avenues, as he cannot be trusted.

										On the first week of June 2009, I called Dr. Laila Nayab from Tustin, CA for an appointment and asked how much it was for the first visit and Kim told me there was no charge on the first visit.  Then without letting me know Dr. Nayab charged me $160 for the first visit, and an estimate of over $4,000 because I have $5,000 credit line with Care Credit.  I left without getting adjusted because Dr. Nayab wanted $75 per adjustment and $60 for acupuncture.  I told her I did not want any adjustments and left, after I paid her the $160.  I sent Dr. Nayab an email explaining to her why I did not become her patient.  Kim, her receptionist told me to pick up the X-Rays.  I called on June 29 and told them I was going to pick up the X-Rays on that day or the next day by 9 am.  Kim said ok.  I stopped the next day to pick up my X-Rays and Kim told me they did not have them.  Dr. Nayab said she did not know I was going to pick up the X-Rays.  Both Kim and Dr. Nayab lie a great deal.  I then left to my new chiropractor's appointment without the X-Rays.  My new doctor told me I did not have to bother that they would request the X-Rays by a fax, and did.  They were in contact with the new office and agreed to mail the X-Rays.  It has been nearly a month and Dr. Nayab has refused to send the Physical X-Rays she reviewed with me.  I have had several appointments with 2 doctors, without X-Rays.  Today I got a nasty email from them.  I then called them and they accused me of NOT calling an then told me never to call.  I'm an accountant and a 66 year old senior citizen, and have lost a lot of time.
Beware, not all chiropractors are honest nor have the best interest for our health.  It is illegal for Dr. Nayab to refuse my X-Rays.  I have been going for treatment with my new doctor for almost a month; however, Dr. Nayab would care less that I get my deperately needed X-Rays to my new doctors.  The following is a culture issue not a racial issue.  I have dealth with two chiroproctors from Iran and one boss, and both times I have been seriously ripped off and ""burned.""

He has been calling  prospective employers with lies making it impossible for me and my children to find work in Naples Florida. After moving to New York I was able to find work immediately
The local collier county police dept continue to protect this sexual predator.
All anyone has to do is look into his back ground to find he's a women abuser, chronic liar, sexual predator and stalker. However the letters M.D behind his name serve as a shield for this psychopathic behavior.
Never dated this man, never socialized with this man, nothing was done to seduce this man.
This man became obsess with destroying my family.
When I went to work at the willoughs of Naples as a registered nurse.....I was escaping the stress of critical care nursing ...I had no idea I would end sexually assaulted and stalked.... for approximately four months ( LEONARD LADO) a psychiatrist on staff whispered inappropriate sexual word in my ears .. Constantly went out of his way to touch and feel where ever he could ...I was constantly invited to his office...all of this was reported to the administrators ...however nothing was done. 
This mad man showered at my house requesting an all night "".which I ignored  ...he went on talking about his multiple failed marriages and bad relationships ..After about 1hr of listening to his problems.... he left. Soon after I started receiving explicit sexual phone calls ...i.e.  ""My penis is bigger than the average you know"" I might no look like it but am a black man would you like to see"" .....In one phone call I was offered $2,000 per month for sex in return ....the phone calls kept coming ....request for phone sex was a frequent. I have changed my phone number 4-5times a year since 2002 my initial contact with this sex predator ...I even changed job several time and asked him to stop calling , but the calls came more frequent  both in Spanish and English...my self and my children were constantly followed ...and harassed by him or his friends ...
The local police (Tim Smith) said he would have to physically harm me or my family before they could do anything. The EEOC (Latoya Allen) was useless
Incompetent and the waste of my time and intelligence. 
I was able to find work immediately in NY.  With out this man following me and lying to prospective employers.

										My wife had been a patient of Dr. Andrew A. Konen's for about five years.   She has various ailments.  Degenerative disk disease, Osteoporosis, Arthritis.  These all contribute to my wife's level of pain.  She's recently broken her clavicle and small finger of her left hand.  He has over the past five years precribed more and more pain medications.  Some of which she now needs a doctor's help to get off of.  Some could cause seizures if stopped without help of a physician.
The plan up until a couple of months ago with Dr. Konen had been to do just that.  He was going to formulate a plan to lessen the dosages to help my wife get off some of the more meds.  This is now just a bad memory for us. He has stated all kind of things when I have been there with my wife.  His staff is manned by the most petty, insensitive bunch of ethnic women I have ever had the displeasure to meet.   
This doctor was supposed to take an oath to ""Do no harm"".  Well here's the kicker.  Last month my wife visited him at his office and she was in so much pain she was crying while in his office waiting room while waiting to see him.   This to me seems quite normal if someone is in real pain.   Thats why you go to a doctor.  Logical.
This month my wife went in for her next scheduled checkup and she was greeted by his typical insensitivity.  He came running out of a back office area and immediately started to yell at her in front of the whole office staff and the other folks in the waiting room.  Naturally she began to cry out of fear and uncertainty for what her future had to hold relating to her need for continued treatment and still the need to get weaned off some of the medications that shes taking.  This was totally uncalled for.   What a jerk.  Doctor Konen should have escorted her to a consultation room and had a private conference with my wife about whatever issues he had.   This did NOT happen.  He then informed my wife he would no longer treat her and dismissed her on the spot.  
BEWARE of Dr. Andrew A. Konen.  His office staff is mean, insensitive and ignorant.   Do not seek his help for your medical needs.   He may abuse you like he abused my wife.   SHAME on you Doctor Konen.   Where's your hypocratic oath now??   Or did you forget why you became a Doctor?

										If you're looking for a compassionate mental health care provider, think twice before seeing Dr. JC Van Doren.  
With each appointment to his office, I've sensed he was uninterested, hurried, distracted and NOT listening.  He sits behind his desk and seems to be checking email.  (His chart notes are hand written.)
In over 6 months of care, with little progress acheived, he made absolutely no changes to my treatment plan.  Fortunately I was resourceful enough to find a psychiatrist who is innovative, up on the latest medications for the treatment of chronic depression and LISTENS.  I just regret not having found her sooner.
Dr. Van Doren conveniently does not bill health insurance carriers and requires cash payment, up front.  For this reason, I am inclined to believe his sole motive is for financial gain.  He clearly has no sincere concern and is not a diplomatic patient advocate.

										Dr. Greenwald preformed a cervical fusion on me and failed to tell me that the fusion never worked. He just told me it was fine, so i kept working out. All the while my neck had not fused and after 18 months of incresing pain and agony he again took new pictures and declared my neck was fine and suggested i get a epidural shot in the adjacent vetebrae for the pain. 
The doctor who i saw to get the shot took one look at the pictures and gave me the news that my neck was not fused! After almost two years of agony i then saw three other neuro surgeons all of whom in a matter of a few minutes declared my neck not fused. They were looking at the same pictures, four doctors all saw the problem, the guy who did the work could not. 
i don't know what it takes for a doctor to be considered incompetant but based on my experiance i would say he qualifies. 
in addition, he did not even want to see me after the original surgery and had signed the discharge papers without ever coming to my hospital room to tell me how the surgery went. i guess poor beside manner is no call for being called a rip off, but not admitting an obvious failure sure is. 
had he simply been honest with me i would have avoided 3 plus years of misery, plus the significant damage that was done to my neck while i was working out with a failed fusion. 
i needed two additional spine surgeries to get it fixed and as a result of all the trauma will never be the same. 
i was asked by the surgeon who fixed me to complain to the calif state medical board which i did. they found his post operative care to be poor. what a joke, he knew my neck never fused 120 days after the initial surgery, but didn't want to deal with or take responsibilty for it so he let me suffer!

										I have insurance through Tennessee's Tenncare program. Tenncare assigns a primary care physician for you. I was assinged to a Dr. John Crabtree, of Cookeville, Tennessee. I have stomach problems and frequent migraine headaches. I was out of medication, so I went to his office for the first time. He is in his late 70's which was a red flag for me. I told him of my stomach problem, and that I have a Hiatal Hernia of the stomach. 
He went into an hour long conversation about his mother having the same thing and that all she had to take was Mylanta. I told him I needed to refill my Prevacid. 
Finally after another half an hour of trying to get two simple prescriptions, he prescribes another antacid pill to go along with the Prevacid. I ask him about the migraines and that I had been taking Imitrex, which I also needed a refill for. He said he couldn't prescribe it for me. I asked why. He said that he needed the medical record from my previous doctor before he could prescribe it. he also stated that it was my job to get my medical records and not his office's job.
He was supposed to make a referral for me to go to a neurologist for the migraines. My insurance requires a referral to see a specalist, which usually takes two weeks. His office never made the referral.
Two months later, I go back to his office for the 2nd and last visit. I had a swollen finger, and had no idea why it was swollen. Dr. Crabtree looked at the finger and said it was infected and that he had to cut it open. he did not wash his hands, nor did he sterilize the area where he was about to cut. He used a numbing agent and he was extremely rough with the needle, moving the needle around and around. 
Then he made the cut, about a half of an inch long, in the cuticle area. As he made the cut, he was about 1 foot from my face and I smelled a strong odor of alcohol on his breath. He then sent me home with a piece of gauze and two prescriptions. I asked the receptionist why the referral wasn't done and she stated that the woman was on vacation that did the referrals.
At six o'clock that evening the finger swelled up three times it's normal size. I went to the emergency room, where I was admitted immediately, and placed on IV antibiotics for two whole days. The finger turned black and blue where Dr. Crabtree was so rough with the needle. That skin had to be removed by a plastic surgeon, who told me that I had an infection of the bone. Why didn't Dr. Crabtree make me go to the ER? Why did he cut me when there was no visible infection, just swelling????
I reported him to my insurance company's investigations department. I did a little snooping and found that he is no longer able to perform surgeries, he is not licensed at the local hospital, but licensed at a hospital in Celina, Tennessee.
Why wouldn't a local doctor not be able to practice at the local hospital in town where his practice is??????
BEWARE of this doctor so this doesn't happen to you! Dr.Crabtree is drunk and unsanitary and made a bad call in my case, it is rumored that he is one of the worst doctors in town. I truly know that from experience.

										Beware for people moving to Phoenix, or living in Phoenix searching for family doctors. Went in with a simple cold. Waited for almost 3h, treated by no DO or MD, horrible service provided - as if the physician didn't care at all. But that's not all... Since I wasn't sure if my insurance would cover the visit, I was informed that the visit would be around $65. Received a bill for $400. So overall, if you don't have 5h to spend while being sick at the office, don't go. if you mind bad service and out of the blue billing (that states that you were treated by a DO) - don't go.

										I have had an MRI done april 10th 2006 with Dr. Norman Baade. He unlawfully kept vital information from me and in turn refused to give me the treatment needed.
I know suffer chronic pain, 4 protrusions in my spine and a Hemangioma benign tumor in my L4 region.
I recently called to get my Full MRI report.
I had on December 20th 2006 gotten another MRI done with Dr. Maninder Pabla of Northwest Health Services.
And was turned away as if i needed nothing to help take away the pain or needed anything looked into.
I constantly have a horrible pinch in between my shoulder blades where they reported in the first MRI to have found the 4 protrusions, the second MRI reported nothing of that yet i still have the pain as was before.
This is a clear sign to me that these 2 doctors who work for Heartland Medical Center in Saint Joseph Missouri do not do their jobs as informed in medical school, and wrongfully dismiss patients because they are angry about why they have to suffer in pain and wonder whats wrong.
When I got the MRI report, i found a report that i was not ever given.This is the one that they were hiding from me.
Knowing that i can sue them for malpractice they both covered it all up by just ignoring my problems and not letting me get any more extensive testing that is needed.
I know have to have spinal surgery to place pins in my spine because they let it continue for so long.
I am an angry mother of 4 trying to fight my way threw cleaning and taking care of my little ones who are still all under the age of 10. If there is anyone else who has had a problem with this hospital please do not hesitate to file a report against them.

They were observed being unprofessional in the medical work place; shouting, screaming (where patients could hear them).
Known to have thrown out medical supplies into the trash (worth thousands of dollars), one coworker saw this happen twice. Carolyn was always throwing out supplies. Misplacing/ diagarding  or non crediting account money. 
TAKING MONEY FOR HERSELF. Working while heavily medicated.
Carolyn Patterson was seen coming to work with black eyes, broken foot and other injuries, and gave unprofessional care to the patients. She was also seen giving injections to cancer patients and doing blood work. 2006 NOT CERTAIN SHE WAS QUALIFIED ENOUGH TO DO THIS? nor given permission.
Several people have been known to have placed complaints in the lobby's suggestion box of this doctor's office.  Carolyn tore them up before the doctor could read them. He was unaware of her tactics. many nurses came and went because of her yelling and trying to be an offfice manager. She was overheard as saying, she borrowed office money to buy a computer from a guy that was giving her a great deal on that day for a home computer!
Both these girls were manipulative and treated families with rude remarks, some left in tears, THE DOCTOR WAS UNAWARE OF WHAT THESE TWO SISTERS WERE UP TO IN THE OFFICE IN THE LOBBY.
One family was not credited money to their account for their payments.
One incident in 2006; which was totally uncalled for.. a correctional female officer brought in a young man for treatment to his leg area. Carolyn treated the lady officer with disrespect and they got into a yelling match. Carolyn threatened her to a fight. Doctor was in with patients in back rooms and didn't hear them arguing. Lady told her, she was making a phone call to report her actions!

										On the 14/02/2007 my wife and I visited your clinic to obtain Botox prior to departing on a cruise on the 17th allowing three days, as my wife has had Botox regularly over many years and has never had any marks from this treatment.
You then recommended that Thermage and Restylene with Botox would achieve the best results and I specifically asked you ""would the procedures leave any marks as we were going on a cruise in three days"".
You replied that there would only be needle stick marks that would be covered easily by make up.
We also asked if you would be doing the procedures and you stated you would.
Both myself and my wife had to ensure that your receptionist understood this and she again confirmed you would be performing the procedures.Then when my wife was to start the thermage a nurse went to start the procedure and my wife again stated that the Dr was to perform the procedure and she went away for ten to fifteen minutes and then came back stating you were delayed and she would start when in fact she completed the procedure bar for ten minutes of your time.
I paid for two hours of Thermage and my wife only was given an hour and a half, of which you only performed ten minutes.In Doing the Thermage you have pushed so hard on my wife's cheek that you have left the cheek split and bruised and permanently marked.The Thermage has not given any result and you stated it would give an instant lift.
With your Botox injections you have left large bruises at each injection site and now after ten days these have spread and are impossible to cover by any method.I have never seen so many needle marks both on the side of the face or under the eyes in any previous treatments.And to add insult to injury the botox has not worked at all when on all prior occasions it has worked within 5 days and has never left any marks.My wife states that she thought the procedure was unprofessional as the injections were given from one side with you reaching across to inject the other side.
The same applies to the Restylene again bruises that are uncoverable.
You have totally ruined our cruise as my wife has been unable to leave the cabin due to the marks and the condition of her face.
I have taken photos from day One and the results of your work are patently obvious, it is an unmitigated disaster.
I would draw to your attention to the fact that my wife has always had a flawless complexion all her life and I have annexed a photo taken in January to prove this point and her own Dr will attest to  this, this experience has left her devastated and depressed.As my wife is not well this has compounded her problems.
I have spent over $20,000.00 on this holiday and it is now totally wasted as we have not been able to venture out due to the condition of my wife's face.
I paid you the sum of $7790.00 on my Platinum Card and I have advised them to reverse the payment as I am disputing the charge due to the results as are evidenced in the attached photos.
I have phoned a major Cosmetic Center in Los Angeles to ascertain  the price of Thermage and have been amazed to find I am quoted $2500.00 for the neck and face not $6500 as you quoted.
I have been unable to contact you throughout the cruise and have not been able to use my laptop to email you and I will be ringing you on Monday prior to flying out to Australia to further discuss the matter.

										If you're looking for a compassionate mental health care provider, think twice before seeing Dr. JC Van Doren.  
With each appointment to his office, I've sensed he was uninterested, hurried, distracted and NOT listening.  He sits behind his desk and seems to be checking email.  (His chart notes are hand written.)
In over 6 months of care, with little progress acheived, he made absolutely no changes to my treatment plan.  Fortunately I was resourceful enough to find a psychiatrist who is innovative, up on the latest medications for the treatment of chronic depression and LISTENS.  I just regret not having found her sooner.
Dr. Van Doren conveniently does not bill health insurance carriers and requires cash payment, up front.  For this reason, I am inclined to believe his sole motive is for financial gain.  He clearly has no sincere concern and is not a diplomatic patient advocate.

										Beware for people moving to Phoenix, or living in Phoenix searching for family doctors. Went in with a simple cold. Waited for almost 3h, treated by no DO or MD, horrible service provided - as if the physician didn't care at all. But that's not all... Since I wasn't sure if my insurance would cover the visit, I was informed that the visit would be around $65. Received a bill for $400. So overall, if you don't have 5h to spend while being sick at the office, don't go. if you mind bad service and out of the blue billing (that states that you were treated by a DO) - don't go.

										I have had an MRI done april 10th 2006 with Dr. Norman Baade. He unlawfully kept vital information from me and in turn refused to give me the treatment needed.
I know suffer chronic pain, 4 protrusions in my spine and a Hemangioma benign tumor in my L4 region.
I recently called to get my Full MRI report.
I had on December 20th 2006 gotten another MRI done with Dr. Maninder Pabla of Northwest Health Services.
And was turned away as if i needed nothing to help take away the pain or needed anything looked into.
I constantly have a horrible pinch in between my shoulder blades where they reported in the first MRI to have found the 4 protrusions, the second MRI reported nothing of that yet i still have the pain as was before.
This is a clear sign to me that these 2 doctors who work for Heartland Medical Center in Saint Joseph Missouri do not do their jobs as informed in medical school, and wrongfully dismiss patients because they are angry about why they have to suffer in pain and wonder whats wrong.
When I got the MRI report, i found a report that i was not ever given.This is the one that they were hiding from me.
Knowing that i can sue them for malpractice they both covered it all up by just ignoring my problems and not letting me get any more extensive testing that is needed.
I know have to have spinal surgery to place pins in my spine because they let it continue for so long.
I am an angry mother of 4 trying to fight my way threw cleaning and taking care of my little ones who are still all under the age of 10. If there is anyone else who has had a problem with this hospital please do not hesitate to file a report against them.

They were observed being unprofessional in the medical work place; shouting, screaming (where patients could hear them).
Known to have thrown out medical supplies into the trash (worth thousands of dollars), one coworker saw this happen twice. Carolyn was always throwing out supplies. Misplacing/ diagarding  or non crediting account money. 
TAKING MONEY FOR HERSELF. Working while heavily medicated.
Carolyn Patterson was seen coming to work with black eyes, broken foot and other injuries, and gave unprofessional care to the patients. She was also seen giving injections to cancer patients and doing blood work. 2006 NOT CERTAIN SHE WAS QUALIFIED ENOUGH TO DO THIS? nor given permission.
Several people have been known to have placed complaints in the lobby's suggestion box of this doctor's office.  Carolyn tore them up before the doctor could read them. He was unaware of her tactics. many nurses came and went because of her yelling and trying to be an offfice manager. She was overheard as saying, she borrowed office money to buy a computer from a guy that was giving her a great deal on that day for a home computer!
Both these girls were manipulative and treated families with rude remarks, some left in tears, THE DOCTOR WAS UNAWARE OF WHAT THESE TWO SISTERS WERE UP TO IN THE OFFICE IN THE LOBBY.
One family was not credited money to their account for their payments.
One incident in 2006; which was totally uncalled for.. a correctional female officer brought in a young man for treatment to his leg area. Carolyn treated the lady officer with disrespect and they got into a yelling match. Carolyn threatened her to a fight. Doctor was in with patients in back rooms and didn't hear them arguing. Lady told her, she was making a phone call to report her actions!

										On the 14/02/2007 my wife and I visited your clinic to obtain Botox prior to departing on a cruise on the 17th allowing three days, as my wife has had Botox regularly over many years and has never had any marks from this treatment.
You then recommended that Thermage and Restylene with Botox would achieve the best results and I specifically asked you ""would the procedures leave any marks as we were going on a cruise in three days"".
You replied that there would only be needle stick marks that would be covered easily by make up.
We also asked if you would be doing the procedures and you stated you would.
Both myself and my wife had to ensure that your receptionist understood this and she again confirmed you would be performing the procedures.Then when my wife was to start the thermage a nurse went to start the procedure and my wife again stated that the Dr was to perform the procedure and she went away for ten to fifteen minutes and then came back stating you were delayed and she would start when in fact she completed the procedure bar for ten minutes of your time.
I paid for two hours of Thermage and my wife only was given an hour and a half, of which you only performed ten minutes.In Doing the Thermage you have pushed so hard on my wife's cheek that you have left the cheek split and bruised and permanently marked.The Thermage has not given any result and you stated it would give an instant lift.
With your Botox injections you have left large bruises at each injection site and now after ten days these have spread and are impossible to cover by any method.I have never seen so many needle marks both on the side of the face or under the eyes in any previous treatments.And to add insult to injury the botox has not worked at all when on all prior occasions it has worked within 5 days and has never left any marks.My wife states that she thought the procedure was unprofessional as the injections were given from one side with you reaching across to inject the other side.
The same applies to the Restylene again bruises that are uncoverable.
You have totally ruined our cruise as my wife has been unable to leave the cabin due to the marks and the condition of her face.
I have taken photos from day One and the results of your work are patently obvious, it is an unmitigated disaster.
I would draw to your attention to the fact that my wife has always had a flawless complexion all her life and I have annexed a photo taken in January to prove this point and her own Dr will attest to  this, this experience has left her devastated and depressed.As my wife is not well this has compounded her problems.
I have spent over $20,000.00 on this holiday and it is now totally wasted as we have not been able to venture out due to the condition of my wife's face.
I paid you the sum of $7790.00 on my Platinum Card and I have advised them to reverse the payment as I am disputing the charge due to the results as are evidenced in the attached photos.
I have phoned a major Cosmetic Center in Los Angeles to ascertain  the price of Thermage and have been amazed to find I am quoted $2500.00 for the neck and face not $6500 as you quoted.
I have been unable to contact you throughout the cruise and have not been able to use my laptop to email you and I will be ringing you on Monday prior to flying out to Australia to further discuss the matter.

Dallas, Texas U.S.A. ",,214-631-7546,Dr. Allison F. Singer Dr. Singer nearly killed my child Dallas Texas,"
										I took my autistic daughter in to see Dr. Singer last year for severe acne. My daughter was prescribed and anti-biotic, Duac, and Retin A. 
   My daughter after being on the medicne a few days practically refused to take her anti-biotic. Because she is autistic she cannot swallow pills, so the anti-biotic was crushed up and given to her in pudding. My daughter began throwing up about a week after being on the anti-biotic. 
   I called Dr. Singer's office and made a second appointment to bring her in, and told Dr. Singer that she was throwing up and it was almost impossible to give her the medication. She practically ignored what I told her and told me to keep giving her the medication.
 After much cajoling she would take her medicine everyday, and would throw up shortly aftwards.
   I called Dr. Singer's office, and politely told her nurse what was happening and that I really believed that the anti-biotic was causing her problems.
   The nurse became very defensive, and kept repeating in a hateful tone ""I just don't understand"". I don't know what there was to not understand. I don't know why a nurse and not the doctor was making this decision. The drug was making her sick. Finally the nurse, not the doctor decided to put her on a weaker form of the anti-biotic, my daughter continued to throw up, becoming very sick aftward.
   I called once again, and I was heartbroken, because my daughter has severe acne, extremely severe, and I was in a dilemna. I knew the medicine was making her sick, and yet if I didn't give it to her, she would remain horribly disfigured. I made an appointment to see Dr. Singer herself.
   Dr. Singer was very snobbish towards me, as other times. She prescribed a newer anti-biotic of the same class, and gave me a ton of samples - no record of prescription. She implied that she really hoped that Valarie could continue the program, but said it in such a way as she looked back at me, to insinuate that if my daughter continued to be a problem patient, she could no longer come to her office.
   I gave my daughter this newer anti-biotic, and she kept throwing up. Half her face then became paralyzed. She was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with Bel Palsy. She continued to see the new neurologist, and the nurse from his office called and said that the new anti-biotic could cause Bel Palsy, and that she was appalled that Dr. Singer didn't tell me so. 
   At the hospital we took her off the anti-biotic and no longer give it to her at all. Her face has returned to normal. Her face will probably never heal, but I have no other solution at the present time. My daughter is now officially a problem patient, and I and her have been blacklisted.
   My observations are that Dr. Singer felt threatened for some strange reason, that a patient would dare in a polite way, tell her that a prescription was causing extreme ill side effects. I have no idea why. I know that my daughter could have died because she refused to listen to a patient.
   Texas is one of the few states where it is almost impossible to sue a medical practicioner. It is the state where Dr. Jones, a radiologist from Mesquite, started the very first blacklist webside doctorsknow.us. 
It is the first state to where patients were denied healthcare priviledges for sueing a doctor. Doctors in this state are joining ""anti-sue"" clubs by the thousands, and if you are blacklisted in their club, you no longer get decent healthcare. 
  God help us all. If you are not rich, affluent, and have great insurance, you will not receive healthcare in this state.

I made a deposit of $500 for surgery scheduled the following Tues, paying for the deposit with my CitiBank credit card (CitiCard).
Over the weekend I thought hard about risks of surgery and permanent metal plates, changed my mind, and decided to seek a second opinion.  I canceled the surgery, sending both e-mail and leaving phone messages with Dr. Schacherer's office.
On Monday I obtained a second opinion from another Doctor who noted from the same x-rays the fracture had not displaced (bones were aligned) and advised against surgery, suggesting a soft, removable cast and careful treatment.  I confirmed my surgery cancellation with Dr. Schacherer's office the same day.
Since then, I have not been able to get my $500 deposit returned.  Humana (insurance company) denied Dr. Schacherer's claim for the deposit, ruling it a ""service not rendered"".  CitiCard tried to obtain a credit for the $500 charge on my behalf, but Dr. Schacherer's office refuses to honor their request.
Even though Texas Orthopaedic Associates and Dr. Timothy Schacherer may appear reputable, occupying offices in the same complex as Presbyterian Hospital, they are not.  Do not be fooled.  Go there at your own risk -- and if you do, then do not give them *any* deposits for any reason.

										I went to see Dr Hymes based upon the advice of an acquaintance whose friend held him in regard. Having been in an auto-pedestrian accident (I was the pedestrian), I had many injuries for which I was in constant pain. After reviewing the patient intake forms, the first thing out of his mouth to me: ""where doesn't it hurt?"" From the submitted medical records, Dr Hymes knew that my cns -amongst other injured areas- was injured, ergo pain over most of my body. It was a cheap shot; his introduction no hello, no I am sorry for all your discomfort, just plain rude and insulting.
Dr Hymes is more interested in generating revenue than providing care or finding a medical solution to health problems. In the first visit I inform him that I am undergoing surgical procedures with a doctor whom I am satisfied with services and have had some success in improving my health. Dr Hymes does not care, he wants the business and revenue and asks me to let him provide the future treatments. I went to Dr Hymes for pain management because I am in constant pain, not for other services.
Desperate, I foolishly give him the benefit of I don't know what doubt I had left, I return to Dr Hymes for a follow up visit for which he recommends significant increase in a drug prescribed by another physician. I follow his advice; the drug side effects at the new level are unbearable and it does not provide sufficient relief. 
Fair enough, some doctors need to guinea pig their patients. In a follow up visit, his advice to come off the drug is to scale down in 24 hours. I follow his advice and go into withdrawals and end up in the emergency room. After looking the drug's manufacturer up online, I find out that I should have tapered off over 7 days.
Dr Hymes incompetence does not stop there. In the same visit that he advised me to stop taking the first drug, he prescribes a new drug. But doing my homework before taking it, I find out it is counter-indicated for my condition. In fact it would make the very thing I (supposedly we) am trying to minimize worse!
Needless to say, I stopped seeing Dr Hymes. He never did help me. He only made my condition significantly worse.  Dr Hymes neither presents nor practices the Hippocratic Oath. He is a dangerous physician.

These below were sent to me as questions to ask Bunny to find out if  her education was a fraud?
She claim the PHD was from  ""Huntington Pacific University"". The website:
http://www.hpu-edu.com/generalinfo.htm
--Credit acquisition. A wise man once said, Nothing worthwhile comes easy, and the same holds true for college credits. Programs that offer life experience credits for simple everyday tasks should be examined carefully. Generally, accredited programs will demand careful documentation that demonstrates a correlation between life experience and college-level coursework.
Huntington Pacific University"".- Offers life experience and seems to have an easy way and also offers an easy payments. whch with some progarms allows you to become a member automaticly on the boards, Bunny is currently a member
-Scheduling. Although there are many fully accredited programs that offer schedules conducive to the working adult student, degrees that don't require some classroom time or instructor interaction should raise a red flag.
Huntington Pacific University"".-  does not require classroom time at HPU  or  a lot of instructor interaction .
-Association with other students is an important part of the learning process. If you ask people who've been to  USC  about the most valuable part of the experience, they'll probably tell you that much of the education comes from the open exchange of experience and ideas after the class has ended.
Huntington Pacific University"".-  does not require classroom time at HPU  or  a lot of instructor interaction , you do not get to know many students , so the association with other students is not an important part of the learning process.
-The overall length of the program is another area of concern. Degrees that can be earned in a short time should be pursued with caution, as it's difficult to master complex disciplines in mere months. There's a reason why most bachelor's degrees are earned through four-year programs.
-Huntington Pacific University"".-State's ""....students are therefore able to complete their programs within self-generated time frames. This unique concept allows the student as much time as he or she may need to complete the program of study. We do, however, urge the student to complete his or her degree program within three years...""
http://www.hpu-edu.com/generalinfo.htm
 -Location. Administrative offices that use P.O. Box addresses or suite number can be a sign to use caution, especially if they're accompanied by uncaptioned brochure pictures of beautifully landscaped campuses and Gothic-style buildings. Under investigation, some institutions have been revealed to use pictures of buildings in other states that have no relation to the college in question.

-Accreditation. Accreditation means that an institution has met certain standards that are recognized by the public as having worth. However, organizations that boast impressive-sounding accreditation names aren't necessarily meeting any standard of service. If there's any question as to whether the institition is legitimate, then the accrediting agency should be verified with the U.S. Department of Education or the Council on Higher Education Accreditation.
... HPU has chosen not to pursue accreditation from regional and/or programmatic agencies associated with the U.S. Department of Education... http://www.hpu-edu.com/generalinfo.htm

The Doctor charges $2,500.00 for writing out the prescriptions that go to the company that is making the hormone replacement.
Then I started calling around and found out that she was also overcharging me for the product. I asked a friend of mine in Beverly Hills how much her doctor was charging her and found out that even the best doctor's in the United States do not charge this much.
In the first month, I contacted Dr. Peters and told her I did not appreciate being overcharged and requested my money back that I had pre-paid. She kept about $700.00 of the $2,500.00, in addition to all of the office visits and products I overpaid for.
DO NOT GIVE THIS CLINIC YOUR MONEY. There are many doctors that will write you a prescription as part of the office visit and not charge you extra for it or the products.  Once you have the prescription you can go online and purchase the products for 1/2 to 1/4 of what she wants to charge you.

He said he wanted to make them a little smaller by removing some of my skin to fit a smaller implant.  He said he was going to remove my nipples and center them so they would be even and make sure that each
 breast was the same size and that he would make sure I kept the cleavage that I came to him with. He agreed to keep them high profile.  I had neither sagging nor a fold when I went to him.  See insert (photos).  He said I would come out of surgery with no sagging.  I would have my cleavage and high profile.  That they would be beautiful.   We both agreed that he would replace my implants and leave me high profile with no sagging and my nipples and breast size would be even.  Everything we agreed on he didnt do.  When I came out of surgery   I was sagging like a dog with 12 puppies.  I had no cleavage.  My breast was uneven.  One hanging a lot lower then the other one.  Larry Crooker  & I were and still are very upset.  I cried and still am crying. (On top of it all he replace my saline implants with silicone.  *
COMMENT:
Which scares me to have silicone inside of me. {(NOTE I use the silicon implant that was remove from my left side to stuff my bra and went to the beach.  When I awaken after falling asleep the silicon implant had melted.  My skin and clothes was filled with melted silicone.  I am afraid if the silicone implant inside of my right breast has melted inside me or not.  I don't have the money to have it remove at the moment.)}
*We asked him what happen.  Why was I sagging?  Why was I un even?  Where was my cleavage?  Why didnt
He removes the skin he said he would remove if he were to place a smaller implant in then what I had.
He said my implants look good to him.   See inserts. 
He was high on something.  He said they look more nature the way
 he fixes them.  He said he put a fold in them to make them sag. Larry and I said we told you we wanted no sagging.  (I hadn't any sagging when I first went to him)
We wanted them up like they were before he did the surgery.  He said to give them a few weeks and they would look ok. 
 Nov 9, 2007
When I called him a few weeks later and went back for my 7 day follow up he said 
that he made them look like they look because it was more nature.  Larry, Dr Jacob and I argue about how he screwed up my surgery.  I asked him how did he make such a mess out of my breast. He just said he place a fold in them and now they look nature. Like real breast and he liked them.  I told him I didnt care about what he like it was about what Larry and I wanted and paid for.
I didn't know what a fold was.  He pulled up his shirt and showed me his chest. He said see my breast this is what I did to yours.  I cried. His eyes were very glossy and he spoke weird. He said he would redo them but I had to wait.  I was afraid to go back to him. 
 I flew back to Florida.  I was to return to him for another follow up.  When I return home I had problems. 
On Nov 13,2006 Dr Jacob office. referred me to doctor here in Boca Raton.  Dr. Pozner.   Dr Pozner brought in a specialist. Dr Wagner for consul.  561 391 9631.  They had to perform a closure on my right breast. 
I have been seeing the Florida Doctors every week.  Two to 3 times a week since Nov 13,2006 because of the extreme conduction deformacy Dr. Jacob cause 
With the surgery he performed on me Nov 2, 2006. (SEE INSERT)
12/2/06  Dr Pozner had to perform a closure on my left breast. (SEE INSERT)
The doctor had to re stitch me up.  A week later he had to remove some of the skin that was damage.   It hadn't been a full month when this happen.  Only a few weeks.  (SEE INSERTS)
In Jan 2, 2007 I return to Dr. Jacobs for my follow up and to be release so, Dr Pozner.  & Wagner could take over my care.  I also went to see him on the above date to ask him to pay for future surgeries I needed to correct the problems he cause.  Which they say their will be some permanent damage.
Jan 2, 2007  Dr Jacob removes a capsule covering my implant, which Dr. Pozner & Dr Wagner said he shouldn't have touch it.  
I ask Dr. Jacobs not to remove it.  He did anyway.  After removing it he squeeze it hard. It re opens the womb. .  (stitch area) (See insert) 
Dr. Wagner & Dr Pozner told me not to see Dr Jacob ever again because he was making a mess of things.
 (Each time I have seen him he seen to be agitated.  I didn't get to see him before my surgery of Nov 2, 2006.  Only, after the surgery. He seen agitated and complains about having to spending 2 hours in surgery with me.
JAN 15, 2007 I had to have another medically necessary surgery Dr. Pozner and Dr Wagner had to remove my left implant leaving me deform.  (SEE INSERTS)
My skin has retracted and I have to have Ultra-sound twice a week until I can be re-implanted. (SEE INSERTS Dr notes) 
I have been having it and still am for months now and have to have it until I can have my surgery.
My breast (skin) had retracted so badly, it harden.  The ultra sound is loosening the skin in my breast area.  
So it will expand when they put an expander in it.  Before the surgery all I needed were implants exchange.  Now, I have to have expanders and go thru a series of being fill until my breast look like a round breast again.
I was schedule for post opp June 25, 2007 and surgery July 5, 2007.  Which I won't be able to have because I have ran out of money.  I have to walk around in pain looking like a freak with one missing left breast and a extremely sagging ripple right breast that a bra can't lift up the way I am use to looking and being torture not being able to work.  Larry (my boyfriend) left me because he couldn't deal with the way my breast look or had any more money to put into surgery to get me fix. (All because of what Dr.Brad Jacobs did to me I am penniless and alone and don't know what to do.
Is there a fund to help someone like me to get my breast fix??

Lucido Jeffrey,"  Lucido Jeffrey  441-77 Street 
Brooklyn, New York U.S.A. ",,,Lucido Jeffrey Fraudulently Practice. Brooklyn New York,"
										I have to inform you about those facts, that the doctor Jeffrey Lucido whose office is located at: 441-77 Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11209 was very abusive and intimidated me and my family, while we were his patients. After our visit above mentioned doctor, had completely ignored our requests and questions regarding executing services and treatments that were not authorized by us as patients and a consumers. We have tried to cancel these services, by contacting his office many a time.
Under meaning services I have brought up one of the facts, that under false pretences, doctor Lucido had forced us to purchase an expensive insoles for shoes, no matter were we needed them or not, then doctor Lucido has told us, that those kind of insoles: It's all that you need from pain, and they will do a miracle for us, even if we have had a different diagnoses while we came to his office with a different type of pain for each.
As patient and a consumer I have tried to cancel this imposed by a deceit treatment, because later, I have had a second opinion about ineffectiveness of those expensive insoles from the different doctor. But doctors Lucido office personal, including him, has assured me that his service was done thru the internet and can't be canceled and even if my insurance paid already for everything full amount, I am obligated to pay for it also. 
The doctor Lucido has also neglected me as a patient, when I tried to contact his office when being in pain, after his treatment. Also I am complaining about a doctor's attitude, and I have very deep doubts in his honesty, because, as I have mentioned before, he has already received a payments from my insurance company for the services, products and procedures that we have never obtained. 
Even after my insurance company paid him full amount requested, he has sent a different bill with my wife's name and my name on it to my house for the second payment, but different amount of money, with demanding of immediate payment. (Copy of the bill from my insurance company and a print out of two different bills from that doctor that we have received already in, I can provide upon your request).
As well as all that was mentioned above, I am intensely doubt in proficiency and proper communication skills abilities of the doctor and his office personnel. For example; I have never got the medicine that he has prescribed to me. Instead of it a different prescription has been given to my wife with other patient name and age shown on it, which she will never use, because she values her life very much.
In addition to it, nobody from doctor Lucido's office has informed us about status of the laboratory test of the tissues simples, which has been taken previously during the visit. But we have already received a bill from his office with demanding of immediate payment for it.
Besides, I will not stand the infamous lie and extremely rude behavior that I and my family have faced in this office, while attempting to contact doctor Lucido's office many times, to find a status of a cancellation of service and procedures. 
Committing medical misconduct and practicing fraudulently, can probably be a normal for him, and his personnel, but absolutely unacceptable for me and my family.
I got nothing but nervousness, frustration and emotional sufferings, from those visits. And continue to live with a deep pain in my feet, and questions about greediness and professional honesty of doctor Lucido.
I hope that will be enough information to do appropriate investigation about this doctor malpractice. I am working hard and paying my tax accurately not for being robbed by that doctor.

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES
Resolution:  110
(A-07)
Introduced by: California Delegation 
Subject: Elimination of Medicare Private Fee-For-Service Plans 
Referred to: Reference Committee A
(Virginia E. Hall, MD, Chair) 
Whereas, Medicare Private Fee-For-Service health plans (PFFS)--one type of Medicare Advantage Plan established by Congress under the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003--are authorized under federal law to unfairly deem any physician participating in the Medicare program to be contracted with such plans if the physician treats a PFFS-enrolled patient, even though the physician has not signed a contract with the PFFS plan; and 
Whereas, PFFS plans may pay physicians for medical services at Medicare allowable rates, but they must adhere to the PFFS plans other terms and conditions which are subject to change at any time and may include utilization review rules and other requirements, and do not conform with Medicare payment rules; and 
Whereas, Federal law stipulates that PFFS plans do not have to demonstrate that they have an 'adequate' network of physicians because they have the authority to 'deem' that a physician is bound by the plan's contract terms, and as a result these plans have no incentive to negotiate fair contract terms with physicians to ensure that patients have adequate access to medical services; and Whereas, The federal government pays PFFS plans an average of 119% of the amount Medicare pays per patient for the standard Medicare fee-for-service program, creating a substantial financial incentive for private insurers to market PFFS plans which has spurred a 270% growth rate and represents nearly half of the growth in enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans over the past two years; and Whereas, Medicare Advantage plans are paying 4 to 5 times higher commissions to brokers to market PFFS and there have been well-documented marketing abuses against seniors which include illegal door-to-door soliciting, misleading promises that patients can continue to be treated by their existing physician, and failure to disclose that the plans often have higher co-payments and fewer benefits than what is available in other Medicare Advantage plans or under standard Medicare coverage if they are also covered by the Medicaid program; and Whereas, Higher payments from Medicare, elimination of an incentive to negotiate competitive contract terms with physicians due to the deeming authority given to PFFS plans, and the ability to claim that patients have access to virtually any physician participating in the Medicare program has made PFFS plans an unwarranted profit-center for the insurance industry at the expense of patients and physicians; therefore be it RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association take appropriate action to support the elimination of the Private Fee For Service Plans (PFFS) in the Medicare Advantage Program.  (Directive to Take Action) 
Received: 05/09/07
Fiscal Note: Implement accordingly at estimated staff cost of $4,580.

NEWBURGH, Indiana U.S.A. ",,812-483-4616,MY CHOICE MEDICAL -DR. GEORGE VALENTINI MY CHOICE MEDICAL (DOCTORS SAY YES) AND PLASTIC SURGEON COMPANY ARE OPERATING A SCAM! Ripoff NEWBURGH Indiana,"
										Well it all started in May of 2007. I went for my consultation for breast augmentation surgery.  I thought that it was going to be the most exciting time in my life, but it was just the beginning of a huge nightmare.  I was seen by Dr. George Valentini, which I was told by My Choice Medical that he is a great doctor.  I was not only scamed by My Choice Medical (doctor say yes), but I was also injured by Dr. George Valentini. Dr. George Valentini did his consultation, and we didn't even discuss prices. He told me what he thought was best for me. I left it up to him. After he left a girl named Angel from My Choice Medical came in. Let me remind you I have already put down $500, and then I was going to put another $1,000 more when she said ""oh I am so sorry I made a mistake I figured out the the wrong price it is going to required another $1,000 for you to be able to have the surgery"".  I didn't know what to think. My heart sunk to the ground. Well I was very stupid I went along with it out of the goodness of my heart, and said ""that is ok mistakes do happen"".  One thing I hate is being played like a fool, and I was played like a fool. I then wrote the check out, and book my surgery.  
After a few weeks went by I decieded to get my money back, and pay for the consultation. I contact Dr. George Valentini office, and they said I couldn't get my money back.  I took a look at my finance paper, and It says in the contract that I would lose all my down payment money if I cancel the surgery.  Well let me tell you this. I wish I would have cancelled, and not worried about the money, because I wouldn't have never been in a situation like I am today, if I wouldn't worry about the deposit money of $2,300.
On June 18, 2007 I went under surgery. 1 1/2 weeks  later I started in with pain. I called the doctor and they take your pain medication, and just go to bed, and so I did. I recently seen Dr. George Valentini, and stress my concerns. My breast have fallen, and I feel something isn't right is this normal? He told me that the breast implants are now settling, and they look natural.  He took  his camera, and took pictures he didn't even examine me. I drove 2 hours away for that, and not to mention very rude. I tried to smile and joke, but deep down inside I wanted to cry. Well 5 days later the pain started coming in. It hurt so bad I could cry. I called the doctor, and the nurse Susan was yelling at me. She said ""you have a very low tolence of pain.  I am going to add to this I had 29 surgerys by the best doctor I think I am a very strong person to be able to go through that. Well I told Susan that I was going to see my family doctor, and I did. My family doctor told said ""I am not a plastic surgeon, but I can tell you this that your breast are to low. So 2 days later went to see a plastic surgeon, and was told it is going to cost me $8,000 for breast reconstruction. I was really impressed with this doctor. The doctor talk with me for 45minutes to 1hour, and that is impressive. Dr. Valentini was only in my consulation 10minutes at the most.
Well the new plastic surgeon said that I have huge implants in with no support, and I am going to continue to have pain until I have to surgery.  Well this is a sad situation. I can't get approved for financing. The only place I can get approved for financing is from that crazy scam company called ""My Choice Medical"", which I wouldn't be in this situation if it wasn't for them in the first place. There doctor are unfit to plastic surgeon. My surgery cost me $5,999, and now I am on pain medication for my pain. I also want to mention that this so called vitiam, which is call Arnica and Bromelain (VitaMedica) is said to Asthenoazoospermia in patients receiving anti-tumour necrosis factor {alpha} agents. On August 12, 2007 almost 7 weeks after surgery. I woke up with a huge golf ball size knot on my groin area, which I was told  was an abscess.  I want to say that I have never In my life ever had anything like this before.  I was very scared.  I went to the minor emergency center, and had it opened up. They told me if it doesn't get better in 5 days to return, or go to your family doctor. Well my point on this is that these vitamins that he gives his patients before and after surgery have very bad side effects. It is used as an anti-inflammatory medicine for healing. The reverse side effects could result in to tumors, which is found it different parts of the body. This homepathic vitiamin is still be considered and unclassified drug. All I can say is I hope to God that this abscess I have isn't cancerous, or anything serious.
My final statement for anyone that read this is ""Don't worry about the money, go through a real finance company, and a real good plastic surgeon"".
I hope that by sharing my story that I will make a difference in the world for all the people that might make this huge mistake.

										I am writing this complaint in reference to an appointment I had with Dr. Fraizer for the first time on August 20, 2007. I have been a patient at the GMS center for about a year now and have never been treated in the manner that I was today. The secretaries and nursing staff are decent enough, but they too appear to suffer from a lack of empathy and concern for their patients. I realize now; however, that working for Dr. Frazier could most certainly have that impact on a person. I needed to see Dr. Fraizer today in order to get a referral by him to a specialist for whom I desperately need to see in regards to a medical condition I have recently acquired. I was able to make an appointment with this particular specialist for the end of this week, but just needed Dr. Fraizer to ""okay"" it by sending a referral to his office in order for my insurance to cover it. Dr. Fraizer arrogantly denied my request stating ""we do not refer to that group."" When I inquired as to why not, he grinned and happily stated ""we just don't, it's too much of a hassle."" Unfortunately and unknowingly as to why, he appeared to enjoy being a pompous jerk to a desperate patient in need of prompt medial care. He stated that he could make a referral to another specialist, but not the one I already had an appointment with and would be able to see in 3 days. When I mentioned that it will probably take up to one to two months to see any other specialist, he nodded in agreement and said ""Choose another primary physician if you want to be referred to that specialist, but I won't do it. You don't have to come here if you don't like."" I was absolutely astonished at the incredible rudeness I was experiencing from a person in a ""helping"" profession. I will NEVER go back to GMS again based on the way I was treated by him. He was not willing to do what it took to please or help his patient in any way. The most disturbing part about this situation was having to watch him display such a cavalier attitude throughout the entire interaction. It is unbelieveable that this physician denied his patient proper medical care based on the fact that he would not have money put in his pocket by referring me to a particular specialist.

										I had liposuction done on my chest which Dr. Ha completely botched.
One pectoral was larger than the other and he used ultrasonic lipo to knock down the top portion of my chest without removing the fat from the lower portion making me look very strange and requiring a second surgery by a competent Doctor to correct. 
I was told by the new Surgeon that Dr. Ha worked on the wrong two thirds of my pectorals and ignored the other one third that he should have focused on.
He was very defensive when I complained and actually walked out of our final consultation before I was finished talking to him.
I am told that he is a gifted children's craniofacial surgeon but I can say in good conscience that he is terrible at general plastic surgery.
Stay away from this guy, and see someone who does not simply dabble in cosmetic surgery as a sideline to his specialization.

										The reason I am sending you a complaint is that since being a patient at Primary Care Physicians of Atlanta for the past 2 years, I have noticed a drop in the level of care by my physician, Sandra K. Banks.
Whenever my husband and I would need to call in for a prescription, it would take as long as several days before a refill is done. Sometimes there is lack of return phone calls.
Recently, my husband Jody and I have decided to switch doctors and have our medical records transferred so that way our new doctor can have our full history of past illnesses and treatments performed.
Although we filled out a consent form at our new doctor's office requesting to have our medical records transferred, Primary Care Physicians called me at work to let me know that they would charge me $.50 per page of records sent over.
In the past if I switched to a different doctor, I don't recall having to pay a fee for my medical records to be transferred.
Even though it is legal in the state of Georgia for a doctor's office to charge up to a $1.00 for every page sent to another doctor's office, I feel that it is bad business practice to charge for our medical records to be transferred to another physician as it should be considered a violation of HIPPA rights.

Description My first consul with Dr. Jacobs was 12/31/2004 Capsulectomy Saline exchange. 
My second visit was 10/20/06 my post appointment at 3:30 pm. At the second visit they gave me the name of a Hotel to stay in after the surgery.  The Franklin Hotel at 164E 87 th street NY NY  (212) 369-1000 and told me he had a deal with that hotel for his patients that fly in to town to have surgery.
That was $359.00 per night.   
My third visit was Nov 2, 2007 day 
of surgery around 7 am.  I was told by Dr Jacobs to bring a DD bra with me.  (I am not a DD now & I am a sagging B or after he finish with me.  Even a D bra is too large now and nothing holds them up they sag too badly which makes them hurt.  All the movement.  I have always had firm implants.  I am in pain everyday since, the surgery.
I got my medical check up for surgery 10/27/06 at Minor emerge Center Physician Services at 11:10 am visit # 28398 
I went to dr. Jacob to have my saline expanders exchange for saline implants and to have the implant on the left side turn right side up.  (It was place in me upside down.)  I was a DD/F 950 ccs.  He said he wanted to make them a little smaller by removing some of my skin to fit a smaller implant.  He said he was going to remove my nipples and center them so they would be even and make sure that each
 breast was the same size and that he would make sure I kept the cleavage that I came to him with. He agreed to keep them high profile.  I had neither sagging nor a fold when I went to him.  See insert (photos).  He said I would come out of surgery with no sagging.  I would have my cleavage and high profile.  That they would be beautiful.   We both agreed that he would replace my implants and leave me high profile with no sagging and my nipples and breast size would be even.  Everything we agreed on he didnt do.  When I came out of surgery   I was sagging like a dog with 12 puppies.  I had no cleavage.  My breast was uneven.  One hanging a lot lower then the other one.  Larry Crooker  & I were and still are very upset.  I cried and still am crying. (On top of it all he replace my saline implants with silicone.  *
COMMENT:
Which scares me to have silicone inside of me. {(NOTE I use the silicon implant that was remove from my left side to stuff my bra and went to the beach.  When I awaken after falling asleep the silicon implant had melted.  My skin and clothes was filled with melted silicone.  I am afraid if the silicone implant inside of my right breast has melted inside me or not.  I don't have the money to have it remove at the moment.)}
*We asked him what happen.  Why was I sagging?  Why was I un even?  Where was my cleavage?  Why didnt
He removes the skin he said he would remove if he were to place a smaller implant in then what I had.
He said my implants look good to him.   See inserts. 
He was high on something.  He said they look more nature the way
 he fixes them.  He said he put a fold in them to make them sag. Larry and I said we told you we wanted no sagging.  (I hadn't any sagging when I first went to him)
We wanted them up like they were before he did the surgery.  He said to give them a few weeks and they would look ok. 
 Nov 9, 2007
When I called him a few weeks later and went back for my 7 day follow up he said 
that he made them look like they look because it was more nature.  Larry, Dr Jacob and I argue about how he screwed up my surgery.  I asked him how did he make such a mess out of my breast. He just said he place a fold in them and now they look nature. Like real breast and he liked them.  I told him I didnt care about what he like it was about what Larry and I wanted and paid for.
I didn't know what a fold was.  He pulled up his shirt and showed me his chest. He said see my breast this is what I did to yours.  I cried. His eyes were very glossy and he spoke weird. He said he would redo them but I had to wait.  I was afraid to go back to him. 
 I flew back to Florida.  I was to return to him for another follow up.  When I return home I had problems. 
On Nov 13,2006 Dr Jacob office. referred me to doctor here in Boca Raton.  Dr. Pozner.   Dr Pozner brought in a specialist. Dr Wagner for consul.  561 391 9631.  They had to perform a closure on my right breast. 
I have been seeing the Florida Doctors every week.  Two to 3 times a week since Nov 13,2006 because of the extreme conduction deformacy Dr. Jacob cause 
With the surgery he performed on me Nov 2, 2006. (SEE INSERT)
12/2/06  Dr Pozner had to perform a closure on my left breast. (SEE INSERT)
The doctor had to re stitch me up.  A week later he had to remove some of the skin that was damage.   It hadn't been a full month when this happen.  Only a few weeks.  (SEE INSERTS)
In Jan 2, 2007 I return to Dr. Jacobs for my follow up and to be release so, Dr Pozner.  & Wagner could take over my care.  I also went to see him on the above date to ask him to pay for future surgeries I needed to correct the problems he cause.  Which they say their will be some permanent damage.
Jan 2, 2007  Dr Jacob removes a capsule covering my implant, which Dr. Pozner & Dr Wagner said he shouldn't have touch it.  
I ask Dr. Jacobs not to remove it.  He did anyway.  After removing it he squeeze it hard. It re opens the womb. .  (stitch area) (See insert) 
Dr. Wagner & Dr Pozner told me not to see Dr Jacob ever again because he was making a mess of things.
 (Each time I have seen him he seen to be agitated.  I didn't get to see him before my surgery of Nov 2, 2006.  Only, after the surgery. He seen agitated and complains about having to spending 2 hours in surgery with me.
JAN 15, 2007 I had to have another medically necessary surgery Dr. Pozner and Dr Wagner had to remove my left implant leaving me deform.  (SEE INSERTS)
My skin has retracted and I have to have Ultra-sound twice a week until I can be re-implanted. (SEE INSERTS Dr notes) 
I have been having it and still am for months now and have to have it until I can have my surgery.
My breast (skin) had retracted so badly, it harden.  The ultra sound is loosening the skin in my breast area.  
So it will expand when they put an expander in it.  Before the surgery all I needed were implants exchange.  Now, I have to have expanders and go thru a series of being fill until my breast look like a round breast again.
I was schedule for post opp June 25, 2007 and surgery July 5, 2007.  Which I won't be able to have because I have ran out of money.  I have to walk around in pain looking like a freak with one missing left breast and a extremely sagging ripple right breast that a bra can't lift up the way I am use to looking and being torture not being able to work.  Larry (my boyfriend) left me because he couldn't deal with the way my breast look or had any more money to put into surgery to get me fix. (All because of what Dr.Brad Jacobs did to me I am penniless and alone and don't know what to do.
Is there a fund to help someone like me to get my breast fix??

Lucido Jeffrey,"  Lucido Jeffrey  441-77 Street 
Brooklyn, New York U.S.A. ",,,Lucido Jeffrey Fraudulently Practice. Brooklyn New York,"
										I have to inform you about those facts, that the doctor Jeffrey Lucido whose office is located at: 441-77 Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11209 was very abusive and intimidated me and my family, while we were his patients. After our visit above mentioned doctor, had completely ignored our requests and questions regarding executing services and treatments that were not authorized by us as patients and a consumers. We have tried to cancel these services, by contacting his office many a time.
Under meaning services I have brought up one of the facts, that under false pretences, doctor Lucido had forced us to purchase an expensive insoles for shoes, no matter were we needed them or not, then doctor Lucido has told us, that those kind of insoles: It's all that you need from pain, and they will do a miracle for us, even if we have had a different diagnoses while we came to his office with a different type of pain for each.
As patient and a consumer I have tried to cancel this imposed by a deceit treatment, because later, I have had a second opinion about ineffectiveness of those expensive insoles from the different doctor. But doctors Lucido office personal, including him, has assured me that his service was done thru the internet and can't be canceled and even if my insurance paid already for everything full amount, I am obligated to pay for it also. 
The doctor Lucido has also neglected me as a patient, when I tried to contact his office when being in pain, after his treatment. Also I am complaining about a doctor's attitude, and I have very deep doubts in his honesty, because, as I have mentioned before, he has already received a payments from my insurance company for the services, products and procedures that we have never obtained. 
Even after my insurance company paid him full amount requested, he has sent a different bill with my wife's name and my name on it to my house for the second payment, but different amount of money, with demanding of immediate payment. (Copy of the bill from my insurance company and a print out of two different bills from that doctor that we have received already in, I can provide upon your request).
As well as all that was mentioned above, I am intensely doubt in proficiency and proper communication skills abilities of the doctor and his office personnel. For example; I have never got the medicine that he has prescribed to me. Instead of it a different prescription has been given to my wife with other patient name and age shown on it, which she will never use, because she values her life very much.
In addition to it, nobody from doctor Lucido's office has informed us about status of the laboratory test of the tissues simples, which has been taken previously during the visit. But we have already received a bill from his office with demanding of immediate payment for it.
Besides, I will not stand the infamous lie and extremely rude behavior that I and my family have faced in this office, while attempting to contact doctor Lucido's office many times, to find a status of a cancellation of service and procedures. 
Committing medical misconduct and practicing fraudulently, can probably be a normal for him, and his personnel, but absolutely unacceptable for me and my family.
I got nothing but nervousness, frustration and emotional sufferings, from those visits. And continue to live with a deep pain in my feet, and questions about greediness and professional honesty of doctor Lucido.
I hope that will be enough information to do appropriate investigation about this doctor malpractice. I am working hard and paying my tax accurately not for being robbed by that doctor.

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES
Resolution:  110
(A-07)
Introduced by: California Delegation 
Subject: Elimination of Medicare Private Fee-For-Service Plans 
Referred to: Reference Committee A
(Virginia E. Hall, MD, Chair) 
Whereas, Medicare Private Fee-For-Service health plans (PFFS)--one type of Medicare Advantage Plan established by Congress under the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003--are authorized under federal law to unfairly deem any physician participating in the Medicare program to be contracted with such plans if the physician treats a PFFS-enrolled patient, even though the physician has not signed a contract with the PFFS plan; and 
Whereas, PFFS plans may pay physicians for medical services at Medicare allowable rates, but they must adhere to the PFFS plans other terms and conditions which are subject to change at any time and may include utilization review rules and other requirements, and do not conform with Medicare payment rules; and 
Whereas, Federal law stipulates that PFFS plans do not have to demonstrate that they have an 'adequate' network of physicians because they have the authority to 'deem' that a physician is bound by the plan's contract terms, and as a result these plans have no incentive to negotiate fair contract terms with physicians to ensure that patients have adequate access to medical services; and Whereas, The federal government pays PFFS plans an average of 119% of the amount Medicare pays per patient for the standard Medicare fee-for-service program, creating a substantial financial incentive for private insurers to market PFFS plans which has spurred a 270% growth rate and represents nearly half of the growth in enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans over the past two years; and Whereas, Medicare Advantage plans are paying 4 to 5 times higher commissions to brokers to market PFFS and there have been well-documented marketing abuses against seniors which include illegal door-to-door soliciting, misleading promises that patients can continue to be treated by their existing physician, and failure to disclose that the plans often have higher co-payments and fewer benefits than what is available in other Medicare Advantage plans or under standard Medicare coverage if they are also covered by the Medicaid program; and Whereas, Higher payments from Medicare, elimination of an incentive to negotiate competitive contract terms with physicians due to the deeming authority given to PFFS plans, and the ability to claim that patients have access to virtually any physician participating in the Medicare program has made PFFS plans an unwarranted profit-center for the insurance industry at the expense of patients and physicians; therefore be it RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association take appropriate action to support the elimination of the Private Fee For Service Plans (PFFS) in the Medicare Advantage Program.  (Directive to Take Action)

NEWBURGH, Indiana U.S.A. ",,812-483-4616,MY CHOICE MEDICAL -DR. GEORGE VALENTINI MY CHOICE MEDICAL (DOCTORS SAY YES) AND PLASTIC SURGEON COMPANY ARE OPERATING A SCAM! Ripoff NEWBURGH Indiana,"
										Well it all started in May of 2007. I went for my consultation for breast augmentation surgery.  I thought that it was going to be the most exciting time in my life, but it was just the beginning of a huge nightmare.  I was seen by Dr. George Valentini, which I was told by My Choice Medical that he is a great doctor.  I was not only scamed by My Choice Medical (doctor say yes), but I was also injured by Dr. George Valentini. Dr. George Valentini did his consultation, and we didn't even discuss prices. He told me what he thought was best for me. I left it up to him. After he left a girl named Angel from My Choice Medical came in. Let me remind you I have already put down $500, and then I was going to put another $1,000 more when she said ""oh I am so sorry I made a mistake I figured out the the wrong price it is going to required another $1,000 for you to be able to have the surgery"".  I didn't know what to think. My heart sunk to the ground. Well I was very stupid I went along with it out of the goodness of my heart, and said ""that is ok mistakes do happen"".  One thing I hate is being played like a fool, and I was played like a fool. I then wrote the check out, and book my surgery.  
After a few weeks went by I decieded to get my money back, and pay for the consultation. I contact Dr. George Valentini office, and they said I couldn't get my money back.  I took a look at my finance paper, and It says in the contract that I would lose all my down payment money if I cancel the surgery.  Well let me tell you this. I wish I would have cancelled, and not worried about the money, because I wouldn't have never been in a situation like I am today, if I wouldn't worry about the deposit money of $2,300.
On June 18, 2007 I went under surgery. 1 1/2 weeks  later I started in with pain. I called the doctor and they take your pain medication, and just go to bed, and so I did. I recently seen Dr. George Valentini, and stress my concerns. My breast have fallen, and I feel something isn't right is this normal? He told me that the breast implants are now settling, and they look natural.  He took  his camera, and took pictures he didn't even examine me. I drove 2 hours away for that, and not to mention very rude. I tried to smile and joke, but deep down inside I wanted to cry. Well 5 days later the pain started coming in. It hurt so bad I could cry. I called the doctor, and the nurse Susan was yelling at me. She said ""you have a very low tolence of pain.  I am going to add to this I had 29 surgerys by the best doctor I think I am a very strong person to be able to go through that. Well I told Susan that I was going to see my family doctor, and I did. My family doctor told said ""I am not a plastic surgeon, but I can tell you this that your breast are to low. So 2 days later went to see a plastic surgeon, and was told it is going to cost me $8,000 for breast reconstruction. I was really impressed with this doctor. The doctor talk with me for 45minutes to 1hour, and that is impressive. Dr. Valentini was only in my consulation 10minutes at the most.
Well the new plastic surgeon said that I have huge implants in with no support, and I am going to continue to have pain until I have to surgery.  Well this is a sad situation. I can't get approved for financing. The only place I can get approved for financing is from that crazy scam company called ""My Choice Medical"", which I wouldn't be in this situation if it wasn't for them in the first place. There doctor are unfit to plastic surgeon. My surgery cost me $5,999, and now I am on pain medication for my pain. I also want to mention that this so called vitiam, which is call Arnica and Bromelain (VitaMedica) is said to Asthenoazoospermia in patients receiving anti-tumour necrosis factor {alpha} agents. On August 12, 2007 almost 7 weeks after surgery. I woke up with a huge golf ball size knot on my groin area, which I was told  was an abscess.  I want to say that I have never In my life ever had anything like this before.  I was very scared.  I went to the minor emergency center, and had it opened up. They told me if it doesn't get better in 5 days to return, or go to your family doctor. Well my point on this is that these vitamins that he gives his patients before and after surgery have very bad side effects. It is used as an anti-inflammatory medicine for healing. The reverse side effects could result in to tumors, which is found it different parts of the body. This homepathic vitiamin is still be considered and unclassified drug. All I can say is I hope to God that this abscess I have isn't cancerous, or anything serious.
My final statement for anyone that read this is ""Don't worry about the money, go through a real finance company, and a real good plastic surgeon"".
I hope that by sharing my story that I will make a difference in the world for all the people that might make this huge mistake.

										I am writing this complaint in reference to an appointment I had with Dr. Fraizer for the first time on August 20, 2007. I have been a patient at the GMS center for about a year now and have never been treated in the manner that I was today. The secretaries and nursing staff are decent enough, but they too appear to suffer from a lack of empathy and concern for their patients. I realize now; however, that working for Dr. Frazier could most certainly have that impact on a person. I needed to see Dr. Fraizer today in order to get a referral by him to a specialist for whom I desperately need to see in regards to a medical condition I have recently acquired. I was able to make an appointment with this particular specialist for the end of this week, but just needed Dr. Fraizer to ""okay"" it by sending a referral to his office in order for my insurance to cover it. Dr. Fraizer arrogantly denied my request stating ""we do not refer to that group."" When I inquired as to why not, he grinned and happily stated ""we just don't, it's too much of a hassle."" Unfortunately and unknowingly as to why, he appeared to enjoy being a pompous jerk to a desperate patient in need of prompt medial care. He stated that he could make a referral to another specialist, but not the one I already had an appointment with and would be able to see in 3 days. When I mentioned that it will probably take up to one to two months to see any other specialist, he nodded in agreement and said ""Choose another primary physician if you want to be referred to that specialist, but I won't do it. You don't have to come here if you don't like."" I was absolutely astonished at the incredible rudeness I was experiencing from a person in a ""helping"" profession. I will NEVER go back to GMS again based on the way I was treated by him. He was not willing to do what it took to please or help his patient in any way. The most disturbing part about this situation was having to watch him display such a cavalier attitude throughout the entire interaction. It is unbelieveable that this physician denied his patient proper medical care based on the fact that he would not have money put in his pocket by referring me to a particular specialist.

										I had liposuction done on my chest which Dr. Ha completely botched.
One pectoral was larger than the other and he used ultrasonic lipo to knock down the top portion of my chest without removing the fat from the lower portion making me look very strange and requiring a second surgery by a competent Doctor to correct. 
I was told by the new Surgeon that Dr. Ha worked on the wrong two thirds of my pectorals and ignored the other one third that he should have focused on.
He was very defensive when I complained and actually walked out of our final consultation before I was finished talking to him.
I am told that he is a gifted children's craniofacial surgeon but I can say in good conscience that he is terrible at general plastic surgery.

Atlanta, Georgia U.S.A. ",,404-255-9100,Primary Care Physicians Of Atlanta When Doctor's Offices No Longer Serve the Patient Atlanta Georgia,"
										The reason I am sending you a complaint is that since being a patient at Primary Care Physicians of Atlanta for the past 2 years, I have noticed a drop in the level of care by my physician, Sandra K. Banks.
Whenever my husband and I would need to call in for a prescription, it would take as long as several days before a refill is done. Sometimes there is lack of return phone calls.
Recently, my husband Jody and I have decided to switch doctors and have our medical records transferred so that way our new doctor can have our full history of past illnesses and treatments performed.
Although we filled out a consent form at our new doctor's office requesting to have our medical records transferred, Primary Care Physicians called me at work to let me know that they would charge me $.50 per page of records sent over.
In the past if I switched to a different doctor, I don't recall having to pay a fee for my medical records to be transferred.
Even though it is legal in the state of Georgia for a doctor's office to charge up to a $1.00 for every page sent to another doctor's office, I feel that it is bad business practice to charge for our medical records to be transferred to another physician as it should be considered a violation of HIPPA rights.

Torrance California","
										Dr. Baghai insisted on cutting my abdomen apart during a procedure in 1998 - when she was an intern at Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN - and it was a difficult case from University Hospitals in Cleveland.  She didn't belong touching anything and WAS ASKED NOT TO - asked to let another professional have some privacy and some CARE by Dr. Michael Sarr AWAKE.  But she had to CUT AND CUT AND CUT NORMAL TISSUE for her CV.  Three times I refused her in discussions with Dr. Sarr - 3 times - which she chose to ignore - foreigness (BAGHAI) or something cruel in her makeup or mentality?  She watched while I was put under an anesthesia that I had also refused - to get me to accept her practicing.  Awake I would have screamed.  And practice she did.  She didn't care.  To this day I see her face in my nightmares.
I never agreed to the procedure that was done, the procedure that she participated in was never discussed with Dr. Sarr - not even DISCUSSED.  And I asked that she not be involved - 3 discussions of saying NO - a NO that wasn't honored so that she could 'rape' me with her surgical gloves under anesthesia.  A woman intern raping another woman's abdomen with no need, or cosmetic benefit involved for the PATIENT?  The PAIN will be worse for the rest of my life, this procedure wasn't to prevent pain.  Three abdominal muscles were cut irreparably and sloppily, TRASHED, and I discussed 3x with Dr. Sarr that NO MUSCLES WOULD BE CUT BY ANYONE - A NON-NEGOTIABLE CONDITION OF MY AGREEING TO THE SUDDEN SURGERY - that he found a slot for to give her experience apparently.  Cut, rape, destroy, ruin, disfigure = the mantra at Mayo and as soon as possible after you see the patient.  Just the guy thing.  No student or resident was to be involved = condition of the surgery = a condition her mother would have made, her sister, her brother - I had FAMILY that wanted me back without her mutilations and/or neuroma surgery, no muscles were to be gone into without a family member being in Minnesota = she couldn't understand this.  
My family didn't realize that Dr. Sarr would cut muscles without an MRI scan.  That was refused 3 times with Dr. SARR.  An inflamed normal nerve was removed = a dangerous procedure for even an experienced surgeon.  No workup or scans were allowed or done - she didn't question one question - just wanted to cut, rip, and mutilate = destroy another woman's body.  She was drooling over me when I last saw her, planning how to carve me up without my consent.  Don't let her cut you, you will regret it and her attitudes for the rest of your living life = she doesn't care and never did.  There's only a handful of physicians that are this bad, that they would 'rape'/ruin another professional's body for their petty experience; that they FORCE themselves on you.
If she had not forced herself on my case, and every intern/resident should know some ethics and professionalism about respecting another professional not wanting them in the room (just professional privacy/courtesy), immature Dr. Michael Sarr wouldn't have been doing a LIVE DEMONSTRATION on me - a physician also of bottom-feeder professionalism = the kind that Mayo Clinic rewards and promotes through the ranks of sleaze.  The abdominal muscles have NEVER healed, and she knew NOTHING about me, or the procedure, or what I had agreed to - she just cut and didn't know how to cut at that time and didn't CARE THAT I WOULD WAKE UP AND CRY for 10 years - she didn't care and needed some dog labs from what the plastic surgeon saw = what she left was a literal mess without one qualm of conscience.  Not one tear would she ever shed for the mutilation that she did to another woman - Old World type of mutilation = the Dr. Sarr neuroma procedure.  I had to get on a plane an come home to Ohio disfigured, with a horrible sore throat from an experimental airway = everyone experimented on me that day.  Was this a joke?  Dr. Baghai is a horrible surgeon, especially in forcing herself on other professionals for an afternoon of fun and games - that should never happen EVEN AS AN INTERN; that you do a procedure for your CV - that you can say you did one.  ONE WOMAN RESIDENT WAS TO BE IN THE ROOM, not an INTERN = not her.  It wasn't a game when I woke up smelling like the black medical student's sweat and his horrible dressing - so sloppy, so crude, so cruel = gross for even rural Ohio.  It was just HORRIBLE, GRISLY, A SHOCK and a sadness for the rest of my life = CRIMINAL.  My mother took care of those muscles when I was a child, and not for her to cut and destroy in a moment of stupidity, inexperience and frivolity = her picture says it all smiling at the patients she's hurt in her past.  The incision was a mess and she had no business being 'in' on anything; SHE WAS REFUSED.
Jill Beed Esq is partially responsible for this in not honoring or mandating written patient consents at Mayo Clinic; Mayo Clinic doesn't have or honor patient consent forms - everyone just does what they feel like to the patient.
Jill Beed in the legal administration/department encourages literal 'rape' of patients by incompetent learning staff that shouldn't ever be in the room, and aren't wanted in the room by the patient or the family - Dr. Baghai fell in that category.  The HORRIBLE MONSTER black medical student shouldn't have been touching me unless my parents were in Minnesota IN THE ROOM and ON HIS BACK - Dr. Baghai has no ethics or maturity like her mentor Dr. Michael Sarr - who can't see to recognize a normal nerve.  I was alone and taken advantage of, for her laughing.  Someday hope she has a black medical student pawing over her, grunting, sweating and mutilating for the OR staff - he was horrible to look at, and couldn't say a word, but he could destroy tissue better than any Iraqi landmine.  BAGHAI ethics; if you can't mutilate in Iraq, get the American in the Operating Room in Minnesota - this was 3rd world care.  The two, Baghai and her black friend, were the worst around apparently, and were asked NOT TO BE THERE, participating or otherwise.  But they can't be told NO.  I only agreed to one woman resident being IN THE ROOM to WATCH to SHUT UP DR. SARR'S barrage of persuasion and harassments - he forces the students/residents on patients with 'go' after 'go' behind closed doors without the nurses to witness - when he needs to check the blood work and scans instead of interrogating your reasons.  Dr. Sarr, and Jill Beed knows this, shouldn't be doing this monster behavior vampire stuff.  Dr. Baghia should have asked herself as I had to ask as a woman intern - but she's too lazy so Dr. Sarr has to harass you, rack you, for an hour or more (more than he discusses the procedure) he goes at you about who can help and you keep saying NO and he keeps not hearing.  And he's a big guy doing this PERSUADING.  It's just force, and force, and kill the patient for Mayo Clinic glory.  Jill Beed needs to sit in on one of these Dr. Sarr torture sessions; the Gestapo could have learned from him - maybe that's where he got it.  A Jewish guy destroying a Catholic girl's body to get back at someone for past historical wrongs done to Jews?  Gotta hurt someone else like the Jews were hurt with the experimental surgeries in the wards of the German concentration camps?  This surgery was an experiment if ever there was one, just done under anesthesia this time.  For sure it was a Mengele-type 'special' surgery that I would have NEVER have agreed to AWAKE (and Dr. KNEW THIS - which is particularly disturbing).  Dr. Sarr could have reached my father surgeon before he proceeded to cut the muscles - my father was by the phone.  The Medical Board of Minnesota needs to outlaw this procedure - there are better ways of treating nerve inflammation in an old incision.  And they need to outlaw the way that Dr. Sarr and Dr. Baghai did this to me - just deception, force, have a 'go' at a Catholic girl - ruin a body. . .
Inflamed normal nerves are not RECOMMENDED removed before nerve blocks are tried = literature which no one reads at Mayo Clinic, they just write it.  Dr. Baghai knew nothing about the case or the literature (Mayo or other academic papers) - just stupidly cut, and certainly not by cutting a whole abdomen off.  This happened because she forced the situation for experience and to look like the guys - big ego no brains, keep cutting to the peritoneum - rip me apart.  The operative report read like a Third World War.  Dr. Baghia had no experience with people or surgery, and had to mutilate me and was asked/BEGGED not to - I agreed that she could WATCH the procedure only, and she persuaded Dr. Sarr otherwise apparently.  No respect for anyone else's LIFE, CAREER, or FAMILY.  There's a classic paper about Abdominal Wall Pain but it's in the Family Practice Journals - too plebian for Drs. Sarr & Baghai: Am Fam Physician. 2002 Jun 1;65(11):2211.  The abdominal wall: an overlooked source of pain.  Suleiman S, Johnston DE.
Dr. Baghai doesn't take 'NO' and will mutilate muscles, nerves, and patients - without a care or regret.  There was extensive plastic surgery required (did she care or ask?).  No picture was taken at Mayo and I was dropped as a patient so that the plastic surgery department wouldn't see what she was doing, so her credentials would be intact.  When a picture ISN'T ALLOWED, you know there's a BIG goof; a no glossies goof.  Her operative report had to be re-dictated, and mentioned things that didn't happen (apparently? no one knows what really happened that day or will admit - just like in concentration camps), and sutures that weren't used - it was a disgrace of incompetence, a female-getting-her-ire-out-at-another-female so that I wouldn't get married ever (= get rid of the 'competition' by destroying 3 muscles for life, and she knew this = mutilate the American woman physician was the sole purpose and should have been on the operative report, not to prevent pain).  
Dr. Baghai was complained about to the State Medical Board of Minnesota - they let her go to do this again.  An intern/resident is RESPONSIBLE for what they do, or for what they try to do and don't know how to do and won't admit, and for what they FORCE themselves on another human being for = unnecessary anesthesia, surgery, and destruction of muscle tissue.  What you did was WRONG, and Dr. Sarr knew it was WRONG and YOU KNEW it was wrong, but Baghai v American and you destroyed for whatever reason.  
Dr. Baghai let an incompetent, gross, smelly, huge black medical student further mutilate the situation - and both were asked to allow Dr. Sarr to do the procedure without their assistance because of 'confidentiality' (just a woman begging nicely) - neither could keep their hands off me for all the begging or parents worrying at home in Ohio - just gross touching even without CONSENT.  My mother can't even bear to think about what PROBABLY happened in that OR.  The medical student was even worse than Dr. Baghai was at the time (if that could be possible), and he was requested not to be in the room and didn't care, he was BLACK and had to cut a WHITE woman = his divine right.  Meanwhile, I had no rights between Baghai and an Equal Opportunity Student = equal opportunity mess.  Dr. Sarr never saw me back for ONE post-op visit as I would have had the police in the room with Ms. Beed.  Dr. Baghai has no respect for another woman physician, no abilities, she can't cut or sew and forces herself on you for experience - I will regret seeing her, and not SCREAMING before I was drugged, for the rest of my life.  She's a horrible physician, and an even worse person.  
Dr. Baghai will do a procedure without a thought, scan, review of the case, or a permission from the patient - the verbal permission was that she was not to touch anything and not to do the procedure, not to watch me get drugged.  Anesthesia was also at fault here - anything for MONEY - drug the woman from Ohio out-of-her-mind and use an experimental airway for FUN AND GAMES AND MAYO GLORY.  It's all a paper publication, or an experiment, unless the patient dies.  I refused an airway for what it was worth; SPINAL if you were going to do anesthesia was my choice - BUT NO ONE LISTENED or interviewed me - they just drugged and cut = date rape in any other state.  I had to be cut up drugged - trashed with a tattooed 'twist' (her incision had these 'signature' curves).  It was intentional; the plastic surgeon worked for over an hour to Z-plasty everything multiple times.  My parents didn't come because they thought that this was straightforward procedure UNDER LOCAL, and didn't have to POLICE her as this was Mayo Clinic where better behavior was expected.  Her incisions are 'signature.'
Both parents could not understand Dr. Sarr destroying someone else's child's abdomen for sport - nothing was an emergency, and it was agreed with Dr. Sarr that HE WOULD STOP AND DISCUSS THE OPTIONS BEFORE TOUCHING ANY MUSCLE - but she apparently got him to CUT ME UP - no intermissions or reprieve.  This was a groupie disaster.  My parents were a physician and a nurse, and Dr. Sarr threatened my physician father afterwards, he screamed at my mother - all because of you and your experience to be a bariatric surgeon and endoscopist.  Hope you got what you wanted and that someone tattooes you in the OR.
YOUR MOTHER WOULD HAVE PLEADED THAT THIS PROCEDURE NOT BE DONE TO YOU AND YOU DIDN'T CARE ONE MINUTE.  The muscles don't heal from the particular butchery that Dr. Baghia did that day and she should have known the statistics on that procedure - IT'S A PROCEDURE THAT THE STATE MEDICAL BOARD OF MINNESOTA NEEDS TO STOP - and it was refused 3+ TIMES that ANY NERVE MATERIAL BE REMOVED - NO NERVE WAS TO BE TOUCHED, NEUROMAS WERE NOT TO BE REMOVED WITHOUT DISCUSSION OF THE OPTIONS.  That's top of the list on her operative report - probable neuroma (that I refused be removed).  ONLY previous scar tissue was allowed to be removed.  Dr. Baghai didn't care and my nerve went to pathology, and that sensation did not return - the skin feels like 'jello' - the Baghai kind.  And it wasn't an emergency - but she was too stupid and interested only in her own career and getting back to California and being a big deal.  Take out all the nerves in an American patient becuase you are first generation whatever or just plain angry?
Dr. Baghai will not THINK more than a cyborg about who she hurts, ie the cyborg Cameron on the Sarah Connor Chronicles thinks more than Dr. Baghai about things, and she's programmed NOT TO THINK.  But to inflict herself on a re-do procedure, that was then botched beyond the repair of an experienced plastic surgeon in Ohio - is so horrible, gross and unprofessional that I was shocked and still am.  There was no need to cut the muscles, and no discussion of this - her hands and Dr. Sarr's hands were too big?  And she's a surgeon now?  A plastic surgeon was to do the closure.  Dr. Baghia doesn't talk with patients, dates back to Mayo Clinic - she mutilates, hurts, and deforms you for life for her experience and her glossy picture on the Internet.  Stay away.  There's not a moment without pain from what she did - nerves regrow painfully, but the muscles don't heal after the fascia has been torn, ripped and cut - for her demonstration.  
This wasn't a procedure that I was even REMOTELY FAMILIAR with, and I've assisted at a lot of surgery, and at the time of this surgery had more surgical experience than Dr. Baghai who was surgerizing me courtesy of the State of Minnesota Medical Board.  Dr. Sarr was doing things that were not agreed to with her encouragement - and that's her responsibility.  One question:  Couldn't you have let me be that day and gotten your experience somewhere else?  The Chief of Surgery at University Hospitals in Cleveland had had trouble diagnosing the nerve problem?  Dr. Sarr didn't call him.  Couldn't you have let me have some privacy, some consideration, some professional care - your care was not professional.  I did an internship in surgery also and never mutilated a patient, or participated in a surgery, when I was asked to step aside and let this case go to the Chief.  Part of the nerve problem was an untreated auto-immune thyroid problem - but did anyone check the labs even at Mayo Clinic? NO, they just carved me up for the RIP.

Sure he may seem charming initially or WHENEVER he needs to, but make no mistake he is nothing shy of a criminal that is yet to be prosecuted.

We all are a revolviong door by our own choice when the truth of his unethical practice reveals itself.   What is a true travesty is that the patients that he robs he professes to care about.  
I have personally for years taken phonecalls from desperate patients that he has not answered phonecalls of distress from.   
Little does he care about because he has collected not only cash from them but also 10 fold from their insurance company for procedures that were never even done (yet he bills for).  
I truly wish that the public could see even a fraction of the ethics of this man.  I detest the fat that I had anything to do with his practice prior to my fully seeing the truth.  Yes, I am a disgruntled employee, but rest assured I am in good company for VERY sound reasons.

Los Angeles, California U.S.A. ",,,Dr. Shane Sheibani - New Me Surgical Institute patients beware! Los Angeles California,"
										Finally a chance to warn potential patients about this doctor without losing my job. Please read this, if you are thinking about going to Dr. Shane Sheibani for any kind of surgical procedure.  First things first my experience with Dr. Sheibani the ""cosmetic"" surgeon. Ladies and gentleman I have been in the beauty industry for many years and let me tell you the most important bit of information.....DO YOUR HOMEWORK!  Dr. Sheibani is a ""cosmetic"" surgeon..what does that mean? It means that he is not only NOT a board certified surgeon he is not even a plastic surgeon. There is a big difference between the two, please do your research! This does not always matter too much for more simple procedures like a breast augmentation, but for anything more complicated like a breast lift or tummy tuck this is the difference between a good surgery and a botched surgery. At least this is true for Dr. Sheibani. 
I will never forget how appaled I was to have a very nice patient come in after her surgery was completed to tell me that there did not seem to be any difference at all! This patient spent 8k for a breast lift and was not happy about the results. As usual Dr. Sheibani told her to wait it out for six months. After six months she came back in and to my horror her before and after pictures showed absolutely NO difference at all!! This was hard for me as I grew very fond of the patient. I found the doctors response to be even more apalling he pretended like there was a big difference and that he would do a ""touch up"", at the patients expense, in a couple  years if she still felt like she needed it. This happened several times with different patients, it always surprised me how nice Dr. sheibani could be when a new patient came in and how easy it was for him to dismiss a patients concerns after they had a surgery. He is unethical to say the very least. 
There were a couple of times when he would change his mind about what procedures he wanted to perform on a patient THE DAY OF THE SURGERY, like if he did not quite feel like doing a breast lift he would convince a patient that a breast lift was not needed and a breast augmentation would be fine. Before he would perform the procedure he would have the patients sign one of his infamous last minute contracts to make sure the patient was okay with this, if the patient refused he would not perform the procedure. Please anyone interested in having any type of surgical procedure do not allow cost to be the only reason you go to one surgeon over another, you could end up spending more for results you aren't even happy with. Take my advice DO NOT HAVE ANY WORK DONE BY DR. SHEIBANI EVER!

The Texas State Board of Medical Examiners reprimanded David Kleiman and Anthony Evangelista for ads published in various Dallas-Fort Worth newspapers.
The ads for the Kleiman-Evangelista Eye Center contained statements such as ""nearly three out of four patients are seeing better than 20/20 vision! As for that other one patient, well, they'll just have to settle for 'perfect.'""
Another ad urged consumers to ""trust your eyes to Tarrant County's leading LASIK surgeons"" -- even though the eye center doesn't have data verifying that its doctors perform the most LASIK surgeries in the county, according to the board.
The board's rules prohibit ads that are false, deceptive or misleading, including those containing claims that cannot be substantiated.

Resnick MD Dr. Resnick will agree to do 6+ evaluations' on women physician graduates of CWRU, objecting to the wrong diagnosis (lab confirmed), for the State Medical Board of Ohio when University Hospitals physicians goofed in her care as she was just 'unlucky.' Cleveland Ohio","
										University Hospitals of Cleveland is not CARING PHYSICIANS doing anything.  Dr. Resnick is an Ohio State cleaner' of messes, and CWRU cleaner' of messes  where things that are not psychiatric suddenly become transferred to his purview  orthopedic care and missed endocrine diagnoses on women are alchemized to 'holding a grudge.'  The MEDICAL MISTAKES in my care are embarrassing to any academic institution, so CWRU and THE OHIO STATE MEDICAL BOARD have to regroup and make this psychiatric.'  A woman physician in Ohio has to be CRAZY,' she can't be RIGHT.'
AND Dr. Resnick conducts SEMINARS, supposedly nationally known and advertised, where he teaches other psychiatrist/psychologists to go after women until they break  even if it takes years and piles of lies that he knows are lies.  He's a relentless attack dog in a suit, tie and white coat.  In Ohio, Dr. Resnick would evaluate a woman physician for the $5,000 6th time for objecting to the wrong care and wrong diagnosis, while her serious' bone condition remains untreated for his hardened denial - last 5 years. [Criminals aren't the only hardened characters  try male psychiatrists/orthopedics/ob-gyns = anything androgen stimulated.]  It only makes COMMON SENSE to treat the bone problem first, and then if the patient is happy, to let her go back to work in medicine.  But she can't keep fracturing in front of patients and psychiatrists. . .or can she?  That's the WHITEHOUSE PLAN.  
Dr. Resnick can't admit a mistake, or a group mistake, anymore than the terrible psyches he's studied - a mistake that has already cost this woman physician 8 fractures, her having a family, and a career.  Meanwhile, until she gets to Dr. Resnick, the Grendell choice, she's had been declared an IMPAIRED physician for 4 years now (what's the IRS to do with this IMPAIRMENT by decree? make her a perennial dependent? until the file is opened?).  Meanwhile the physicians who couldn't reduce or cast her fractures, couldn't order physical therapy, and who couldn't do blood work as they were learning' from her case  are all out there practicing on other unsuspecting patients.  She couldn't have even one child, wasn't good enough for that in Ohio, while child murderers do it everywhere and abortion is rampant  she'd like one of those babies delivered to safe baby havens/zones.  Mrs. Yates can have kids, but not this MD.
And in Ohio woman-physicians need WOMAN PHYSICIAN HAVENS (WPH) or SAFE ZONES (SZ); for when you get sick or fractured so that your male colleagues don't try to cut you up for demonstrations, refuse to order the blood work you need, or just leave you to rot as you didn't sleep with them; not action and therefore no medical care needed.  Women physicians, despite the number of hardened woman physicians/DOs on the Medical Board, do not get due process or any process in Ohio  THEY ARE TOLD WHO TO SLEEP WITH, WHO TO REFER TO, AND WHAT DIAGNOSES TO HAVE FOR CONVENIENT MEDICAL BOARD DISCIPLINES/STATISTICS by other women.  The statistics in Ohio are very skewed  meaning that things that are not anything in most other states are suddenly IMPAIRMENTS in Ohio; physician disciplines are a GPS-thing for Ohio  have to have so many women physician disciplines per acre, like oil/natural gas wells.  Kentucky, needing physicians, needs to question Governor Strickland.
For five years now, we've argued back and forth about another Dr. Resnick evaluation to end-all-evaluations: first the cost, then the secret CONFIDENTIAL' FILE, and most recently the possibility of another evaluator.  BUT no one except Dr. Resnick wants to be involved given the substance & evidence in the case  evidence modified many times despite his teaching EVIDENCE at CWRU Law School.  Everyone knows that Mr. Whitehouse is running a very DIRTY HOUSE.  EVIDENCE IN OHIO IS ANYTHING THAT THE OHIO STATE MEDICAL BOARD WANTS IT TO BE and Dr. Resnick goes along with this; convenient ethics, evidence by vote.  Otherwise, it means telling the State Medical Board of Ohio that the University Hospitals of Cleveland physicians may not have done the right' thing in my care (or many wrong things)  that is if you have a conscience that isn't too criminally hardened to remember innocence, the right diagnosis, or how to tell the truth.
Dr. Resnick has the consult from Dr. Angelo Licata of The Cleveland Clinic that this is a missed endocrine diagnosis causing bone loss and decline to the point of fracturing  but Dr. Resnick apparently doesn't know any medicine or care about the physician-patient grad of CWRU  just his visible darkness' celebrity.  Dr. Resnick is not a MATCH for this case and needs to defer to Dr. Andrew Skodol with all the files.  Ohio psychiatrists are not the RIGHT psychiatrists for this political case, where the Ohio State Medical Board has intentionally falsified and changed evidence over 16 tears now.
Senator Grendell, Representative Dolan, Representative Trakas  all know this and just go party with the boys; this wasn't my legislative problem, it's theirs that absolute power, with no oversight, corrupts.  The Ohio State Medical Board has no overseeing Review Board.  IMPAIRMENTS are just a NEW AGE thing in Ohio  boxes of physicians with no criteria are impaired while their drunken colleagues just have friends' on the Board  the real MD drunks in Ohio are never disciplined, just pickled = Dr. Suppes, Dr. James Carter, Dr. Carla O'Day, and whatever Dr. Nice is on that makes him leave fractures to excrescence and other coined words = some drink.
Dr. Resnick is decently bright, but . . . not an amazing scholar' by his own admission, so why have the brilliant woman physician, CWRU School of Medicine graduate of 1980, who tried to explain her rare diagnosis to the not-so-decently bright University Orthopedics, mandated evaluated by him by the Ohio State Medical Board?  How can she explain to him what the other University Hospitals physicians don't have the IQ for.  Her family has paid over $200,000 to straighten out two other 'right' Ohio psychiatric evaluations: one with a falsified Rorschach test and the other with an invented psychiatric diagnosis.  THE OHIO STATE MEDICAL BOARD CAN TAKE A WOMEN PROFESSIONAL'S MEDICAL LICENSE FOR A PROVISIONAL DIAGNOSIS THAT DOESN'T EXIST AND KEEP TRYING TO DO THIS FOR 16 YEARS.  This WOULD BE THE 6th EVALUATION to try to find a case' for the Ohio State Medical Board's taking her license in 1992, for making too much of her fracture care' = a capital crime in Ohio (career death).  
No one has heard of this RIDICULOUS EXCUSE for suspending a medical license in ANY OTHER STATE.  There was no exaggeration of the bone pains or fracture problems, just a hardened State Medical Board of average six-pack Joes, DO Janes and SPOTty laymembers (see the laymembers run with the boys) from the business communities  who don't know any medicine and shouldn't have a women MDs medical files to review (this is supposed to be confidential' if the diagnosis doesn't impair function  but Dr. Nice/Keith et al MISSED THE DIAGNOSIS).  The Ohio State Medical Board functions as a malpractice determiner/sieve; if you have malpractice, they administratively beat the case out of you instead of correcting the diagnostic deficiencies in Ohio.  Physician complaints are whitewashed; that's why the 'confidential' part is required.  The case here: that I was a BAD PATIENT who TRIED, like the 7 year old being drowned in one of Dr. Resnick's famous cases, to save her hand function, thyroid, and career from the male vultures/wolves/6-pack Dr. Joes.  But I wasn't 7, and no more successful that that child, and so far I've been drowned for the politics and fevered apocalyptic reasoning minus the horror.  
The diagnosis is a thyroid bone weakening  not a felony - just a sad consequence of Ohio stupidity, medical neglect and mistreatment.  It took no less than 10 years to get a TSH drawn, and it was done in Washington DC at Georgetown University Hospital after another fracture and a swollen thyroid gland (neglect finally caused the thyroid gland to enlarge enough to be detected by male physicians with no ability for this exam, ie Dr. Lafferty, Dr. Keith, Dr. Suppes, Dr. O'Day, Dr. Nice).  Most physicians in Ohio, and all on The State Medical Board of Ohio, don't know what a TSH is  after all Mayo Clinic missed doing it on my abbreviated 1991 blood tests.  The Ohio Board, anymore than Dr. Resnick's University jock' Orthopedic Associates, doesn't understand what this woman physician had, which wasn't psychiatric or an impairment' to practice  just something different to get their head around, nothing ordinary, so they had to stamp it psychiatric.'  After all asking a lay Member to explain HASHIMOTO'S is likely to result in a new bar cocktail drink answer; an RN State Representative (SALLY KILBANE) had no idea about the word, but she went to Nursing School in Ohio.  
BUT anything that an Ohio male physician misses, or is too unintelligent to grasp, is a psychiatric' diagnosis.  They know the words psychiatric and evaluation in Ohio.  My case is not psychiatric though, it's just the most common thyroiditis that WOMEN have and the guys skip those lectures for the B-Ball courts at every Medical School in Ohio.  And the second problem in my years:  Dr. Lafferty, who missed this diagnosis on me, gave the lecture.  
However,  Dr. Resnick is still obsessed with the narcissistic delusional logic that endless evaluations' are a moral act to be practiced on dissenting 
woman physicians with IQs over 150  strike down the amazing scholars is the way to handle anything more than ORDINARY.  Dr. Resnick is once again to be a legal expert for the defense of the Ohio State Medical Board, if the money can be found, any donations from corporations will be welcome  if there are any corporations left in Cleveland after the last months and sale of National City Corp.  
After all University Hospitals and The Cleveland Clinic are cooperating on a class of medical students, but can't cooperate or exchange ideas on a woman patient; they are still each other's COMPETITION until someone referees them with ENOUGH money.  Like some of the victims of Dr. Resnick's cases, I've struggled,' trying to save myself from drowning/fracturing in the sea of lies, fabrications, and denials that happens when there are no MEDICAL MISTAKE LAWS in a state.  Ohio, unlike 35+ other states, refuses to admit that physicians, attorneys, or Medical Boards can make mistakes and have to handle them in responsible ways.  And I'd like my tormenters to say sorry'  it would go a long way.
Dr. Andrew Skodol, the US psychiatric personality expert in every other state, is not good enough for the Ohio Board in 1995-6; they had to have another go.'  It's 10 years later of no answer from Mr. Whitehouse  he just ignores what he can't solve  hires Eileen = SILENTHOUSE.  There were no patient complaints, but this isn't about patient problems; it's about University Hospitals of Cleveland (and Hillcrest now owned by The Cleveland Clinic) - getting out of a missed diagnosis that they lied about, trashed the blood work on (Dr. Lafferty's 1991 blood work has never been found), and misrepresented to get out of liability for  to let the statute of limitations expire for 16 years  another first for Medical Board statute of limitations duration.  The cast that I got at University Hospitals was an experimental' cast that has never worked, and didn't work on me  and shouldn't have been tried when Dr. Lacey could have tried something more traditionally successful, ie re-manipulation and re-reduction in the OR.  Yet the cover-up on this goes from Floyd Loop MD (who sent me to a CCF Personnel talking-head guy who tried to say that I asked' for it), to Dr. Wulf Utian, to Dr. Chad Deal, to Dr. Lafferty, to Drs. Keith & Nice = conspiracy of silence.
There's no DNA evidence to prove the woman correct,' but Dr. Resnick will try again; another go' to discredit and shatter what mental self-respect is left, if he doesn't see some enlightenment or psychiatric epiphany about abuse.  Abuse of women physician colleagues for male advancements, egos, demonstrations, and disciplines = the only advance is that women get their MDs to be the discipline statistics, the scapegoats, for a flawed system of physician discipline in Ohio.
Medical licenses should only be suspended for serious matters, not disagreeing with a testosterone-drive JERK or TWO.  This is not what psychiatry, or forensic psychiatry, was intended to be used for.  Even military medical ethics applies to aggressive interrogations, and the misuse of endless psychiatry consultations or psychotropic drugs, on terrorists (NEJM 359;11,1087-9), but nothing applies for women physicians and the Ohio State Medical Board.  Torture by isolation, cruel, inhuman and degrading medical care treatment(s), and punishment' to work only in research labs goes for the suspended woman physician in Ohio  Chad Deal MD and Wulf Utian MD refused to help in any medical way (~2000), even knowing the missed diagnoses and continued fractures, because the Ohio State Medical Board was involved and their careers came first.  Chad Deal MD just condemned me to more fractures in 2000, and he wants to run the Bone Department at The Cleveland Clinic  just for men and politically correct women.   
The Ohio State Medical Board has ruled that Dr. Resnick is the expert of their, and Senator Grendell's, choice - to evaluate me after 3 national experts have told the Ohio State Medical Board to stop' the harassments, return the medical license, and let me get the care that I need for a rare misunderstood hereditary bone problem (my cousin, exactly my age, has exactly the same diagnosis with fractures and has been under treatment' for years now to stop the fractures).  University Hospitals, and every Member of the present Medical Board of Ohio, missed this 7-figure diagnosis miss = that's why it has to be a psychiatric impairment = so that I can't collect.  So now the game is to destroy me with the fierce cross-examination of a hardened forensic pro -- a pro with no expertise in women's medicine and self-admittedly maybe not the acumen, or the less than acid approach, needed to understand the one question on the Endocrine Boards diagnosis.  Notwithstanding this, the old adage still stands up that you (a) do the blood work, and (b) treat the medical diagnoses, before you (c) try to find an occult psychiatric diagnosis to get out of liability for a & b = medical PEARL.
There's no IMPULSE CONTROL when it comes to the State Medical Board of Ohio, ordering endless evaluations' on innocent women physicians struggling to save themselves, and what health they have left, after University Hospital physician goofs and gaffes.  Question: Are most University Hospital physicians good, fair, or poor when it comes to impulse control?  They seem to order random acts of experimentation (experimental casts), can't do even a RANDOM workup though, will schedule endless explorations,' and can't keep their fingers off the psychiatric evaluation' mouse click.  Does Dr. Resnick have any impulse control when it comes to another one-on-one $5000, Medical Board kudos, unneeded, traumatic, and potentially harmful 6th evaluation of a woman physician-patient who can't get her bone condition treated by Dr. Licata  fearful of his Ohio medical license being forfeit  and can't get a job for being published impaired' with no criteria except that she disagreed with the ol' boy network 16-going-on-17 years ago?  This is an antique case which the Ohio State Medical Board continues to pour money into = the Whitehouse bailout of Ohio monies.  
Few have Dr. Resnick's credentials, but Dr. Andrew Skodol of Columbia-Presbyterian had more for this case and Dr. Resnick can't recognize that; the Achilles heel in Ohio is that COMPLETE MEDICAL CERTAINTY only comes from Dr. Resnick  even if you kill the personality of the woman physician in the process.  And if it doesn't matter which side pays the tab  this one's on The Ohio State Medical Board and they should have antied up the $5000 no less than 5 years ago  after cheating on two past evaluations (falsifying a Rorschach and inventing a diagnosis that doesn't exist; 1992 & 1995-6).  No amount of money can make THE OHIO STATE MEDICAL BOARD tell the TRUTH however.  Further the damage of what's been done for 16 years now needs to be assessed and price-tagged, before more cross-examination.  Dr. Goldstine of Berkeley Therapy, who has gone to Dr. Resnick's infamous criminal seminars, had refused to do another evaluation in 2005  he saw what the last one did and had to pay in terms of an organic lunch with buckets of chamomile tea.  It will take the rest of my life to understand the so-termed true integrity,' that has gone so mistakenly down the path less traveled here, along with other abusive behaviors in this tragic situation  even with the Catholic take' on the redemptive qualities of suffering.  
Isn't it inconsistent to insist on a 6th evaluation for a missed medical diagnosis by University Hospitals - where the physician-patient didn't do the miss'  by a University Hospitals in-house forensic psychiatrist with a BARE BRASS-KNUCKLES APPROACH to getting the witness to recant - or at least regret still living with complete medical certainty after the 6th scrutiny?  Does it take a FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST to EVALUATE THE INAPPROPRIATE SEXUALLY-LACED AND CONDESCENDING COMMENTS THAT OBSCURED THE CARE AND MUDDLED THE DIAGNOSIS?  Comments that have been University Hospitals daily wards fare for over 25 years now went on, as they do every day, and wreaked havoc in this situation as they have in every University Hospital miss' and bad result = attention was on the wrong kind of PERFORMANCE for patient care. 
When your patient is less than a guy, then it's inconsistent to let a guy do more male mayhem in an unfair field.  And legal battery has already been done here and come up short.  Dr. Resnick has defended murderers and the mentally ill, but evaluating someone not impaired, who is published impaired' because she's saying that the University & Hillcrest physicians that botched the care, missed the diagnosis, and lied, are as responsible as his murderers  for at least sending the medical records and expert orthopedic consultation?  This is a bit overkill, over dark, and over the psychotic fence.  There's forgiveness, but there's still responsibility and admission of the mistakes so that there can be correction and remuneration  or just getting on with one's life and an end to the mess in a fair and learning way.  REMUNERATION = X IN THE BOX ON THE COMPUTER FORM THAT RETURNS THE MEDICAL LICENSE before 2009.
The problem however, like with most legal cases, is the damages - so I'm impaired because I complained to the State Medical Board that I couldn't get my medical records, or the physicians who had goofed to stop harassing me and saying that I didn't deserve' care.  DO I DESERVE DR. RESNICK, OR MAYBE THAT THE CONFIDENTIAL' FILE BE OPENED AND I BE ALLOWED TO DEFEND MYSELF  AS HIS MURDERERS CAN  AND THAT THERE BE IMPROVEMENTS IN OHIO MEDICAL CARE FOR WOMEN PATIENTS AND PROCEDURAL PROCESSES AT THE STATE MEDICAL BOARD OF OHIO.  Maybe this case needs a different Dr. Resnick  LIGHTNESS VISIBLE  OR AT LEAST SOMETHING TO DO WITH ENLIGHTENMENT?
There's a dark side to my situation and these evaluations; there's huge damage to my psyche and self-confidence, and I shall never have a family or any children  which I deserved.  After these evaluations, you understand suicide, ie why people do it.  Maybe Dr. Resnick should get intrigued by the problem of medical mistakes and what it does to the physician making them and the physician-patient trying to deal with them.  It doesn't need a monograph of 5 different types of ways to destroy the victim, the problem needs mistake laws as in Boston at Harvard Health System  where physicians can admit the mistakes, process the problems and move on without blaming everyone else obsessively for 16 years using psychiatric malpractice.
The Medical Board of Ohio is obsessed with my objecting to the wrong care, my personality, my dates (guys), my letters, my trying to save myself from a sea of insanity and Dr. Resnick's 6th interpretation of why Ohio orthopedics CAN'T cast a fracture or order some blood work.  The want the final Resnick chapter but the final answer: orthopedics in Ohio don't have to do ANYTHING.
This is a tragedy and I'm asking that Dr. Resnick find another way as the Ohio Court of Appeals suggested in 1993.  This was a COLLEAGUE-COLLEAGUE DISAGREEMENT that led to injury of the woman physician, ruining her health and career, and it needs to be solved in another way  with colleague discussion and working together to improve women's medical care in Ohio.  A friend in Rhode Island is willing to recheck the Internal Medicine skills for Recertification by the American College of Physicians, and to help get her back' (me) - this needs to be allowed along with treatment of the bone condition at Massachusetts General Hospital  after all even The Cleveland Clinic can't take the pressure and would leave me to rot and fracture, medical ethics be damned - certain types of drowning are allowed.  Orthopedics get away with Mrs. Yates' behaviors in Ohio many mornings  THE SEDUCTIVE LOGIC OF PSYCHOSIS.  
There were no patient complaints, and there have to be rules about colleague discussions, debate about difficult diagnoses, and less insanity about IMPAIRING the competition,' by votes after drinks at the State Medical Board of Ohio, or whiting-out the unanticipated result.'  I barely exist anymore except as IMPAIRED without explanation, suspended without dignity or defense  holding pattern in the gutter.  
Headline-grabbing killers just get it over with, whereas physicians just try to be the best liar, the more powerful persuader, have more friends,' and hope that the missed diagnosis doesn't last to get treated.  No headlines in my case as the press is bought off by Mrs. Nice.  So, so far that tactic has worked courtesy of missing Dr. Resnick's exclusion, whose mug I've studied and still hope to go-around.  Yet isn't it a bit narcissistic to take such glossy head shots while I continue to struggle; just getting my head above water and saying that I'm sorry to exist and have something rare, but this hardly deserves the punishment of 16 years loss of medical career?  Isn't that detail poignant and horrible or do you have to be seven?  I was 35 when I started fracturing bones and was told that I was just unlucky' and didn't deserve' care if I didn't like Dr. Nice's care.'  
Dalmer wanted partners who would do it his way, but so does THE STATE MEDICAL BOARD OF OHIO and Drs. Nice & Keith (want patients to do it their way).  They just do the abuse legally; with an MD and the blessing of the Ohio State Medical Board.  This is a different kind of necrophilia - an attraction to abuse women physicians that challenge, so that you never have to say your are 'sorry' - because your partner/colleague can't complain or she can't get her medical license back = make the women physicians corpse-like in Ohio.  It's the same Jeffrey Dahmer pleasure-principle, my being 'eaten' by the State Medical Board of Ohio that has bizarre needs/drives, and goes to EXTREMES to fulfill them.  Maybe Dr. Resnick needs to probe the minds and reasoning of his colleagues - certainly a 6th evaluation is an EXTREME MURDER of a psyche.

Dallas, Texas U.S.A. ",,,Dr. Nauman Anwar Quack!!! Dallas Texas,"
										My husband went to Dr. Anwar for the first time about 18 months ago complaining of left side jaw pain. At the time he was a smoker in his early 50's. Dr. Anwar prescribed anti inflammitories and told him it was TMJ as he had indicated to the Dr. that he had suffered from that many years prior. My husband had a massive heart attack a year ago.  I have since learned that left side jaw pain is a symptom of heart disease. I was quite surprised that Dr. Anwar didn't consider this a possibility.
This past weekend my husband discovered blood in his urine. Unfortunately as he had not established himself with a new internist, he went to Dr. Anwar. he was immediately instructed to check into the hospital for tests. That was a three day ordeal in which Dr. Anwar was absent most of the time. He told my husband he had a cyst on his kidney and then came back and said that it was kidney stones. Dr. Anwar had ordered lots of different blood tests but when asked about the blood panel on his liver Dr. Anwar had no idea why he ordered that. when questioned about results of a sonogram and why it didn't show the same kidney stones as the cat scan he said he had no idea. he then tokd my husband that he neede to see a urologist because he did not know the answer to other questions regarding the stones. We were referred to Dr. Rufus Green who was more than anxious to perform 2 different procedures. 
Even if you are dying do not go to Dr. Anwar as he is most definitely just practicing medicine. Maybe he'll figure it out one day. Also you might want to beware of Dr. Green.

										I went to Dr. Sand due to severe stomach pains and bleeding in my stools.He found nothing after a colonoscopy, CAT scan and examination and I'm still having severe problems. His bedside manner is that of a rock and he never spent more than 5 minutes with me during any of my two visits. I feel my time was wasted when I could have gone to a better doctor who would have found what my issues are. Unfortunately, I was still scheduled for a follow up visit. 
On the Friday before the Monday of my visit, I was advised by my employer that I had to go out of town the following week, making it impossible for me to make my appointment.I was told there would be a $25 charge for missing the appointment (even though I gave them three days notice) and that I needed to give them 72 hours notice. I told them to bill me, never intending to pay but to respond with a letter explaining the urgency of my job.My husband got a call from the horrendous office manager for Doc Sand, who informed him they're still owed $25 and they don't bill for ""those services."" 
He told her we had no intention of paying since her work called her out of town suddenly, and she replied ""Oh, then I'll go ahead and forward this right to the collection agency, so they can get it on your credit report right away.""First of all, it is ILLEGAL to make such statements without first speaking to the person responsible (me...the woman was talking to my husband). Secondly, it is ILLEGAL to charge for missed appointments with good reason in the state of Arizona. I called a lawyer. I called her myself and she gave me the same song and dance. I even asked her if my mother died would they charge me and she replied, ""yes, the policy stands."" She then had the nerve to ask it I would like to re-schedule the appointment. Laughable. 
Please...if you value your health and your mental sanity...stay away from this doctor, his crackpot staff and his horrendous policies which do nothing but hurt others and line his pockets. I could go on here about his unorganized billing practices (the proof is the pile of INCORRECT bills piling up on my counter that I'm wading through with the insurance company), but haven't I said enough to convince you to stay away???
