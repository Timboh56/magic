phoenix , Arizona USA ","",  (602) 402-0175,""," I rent rooms in my home, and have done so for years. I made a serious mistake in trusting this man, who seemed to be honest, even though he would talk my ear off, and went on and on about insanely ridiculous stories that I had absolutely no interest in… I had an empty room, and he had some cash, and I let him move in without really trusting my gut feeling, that he might be a problem. I have a washer and dryer that roommates use, and a camera that keeps an eye on the patio where these machines are located. I saw him put a single blue bath towels into the washer, and after the machine cycle was completely done,he added a little more soap, and turn the washer on again, a second washing for a single towel! then, later after he came home he put the towel, all by itself, into the dryer, and proceeded to waste even more gas and electricity to dry it. I took out the towel, knocked on his door, and told him that these machines were designed to handle eight or 10 times as much laundry at once, and would he make sure that he doesn't ever wash a single towel, or any such small load, if he needs more things to wash with his single towel, either wait until he has a full load, or ask me for other laundry items that could fill out the load… I was clearly upset, and he said he would never do it again. two days later he did the same thing, with a couple more small towels, still, about 1/8 of a ""normal load"". because I had the camera footage, I was able to tell him in no uncertain terms that he had better never do this again, as I have it on camera, and he will be kicked out if this ever happens again! I yelled at him.  you're right, – – he did it again just two days later! another single towel., I think he was basically trying to rub it in my face, thinking that he had the right to do anything he wants, even though it is my house. I put him on a one day at a time, with instructions to get out of my house, and he had something else in mind, even after he said he would move out, he persisted and staying, which required me to get him and it fiction notice, and delivered, in writing,so I wasted a lot of time, resources, and he thinks he can pretty much do anything he wants, without recourse. if you are lucky enough to have searched his name and found this report, before renting him a room, or a house, or an apartment, Then I wish you well, if you should decide to go ahead anyway, and rent to this nonstop talk your ear off fool, then you will get what you deserve--as no good deed goes unpunished! I tried to be kind and give this very strange man a break – – as he claimed he had lost his home to some evil bankers and such… I guess that's where my kind heart opened up an allowed this stranger into my house. I will be keeping his deposit, and he has not given me another cent for 13 days and counting, his rent has been unpaid, and I even the police showed up and told me that I would still have to do formal eviction on him, which makes for a very unsavory household while you have a hostile person digging in and refusing to leave, even though they are wasteful, and non-paying     Ain't life grand?

My friend lost his family because she alienated everyone is this wonderful family.  She has three boys that she has given up because she has April to satisfy.  Her one son is a stoner and she buys his drugs? She worked at Mercy Hospital in Sacramento, where I met her as a nurse and our boss that had been a manager for years was fired because she had an affair with him and then turned him in? He had given her sevral thousand dollars and rented her a really nice car and his life ha My friend was arrested for domestic violence and two days later she told me that she had told him she was sorry and had told the police she had made the story up!   She uses her sex appeal to lure men, use them and somehow she has created a trail of broken souls, divorces, arrested and other serious alterations in peoples lives. I heard from my friend that she drove a car without the legal registration, plates or insurance and hit a the car of neighbors son (parked) in June of 2014.  My friend at the hospital recently heard that she said ""F"" him, he can't put me in jail, he can only sue me. Her landlord is from Auburn area Bob Sowl, and the story has it that she is or had an affair with him to get leverage on my friend that rented the house where she lived in Roseville.

When you’re shopping for a holiday gift, looking for a good attorney, a nice place to have dinner or a good hotel, do you pay attention to those online reviews? A lot of people do. After all, most of us put more stock in what regular people have to say about a product or service than we do in company advertising. The reviews can be helpful, but you have to take them with a grain of salt because there’s strong evidence a significant number of online reviews are fake. How does this happen? Company posting phony positive reviews to boost its own business, or a company posting phony positive reviews to hide Regular customers who post negative reviews. It happens all the time. Sallie D.Skipper had 3 reviews in 6 years,then a real review from a real person was posted with negative feedback and in one day it has more reviews than it had in the last 6 years. Business's who post false positive reviews commit fraud. I've forwarded a copy to the Attorney general. Do a google search of positive false reviews.

 Connor Group Atria At Crabtree Valley Apartments ,"  Connor Group Atria At Crabtree Valley Apartments  4601 Baymar Dr 
Raleigh, North Carolina USA ",http://www.atria-apartments.com/, 9197837425,"","  Do yourself a favor and avoid this apartment complex. If you've already put a down payment down forget your money and run as fast as you can. The following is a list of headaches and issues that I had to deal with. 1. When I first visited the apartment I was awed by the woods that surrounded it and the beauty of driving back off of route 70. I thought it was perfect (my first mistake). When I put down a down payment I was told that the pet fee would be a $300.00 one time fee. When we moved in it became a $250.00 one time fee and $30.00 a month every month. Big difference from a one time fee of $300.00. 2. I really wanted a view of the woods and the running trail. So they gave us that view but the apartment they put us into to had mold covering the walls in the master bed room closet. When we said this won't do, they said move in and we can make the repairs later. They obviously didn't know that exposure to mold can significantly affect ones health(http://www.cdc.gov/mold/dampness_facts.htm) They tried to tell us they didn't have any other apartments in this size, we told them we would take a 2 bedroom for the same price and suprise, suprise they found a one bedroom in the size and layout we originally wanted. 3.I scraped a knife on the counter top by accident and it was damaged. I requested that they fix the damage. They said no problem, remove everything from the counter top, we will come in and sand the counter then reapply paint and a sealer, give it 12 hours and then you can use the counter top again. I said that's fine, I don't mind the wait, after all I damaged the counter-top. So they came in and sanded the counter top, and then painted it before realizing that they didn't have the required sealer to complete the job. A month later they were able to complete the work, in the meantime countless plates, pots and pans were stained by the black paint on the counter top. 4. Wood roaches/water bugs/fast moving disturbing looking creatures inside the apartment. 5.First Billing. This is a scam, you are led to believe that by them bundling all your normal utility costs they're saving you money. They're not. What is normally included in your rent is piled on top of it in a totally seperate bill that you must pay online before your allowed to pay your rent. This bill is for water, water usage, sewer, sewer usage, trash charge (for the one dumpster on their property, they don't pick it up at your door, and it's usually overflowing with trash.) Stormwater, Sanitation Fee (I'm already paying sewer twice and trash so it gets redundant), Recycle admin fee (I'm happy to pay as long as we are saving the environment), and your internet and cable bundle which is always $99.99. Normally this bill adds up to anywhere between $180.00 to $200.00. Don't forget that you pay a seperate bill for electric, gas, and a fee to TWC if you want an HD box. 6.Renewing the lease. They sent one of their revolving attendents into survey the apartment and present me with an offer to stay in that apartment. The person asked me how this process went, and what she was suppossed to do. I told her this was the first time I've had this done, I assumed they would have trained you to do this. They hadn't. Then they made me an offer of $937.00 a month in rent to stay in my current apartment. This cost didn't include the pet rent fee of $30.00 a month, which she didn't mention to me until I looked at her papers and said so my total rent per month would be $967.00? $208.00 more than what I'm paying now? (I know rent goes up each year you stay in an apartment but $200.00?) Then she said well we can cut you a deal if you sign today, with pet rent it will be $937.00 a month. I said no thank you, I'll look else where and I did. Meanwhile a new renter moved in across the hall and above us a level his rent, $748.00 a month. Yet I was going to pay $937.00? Turns out he knew one of the many workers in the office and got a special discount. More power to him, and if you have that special arrangement consider these apartments if you can get past all the other issues. 7. When I decided to move out and informed the office of my intentions with a letter that I requested they sign (they did), they begged me to stay. I told them if they would have made an offer that kept my rent the same or decreased it I would consider. They said sorry we can't do that. Then a week before I move out they tell me that I can pay the same in rent and we will knock $250.00 off the first month because of your down payment on your new place. I reflected on the previously listed reasons and declined their offer politely. 8. One week after I move out I recieve a letter from the Atria at Crabtree Valley. In it is my apartment inspection, there was nothing wrong with it, as well as two bills. The first bill was for First Billing, an exorbant amount because aparently some of my services are billed a month behind. I regret not saving the first bill I got from this service to double check that statement. The second bill was for $10.10 for pet fee. When I called to find out what this was about, I was told it wasn't included in my final rent payment. I asked how could that be? You told me my total rent cost for a shortened month and I paid it, I paid you final amount and now you want to charge me more? (Yes, its only $10 but after all the frustration I didn't want to pay it,) I told the manager that I thought this was illeagal and that I would consult with a lawyer. She said she wasn't going to argue with me about the bill, and then hung up the phone on me. When your no longer living there they don't care about you. If you like the apartment and you already live there, enjoy it, you maybe one of the lucky ones. If you considering moving in, run away as fast as you can, it is as close to hell as I can imagine. You might find a better apartment and apartment management in Iraq. ",  Attorneys General

I paid all utilities on time. I gave the required move out notice. My contract says that Bruno Inc has 30 days after I move out to return my Security Deposit. Apparently they refuses to do so. It's been nearly 60 days now and have received nothing. I contacted anoter renter that moved out just prior to me and he said they have'nt returned his either.  In investigating I think I understand why. Louisana imposes No penalties against Landlords for not returning rental deposits. IF they are taken to court they will only be ordered to pay or return the original amount of the deposit. They have nothing to lose by not returning it and then wait to see if your going to pursue legal action against them. If you do and they lose then their not out any extra monies except maybe court cost and figuring that maybe only one in ten renters will pursue legal action to get their deposit back then they are saving a lot of money. I might add that when I looked up Civil Courts of New Orleans, one of the Judges is a Christopher Bruno. I was curious if he is related to Joshua Bruno of Bruno Inc. ",  Attorneys General

But after telling them my single mom financial status, I was given to Shawn Bunyard. His initial meeting was mostly spent on trying to figure out the assets. He actually appeared to get excited if it seemed like there was money to be had. Once I hired him (against my better judgement but with the reassurance he would be meeting weekly with Linda who would oversee his work), I realized what a mistake I made. Papers were not filed to the court on time, I would rarely get responses concerning important matters, and he mumbled in the courtroom and made horrible decisions. I ended up worse than when I started (when I didn't have a lawyer!).  After a devastating court hearing, I sent an email asking Shawn Bunyard what happen and why things went so horribly wrong. I got no response for 10 days, but in those 10 days, I somehow managed to accumulate $2000 in fees. His firm lied about not receiving a check that they had received and only confessed when I told them I had a copy of the canceled check. We parted ways in February, but I did not receive a final statement (despite asking several times) until end of April!!!!! Shawn Bunyard also was friendly with opposing counsel and unprofessionally discussed my case with her (found out because my ex told me things he should not have known!).  One day in the court room hall, I met a man who had used Shawn as well. I asked him why he no longer used his services, and he said he could not afford him anymore, his money disappeared too quickly.  Shawn would also brag about how he and several psychologists such as Bob Cassinova, Ph.D. had ""an understanding"" showing me his elbow, like they were buddy buddy and would work towards serving each other's clients. This seemed very dishonest on his part.   He is a very scheemy lawyer, that does not really take a personal interest in your case, but more so in your wallet, and in conning other professionals in the field to get what he wants.

The substitute attorney could not object and told me to inform erik. When I informed Erik he said he was not happy with the DA but never corrected the matter.  This is a Federal Due Process Violaton against the Defendant. Then Erik asked me to waive my rights at the hearing I told him I would not do so. He got mad and said he would waive them for me.

Cold Spring Harbor, New York, New York USA ","", 6316920247,""," Bruce Hafner and the board of fire ccommissioners have taken it upon themselves to cancel the health insurance of five retirees that have worked for the district for over 30 years. Each of these men have serious health issues and depend on their health insurance. They were hired in the 1970's and a district handbook states that the employees and their families would receive health insurance for the rest of their lives. In January of 2014, the board of fire commissioners decided to cancel the health insurance for the retirees. This is the thanks they received for the many years of hard work and service they have done for the district. It was more important for Mr. Hafner to purchase $130,000 worth of heart monitoring equipment that was not needed, then to pay for the insurance for the retired employees that was promised to them. The residents of the district should also be concerned that Commissioner Hafner, an EMTCC attempted to revive a young man that was obviously dead for a few hours and in rigor before the EMT's arrived at the scene.

I was in a car wreck 2 years ago, (04/17/2012-03/27/2014) and I am still waiting to get paid. Allstate paid them 3 weeks ago, the check cleared, but for some BS reason I'm still waiting for my money like a bum. I am tired of calling them just to get sent straight to voicemail, tired of them never returning my calls, tired of hearing lame standard lies and responses from them. As much crap as I've been fed from them throughout the years, I should be a well qualified candidate to work at that joke of a law firm. The reason they claim my case took so long is because the company we were suing went bankrupt, therefore, the process changes and drags on. Not to mention, they lost my file, misplaced my MRI reports, (which I had to go get personally From DFW MRI), and continuously did their best to dish out their premium grade A Bull crap to me. I went to their Quacks on Jefferson St. only to have them tell me ""drink plenty of water, watch your movements, and see you tomorrow"". And their doctor Farley, who by the way has since ""quit"", was an even bigger disgrace, advising me to put ice on a fractured ankle so it would heal. How insulting and incompetent these freaks were. Like some bums off the streets just came in and put labcoats on trying to play doctor all of sudden. I quit going to therapy after it was doing my herniated disk more harm than good. It was as if they were purposely aggravating my injuries in order to goad me into going to surgery to get more money from the insurance company, and all at my bodies' expense of course. Oh, and boy were they quick to recommend I go under the knife as if there was no other alternative. It was all very surreal. I kept wondering and looking around for Ashton Kutcher to come around the corner any minute and kick me in my ass and scream in my face ""you've been punked!"" Atleast then I would've understood all the subhuman treatment and despicable customer service from these crooks. All in all on a scale from 1 to 2, I would rate this ""Flaw Firm"" a -100.

 Ronald S. Clement ,"  Ronald S. Clement  8 Williams Street,  
Greenville, South Carolina USA ",www.ronclement.com, ,""," This is not necessarily a rip-off report as much as it is raising a question. My niece hired Mr. Clement to represent her in court for a child custody case recently and although the judge's decision may not have been affected, my understanding is that Mr. Clement was not very vocal in bringing out things that would have have at least shed more negative light on the opponent. Although I was not able to attend the hearing, my understanding is that when challenged about his representation, Mr. Clement's response was that and I paraphrase, ""the information was all in the documents"". I will not say either way whether my niece was ripped off or not, but I will say that I hear all the time, that attorneys are paid lots of money, and then seem very non-chalant in the courtroom. If, I hire you, I want to be made to feel like you are trying to rescue me, as though I am hanging from a cliff by a frayed wire. In a life or death situation, there is emotion, there is urgency, there is an extreme effort to do what ever you can to make a difference for the person who is hanging by a thread. According to what I am being told, Mr. Clement showed no signs of being aggressive for his client. It was just another day in the court room. When I go to a restaurant and I PAY for service, if I do not like the service, I can send my order back and ask to have it prepared to my liking. It seems that there is no recourse for clients of attorneys whose service is not up to par for the client. If you are not satisfied with the emotion an attorney puts into a case, then you should have some recourse to ask for money back. I know it is all subjective, but this is my feeling on the matter. Mr. Clement may be a good attorney but for my niece, it appears that he showed no real effort to make a difference for her. Whether or not he felt anything would have made a difference, I believe he could have at least made a show, and brought out vocally some of the negative things about the opponent.

Prior to this event, my father was in the hospital the month before, we went to go visit my mother who suffers from Alzeimers & Dementia, she's been known to wander the parking lot of the apartment complex.  While visiting my mother, there was a altercation between Ms. Cockerham & my mother.  Ms. Cockerham jumped up off the loveseat, attacked my mother on the couch.  Choking, punching & rolling up a magazine that she was hitting my mother over the head.  Then Eva said ""Call the police, call the police"".  She said ""nevermind, that could ruin my law career.""  She has a peace order against her from a woman in Dundalk, Md. How can she have this and still become a lawyer?  She had to go & speak to the bar committee.  They questioned her about the peace order and anything else that would stop her from becoming a lawyer.  She threaten me & said if I told anyone about her past violent behavior, what she did to my mother & father, when she was previously married, her husband threatened to leave her, she admitted to me that they got into a heated argument of him leaving, she smashed a wedding picture, & set the bed on fire while he was sleeping.  Later on that night, she was going to take the gun, kill her husband, her children and herself.  There are other things, that I choose not to discuss.  To me, its very apparent, her mental state is questionable & should NOT be practicing law anywhere.  She discriminates against, ethnic groups, making comments about ""white trash"" etc.  I have kept this to myself, but my conscience will not allow this to be kept secret.  My mother is on stage 3 hospice care, close to dying.  Ms. Cockerham continues to harass me contacting me, asking me where I am at, what I'm doing.  I find this very un-professional.  I have asked her to stop contacting me, which she continues.   She has called attorneys ruin cases for me, she seems to have this personal vendetta against me.  I'm at a loss as to what to do.  Do I call her boss to make a complaint?  Do I report her to the state bar?  What can I do?  I need help!!!!!!

Michael Tiedemann, 48, whose last known address was in Hudson NH, was charged with four counts of first-degree sexual assault and one count each of third-degree sexual assault and disorderly conduct. Tiedemann was held on bail of $250,000, pending an appearance in Manchester Superior Court slated for May 31. The woman told police on April 26 that Tiedemann had arrived at her apartment unannounced two days before, according to an arrest warrant affidavit. The two had recently had a dispute over rent, and after learning that the woman was communicating with a lawyer, Tiedemann became angry, the warrant says. Tiedemann grabbed the woman, shook her, tore off a necklace she was wearing and threw wine from a glass into her face, the warrant says. During the struggle, the woman ripped Tiedemann's shirt. Police said they seized the shirt, which was stained with what appeared to be wine, corroborating that part of the woman's story, the warrant says. She also had scratches on her chest consistent with her account that Tiedemann ripped away her necklace, police said. Tiedemann, who apparently had a key to the apartment, left, but returned about an hour later and forced himself on the woman several times, the warrant says. The document describes Tiedemann as 5 feet 11 inches tall, weighing 250 pounds, and the victim as 5 feet, 3 inches tall, weighing about 130 pounds. ""At some point, victim noted that she just gave up trying to push him off of her,"" the warrant says.

I met the corporate executive from I believe an Indonesia  telecom who was appalled at how AT&T conducted business.This is a million dollar customer and he was treated very badly unfortunately.He explained how he consistently was being lied to by AT&T and that he has lost over  100,000 . I was very sympathetic to his plead because I know that he's not lieing. I went back to my manager Betty Day to ask if we can do something to help resolve his issue, she was very unconcern and basically brushed it off with telling me to send him right back to square 1 which would amount to nothing.Sadly, that customer dropped AT&T and went to another company that treated him with the dignity and respect that he deserved.

In the middle of October, we had been house shopping, and were ready to put in an offer.  I went into the office at the end of October to see exactly what day the end of our lease was.  At that point was when we found out we had a 12 month lease.  I told them that is not what we had signed up for, and I went and found the original paperwork that said 6 months.  They pulled out the lease and said the original paper wasn't a binding contract.  The lease they had us sign later had been changed to a 12 month lease.  I'm actually assuming the office manager didn't mean to put 12 month in there and screw us, but neither her or I caught the mistake and it was done. I went back in and talked to the office staff, who told me the lady that had us sign the lease conveniently no longer worked there.  I asked what we could do to get this changed because we had absolutely no intentions of staying for 12 months.  I was told I could talk to the corporate manager, and left 3 messages for her with no returned phone calls.  I went back to the office and told them that I wasn't getting a call back and they said the VP of the company would be giving me a call that day.  I had to call the office three days in a row before hearing from the VP.  After speaking to the VP, she told me there wasn't anything she would do, and threatened if I tried to get out of the lease, they would take me to court and get it on my credit record.  She later told me she would try to get a hold of the original lady in the office to see if she remembered the original conversation and she would get back to me.  Needless to say, she never called me back.

omaha, Select State/Province USA ","", ,"","  I am dissapointed in the mindset of masses of people that elevate their lives on traditional values that are extended habits that rise security and joy to use products, meet friends, follow trends, wear what the villagers make acceptable.   However, the stone age would still be the present and the future if risk was not employed to risk creating new life lines of luxurious living, work trends, and social trends.   Breaking away from the same coffee table that one has used with others for years, and go to a coffee house takes faith, adventure and open minded expectations of something unsure.  If we did not evolve, there would be no evolution of humankind. To live on a planet that rests amongest the stars in the middle of nine other huge spoeeding planets and a ball of fire that is unexplainable is enough to make me apprciate how little I am. It makes me aware of a factor that is amazingly incredable and extreme for brilliant minds to try and grasp even with PHD's in excelled science.  There are those that live to survive and adhere to comfort and traditions for their entire lives.  There are few that live mentally in a wonderous space where exploration of things seen, heard, smelled, felt, tasted, or touched become pivital points of seeking answers to unknow horizons. Most creators and inventors excell in the unknown developing visions into reality that often make their way into the hands and homes of users worldwide. Now, the down end.  Most potentially good to great additions to our lives never come to fruition, because of the lacking of finance.  In most cases finances are provided by close friends or relatives.  However, if the creator or inventor stumbles along the way or encounters failure while still in the test tube stage, some supporters stress expecting faster returns.  In many cases, human instinct sets adversity into play and negative enery enters the door.  If the adversity expands for long, the creators and supporters become anxious, and at times enraged with the situation. In the past these issues were handled by lawyers and if necessay by courts.  In the day, we have the FREE FLOW internet where explosive situations can become overwhelming and painful. Before you realize, hundreds of bloggs surface one person against another and one day someone that the people know comes across on goggle.  The reader is usually shocked and very bad quetional caharater qualities may be quetioned by the readers. In some cases a brilliant creation can be killed and the supporters that came against the creator cut of their own noses to spite their faces.  They take all credability away from the project and its creator. Thus, buyers won't touch the prject and usually the project dies from the attacks and both the creator and the supporters lose.  This is my input on a great guy that created one of the most brilliant products in this era.  However, a handful of weak people ruined the ability for over a hundred investors to see the project sell as it could have.  Then the creator is called a ""Conartist"" or ""Scammer"". Neither is true, the creator was 100% on track and a handful of idiots tore the track out, pre-judging him, prosecuting him, and sentencing him. This posting is an educational post to helpfully educate the persons that caused the loss of the projects evolution and vertually robbed their friends from getting returns on their investments, I can tell you that the creator continued to dedicate his talents to complete all of the ienvisioned products,  But, getting them to market and make money for them is very slim, because his name and products are trashed in the eyes of the worlds media producers and distributors of education and entertainment products for Children. The creator is Mr. Ottis and his brilliant product line is completed and extremely beautiful with amazing opportunities to begin a new era in childrensa products.   Unfortunately, an Eagle soaring in the Trade winds that lands on a Desert floor wher he sees a little earth worm cannot express his wonderful experience, because the worm has no ability to comprehend the Eagles flight.

I was informed it did go out in march only to be returned because they left off my apartment number. Then I was told because they left my apartment number off I had to fill out a change of address form and that the form and check were in the mail by a company manager who Iasked to speak to . Now this was in April of this year I didn't,t receive this form to fill out for almost three months and of course I ended moving town months later. I called about a month after they received the letter to be told that the check was in the mail and I called a week after that to be told i never spoke to a supervisor and that supposed supervisor did not care that an employee lied to me about being a supervisor And of course the check is in the mail. When I did move in August I was told I could just give them the address over the phone and. I did to be told the check is in the mail. Now I found out they sent the check again to the old address so it has to be re issued and I might receive it by December wow I,m still waiting for the post card saying I would receive a check . when I called the office of the controller of the currency to complain  told given a case number and told the group that would help me would call me and when I do get a call its from rust incorporated the same people I have the complaint about and they tell me the checks in the mail. What's the point of having a complaint line through the occ. another part of this mess is I was divorced and my last name changed so I sent rust incorporated a prof of name change along with my case number and another personnel information twice now to the address they provided by there of their employees on three separate occasion this required bying stamps and paying for proof of my name change at my local court house. Only to find out that the address they gave out was wrong and I never received any of it. Now they want me to send another form I told them to stick it.

 Blount County Police ,"  Blount County Police  930 East Lamar Alexander Pkwy 
Maryville, Tennessee USA ",http://blountccc.com, 865-273-5450,""," WARNING - DO NOT CALL 9-1-1 unless you are prepared to go to jail! Only Blount County would think of establishing a policy like ""whenever 9-1-1 is called, someone WILL be arrested."" Unaware of this moronic and short-sighted policy, which gives the police way too much power and basically ensures the Attorney General maintains a bottomless caseload with the accompanying increase in income, I called Blount County 9-1-1 for help with my schizophrenic daughter. I am a 61 year old woman with a 32-year old daughter who has been diagnosed with paranoid delusional schizophrenia. She had balled up her fist and was about to strike me, which is why I called 9-1-1. After I made the call, my daughter calmed down so I got into my car and drove home, phoning 9-1-1 on the way to cancel the emergency. I had no idea the Blount County police have a policy that someone must be arrested whenever 9-1-1 is called! My daughter was angry with me for taking back my coffee table, but that was a personal family matter, not a police matter. Unaware that my daughter had accused me of domestic assault (she claimed in one story that I picked her up--she weighs 230 lbs.--and threw her off of the coffee table, and in another story that I picked her AND the 54 lb. coffee table up and flipped her and the table over. Never mind that I am a 61 year old woman and could not possibly lift her, much less her and the coffee table.), I told the 9-1-1 dispatcher and the police that I saw no reason to return to my daughter's apartment since the emergency had passed and I was in the middle of moving into a condo and had a thousand things to do. I have made similar calls to 9-1-1 over the years for help with my daughter and NEVER had the officer order me to return to the scene without any explanation of why. Within an hour, I was shocked to find myself surrounded by police cars in the driveway of my new condo with all of my neighbors looking on as I was arrested for domestic assault, placed in handcuffs, and hauled away to jail for the first time in my life. I was released the following night on my own recognizence, but I am now facing criminal charges and possible incarceration for a crime I did not commit based on a lie from a known paranoid delusional schizophrenic. Now my son won't speak to his sister or brother-in-law, so this is tearing my family apart. If I am convicted of this, I will no longer be able to help my daughter who is also blind, diabetic, and married to a lazy, abusive pothead who has lived off of her Section 8 and SSI for years though he earns $50,000 a year. She is nothing but a free meal ticket to him, and he makes her go without her insulin and medications until she is so sick she has to be hospitalized, out of her mind and defacating on herself. This is unconscionable! At the initial hearing, my muscular 31 year old son told his sister in Mike Flynn's presence that he could not lift her and the coffee table and flip them over without difficulty, so he knows I couldn't do it, so it is obvious her story is a lie. Mike Flynn quickly hurried my daughter and her useless husband away from her brother. Mike Flynn's motivation for pushing my daughter to go to trial no matter the price to me or my family is that he only gets paid when a case goes to trial. The police and the attorney general are supposed to serve their community, not put innocent citizens in jail!!! Blount County citizens must demand that this unjust, arbitrary policy of putting someone in jail whenever 9-1-1 is called be stricken and removed from policy. This policy is unjust, wastes the tax payer's dollars, and needlessly destroys the reputation and livelihood of innocent citizens. Mike Flynn and Hatcher, who signed the arrest warrant, should be tarred and feathered and run out of town on a rail. ",  Attorneys General

 James LEA III esquire ,"  James LEA III esquire   
wilmington , North Carolina USA ","", ,"","  Well we hired him based off the rep he had as a good lawyer, for a child custody case were the child was kidnapped and he did very little for the case. The other party in the case made up some very large lies and slanderd us without a shred of evidence. Mr Lea did nothing to defend us or to have the false reports removed from the court record and was only concerned with his paycheck. he refused to work with our other attorney or do his job. He did not even do much about enforcement of court orders or anything. He almost cost us custody of our child and did nothing about the other party showing up to court under the influence of drugs, would not go on the offensive when the other party lost leagle representation, wasted our money, and above all did nothing to earn his pay. It was as if we were subhumans because we did not live there but argued that the jurisdiction was there even though it was not and he even aided and abetted the other parties in the case instead of pushing for criminal charges or to have the case dismissed. The sad thing is that we could of and should of saved our money and defended ourselves instead of getting our time 3 years and money wasted by this pathetic excuse for a human and even more pathetic lawyer. After he refused to do the job he was paid for we stopped paying him and doing what he insisted we do after he set it up that he would have jurisdiction for any further action. While the fact of the matter is we did not reside in Wilmington in a few years but they had jurisdiction, a minor child was kidnapped from her home state and brought to Wilmington and a custody case opened against us by the kidnappers. They refused to accept depositions from teachers and law enforcement, but anything that was alleged by the kidnapers who reside ed in Wilmington was taken as fact with zero proof or evidence to prove anything was taken as truth. James lea needs to be disbarred, face criminal charges for his obvious thefts from clients without doing any work for his money. He is a greedy bottom feeder that only cares about himself and how much money he can get out of his clients without doing any real work. The man also has a serious attitude problem when the clients expect results for the thousands of dollars he charges but has very little to show for his work. But finds it to be just fine to argue with his clients over his lack of effort for the case he thinks he won but the fact is the other party gave up because they ran out of money. Not his pathetic legal skills he thinks he has or the work he did not do. A circus monkey could have done a better job and that we could have saved a ton of money and done a better job representing ourselves than he did. We have not paid him what he says we owed him and have no intention since he did nothing to defend his clients and was more concerned with the reputations of the lowlife locals that should be in prison for the felonies that they commited and we have not been back to that corrupt prostitute infested tourist trap of a town in almost a decade and have no intention of it. When the legal system has zero justice and the so called top lawyers are no more than high priced simpleton crooks. When a legal system can railroad, and treat the innocent as guilty with zero supporting evidence but the guilty criminals are protected by the courts it says avoid the place because if your not a resident you have no rights and are guilty because your an outsider. You are doomed and might as well do the time because you are guilty before innocent when you are not allowed to defend yourself from the alligations of a coke head and a drunken nut. I will never go back there and would not trust old Jimmy to take care of a ticket ir represent my dog. infact other lawyers that looked at the case could not find much that he did except rip us off and waste our time on top of developing a sever mistrust and disgust for the redneck rivearia town of Wilmington that is stuck in the 1600s If I knew what I know now back than I never would have moved there and I would never would have called that incompetent bum James Lea III for legal representation since he did nothing but help himself to thousands of our hard earned dollars and I hope that he loses his license or just stops practicing law because he does nothing for the pay he thinks he is worth but is delusional to think he is worth more than minimum wage. I do think that we are lucky that we did not get taken for more money but when he does nothing for his inflated ego that matches his pay not his skill. they are a pathetic excuse for a lawyer and at that point he was considered to be one of the best in town and that is sad that in Wilmington he is what passes as an excellent lawyer when a public defender would have done a better job than his lazy greedy bs in a high priced suit that rarely returned calls except to ask for more money.

Due to this they decided to move out of the property, and left the lawn unmowed with weeds growing every where.

When I was told this I advised how can you tell someone who does not want the unmaintained properties weeds in their yard, that no they are not going to be reimbursed for trying to ensure those weeds are not being spread into their own yard if no one from their company will come to maintain it. This company does not give a S((( about anyone unless you are giving them money, sorry yet last I knew homes are generally in communities like we are in, and none of the neighbors will generally want the unmaintained property spilling over to their own property. Hope that the majority of the employees of this company have to experience a neighbor being foreclosed on, and the property not being maintained - so that they can feel a little more for others, and understand most other mortgage companies will pay individuals the measily $20 to take care of the maintenance when it is a need, yet they are one of the only that feels they should not have to do so.......

He sold me a laptop for $1,500.00 that my business associate and I had to take to the Geek Squad for inspection because we could not get it to work.  They said the mother board was fried.  I asked Darrell for my money back and he refused.  The website he created for our company was a domain name and the uploading of a DVD that contained the web files from my company’s former web site.  Hardly a $20,000.00 job he reports in his bogus web blogs. I have operated my business for fifteen (15) years after twehty three (23)years in mainstream media where I did meet, work and or associate with numerous celebrities, sports figures and politicians.      Since 1998, I have created and produced numerous products for my Globee project including a complete set of professional theatrical costumes for every character of the Solar System.  I have published three beautiful children's books, one interactive childs game on DVD, two animated cartoon stories on DVD, a thirty minute television pilot, soft toy dolls and I have donated time and money to several non-profit organizations in Nebraska.  (See products below) My credentials are solid and provable through numerous family and friends that go back to 1973.  The adverse blogs began with a former employee that was fired. The person was institutionalized at a mental (Richard Young’s) facility three times, four suicide attemptes, burnt a house down while the father was asleep in the house and was restrained from being with grandchildren because of abusive conduct. This persons bloggs were followed by another terminated employee that took $60,000.00 out of a $250,000.00 company bank deposit.  The retaliation for being terminated included adding adverse and false postings against me on the internet along with the prior posting.  The more my associates and I responded to the postings in defense, the more the malicious, derogatory, and erroneous postings appeared under  anonymous and factitious names.   It became a battle. On October 18, 2007, my lawyer filed a suit in The Nebraska Federal Court to force Darrell Purdue, the other known bloggers to court.  I intended to force them in front of a federal judge to provide evidence to back their lies, or to expose themselves as liars and frauds before the Judge. Knowing that their posted information would prove to be lies and fraud, I intended bring suits against them and ask the courts for damages for  millions of lost revenues due to their sabatogging me/Globee.  I have the mraket anyalisis in conjunction with PriceWaterhouseCoppers to validate potential earnings and probable losses of revenue due to their tort of my business by means of malicious and intentional fraud.  I planned to place liens of their homes, banks, wages and other assets.  Plaintiff:   J.   Paul Ottis   Defendants:   Internet   Bloggers and Does 1-10               Filed:   October   18, 2007       Court:   Nebraska   District Court   Office:   4   Lincoln Office   County:   Douglas   Presiding   Judge:   Senior   Judge Warren K. Urbom   Referring   Judge:   Magistrate   Judge David L. Piester       Nature   of Suit:   Torts   - Injury - Assault, Libel, and Slander   Cause:   18:1962   Racketeering (RICO) Act   Jurisdiction:   Diversity   Jury   Demanded By:   Plaintiff      My suit was dropped at the time due to the lack of laws governing content on the Internet. The case cited was the Megan Meier death of 2006.  Where a thirteen year old school girl was being stalked and manipulated with lies and acts of fraud on the Internet by a 43 year old female neighbor pretending to be Megan’s boyfriend.   Megan killed herself, and the 43 year old woman could not be prosecuted for causing Megan’s death. However laws are changing and perhaps a door will open for folks like me to prosecute scum like Darrell Purdue and the other bloggers in our files.  I have over one hundred family members, friends, business associates and financial supporters that continue to praise my work and applaud my tenacity for not quitting against the endless lies of despicable people.   Globee is a passion fueled by my spirit to serve God.  It is obvious to me that the visions and products are amazing and that Satan has gathered weak and evil minded beings to assist his attacks on me and my work.   But, God will prevail.  My friends and family deserve to see a return on their invested time and money.  Children deserve and meed the LOVE, KNOWLEDG and HOPE that Globee gives them for safer and better world.  In the past two years I have had five bypasses, three strokes and two cancer removals.  But, I continued to work daily. I just attended the 2013 Film and Television Licensing Convention. I am tired of demented malicious minds like Darrell Purdue and recently Darrells friend, a woman named Theresa Cassidy president of Catena Creations whom I have never met, posting horrible things about me.  What BS, she is so liable.   I would not do business with a person like Thresa Cassidy for all the money in China.  One minute she is excited to work with you and the next she burns you alive never meeting you or opening her eyes to options that may hold truth and honor. I t reminds me the person that eats poop based on “Fly’s Eating poop, believing that One Million Flies Can’t Be Wrong”.  And Darrell Purdue “Mr. Righteous”, may end up in jail, it’s against the law to threaten killing someone, especially in writing and posting it on the Internet.  Darrell, you posted that “I should be shot in the head”.   I take your post as a serious threat on my life and a danger to my family.  I intend to prosecute you.  BELOW ARE SAMPLES OF MY WORK AND PRODUCTS:  I AM SO PROUD OF THEM   The Earth ●The Sun ●The Moon &  The Planets of our  Solar System GWE, Inc. is marketing our fully developed characters, and product rights to accredited sources to get them to the world.

It might be misleading but what would our system be if you were not able to mislead someone.The ""Pick Up Order"" On 9/22/2011 I went to my sons school to pick him up. Angela Gardner interfered. The police were called. Both attorneys were called. Wayne P. Kristall told the police officer that I did not have my ""Pick Up Order"" and without it, I had no legal right to pick up my son.

Cincinatti , Ohio USA ","", ,""," JERRY BAHLE – ABUSER OF DISABLES CUTOMERS – BAKERS OMAHA NE WARNING:  Jerry Bahle is an UNSCRUPULOUS - RIPOFF MANAGER of Bakers at 156th and Dodge in Omaha, Nebraska.   He was reportedly transferred to the Bellevue Nebraska Bakers store for reason of questionable ethics and conduct. On a personal record, I have a friend that works at the old store that reported Mr. Bahle is not respected by most of his employee’s. He is known for manipulative manners and dishonesty as their boss. My friend told me about one costumer that he has known for years that Mr. Bahle abused and ripped off for significant finances. The elderly male suffered major heart problems as a disabled Veteran and had open heart surgery.  While the man was recovering the doctors placed him on a turkey diet for lean protein.  However, Bakers/Kroger’s/Dillon’s (all owned by the same corporation) was in the national news for knowingly selling contaminated turkey for weeks after they discovered the contamination.  The man was provided with copies of his buying an estimated ten and half (10.5 lbs.) of contaminated products over a ten week period while he was in recovery.  He placed a claim with Bakers and their insurance company (Sedgwick CMS) per their direction and three years have passed without any response from Bakers or Sedgwick, not even an apology. Mr. Bahle persuaded the man to write and publish a children’s book exclusively for KROGERS national chain of 2,900 stores.  The man followed Mr. Bahles directions and published the book, produced the in store displays, and produced professional photographs for marketing and advertisements for KROGGERS and BAKERS.  He has not been paid for his book even after making demands from the KROGGER CEO MR. Dillon. He was ripped off while recovering from open heart surgery to do the work and was screwed by Mr. Bahle and the Bakers/Kroger Company for over $11,000.00. Due to his seeking compensation and taking action against Mr. Bahle, Bakers and Kroger’s, he became a target of ill- actions by Mr. Bahle. The man’s wife comes from long history of family working at Bakers in management.  She worked at Mr. Bahles store and even had access to the safe to close the store.  She was family with many of the employee’s at Mr. Bahles store.  She is certified as 100% disabled and recently stopped after having an MRI at a nearby hospital for a few groceries.  She could not get her Visa ATM card to read; neither could the employee at the check stand.  She knew that her husband was waiting in the car right outside the front door.  She pushed her basket halfway out the door and walked over to her husband sitting in the car to ask for his help.  She was followed out by two employees and Mr. Bahle and Mr. Bahle accused her of shoplifting.  He called the Omaha Police and filed charges against her.  She had never even had a speeding ticket prior to Mr. Bahles false prosecution.  Her lawyers told her that Mr. Bahles actions were personal retribution for her husband’s letters and demands.  According to employees, Mr. Bahle also has questionable conduct with female employees and remarks to female customers. It seems reasonable to warn citizens to beware while shopping at Bakers and or any Kroger’s brand store.  The issues in this complaint began at Mr. Bahles store, however, written notice was sent to Kroger’s corporate CEO and NOTHING has been provided to the man or his wife, not even an apology.   It seems that Kroger’s feels their annual earnings set them above delivering human decency. If you have any information to add against Mr. Bahle, Bakers and or any KROGGERS brand store, please post it. Victims Defense Network USA     ",  Attorneys General

										Greetings to the American people:
We are the National Committee Against Judicial Corruption (NCAJC), and are asking you to join us in this fight to overturn and stop the State of Colorado's Illegal Mandatory Parole Laws. We encourage you to stage protest at the Colorado State Capitol Building, as well as to write your representative in Washington and voice your concern with these illegal laws that place all of us at risk of having a future destroyed U.S. Constitution.
This is a Petition to the Federal government of the United States as well as the Colorado State Governor and Legislature to issue an order to declare that the Colorado Mandatory Parole Act, Title 18-1.3-401, violates the ""Separation of Powers"" provision of ArtIcle III of the Colorado Constitution and the United States Constitution and therefore, the sentencing of Mandatory Parole imposed upon the American people is an illegal and/or Unconstitutional Sentence. In support of such Relief, we submit the following Claims and Arguments:CLAIM FOR RELIEF:
We, the (NCAJC), in defense of the American people, claim and argue that Title 18-1.3-401, The Colorado Mandatory Parole Act Violates the ""Separation of Powers"" provision of Article III of the Colorado Constitution and the United States Constitution.
Title 18-1.3-401, the Colorado Mandatory Parole Act, makes it absolutely mandatory that the Sentencing Judge impose a term of Mandatory Parole to run Consecutively to any imposed term of imprisonment, and the respective sentencing judges do not have the authority and discretion as to whether to suspend or to actually impose a sentence of Mandatory Parole, or to order said term of Mandatory Parole to run Concurrently with the term of imprisonment. The (NCAJC) claims and argues that this Mandatory Sentencing Violates the ""Separation of Powers"" provision of the Colorado Constitution and also the United States Constitution.
In United States vs. Klein, 80 US (13 Wall) 128, 147, 20 L. Ed. 519 (1871), the United States Supreme Court proclaimed: ""It is the intention of the Constitution that each of the great co-ordinate departments of government --- the LEGISLATURE, the EXECUTIVE, and the JUDICIARY --- shall be, in its sphere, independent of the others.""Now in Hadix vs. Johnson, 144 F. 3d 925, 943 (6th Cir., 1998) the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit declared: ""The Judiciary's fulfillment of its Article III responsibilities requires at its core, meaningful judicial decision making."" See United States vs. Rojas, 53 F. 3d 1212, 219 (9th Cir., ((S)eparation of powers would be implicated when the actions of another branch threatens an Article III Courts independent and impartiality on the execution of its decision making functions."" ), Cert. denied, 516 US 986, 16 S. CT. 478, 133 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1995).
In Rodriguez vs. Cook, 169 F. 3d 1176, 1181-82 (9th Cir. 1999), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit proclaimed: ""Separation of powers is intended to structurally protect the independence of each of the three branches of government."" United States vs. Klein, 80 US (13 Wall), 128, 147, 20 L. Ed. 519 (1871).
In Inmates of Suffolk County Jail vs. Rouse, 129 F. 3d 649, 655-56 (1st Cir., 1997), the United States Court of Appeals of the First Circuit declared: ""Few Tenants are more central to the genius of our Constitutional System than the Separation of Powers Principal."" See Donoghue vs. United States, 289 US 516, 530, 53 S. CT 740, 743, 77 L. Ed. 2D 1356 (1993) (describing separation of powers as basic and vital to our scheme of government). This principal has many configurations. In one such configuration, it insulates the judiciary from unwarranted legislative intrusion.
See also Benjamin vs. Jacobson, 122 F. 3d 1081 (8th Cir., 1977). Dougan vs. Singletary, 129 F. 3d 1424 (11th Cir., 1998). Rivera vs. Allen, 169 F. 3d 1176, 1179-82 (9th Cir., 1999).
The Florida Supreme Court in Allen vs. Butterworth, 756 50. 2d 52 (fla., 2000), declared that the State Death Penalty Reform Act (which mandatorily restricted post-conviction relief for death penalty prisoners), violates the separation of powers doctrine of the Constitution and was therefore Unconstitutional.
In US vs. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), the Supreme Court declared that the Federal Sentencing Act violated the separation of powers of the United States Constitution due to the mandatory requirements involved in the sentencing of Federal defendants by US District Court Judges.
Once the United States Supreme Court decides that a type of statutory provision is Unconstitutional, then its ruling means that the Unconstitutional statute --- or its portion thereof --- has been Unconstitutional since it very first became law. See Rivera vs. Roadway Express, 114 S. Ct. 1510 (1994).
The United States Supreme Court decision in US vs. Booker, Supra, does not merely establish a new procedural rule --- which would render it only prospective in its application --- but rather passes on the very constitutionality of certain statutory provisions. See Schriro vs. Summerlin, 112 S. Ct. 2519 (2004).
In Miller vs. French, 120 S. Ct. 2246, 2246, 2247 (2000), the United States Supreme Court emphasized:""While the boundaries between the three branches of government are not hermetically sealed, the Constitution prohibits one branch from encroaching upon the central prerogative of another."" 
We the (NCAJC) submit and argue that while the Colorado Legislature can establish the minimum amount of sentence and a maximum amount of sentence for each respective felony crime and misdemeanor criminal conviction, the Legislature of the State of Colorado cannot require the sentencing judge to mandatorily sentence a defendant to a mandatory sentence; the sentencing judge must have the authority and independent judicial discretion as to what particular sentence would be proper and appropriate for the separation of powers of Article III, ""Distribution of Powers"" of the Colorado Constitution, the sentencing judge must have the independent authority and judicial discretion to determine what sentence is appropriate in each case.
Since the sentence of Mandatory Parole that has been imposed upon the American people and the Citizens of the State of Colorado violates the 'Separation of Powers"" provision of ArtIcle III of the Constitution of the State of Colorado, the Federal government of the United States, and the Colorado Legislature, must declare that the said statute violates the Colorado Constitution and vacate and set aside the sentencing of American Citizens to Mandatory Parole that Colorado Courts have imposed on the American public.CONCLUSION
Wherefore, we the American people, do hereby pray for the following relief:1). That the Federal government of the United States issue an ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE to the Attorney General of the State of Colorado to show cause within the next twenty (20) days as to why the Colorado Legislature should not declare the Colorado Mandatory Parole Act, Title 18-1.3-401 to be in violation of Article III of the Colorado Constitution and show cause why the Legislature should not vacate and set aside the Mandatory Parole that has been imposed upon the American people.2). That the Federal government will issue an Order to declare the Colorado Mandatory Parole Act violates Article III of the Colorado Constitution and the United States Constitution.3). That the Federal government will issue an Order to Vacate and Set Aside the Sentences of Mandatory Parole that the Colorado State Legislature has imposed upon the American people, and the Citizens of the State of Colorado.4). That the Federal government may grant any other relief deemed fair, just, proper, and appropriate.We of the National Committee Against Judicial Corruption (NCAJC), do hereby sign electronically this document this very day, April 12th, 2013, and do encourage the American people to forward this Protest to as many people as possible.DATED: April 12th, 2013

EDitor’s UPDATE: Positive rating and recognition has been given to  Lerner and Rowe for its commitment to excellence in customer service.

Ripoff Report’s discussions with Lerner and Rowe has uncovered an ongoing commitment by the company to total client satisfaction.  Indeed, Lerner and Rowe devotes the utmost in care and meticulous attention to each and every case, whether large or small.  They carefully listen to client concerns and see them as an opportunity to learn from past mistakes and become more efficient as a company in the legal services and support offered.  This means that clients can expect that the company will work towards finding a mutually satisfactory resolution to any complaint or concern.

Lerner and Rowe's principal attorney, Mr. Rowe, has informed us that his personal philosophy is that it is a privilege for their law firm to be chosen to help a client in their time of need.  As such, the client can expect to be provided with outstanding professional service after they or a loved one has been injured in an accident, applied and been denied the social security benefits they deserve, injured because of the financial crisis, or accused of city, state and federal crimes.  As a successful lawyer and businessman, Mr. Rowe feels it is critical to listen to his clients comments and concerns, and respond promptly.  By always putting his customers first, Mr. Rowe hopes to maintain that Lerner and Rowe is a successful law firm that always has their clients best welfare at heart.

Another top member of the company told us that Mr. Rowe's personal business philosophy is founded upon the principle of being fully committed to providing quality representation to clients in their time of need and to help them obtain maximum compensation whenever possible.  Some of the other things Ripoff Report learned in the course of its investigation: typical customer feedback reads:  “Lerner and Rowe personal injury lawyers in Phoenix are very helpful and friendly.  I was very impressed by my attorney’s professionalism and the job he did for me.  I never thought I would get the settlement that I did.""The information provided in this report is based on comments made by Brian Prezgay and Kevin Rowe during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Lerner and Rowe.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..

Lerner and Rowe Professionals are injury attorneys. They focus mainly on personal injury claims which include automobile accidents, tractor trailer accidents, motorcycle accidents, and personal property accidents (i.e. slips, falls, etc.). They also handle social security and disability claims. Lerner and Rowe Law Group also extend their services to include criminal defense, DUI defense, bankruptcy, and real estate sales.

Lerner and Rowe set themselves apart from other competitors by the level of commitment and compassion from the entire team.  Kevin Rowe is not only a boss, but an active team member; he prides himself on his passion and desire to help every person that he is able to.  Mr. Rowe has a motto that the way things are now are “never enough,” meaning that he pushes his team to strive for better.  He wants a “volume based company with a boutique feel for the customer” so each and every client feels as though they are the only client and receive full and satisfying attention from the entire team.  The desire to help people and provide special attention to each case as it comes into the business is the basis for the level of customer service provided for each and every person who comes through the door.  There is a wealth of knowledge and experience among the team members, with some holding 40 years of experience.  Mr. Rowe stated that he wants everyone to be able to learn something new every day just from interacting with each other.  The team members will also go to clients if they are unable to come into the office, ensuring that they can help in any way possible.  Exit reviews/surveys are completed for every client once their case is settled or resolved, to find out any problems the client had with the process and/or what positive experiences the client had.  Mr. Rowe stated that he wants to know the good and the bad so the company can continue to improve their practices.  Lerner and Rowe also contributes and volunteers with a large charity base throughout Arizona, making donations, volunteering time, attending events and participating as much as possible.  Mr. Rowe discussed his own personal experiences with several local charities and explained that the entire office gets involved as well.  He has been involved with Phoenix Children’s Hospital, Phoenix Rescue Mission, Susan G. Komen, and Arizona Chapter for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, as well as several others.  Lerner and Rowe have setup a webpage giving information on events and charities they are involved with for anyone who is interested: lernerandrowegivesback.com.

Lerner and Rowe acquire clients through their multi-media advertising campaigns, and from referrals from past and present clients.  The company advertises on television, radio, internet, billboards, bus stops and cabs.  Mr. Rowe stated that many clients come to them due to hearing the jingle on the radio or seeing the commercials, but a large amount of clients are through referrals.  The clients speak with one of the In-take Specialists when they first come into the office or when the call is received, discussing the issue and proceeding from there.

The typical experience a client should expect to receive is individual attention and a feeling that they are the only client.  Each client is provided with a knowledgeable team, who are available at any time to answer questions or concerns, to provide updates and just to check to see how the client is doing.  Lerner and Rowe strives to provide a satisfying experience for each client and to give a sense of relief and assurance of help, so the client can focus on getting better and on their recovery, not having to worry about the case details.

When the client comes in to the office, calls or makes contact with Lerner and Rowe initially, they speak with an In-take Specialist, who takes some details and then assigns the case to a specific team.  This is the team that the client will work with through the entire process, consisting of a Case Manager (paralegal), Attorney, Associate Attorney, Co-Case Manager, and Accounting Team.  The client receives communication and information from the Case Manager and Attorney primarily; the other team members are supportive and administrative roles, helping the Case Manager and Attorney.  The Case Manager and Attorney are expected to provide consistent communication throughout the entire process, no matter how long the case takes.  If there is any kind of delay in the case or time while waiting for information from Medical Providers or Insurance, the Case Manager and Attorney are responsible for reviewing the case and contacting the client at least once a month. ""During the onsite interview Kevin Rowe was asked to describe their standard process for taking care of a complaint: “The standard process for taking care of a complaint is a little different depending on if it is a current client or a past client.  If a current client has a complaint about the Case Manager, Co-Case Manager or Associate Attorney, the supervising Attorney will speak with the client for resolution.  If unable to provide resolution or if the complaint is about the Attorney, it is reviewed by me and my team of Executive Assistants.  I will speak with the client directly, in person or by phone, to find out more information about the complaint and to find the best resolution for the situation.  If a past client has a complaint, I will call the client to speak about the situation and try to provide a resolution.  Each case is notated each time it is accessed, for conversations with the client to updates in the case.  Each notation gives a detailed explanation of what was discussed, any offer made or information that was given regarding the case.  When I speak with a client regarding a complaint I review all of the information to find out if something went wrong or if a client is upset because the outcome was not what they were expecting or wanting.  I try to understand what caused the complaint and to provide the best resolution to the situation at hand.  Through utilization of exit surveys for current clients many complaints or concerns are resolved before the client leaves allowing for resolution and communication at the time it occurred.  I take every concern or complaint to heart and try to provide resolution for situations as quickly as possible; sometimes I am unable to provide complete resolution depending on the situation.  I take all concerns or complaints personally and work tirelessly to provide satisfaction and closure for my clients, past and present.”

In addition to how their office handles complaints, Mr. Rowe was asked to describe a specific situation where a client was not satisfied with the level of service they received: “The client was upset with a situation regarding the settlement; there was a discrepancy from what was offered originally and what was received.  I called the client to discuss the situation, while speaking with the client and with the review of the notes and information regarding the case, the discrepancy was found.  I was able to correct the issue and made an offer of resolution for the situation.  The resolution was accepted by the client and they expressed deep satisfaction for the quick resolution.  The client has since referred friends and family to Lerner and Rowe, stating that he is very thankful for our help and sincerity for the entire process.”

The process for dealing with insurance company requests starts with obtaining all necessary information from the client, requesting medical records/bills for any doctor/hospital visits.  Lerner and Rowe is at the mercy of the medical providers to send the information as quickly as possible, it can take several weeks, months sometimes for the records to be received.  Once everything is received, the information is provided to the insurance company for review and determination.  The insurance company can take between 30-45 days for review.  The delays and time it takes that has spurred complaints about how insurance claims are handled are due to the length of time medical providers and insurance company review takes, it is not something that can be controlled by Lerner and Rowe.  Mr. Rowe stated that the company is not able to go pick up medical records or force the insurance review process to move faster or keep to the time frame given when the reports are sent.  He stated, “Lerner and Rowe do not gain anything from delaying the process, it is better for the company for the process to run smoothly and quickly.”

Some internal processes needing improvement include the size of caseloads each team handles; the company is in process and has already seen improvement of hiring additional staff to lessen the case loads.  The teams are already benefitting from the increase in people and are able to better help clients efficiently and effectively.  Also needing some additional improvement was general training and expectations of the company for newer employees.  Improved training and learning expectations for the company have contributed to better communication with clients and between team members.  Mr. Rowe strives to have pro-active client contact and communication, instead of re-active, he wants to have the teams reach out to the clients and make sure everything is going okay, not to have the clients calling concerned with the process.

The changes seen have been better communication with clients and lessened case load for the teams, allowing more efficiency and effective client interaction.  Additional supportive and administrative staff allows more functionality of the office and allows the teams to focus on the clients more.  Concerns are easier to address and resolve and no client is being overlooked or falling through the cracks.  Mr. Rowe stated that he has a quote that he found a few years ago that he sends to his teams to remind everyone that the client is the most important part of this business, without them we have no business.  The quote he gives; “A client is the most important visitor on our premises, he is not dependent on us, we are dependent on him.  He is not an interruption of our work; he is the purpose of it.  He is not an outsider of our business; he is a part of it.  We are not doing him a favor by serving him; he is doing us a favor by allowing us to serve him.”

In order to do whatever it takes to make the client happy, Mr. Rowe advises his employees to maintain pro-active communication and satisfaction for each and every client. Providing answers and resolution in an effective and efficient manner allows each team to best address clients’ concerns/issues.  Providing the best and most qualified staff, and the level of knowledge provided throughout each team allows Lerner and Rowe to “do whatever it takes” to provide satisfaction.

The creation of the exit surveys and addition of the administrative and supporting staff have been some results from the complaints made on Ripoff Report.  Additional training and expanded expectations have also been directly related to the complaints.

It means a great deal to Lerner and Rowe to be part of the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program; it is a huge benefit to the company.  Mr. Rowe stated that it is the essence of the business and its practices.  Lerner and Rowe / Statements from the staff.  ""Mr. Rowe and the senior attorneys and staff members provide a very positive environment to work.  We are encouraged to share ideas, seek additional training and give back to our local communities by participating in community based events.  Mr. Rowe is truly concerned about our professional growth within the company and takes the time to listen and communicate with employees and clients.""

Lerner and Rowe takes employee satisfaction seriously as well.  If an employee is satisfied with their job, they are more likely to provide exceptional service to clients and their fellow co-workers.  Lerner and Rowe employees have expressed that they are very pleased working at the law firm.  A case manager at Lerner and Rowe stated ""I have seen Mr. Rowe take personal interest in client cases and in giving back to the community.  He is not a silent partner by any means. He actively seeks justice and fair treatment for clients and local community groups and organizations that are in need. Mr. Rowe truly has earned the title of being the ""Attorney with a Heart.""

Lerner and Rowe recognizes that complaints posted on Ripoff Report (whether true or not) are issues that need to be addressed, not ignored.  If handled correctly, complaints can be valuable learning opportunities. With the feedback generated by Ripoff Report’s review, it became apparent that Lerner and Rowe has made organizational changes allowing its users and employees a more streamlined approach to problem resolution and a commitment to a great user experience.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
										 Lerner & Rowe Definatly not the way to go. Phoenix, Arizona On Feb, 12 2012, I was in a pretty bad head-on accident that was of no fault of my own. After going to the emergency room, I made the biggest mistake I have ever made, hiring Lerner & Rowe to represent me. I first went to the intake, everything was explained to me as expected and I felt confident that I had made the right choice. Over the course of the next year, that changed quite a bit. First off, I didnt even hear from my actual lawyer for three months, had my file handled mostly by assistants, who sorry to say never had any idea what was actually going on, (was constantly given incorrect information). After my medical treatment was finished at the end of may 2012, I was given a continued care plan, which included multiple injections in my upper, middle and lower spine. I really didnt know too much about these injections, had heard some good, also some not so good things, which caused some uncertainty in my mind. I expressed this fact to my lawyer and was given complete confidence that with a futures letter he would be able to recover the money to pay for the extremely expensive injections. So, needless to say the injections were put on hold. Shortly after my last and final doctor appointment I received some papers in the mail from Lerner& Rowe, for me to fill out about any changes in day to day activity or basic life changes caused by injuries from the accident. I immediately filled them out and returned them to Lerner and Rowe. Over the course of the next 7 months I received no updates on my claim, would call to find out what was taking so long and get no call back for sometimes a month, but when I would call and request to speak with a manager, even requested to speak with Mr. Rowe himself on more than one occasion, but would be transferred automatically to my lawyer, instead of who I had asked to speak with. Funny how my lawyer was too busy to return my calls but when I ask to speak with somebody in charge, all of the sudden he has time. I received multiple excuses as to why a demand letter hadn't been sent out to my insurance company. After waiting a good part of a year with no results, no updates and still no demand letter sent to the insurance company I finally received a call on December 17th 2012 from the third legal assistant to work my case, stating that they had been waiting on paperwork, (Paperwork that had already been in their possession since shortly after I was released from medical treatment) and that they would be sending the demand letter the next day. After waiting another two weeks to hear if it was accepted or not, I called to find out that it had just barely been sent. At this time, I was past the past the point of being fed up. Asked again to speak to a manager. Got my lawyers voicemail. About a month passed and I finally get a call from my lawyer stating that the insurance company had come back with an offer. The offer was of course low. I was then told by my lawyer that since it had been such a big gap in continued care that the insurance company would not consider covering my much needed injections. And was informed that if I decided to take my case to court the fees would go up and I more than likely wouldn't get any more money than what was offered in the settlement, but would actually receive less due to fees increasing. Basically forcing me to settle for a fraction of what was deserved. I am not a happy client and would never refer even my worst enemy to Lerner & Rowe. They really don't care about their clients, as was proven to me multiple times over the last year. The only goal for them is to make themselves money the easiest way possible, even if it means the client doesnt receive what they deserve. Lerner & Rowe, Not the way to go.

The delays and time it takes that has spurred complaints about how insurance claims are handled are due to the length of time medical providers and insurance company review takes, it is not something that can be controlled by Lerner and Rowe.  Mr. Rowe stated that the company is not able to go pick up medical records or force the insurance review process to move faster or keep to the time frame given when the reports are sent.  He stated, “Lerner and Rowe do not gain anything from delaying the process, it is better for the company for the process to run smoothly and quickly.”

Some internal processes needing improvement include the size of caseloads each team handles; the company is in process and has already seen improvement of hiring additional staff to lessen the case loads.  The teams are already benefitting from the increase in people and are able to better help clients efficiently and effectively.  Also needing some additional improvement was general training and expectations of the company for newer employees.  Improved training and learning expectations for the company have contributed to better communication with clients and between team members.  Mr. Rowe strives to have pro-active client contact and communication, instead of re-active, he wants to have the teams reach out to the clients and make sure everything is going okay, not to have the clients calling concerned with the process.

The changes seen have been better communication with clients and lessened case load for the teams, allowing more efficiency and effective client interaction.  Additional supportive and administrative staff allows more functionality of the office and allows the teams to focus on the clients more.  Concerns are easier to address and resolve and no client is being overlooked or falling through the cracks.  Mr. Rowe stated that he has a quote that he found a few years ago that he sends to his teams to remind everyone that the client is the most important part of this business, without them we have no business.  The quote he gives; “A client is the most important visitor on our premises, he is not dependent on us, we are dependent on him.  He is not an interruption of our work; he is the purpose of it.  He is not an outsider of our business; he is a part of it.  We are not doing him a favor by serving him; he is doing us a favor by allowing us to serve him.”

In order to do whatever it takes to make the client happy, Mr. Rowe advises his employees to maintain pro-active communication and satisfaction for each and every client. Providing answers and resolution in an effective and efficient manner allows each team to best address clients’ concerns/issues.  Providing the best and most qualified staff, and the level of knowledge provided throughout each team allows Lerner and Rowe to “do whatever it takes” to provide satisfaction.

The creation of the exit surveys and addition of the administrative and supporting staff have been some results from the complaints made on Ripoff Report.  Additional training and expanded expectations have also been directly related to the complaints.

It means a great deal to Lerner and Rowe to be part of the Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program; it is a huge benefit to the company.  Mr. Rowe stated that it is the essence of the business and its practices.  Lerner and Rowe / Statements from the staff.  ""Mr. Rowe and the senior attorneys and staff members provide a very positive environment to work.  We are encouraged to share ideas, seek additional training and give back to our local communities by participating in community based events.  Mr. Rowe is truly concerned about our professional growth within the company and takes the time to listen and communicate with employees and clients.""

Lerner and Rowe takes employee satisfaction seriously as well.  If an employee is satisfied with their job, they are more likely to provide exceptional service to clients and their fellow co-workers.  Lerner and Rowe employees have expressed that they are very pleased working at the law firm.  A case manager at Lerner and Rowe stated ""I have seen Mr. Rowe take personal interest in client cases and in giving back to the community.  He is not a silent partner by any means. He actively seeks justice and fair treatment for clients and local community groups and organizations that are in need. Mr. Rowe truly has earned the title of being the ""Attorney with a Heart.""

Lerner and Rowe recognizes that complaints posted on Ripoff Report (whether true or not) are issues that need to be addressed, not ignored.  If handled correctly, complaints can be valuable learning opportunities. With the feedback generated by Ripoff Report’s review, it became apparent that Lerner and Rowe has made organizational changes allowing its users and employees a more streamlined approach to problem resolution and a commitment to a great user experience.

At the last steps of writ of execution and sheriff service, this company kept lying to me and didnt do what they told me to do at all. In the end, I found out it was not necessary to do such kind of things prior to writ of execution. The purpose of these lies from this company is just letting the bad tenants stayed at my property much longer than it should be. It made me confused. Their behaviors made me feel they were helping the tenants instead of me. It looked like they were the lawyer company of my tenants instead of mine. So, I did some investigation. I called one of the tenants and asked him if he paid money to this company. The answer is yes. This tenant told me he paid about $1000 to this company. This explains everything.

Internet United States of America ",www.modeltalentdevelopment.com, 516 822 4208,"New Faces Development Model Talent Development Scam took $2,795 in total. Told us our son could be a model. Internet"," My husband and my son were approached in the Queens Mall sometime in January 2012.  The agent told my husband that my son could be a model and took all of my husbands information. A week passed and we received a called from Jennifer asking us to bring my son in and that we must come both of the parents for an interview. On January 27, 2012 we had an interview with Omar Tovar who showed us pictures of kids who made it to the magazines and told us that our son looked very cute and he does not hesitate he would be able to get a contract. We were unsure, but he convinced us and gives a discount from $700 to $500 for the photo shots and for one year contract with GigaComp. We also paid $45 to get the pictures in a cd. My husband and I totally understood that modeling is a risky industry and we agreed to take the chance for one year. We figured at least we got pictures if he does not get a contract. 
In March we start receiving calls from Jennifer saying that my son out of five more kids have been chosen by Childrens Place for a four year contract and he will have to go for a photo shot once a month and that it usually takes two days in which he will be paid $200 an hour. She also said that the photo shot with Childrens Place will take place in two weeks from the day she called me. However, she said in order to get this contract I needed to extend my contract with them for one year to 4 years contract so they can keep his pictures in the internet so other companies can call him. She told me that the extension cost was $2250, but I needed to do it fast otherwise Childrens Place will choose one of the other five kids. 
On April 5, 2012 we went to Hicksville and we were convinced to sign the extension for four more years. At this point we were very hesitant with Jennifer. Jennifer decided to have us talk to Michelle Smith who supposedly is the second in command after James.  I expressed my concerns to Jennifer I told her that I was willing to risk the money for one year, but $2,250 sounded bizarre and we were not willing to expend that much more money. She said that she will commit herself that even if Childrens Place will not work out there are hundreds of other companies out there that will be interested in our son. Jennifer said to us that if my son will not get any contract within one month of the extension of it; she will refund us the money. After reading the contract extension it did not mentioned at all that a refund will be done in case of dissatisfaction; however, Jennifer said  I give you my word there is nobody higher than me other than James. I am also a mother and I will not do that.
Well she did it. One year has passed and I have been trying to reach her by phone and email and I never heard from her. E-mails she will not answer and my phone calls will go straight to her voice mail. I finally decided to write to newfacesmgmt@gmail.com and got an answer from Nicky and I also spoke with her. She sent a contract like where it said that they will refund my money $2,250.00 in 21 days from the date that I signed. It also said that with this I will commit myself not to seek for an attorney or do any formal complaints against the company and/or dispute any charges with my credit card company. 
In my last email sent to them I told them that this is no longer valid since no reimbursement has been done. I am willing to go all the way with this and take them to court. My first step has been to inform of this scam to the Office of the Attorney General and I will post my dissatisfaction in any website about them. I hope this was useful for all those parents who like us had a dream. Dont let them scam you like that take your kid to Disney instead or open a savings account for college. 
Will be happy if other parents with the same issue can reach me. It will be great to stop them to scam more families like us.

The first one was poision controll who informed me that the product was  not from the USA and had no compliance with any of our standards. Then I called the FDA and they said not to trust it since there was no study of the product in the USA. Then I called my insurance and found that it probably would not be covered under my insurance, since they could not prove if it was a safe  not neglent product. So I took it all back. The manager at the first store was rude. She tod me that she could only exchange 9 items, so I said what about the other 42 that I bought at your store. She informed me that I would have to keep them since it would mess up her system. After much yelling on my part she finally took it back.   We need to buy American, USA products, so we have some knowledge on what we are putting on our kids faces.  My insurance agent told me a child slept with face paint since he would not let his mother was his face.

"," Ripoff Report Verified™ REVIEW:

EDitor’s Positive rating and recognition has been given to Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. for its commitment to excellence in customer service.

Ripoff Report’s review of Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. revealed a full staff of attorneys, case managers, and specialists with unparalleled commitment to their clients; Kanner & Pintaluga clients can expect aggressive, ethical, and effective legal representation from the attorneys and knowledgeable staff members who are available to answer the phone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week whenever you call any of their offices. This dedicated team of professionals works tirelessly to get the maximum compensation to which their clients are entitled. Further, they understand that every case is different, and carefully listen to each individual clients’ unique needs and concerns.

Kevin Sobel, the managing attorney of K&P's Georgia offices fights hard for his clients because he knows what they are going through from personal experience, ""I've been there. I hurt my back in a car accident a few years ago and had to undergo therapy, injections and even back surgery."" Mr. Sobel went on to say that he knows “…how frustrating it is to be effected at work and limited in my regular daily activities, so I am happy to be able to help guide my injured clients through their recoveries.”

Eric Pintaluga, one of the founding partners, echoed Mr. Sobel’s enthusiasm, stating, “I have a responsibility and a duty to make sure the clients’ rights are protected when they’re injured in an accident.”The information provided in this report below is based on comments made by Louis Mosca during an on-site inspection held by a third party verification company with no biases toward Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A.Ripoff Report Verified™ .. part of Ripoff Report Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program.A program that benefits the consumer, assures them of complete satisfaction and confidence when doing business with a member business..

Kanner & Pintaluga is an accident injury law firm with offices in multiple states. “We provide aggressive legal representation for people injured in an accident. We strive to make sure our clients recover physically from whatever medical care they need and ultimately receive the maximum compensation for their medical bills, pain and suffering,” states Kevin Sobel, a representative of the company. “We are licensed in numerous states and we have a track record of success. I, myself, am licensed to practice in GA, FL, MA and MN. We have no bar issues and thousands of satisfied customers,” he explains. Leads are typically acquired through telephone, radio and internet advertising, as well as referrals from current and past clients.

The sales process typically involves an office associate receiving a phone call from a potential client who is interested in retaining the services of the law firm. The representative will discuss the details of the case and the process with the client to determine the next step. “We like to hold the client’s hand through the process as much as possible to make sure they receive the care they need and receive as much money as possible,” explains Mr. Sobel. The associates at Kanner & Pintaluga strive to be very hands-on with their clients, keeping a detailed file for each client, documenting every step in the case. “I personally touch every file that comes into my office,” states Mr. Sobel. The law firm is also entirely paperless, which allows them the opportunity to work with their clients from anywhere. “The phones are open 24/7. I answer e-mails any time I’m awake. We really try to help our clients get through a difficult time,” states Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. Client Care & Complaint Resolution 

At times, clients may not feel satisfied with the services they received. “The frequent complaint we get from clients is either they didn’t get enough money, or didn’t get money quick enough. Unfortunately, this is going to happen through no fault of our own,” explains Mr. Sobel. He further explains that this can be caused by a federal or state law that is impacting the case, the amount of medical damages they may have, or simply the facts of the case itself. To try and avoid these issues in the first place, Mr. Sobel and his team strive to educate the clients up-front with regard to what they should expect, what types of damages are covered, and what documentation is needed. After a complaint is resolved, Kanner & Pintaluga make following up with the client a priority. “We always follow up after a complaint. I do take it personally with my business,” states Mr. Sobel. “Happy clients don’t post negative complaints on the internet, so we go out of our way to make sure the customer is well educated on the things we can and cannot control. We follow up and the goal is to see clients pain free and walking away happy.”

Mr. Sobel and his team take into consideration the time and money spent by the client, and strive to get the client what they need. “Missing out on a gym membership, lost wages, paying for extra help at home… It’s important that’s clients get compensated for every element of their damages, pain and suffering,” he states. They also strive to keep their clients informed throughout every step of the process, utilizing any form of communication necessary to keep in touch with the client, whether it’s a phone call, e-mail, or text message.

In response to complaints lodged against his company on Ripoff Report, Mr. Sobel states, “I would like to point out that a number of the complaints seem fabricated and appear to be posted out of places that I do not work, by named that don’t match any of our clients or past clients’ names. Even still, we address every complaint, no matter how legit or complete.”

Since receiving complaints, the team at Kanner & Pintaluga has instituted a property damage department where they can assist clients’ recovery, and they strive to be available to their clients at any time of the day. Kanner & Pintaluga, P.A. / Senior Managing Attorneys  ""The passion for client advocacy and service is obvious at Kanner & Pintaluga. Each client's case is overseen by a senior managing attorney, such as Kevin Sobel for the Georgia offices, who assigns an associate attorney and two (2) case managers who are available via email, text, phone and in person, to respond to questions or concerns at every stage of the process. These case managers are knowledgeable about their clients’ cases and use the same methods of communication to keep clients apprised of any developments in their case.

Kanner & Pintaluga provides aggressive and effective legal representation to clients throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennesee ando ther states, with the highest standards of excellence, compassion and integrity. K&P is committed to obtaining the maximum compensation to which our clients are entitled. We always provide personalized attention and deliver prompt communication so that our clients always know where their case stands.”STATED IMPROVEMENTS FROM YOUR COMPANY NAME. ""In response to client demand, and in an ongoing efforts to help clients in need, Kanner & Pintaluga created an entire new department consisiting of staff that specialize exclusively in handling clients’ property damage claims; property damage services are provided at no cost to clients who have bodily injury cases with the firm. This business move underscores K&P’s goal: allowing clients to focus on getting better while K&P focus on dealing with the responsible party and navigating the intricacies of the case. “We want our clients to use their time and energy towards their recovery. They can’t get better if they don’t get medical attention, and they can’t get to the doctor’s office without some sort of transportation,” said Mr. Sobel. Kanner & Pintaluga property damage experts are happy to coordinate damage assessments, rental car services, and more.  The majority of our complaints (besides the fakes ones) are clients wanting more settlement money and/or settlement money faster. We combat this by providing as much information as possible up front to the clients, repeatedly by way of letters, emails conference calls, and/or meetings, to set appropriate expectations for how cases work.

We work tirelessly for our clients, long days, nights and weekends, to ensure they get what they need. Our phones are answered 24/7 and we respond to emails at all hours. We are entirely paperless and have smart phones, iPads, remote access, etc. so we can work on files and/or update clients from anywhere.”

										On August 17th I contacted this Traffic Ticket Lawyer for assistance on my speeding ticket that was $185.00. I was told by the lady on the other end of the phone they could handle it for $60.00. I told her okay that I was checking around and would get back to her, with no such luck of any cheaper rates or with offices handling Richardson City Municipal Court, I went ahead with this company. When I called back I was told another amount this time...but quickly told her that she had already quoted me $60.00 so she agreed to the cost. We processed my payment and at that time I asked what I needed to do now since this was all new to me? She said ""Nothing we will go to court for you and try to get your ticket dismissed if not at least deferred or lowered."" She went thru a quick spill and it seemed easy enough so I let her go and let them do their work. 
After a few weeks I got a letter in the mail from the City of Richardson advising of my new court date. I found it odd that I didn't get anything from my attorney not a call, not an email, not even a letter in the mail. So I emailed them to advise of my letter and to ask what the status was since I hadn't received anything. I never got responded to. 
Sept 18th I get an email that simply says in the subject line ""Court Results""...so I open it and it is a stamped lettter from the court showing my ENTIRE ticket amount is due in 10 days AND that I am no longer eligible for Deffered Adjudication, Defensive Driving or Dismissal of an Expired Violation? 
So what exactly did I hire this lawyer for? To take my $60.00 and get me nothing? Not even keep it off my record?? I call the Lawyer and they tell me its because I didn't show up in court? The last I checked that is what I hired you for and that is what your JOB is....to represent me besides the fact that the person on the phone told me that I didn't neet to show up at court that the Lawyer handles that for me.  So I was not letting it go, I then called back another time and spoke to a somewhat intelligent Ms. LISA...who was very caring and seemed concerned and that I something seemed wrong and she would get back to me after she spoke to the lawyer. Well I didn't hear from her so called her back only this time to speak to MR. HYDE...she was completely different on the phone and yelled at me and told me that if I could have done better I should have done it myself and she wouldn't reccomment me hiring them for another of my tickets and would not let me speak after she asked me ""what exactly is it I want for them to do about this??"" HHHHHMMM let me see, HOW ABOUT YOUR JOB! she said my feelings were not important to her and that she does not know why the lawyer could not get anything better than what he got me which was nothing, and that if i wanted better results that I should go myself to the court and request time with the Judge......REALLY? And when I do, and I do get better results maybe I should go back to them and get an application and get a job there since obviously they cannot do their job right or with any profesionalism. She then hung up on me. It seems to me that the CUSTOMER is always right and you should treat them with respect and be professional. This lady knew nothing about those concepts. I reported them to the BBB and filed a complaint. This is a very bad company to do business with and I would not recommend them to anyone wanting RESULTS.									",  Attorneys General

										Tradebank International knowingly engaged in a pattern of conduct whereby they make material misrepresentations regarding positive account balances to franchisees and members of Tradebankacross the country. Positive account balances are situations where an individual barter consumer (a member of a Tradebank franchise) has a positive account balance, meaning they have taken in more barter currency than they have spent. Positive account balances are considered liabilities of a tradeexchange, because they represent already earned barter currency that the trade exchange is obligated to redeem  and because most members with large positive account balances will be reluctant to sell any more of their goods or services in exchange for barter currency unless and until they spend theiralready accumulated reserves. Tradebank of Chattanooga is a perfect example of this activity. The cumulative total of positive account balances in the entire Tradebank franchise system is approximately $15 million dollars (1,2 million in Chattanooga), versus only approximately $200,000 in negative account balances which negative account balances represent unpaid obligations to theapplicable trade exchange, and which in the barter industry are considered assets of a trade exchange. It is the prevailing view in the barter industry lines of credit are essential, and negative account balances in a trade exchange offset the positive account balances and creates a healthy micro-economy within the exchange. Tradebank is all aware of the problems associated with deficit spending (when a trade exchange has far more positive account balances than negative ones). The negative account balances represent goods and services owed and promised by those members of the trade exchange to the members with positive balances, assuring there is sufficient demand for thebarter currency Tradebank have also engaged, on an ongoing basis, in what is known as cash converting.  Tradebank to use trade dollars or trade credits to purchase hard goods (such as a car, orcanoe, or television, or jewelry, and so on) that came into a franchisees trade exchange, without the franchisees prior knowledge or consent. Tradebank then sells such hard goods for actual cash currency and those goods are no longer available to other members of the exchange. Upon information and belief, Tradebank has for years, with the full knowledge and participation of Defendants, failed to properly report all of their own ongoing trade credit purchases (deficit spending) as fully taxable events to the IRS and pay appropriate taxes on such income. Such actions have the effect of putting all of Tradebanks franchises at ongoing and immediate risk of insolvency or collapse. Thus crediting a barter ponzi with all the local supporting businesses left with nothing.  By knowingly causing Tradebank to engage in a pattern of income tax fraud and avoidance (or at the very least by knowingly acquiescing to such conduct),  Tradebank is in immediate danger of potential criminal and/or regulatory actions against it, which could cause every Tradebank franchise to have to cease operating and/or absorb potentialliability of their franchisor Tradebank, which lack the assets to offset the positive balances. I have several supporting affidavits from third-parties with knowledge of certain facts and allegations raised herein. I am in the process of obtaining numerous other affidavits from similarly situated parties acrossthe country, and I have spoken to multiple parties with knowledge of the facts and circumstances which parties have confirmed the same.  Tradebank has a pattern of  misconduct is a clear and ongoing pattern. Taking money from small businesses canceling their unusable from the benefit of Theregion owner of Chattanooga (junner Mootz former owner of the Loft). These Trade dollars are then converted to cash or hard goods then sold for cash. Mootz continues to borrow Trade dollars from local clients and then fails to repay local businesses back. During the last billing cycle some of these accountswere canceled due to the cash fees not being paid. The fees were generated by the regional owner, not the owner of the account. Mootz recently was told by a current client to close his account and take the trade dollars and put them into a non-profits account. Instead he instructed to manager to debit business the remaining amount and credit Mootz`s account instead of the non-profit. There have over 1300 small business`s purchase a membership for 495.00, of the 1300, 800 plus have canceled. Many of these accounts have had positive balances and before they are closed the balances have been transferred to the benefit of Tradebank of Chattanooga and Mootz personally. All 1300 businesses paid 495.00, to my knowledge there have been non that have received a refund of the 495.00. I can furnish the following documents. The radman reports to support the Tax issues, deficit spending, and all local radman reports with a list of canceled accounts. The last non-profit theft and the member who was closing their account.

										Abdel Hakim Belhadj is one of the foremost rebel military leaders and commander of the Tripoli Military Council.In earlier days Belhadj had fought with other jihadists against the Soviet sponsored regime in Afghanistan. When the Soviets were defeated Belhadj returned to Libya. Belhadj fought with other Islamists in a rebellion based in eastern Libya but the group was crushed in 1998. He then went to Afghanistan where he joined the Taliban. After 9/11 Libyan authorities issued a warrant for his arrest. Belhadj claims that informants in the UK informed M16 that he and his pregnant wife were traveling through Malaysia. Both were arrested in Malaysia and transferred to Bangkok where he was placed in custody of the CIA and retained at a secret prison. Belhaj says that his arrest and consequent transport back to Libya was the result of a joint M16 CIA operation designed to help Gadaffi round up his enemies.Belhadj was held in prison in Libya for 7 years in terrible conditions as well as being tortured. However Saif al-Islam one of Gadaffi's sons had him released along with many other Islamists after a ""de-radicalisation"" project. Saif said that the men were no longer a danger to Libya. He was wrong about that as far as the Gadaffi regime was concerned! Belhadj ended up being one of the prime commanders in the successful overthrow of the Gadaffi government.
 A team of rebels and Human Rights Watch found documents related to Belhadj in Tripoli originating from both the CIA and the UK M16. The former Libyan foreign minister noted that M16 had been operating in Tripoli right up until the revolution last February. The British government set up an inquiry into these and other events but it was so flawed that no one shed many tears when the government decided to simply close it down. The UK Metropolitan Police are carrying out investigations. When these are finished the UK government has promised a judge led investigation based on the findings. For more see this article. Of course no similar investigation is being carried out in the U.S. about the role of the CIA in these events.",  Attorneys General

Many defrauded Nevada homeowner association (HOA) homeowner victims (including permanently disabled, elderly, fixed-income) now face homelessness, poverty, inability to obtain adequate housing, lost (rental) income, derogatory credit, and Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (""HOA Syndrome) all due to the State of Nevadas refusal to enforce its laws, convict HOA criminals and seek restitution for homeowner association illegal foreclosure victims.
I am permanently disabled. I have lost my home and retirement due to Nevada HOA fraud (embezzlement, extortion and illegal foreclosure). (Washoe County District Attorney #406539, Reno Police Dept. #08-031672). 
Neither Fannie Mae, nor its loan servicer, Chase Home Finance would work with me to keep me in my home knowing there was HOA fraud, embezzlement and extortion.
Effective August 14, I will have completed 24 hours (Day 1) of a hunger strike in protest of Nevada HOA fraud and corruption.
Please sign my petition at http://www.change.org/petitions/hunger-strike-to-protest-fraudulent-hoa-foreclosure and show State of Nevada that its failure to prosecute homeowner association crimes (and illegal foreclosures) is not only unacceptable, but unconstitutional.

They prey on unsuspecting job hunters with a fake employment offer, to get you to register your information on their site. Then send you fake job assignments and claim to hire you after a trial period of 14 days, then you are supposed to be offered full time employment and paid $1000.00 then after going full time you are supposed to get $2000.00 a month. The first couple of assignments are as follows:
1. A client has Aterial Hypertension and needs diet plan that works for people with this problem.
2. Research Chauffeured Limousine and Exotic Car Rental Services.
3. Here's the one that will cause some concern, A client had a painting done that was damaged and wanted to know if it could be re-done by the artist. They want you to contact the artist and see if this is possible and how much. Then when you get the email from the the artist with cost and the shipping total. They send you an email stating that the client can't send the full amount online, and that it will have to be done in person of course by you the Virtual Assistant. With a reminder that it is part of your job description to sometimes go to the store and shop or send packages out for the client. Then comes the part where they need your banking info for direct deposit of your pay and for the money for the art project plus your bonus for the assignment.

Ft Collins, Colorado United States of America ",Kittle team.com, ,"Keller Williams Rob Kittle, Sara Rowan, Lisa Meyer, Kittle Team. They screwed me and Quit in the middle of my contract, then accused me of harassment and threats! Ft Collins, Colorado","
										About two yrs ago I went online to look for a condo in northern Colorado! A few nights later I recieved a call from a Sara Rowan who said she was with Keller Williams and asked if I needs help. I explained that I was handicapped and had a pet bird! She sent some nice condos, then all she seemed to send where 2 story and garden levels. I reminded her of my handicap and still more  bad listings came. We followed each others Facebook and shared her dog Shebas death and Sara's pool play! After a yr or so I decided it wasn't working(online home shopping). So I told Sara in March of 2012 that I was paying my lease off 3 months early, buying a Honda van, packing a POD and heading to Ft Collins around mid
To late April! But I told Sara that I could not financially afford 30 days in a hotel, and Sara's reply was don't worry I know people, come on out just let her know when. Took care of business and by April 1st I was ready to leave on noon Friday April 20th, arriving that Sunday. Told Sara and made a lunch appointment for
Monday, well that was no show #1, made lunch on day 3 and she pawns me off to some other person I'd  never meet, Sara said she and the other person would get some listings together( should have been done already) the next day. I did not see a house for nine days!!! I told her at lunch that I was not having any luck finding a place to stay due to cost and I have my Conure Beaker  with me in the van!!! Sara's reply was my mom stayed at the Bestwestern hotel and liked it!! That was ""Her People"". After 7 or 8 days of BS like I have something urgent or I have meeting from 9:30am till 3pm. I  called Sara and asked if her boss knew that I was living in a van while she's in meetings, and she got pissed for me calling her out! I said I will  call back If I want to continue with Keller Williams. Soon after I hung up a agent from Keller Williams called me back and said
she had over heard Sara's and my call, and wanted to help save the sale! Her name is Lisa Meyer, she asked what it would take to help, I said show me some houses for God sakes I've been here 9 days and I'm living in my van. Went out the next day and put an offer on the 2nd one. I asked Lisa about finding someplace till closing(>30 days), her reply was try Craigslist! I've been in and out hotels now for over 105 days now, thanks Sara! I found out at the condo that Lisa is Sara's boss, and Sara is no one, a Internet contact person I guess. We sign contract with each other and shoot them an offer to buy. Lisa hands me the paperwork and says while in your van make sure you read this stuff. Now off to our lender FirstCal. Lender ran by Catherine Easue and her assistant Chad Williams. They come in a go your locked in at 4.375% 30 yr fixed, closing cost are $4735( double the 2% I was told to expect) then Catherine left the room and Chad finished up long story short Chad wanted ME to LEND him money for a company HE has ownership in!(foul # 1) .  By the way my FICO was avg. 804 at this point. I leave the lender and am freaked out by this. I'm in the van that night and I read the contract for the condo, and by god someone has put in the contract that my condo has and comes with an "" attached two car garage""! And we all missed it when signing it, buyers, sellers, everybody signed it! I sat down the next day with Lisa and due to Sara misrepresenting herself and her ability, the lender doing preditary lending practices, and her typing error that I might have to seek legal advise !! !!!!! Well they circle the wagons and sent their attorney after me about false claims against his company, sexual harassment, threats, pulled Lisa Meyer off and gave me to JoAnne Johnson to close. I never saw an attorney, that's a whole deal itself! A day or two to closing and they QUIT and washed their hands. Deal fell thru!
 Tried once more on a condo by Mead, made an Offer, they accepted, good ending right..... Nope the selling agent FORGOT to update her listing, the HOA went from $184 to $221, Sorry! My FICO is now 784 I'm out about $20,000, bought a RV and getting out of this messed up place.									",  Attorneys General

Verna has personally told me that she is not going to give me the address to my landlord so that I may write them, violating my tenant rights.
The property has sustained damage causing illness and Josh refuses to clean it up. He states lies, gets tenants confused when talking to us states to us that we said one thing, when he is talking about my neighbor and states it is ""on us.""
Josh and Verna have told landlords whose property they manage that they ""just are not going to get any more pictures, they don't care what the contract states.""
False repair charges are made upon the tenants when requests for repairs are done and then we are told if we fail to pay them they will evict us. They have stated this to me as well as the other tenants in my building. I live in fear of being evicted if I report needed maintenance.
The carpets have not been changed in ten years. All of the apartments have had floods in them several times from the A/C units over the course of the past 12 months. 
The yard personell constantly damage personal property when mowing. Both Josh and Verna have been notified of this. They refuse to relay the message to hold them accountable for the damages caused.
When specialists, whether it be plumbers or A/C repair personell have to be called, Josh makes up lies about what was said by them and then charges us. I have called the people who have come to my place to make repairs. Both times they stated ""I never said that, I wish they would stop doing this."" in regards to Josh making up statements.
The carpet is molding. 
There is mold growing on the walls.
The mold within the walls has made me and other tenants ill. We need a housing authority to come and inspect the building and the inside of the walls for mold. Past tenants state that after they moved out they were no longer ill. All of us have gone to the doctor and have doctors notes for the illnesses we have gotten due to unsuitable living conditions.
The paint on the baseboards are buckling due to flooding.
The back doors are completely rotten. 
The board the A/C unit sits on, in all units has been flooded and several of the A/C units sit crooked. The board is unstable.
The seals on the windows are damaged and the windows are not able to be seen through.
None of the apartments have been cleaned in regards to new carpet, professional cleaners coming out, painting, locks being replaced/changed between tenants, A/C and heating units being serviced between and during tenants and proper maintenance of the plumbing and electrical systems.
A fan fell out of the ceiling and hurt a tenant and was left for repair with bare wires that arced for a week.
I had to pay to have my lock on my front door fixed when it was the managers (that being Isbell) responsibility to do so.
Failure to live up to contracted responsibilites to the landlords they manage for.
Verna is a slumloard who teaches at CTC college. She states this on her website. She teaches business classes. CTC needs to be warned that she is a slumlord and remove her from their staff before she teaches new business students that it is ok to treat tenants in this manner.
Verna and Brittany and Josh will yell at you and treat you as if you were not a paying tenant.  For the record, I have always paid my rent in advance and have never been late. The other tenants have paid theirs in a timely fashion as well. To be degraded as a paying tenant in intollerable.Reports to the BBB have been made only to be told by the BBB that if we, the tenant, do not pay to have a professional come out and say yes this is an issue and they need to fix it out of our own pocket, we lose the BBB report and they find in favor of Isbell.

San Antonio, Texas United States of America ", , 864-274-2604,"Christi Messer  DEADBEAT MOTHER OF THE YEAR!!!   STILL..... San Antonio, Texas"," When I posted a little bit of information about Christi Messer about 3 years ago, she was a mere $5000 behind in child support. As of this date she is almost $18,000 behind in child support, in addition to the roughly $15,000 she will soon owe me for past attorney fees, travel expenses, etc. for my having to travel to and from TX to clear my name due to the false allegations she continues to make about me. See, I have custody of my daughters for good reasons and this is seen by her as a golden opportunity to make a better life for herself, excluding her daughters in almost every possible way. She still continues to send no child support, claiming that she gives me her $100 tax return each year (which the government strips her of because of her failing to help support her daughters financially, not to mention emotionally or in any other way), and ""what more do I want from her..... don't you understand that I'm a student....."", and any other excuse she can give to try to preserve her name. 
Christi Messer is manipulative, narcissistic, and I'm certain that she is an undiagnosed sociopath. Watch it if you have any interaction with her, business or personal, because she uses people to better herself in whatever way she can. She has caused my daughters much strife, stress, and emotional turmoil, only to blame me for all she can so that she feels justified in what she is not doing as a parent. Suffice it to say, she isn't even a ""part-time parent"" because of her consistent lack of communication with our daughters via birthday cards, Christmas gifts, or anything that makes a child feel special in the eyes of their parent. There was a book fair and me, being the Dad that I consistently strive to be, struggle with having to tell my girls no for anything (although it must be done at times). They asked me for book fair money and I gave them a few bucks. Their mother, Christi, told them on the phone that she'd send them $20 for the book fair. A week later she told them that it wouldn't get to them in time, which it would have if she'd sent it when she told them she was, so she decided to not send it at all. This is the type of thing that a child sees and in due time is able to form their own opinion about the types of situations they're placed in. However, as a Dad who struggles to provide everything for my daughters, it is very hard to not call a spade a spade - mommy is a liar. I bite my tongue as tough as it is. This is her character, don't let her snow you if you are involved with her in any way, and maybe one day the TX child support enforcement will do the right thing, being in the best interest of the children so they say, and hold Christi accountable for her actions. My suggestion for anyone looking to work with her in any way - look elsewhere so that you have peace of mind in knowing the truth. Don't be snowed by innocent words and the ""woe is me mother"" card she loves to play.  I have documentation to back up all I claim, including the fraud on the court she pulled when she drove to SC and yanked my daughters out of school, telling them they were never coming back so say bye. What kind of mother completely neglects her children and manipulates them in such terrible ways? WATCH OUT FOR HER!!! ",  Attorneys General

										On 4-26-12 cps took custody of my 4 children. 3 days prior my 14 year old son went to stay with his bi-weekend visit with his mother(ana smith) on his return date he never came home, we called the mother and she was evasive. We knew she was playing her old games! This has been going on since2004 anyways...the Tucson police came to our home for a welfare check on my other 3 children. Everything went great! Kids were in bed no marks, clean clothes, clean bedding, and "" home was emaculent"" the police spoke to my wife privately based on a tiny bruise on her cheek. She explained the two little babies were fighting and she stepped in between and the 4 year old whacked her with a type of lighted toy. The police were happy to leave, but before leaving they informed us that the 14 yesr old is affraid to come home and the mother is filing an order of protection. We explaibed the only reason he wants to stay with "" mom"" is because she is a doormat for this manipulative teen. In addition he recently got off of probation for threatening a tusd teacher, he said he wpuld kill her. Well...one week after the lame probation he was caught trespassing on a school that had been closed, 5 officers responded to a silent alarm. He and my 13 were together and both arrested. We later found out that they broke in to a classroom, well they lied to the police. I explained that when the 14 year old comes back from moms you are going to juvenile to tell them the truth and i hope they come down hard on you! On a side note probation for juveniles here in Tucson is weak! They are not consistent and they really don't care if the kids reform.so the police had a good idea of the caliber of the child and his mom. My wife and I kept waiting to get served on this order, to no avail! I called superior court family and was told there is no order, however; a hearing on the issue. I then explained to the Judge's clerk that i was going to the school to get my son with my parenting agreement to prove residential custody. I also said i will call TPD to keep the peace. Well...we went to the school with the two little ones myself and my wonderful wife! We were met with prejudices and bad attitudes, apparently my ex told the school that there is an active order against me (jim) well the problem is that i went to the school 3-5 times a week for my son and i was very active in his education. She had no proof of this made up order, we explained our position and we were very polite, furthermore my mother was also on scene. We waited while both parties ( me and school) called the police. A total of three hours elapsed while there we were guarded by two police officers, they watched us play and interact with the 4 -6 year old, my son even picked weed flowers for the lady officer. I was approached by CPS and they said they will be taking custody of Brandon14 year old, i had said that was fine! Only because he was also stealing from circle k last year and the other issues previously stated, maybe this will teach him a lesson? Well...they then told us they were taking all of my children!! I was pissed!!! Omg! You are not taking my f@&!@!* kids, i freaked out, my kids were being legally ripped off or kidnapped ss i say. They never interviewed my little ones or myself or my wife. We have only seen them three times since then, this was supervised sr CPS' office, our babies say they want to come home we can't tell them anything or the visit will terminate. They have not allowed recent visits for the last 2 1/2 weeks, we want to die!! We are so devastated!! We will keep or self safe to fight for the kids/babies. They are basically saying there is dv in our home and abuse and neglect, none of these allegations are false! I no longer want my 14 year old to live with us. He destroyed the family, all because his mother was too afraid to give him time out or ground him. We need help and just your support to stay strong.

People associated with the law office include DARRYL MITCHELL. Look them up on google, they both have a criminal records for scamming people out of money. When confronted, they both claimed they did not even know each other and that they were not partners in the law practice even though they are both listed on the business card.
OJ Odunna is NOT LICENSED to practice law in the state of Florida. Look him up the Florida Bar website. His license has been revoked. Darryl Mitchell has had disciplinary action taken against him by the Florida Bar for falsely claiming he could represent someone and did not do as claimed. He was ordered by the Florida Supreme Court to return the money he was paid for services not rendered. [continued below]....
									
										..... We have filed a complaint to the Better Business Bureau and have also filed a complaint with the Florida Bar. Do your research before you hire anyone to represent you. 
If you google OJ Odunna's name, he was one of the 25 lawyers disbarred for committing fraud and scamming people out of $374,000 in 2008. Darryl Mitchell was arrested in Broward County in February 2012. His father Marzell Mitchell was also disbarred for setting up false trust accounts and falsely underreporting income from his law office. This information is all available on the Florida Bar website as well as google. 
Specifically, these two prey on immigrants who do not know any better and are looking for a change in immigration status. They will take their money and promise them a green card, but do not file any paperwork. In addition, they will never give you an itemized receipt or detailed costs. They will ask you for large lump sums of money. OJ is known to disappear - when he calls you back, you will see he only calls from a Skype account and constantly changes his phone number. When he feels you realize he is stealing your money, he flies back to Nigeria and will not call you back. Darryl Mitchell will pretend he does not know who OJ is and will claim they are not partners since he knows it is illegal to have a non-lawyer practicing law under his law firm. These two have their scam down to a science. They know immigrants have so much to lose that they will not report them to the police, etc, so they continue to scam them out of their life savings since they cannot afford to hire an attorney to get their money back and they fear for deportation.

										Had the worst attorney experience with this law firm.  I thought I was getting the best out there.  He had everything right going for him on paper.  He was a part of Family Law associations, he preached a ""let's work together"" philosophy because I was already very active in my case at that point and felt I had enough knowledge, legal wise, but needed the professional to really push my case through and help get things done faster.  He asked for a profile, I did it, I doubt he even read it.  He asked that I fill out a form that outlined what I was asking for in the initial petition, they literally copied what I wrote word for word basically just adding the legal template and that they were representing me.    He never showed up to a court appearance even though that was discussed in our initial meeting, he sent his assistant, it was always something that came up.  One time the excuse was that he had a doctor's appointment, but of course he was too good to call to let me know that or even have the courtesy to have the receptionist let me know another person would just show up.  My point in all this is that this attorney gives a rat's behind about you.  As long as he knows you can pay and can pay for the long haul that's what his focus is, not about getting things done for you.  Court cases can be tedious and we all know things can take forever but when looking for an attorney, especially in Family Law, you should want someone who CARES.  This one does not.  The rebuttal to the other post about this attorney is probably the law office trying to cover their backsides.  There are pleasant people working in the office but the person they are working for is HORRIFIC.  I wouldn't trust him. 									",  Attorneys General

										 have been Hired by Teletech Pioneer Last October 24,2012 and had been working on my KPI's or stats to adhere with the company's rules and policy to keep my job. Unfortunately I am under preventive suspension right now for 30 days, no job and left my family starved to death. I actually don't have problem with it I can find a new job. It's just that the suspension that they're providing me is not justifiable at all for I was informed that I was already under investigation even from the time I started training with them for I have high volume of outbound calls since then. But I was asking why I wasn't informed about it? I am asking why wasn't I able to received not even a single feedback from supervisor or manager and could have had an action plan then? It could have been warning first to work on it and not preventive suspension.I felt that suspension is illegal and has no basis at all. They're complaining about me havin high outbound call volume for I am calling out customer specially when they're call is disconnected, troubleshooting and billing research just to help customer and set right expectations in resolving their concern but they have me flagged. I tried reaching out for the management to understand my issue and help me but I cant find no one not even the highest department people. I am writing all of this hoping that they can do something about this company particularly in the location I am employed with.They said after the case con that they will find a proof for the allegations even if it takes them to listen to all of my calls from the first time I took calls. I am just terrified is this the nature of the company? Is this a clear manifestation that if you dont like the person working They will find ways to terminate them? Is this how are you goin' to practice justice and due process? Suspend the agent right away?Din't I have the right to be informed? Din't I have the right to be coached? Or even developed by providing right feedback and action plans? Now that I am telling them that I will file a case against them they are calling the higher department to look for more grounds?This company sucks!!!!									",  Attorneys General

										I am writing this report about Gina Alford in the hopes that I can help someone avoid being scammed in the way Gina Alford scammed me.  She is a disreputable, dishonest and untrustworthy person who, like most scam artists, is a smooth talker and a convincing liar.  She gains your trust and friendship and then steals your money.  Here's my story:About a year ago I was looking for a show quality male cream sable Pomeranian and while searching I saw Gina Alford's Website on the Internet.  From the looks of her Website you would think that she was a reputable show breeder that breeds beautiful Poms. However, PLEASE, don't be fooled by her Website.  I initially e-mailed her, and after some time she called me and told me that she had a litter of puppies due soon.  In the next couple of days she called and told me they were born and there was a beautiful male puppy in the litter.  I discussed this puppy with her and after a couple of weeks she called and told me he was a show quality cream sable with AKC registration etc., so I decided to buy this puppy for $2,500 and sent her a deposit of $800.  After sending the deposit I asked for pictures of the puppy, but she always had some excuse why she couldn't send them to me.  Finally, when the puppy was 8 weeks old, we demanded pictures of him.  She sent me a few pictures of a puppy taken with her cell phone.  Because of the poor quality you couldn't even see what he looked like, but I trusted her representations that this was a show quality cream sable puppy.  She then asked for more money and, stupidly, I sent her another $1,000. (Please everyone do NOT do this when buying any puppy. Reputable breeders won't ask for this.)  She needed the money so I even paid $20.00 to mail the check next day.After sending Gina Alford the second payment I asked for more pictures, but Gina told me she worked by contract (not yet sent to me) and in her contract it states that she would not send out pictures until the puppy was 10 weeks old.  She also told me her contract stated that he was guaranteed to be show quality at 1 year of age.  She said the contract stated that if the dog was not show quality it would be replaced by a dog that was show quality.  So I waited until he was 10 weeks old and asked for pictures.  Again she refused.  We finally demanded pictures, and she then sent us a couple of pictures of a Pomeranian puppy.  We looked at the photos and the puppy looked nice but the color seemed orange, not cream.  By then we were getting suspicious, so we consulted with friends who are experts in show Poms, and their opinion was that based on the photos Gina sent to us this puppy was definitely orange, not cream sable.  But again, the photos were not the best quality, so we called Gina, told her our concerns and asked for more pictures that would clearly establish the puppy's color.  Gina was angry about our request for more pictures, but after stalling for a couple of weeks she finally sent us another picture.  This puppy was definitely cream sable, but to us it looked much younger and different than the puppy in the initial pictures.  Bottom line:  We didn't think it was the same puppy as the one shown in the first photos.  We again consulted with people who were experienced experts in Pom show dogs, and their opinion also was that the puppy in the second photo wasn't the same puppy as the one shown in the first photos.  He didn't have the same face, ear set, tail set, etc.At this time we also learned that this puppy had not yet been registered with AKC.  In fact, we learned that not only was the puppy not registered with AKC, but we also learned that the puppy's MOTHER had not yet been registered with AKC.  We were shocked by this fact, since Gina Alford had represented this puppy as AKC registered since the beginning of our discussions. So Gina was going to ship us a ""show puppy"" that wasn't AKC registered. My husband and I discussed the situation and decided that since we had already paid $1,800 on the dog our best option was to NOT let her ship the dog to us.  Instead, we would pick up the dog ourselves.  That way, if in fact it wasn't a show quality cream sable we could at least refuse final payment on the balance due and avoid shipping costs.  We called Gina Alford, told her we were going to New Orleans on vacation and that we wanted to pick up the puppy in person instead of her shipping him to us. She immediately got very ANGRY and told us that NOBODY ever came to her home to pick up puppies. She didn't allow that.  Then, she agreed to let us meet her somewhere to get the puppy, but she wanted us to send her the final payment before we picked up the puppy. Despite her protestations, we insisted that we would NOT agree to have her ship the puppy, insisted that we pick up the puppy in person and we told her we would not make the final payment until we saw the puppy.She yelled my husband and me for 10 minutes and then offered to refund our money.  We immediately accepted that offer.  She told us that before she would refund our money we MUST sign her contract, which we had yet to receive and had never seen.  When we got the contract we discovered there was no show guarantee in it, as Gina had previously claimed in her e-mail to me. There was also no clause in the contract regarding photos, as she had previously claimed.  After reviewing the sales contract, we refused to sign that document since it did not clearly establish our right to a refund.  Gina and Rick Alford then sent to us a revised contract that established they would refund our $1,800 in monthly payments of not less than $200 a month.  Under this contract, if payment was made we agreed not to take any legal or social actions against them. After executing this repayment contract, Rick and Gina Alford sent us three payments totaling $600 over five months and then defaulted on the contract.  During those five months, we sent numerous e-mails to them advising them of our willingness to resolve this matter in a friendly and amicable manner and telling them we did not want to harm them legally, socially or financially.  We told them we would work with them to resolve this matter.  During this time we learned by e-mail from Gina herself that she sold a puppy, but they clearly did not apply the proceeds of that sale toward their financial obligation to us.   Now, they have defaulted on the repayment contract that they themselves drafted, and we can't get any response from them.   They still owe us $1,200 that they received for a puppy they did not provide.  This is criminal fraud and we intend to file criminal complaints against them with the Mississippi Attorney General's Office, the FBI Internet Crime Unit and the Winston County (Mississippi) Sheriff's Office. We have documentation to support everything in this report and will gladly provide it to anyone who is interested in this case.  For anyone reading this report:  PLEASE do NOT allow someone to use ""friendship"" and smooth talk to convince you to forget about smart business practices.  If you're planning to do business with someone via the Internet, do your research BEFORE you send anyone money, no matter how ""nice"" or ""friendly"" they seem and no matter how professional the appearance of their Website.  If you're planning on buying an AKC puppy, buy only from reputable breeders.  Ask for and check references, do a Google search on their name and kennel and sign up for a breed forum and ask for people's opinions on the breeder.  We wish we would have.

										This letter is to file a complaint of misrepresentation I recently received from attorney Briley RichmondOn or about 24 July 2011, I was charged with simple assault and DUI 1st offense.  I entered a plea of not guilty on 1 September 2010, with the City of Diberville Municipal Court located on 10383 Auto Mall Pkwy, Diberville, MS 39540, which continued my case to the date of 3 November 2011. I called Mr. Richmond on 25 October 2011 to meet with him for possible representation. We both agreed to meet on the 27th of October.  He said he would call me back with a place to meet. I thought meeting outside of the usual office setting was a good way to establish rapport. On 27 October 2011, we met at Starbucks Caf located on 2404 Pass Rd Biloxi, MS 39531. He showed me all of his credentials to practice law in the state of Mississippi. I was pleased to know that he was involved in different fields of law which made me more comfortable to press on. I presented to him the abstract and case description for the DUI (The City of Diberville would not provide me a copy of the abstract for the simple assault because it was on a minor) (see attached abstract and case description).  He said that this case was easy because of the details that involved the arrest. I told him the court date was on the 3rd of November, but I can ask for a continuance so he can better prepare himself for the case. He said he did not need the extension but if it would make me comfortable than ask for the extension.  I called the court house on the 27th of October to ask for an extension. They advised me that I had to come in person to extend my court date. The date was extended to 17 November 2011.On or about 13 November 2011, we met in a park and ride located in Ocean Springs, MS right off of exit 50. I paid Mr. Briley Richmond $500.00 in cash to represent me (see attached receipt).  I thought it was unusual that we did not conduct this transaction in a business setting. I did not speak with him until 17 November 2011, the day of court. Mr. Richmond showed up for court and presented himself before the District Attorney as my lawyer.  He sits next to me and starts biting his thumb nail until it begin to bleed. Once he returns from the bathroom, he starts commenting on the two womans breasts wondering if they were real or not. I ignored his comments and asked about my case. He said he just read my abstract from the DA and he then shows me a piece of paper, that he clearly went on the internet to find, on what the state of Mississippi says in regards to the ins and outs of simple assault and anything that follows, with that charge, will not hold up in court because the simple assault would be dropped.  I told him that I have pictures of the victim staying at my residence and expressed that if you the mother felt that I posed a threat to her child than why would she ask my roommate to ask me to come and get her children. The victim in question resided at my residence on 14 November 2011 due to a family dispute. The mother of the victim called my roommate, Brittney Winkfield, and asks if I could come back and pick up her two children because her husband was threatening to shoot her in the head.  I originally was at her residence to pick up my roommate to bring her to school that evening. I turned around and picked up the children because I felt regardless of our pending issues that doesnt mean the children should be in that environment. Especially, since they had nowhere else to go to in such a small timeframe. The victim and her brother stayed the night at my residence. I took pictures of them at my residence to help with my case (see attached pictures). I also dropped the children off that morning before I went to work. The individual who pressed charges on me did not show up for court. I thought for sure the case would be dismissed. However, there was a continuance set for the 15th of December. Mr. Richmond told me they did have anything on me so they, the DA, asked for a continuance and I had nothing to worry about.  I called Mr. Briley Richmond several times that evening and early night. He returned my call around ten oclock. I ask him why he didnt ask for a dismissal. Mr. Richmond said the DA was concerned about how high my breathalyzer test was and wanted to research the case further. I did not like his answer, but since I didnt know the law I figured it was ok.On 15 December 2011, I showed up to court. Mr. Richmond was present but did not acknowledge me. I sat in the front of the court room adjacent to the victims parents. Mr. Richmond was in the back of the court room entertaining a young blond woman. After sitting in the courtroom for nearly two hours I received a text from Mr. Richmond stating that I did not have to be in court and he would take care of everything. We did not speak at all in person that day. I then receive a call from my roommate who informed me that he entered a plea of no contest. I did not authorize him to enter that plea on my behalf. I still wanted to plead not guilty for both charges. I called him several times and he did not return my call until around 9 p.m. I asked him why he pleaded no contest instead of not guilty; he did not answer my question. He said, Well, we are going to appeal the case to have everything thrown out and I will get with you about the appeal paperwork to process it. I called Mr. Richmond several times before Christmas and did not get a response. I was a bit concerned because of the holidays and things (i.e., paperwork) get lost. I called him on 27 December 2011 and he said that he was on vacation, that he will have the paperwork, and not to worry we have time. I called Mr. Richmond several times thereafter on his cell phone. The answering machine was full and I was unable to leave a message. I did not hear from Mr. Richmond until 10 Jan 2012.Mr. Briley Richmond called me on 10 January 2012 about the appeal paperwork. He asked when and where was a good time to meet. I thought it was odd that we never once met in an office to conduct business. On 11 January 2012 at 1600, I met with Mr. Richmond in yet another parking lot located across from the Hard Rock Caf on Beach Blvd. He hands me two pieces of paper and tells me to go to the court house, bring this paperwork, and call the person who bonded you out the first time. I said ok, and asked him for directions on how to get to the court house. When I arrived home I saw the condition of the paperwork. The paperwork was incomplete and unprofessional (see attached paperwork and photo of original condition). I was also convicted on both charges. I was flabbergasted because I did not know I was convicted for both charges. I called him about the paperwork once again his voice mail was full and I did not receive a call back.On 17 January 2012, I went to the County Court of Harrison County, Mississippi, Second Judicial District located on 730 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd, Biloxi, MS 39530. I presented the paperwork to the clerk and she explained to me that first my lawyer was suppose to file the paperwork within 30 days. She further explained after 30 day period has expired I can never try to motion for an appeal for this case again. I expressed to her that even with the holiday season it still applies and she replied, yes the 30 day period to file still applies. Second, she told me the paperwork he provided to me was not the proper paperwork required to file an appeal. Finally, she expressed to me that there were fees up to $500 that was to paid before filing the appeal. Mr. Richmond did not tell me any of this. I called him the same day and told him what the clerk said about who is to file the paper and he said, That is ludicrous. Administrative paperwork can be handled by anyone. Either I or you can do it, it a simple process. I also asked him why he did not tell me about the 30 day filing period and the fees. He said, I thought you were going up there the same day since you asked for directions. I told him, No I had something else to do and I asked for the directions so I can go up there on Tuesday. I called the court house in DIberville, MS, and spoke with a clerk. She told me that your lawyer should have known that after the 30 day period it is almost impossible to file an appeal. I asked the clerk what I had to do. She said I had to come in and get a court date for payment arrangements on both charges which totaled approximately $1,800.On 9 February 2012, I went to the City of DIberville court house and was ordered to pay $908.00 for the DUI 1st offense. This offense also includes an additional $170.00 in driving courses in order to get my license back for the state of Mississippi. The simple assault was postponed due to evidence that I presented, the same evidence I gave to Mr. Briley Richmond, to the DA concerning the case. The case was continued until 12 March 2012. I texted Mr. Richmond and asked why he did not show up for the case. He called me three days later and said, He did not know about the court date, and then asked if this court case was for new charges or the same charges. I told him it was for the same case. He said, Ok. I said, Everything will be taken care and I will keep you posted. I once again have tried to get in contact with Mr. Richmond only to receive a voicemail and no returned phone calls. I have not tried to contact him since 16 February 2012.I believe I was misrepresented throughout the entire case from Mr. Briley Richmond.  His lack of communication and work effort as described is below standards. I expected a much higher level of service from Mr. Richmond and I am quite disappointed.  I will be informing my friends and family about this experience.

										On june 28 2011 at 2340 hours i pulled in parking lot at parmatown mall.I sat in car and had a smoke before reporting to work.While in the car i noticed a red van with 2 black guys sitting in it parked by door1 rear entrance for employees.
Reported to work at 2350 hours to replace Douglas Shenek. Greeted him with How ya doin? He said ok and he hopes he did everything ok. This automatically put a question in my mind, so in a calm and normal voice i asked  Douglas is he locked door 1 and he said yes. Door 2? he said yes. Door 3? He said yes. Door 4? he said yes.Then i asked him about the red van and Douglas said he did not know.Then i asked him if he put the chain on the mall door by Walmart. This is when Douglas went berserk on me. He yelled at me in a very nasty and confrontational voice WHO ARE YOU TO QUESTION MY WORK.!!I stoped signing into my Daily Activity Report and sign in and looked at him in total disbeleif. I tried to talk to him and all i got out was  You just told, this was part of the sentance of you just told me you hoped you did everything right but i was cut off by DOUGLAS' ( WHO ARE YOU TO COME IN HERE ACTING LIKE A BOSS AND QUESTIONING MY WORK!!)Again i tried to speak to Douglas calmly and he stated the same comment loud and threatenenly. That is three times i tried to give him my answer and all the while i kept calm doing it.The third time he repeated it and started to walk toward me. We were separated by a flip up counter in the front security office. When he walked toward me i instintively stood up in a defensive move ,..not knowing if he was going to jump the counter or open it. I thought he was going to attack me. SAt this time Then i said to him in a not so nice voice,... If you would shut the(((REDACTED FOUL LANGUAGE))) and let me speak i will be able to tell you i am trying to help you and i am the guy here alone all nightand it is my life that is at stake on the overnight shift if you did not do everything correctly. I only used the f word in a defensive way to get his attention so i could speak, but the bosses did not see it that way. 
  Then Douglas said angrily and loud NOW YOU ARE TELLING ME TO SHUT THE(((REDACTED FOUL LANGUAGE)))? Then in same angry loud voice Douglas said  i CAN SEE IT IS GOING TO BE A PAIN IN THE ASS TO WORK WITH YOU and as he left he called me a jerk and left the office. That same night i found every door i asked him if he locked or chained them unloced and not armed. He lied and the boss Hupy let him get away with it. I was written up and fired.  I was making 11.00 per hour for 40 hours per week. Everyone else including Douglas was at 9 or 10 dollars  per hour. Douglas was written up and promoted to my position and not the same money i made. Also some history.
  January 11 2011,..fell on property of Parmatown mall performing my work checking out a dropped off semi trailer at rear of Marks discount store that had it's doors wide open and broke wrist. Was out of work . At this time i was a transfered employee fron parmatown owners and transfered to securitas.I was working for securitas when accident happened. Now workers comp came into the picture and everyone knows we are all punished for getting hurt on the job by receiving only 2/3 of pay. For  about three months off work. Financially destroyed. WEnt back earlier than doctor stated but with his permission. What Hupy let me beleive would be full time turned out to be 2 8 hour nights and had to perform all duties but classified as light duty. Then workers comp stopped and i had to hustle to get partial payment from workers comp to survive barley. Did any one from Securitas warn me what would happen? NO!! I had no idea.  When i got hurt,..we were all just starting to  learn the computer system in the front office and in the vehicle. When i returned i knew nothing and requested i be retrained not just thrown onto it. WEll Hupy just threw me onto it myself and told me to figure it out. I had alot of problems and got harrassed and reprimanded by Hupy. I filed a complaint with the main office of harassment by Hupy who was my boss. I was feeling picked on by him and it did not feel good. My wife noticed the change in me as well. To,..This all feels like a set up. You see,..when i was switched from parmatown security to securitas i was to keep my shift and hours and my pay which was 11.63 per hour. Securitas did not keep their end of the bargain. And i was informed of the agreement from My old boss Gary Outz that was informed by office personnel. I lost 63 cents when securitas took over. I lost my job on july 5. I really did not actually work for securitas security that long. I was hurt for 3 months and still am. I worked about 2 months and got fired and the person who started the whole incident got promoted.									",  Attorneys General

I wish I would have know what I know now I would have run a fast as I could out of his office. He will rip you off and settle your case and screw you out of the money you deserve. He will make you do all the work and then take most of your money. He cannot get any medical records anywhere in Idaho because he has ripped off most of the doctors offices and hospitals. I was told by St Lukes records office personally that he never paid for the records he received. 
He will not defend you and will delay your case simply by being too lazy to do his job. They have no clue what they are doing and will not return calls. They will settle your case for the first offer that makes them a profit irregardless  of whether or not you get enough money for you or your bills. After my case was ""settled"" I still owe THOUSANDS of dollars for my medical bills and he never bothered to try and get them reduced as he promised he would. He never even made an attempt to discuss how much I would be getting and when I brought it up Bryan would get very angry. He would claim that he would take less money as his fee to insure that his client received more than him. Would you be surprised to know that the only person who made money off of my injury case was HIM? I am in the hole and my credit is ruined but his wallet is a lot fatter.

I have ordered online for years, and I know the standard procedure.  You can add items to your cart, and you can take the first few steps to get a total and make a decision.I selected one pink and one grey Forever Lazy in my ""cart"".  When I entered my address in order to find out how much shipping would cost, it had the credit card field first.  I remember thinking it was very unusual to ask for a credit card up front, but I thought to myself as I am not submitting the form or proceeding, my information is safe just to get a total.  I realized that the shipping seemed kind of high and it would cost around $65 for the 2 items.  I decided that the cost was too high and I closed out the browser.  I then closed out the Internet Explorer.I went back in and found a much cheaper option, a fleece blanket, and I ordered that instead.To my shock, about a week later, a large bag showed up at my door.  I opened it and realized there were four ""Forever Lazy"" blankets inside, 2 pink and 2 grey.  I was completely baffled and shocked as to how this had arrived when I had never placed an order!  I searched for paperwork in the bag but there was none.  It did not go unnoticed that they provided absolutely no contact or return information.I contacted the company immediately to complain.  I explained to the person from the company that I did not submit an order.  He informed me casually that the website is set up so that if you close out your browser, it will put the order through!I informed him that I have never heard of this and it seems fraudulent as I did not knowingly place an order, there was no review, no submit, no confirmation page, nothing!  He told me to write ""return to sender"" and bring the package back to the post office.I was charged $99.72 for these 4 unwanted items.  I felt absolutely sick and robbed.  I returned the package to the post office, scared that the company would deny ever receiving the items back.  I had no papertrail where the package was concerned.  I waited about 10 days.  I finally saw an e-mail stating they had received the package and issued me a refund.I checked my credit card and to my disgust, they only refunded me $65.14.  They stole about $35 from me!  I have contacted my credit card company to file a dispute and I have tried calling the company but was placed on hold and disconnected.  I am calling again on Monday.I feel as though someone knocked me down and stole my wallet.  I have seen many complaints like mine, either people who didn't put their order through, couldn't return the items, or were mislead into thinking they were only buying 2 when in fact they ship out 4, 2 in each color.  Why isn't someone looking into this?I am having a horrible time even finding anything out about this company.  They are shady beyond shady.

										Sweet Innocent Lady was battered by a criminal fleeing from police in a police chase in Riley County Kansas 0n 4-17-2005, while on her way to work, going through a green light on Fort Riley BLVD in Manhattan, Kansas.  The Police chased the criminal in the city limits of Manhattan Kansas and gave no precautions or preventions to not have the USA citizens be endangered from the criminal they were chasing down with their police cars.  The police chase had highspeeds of 70pmh and no streets were blocked off or regulated during their chasing down that criminal who ran a red light and impacted that innocent lady's body and car with permanent damages.  The county attorney's crime victim's/witness division was given a claim of damages to be paid by this lady and the county gave her no assistance to recover financial, medical, property and other life essential damages.  In fact they gave false representation, since they hid from her the goings on of the case and how the case enolved.  They provided NO assistance to her in any way.  And now they say there was no form recieved to them on time.  This lady seeks restitution and wants to have this matter settled fairly and collect full financial costs for all she endured and she is still suffering from the injuries inflicted on her from that happening.It seems to her that people in job positions ought to take a stand on this issue and speak up and take pride in being able to produce fair payment to her, since it ought to be the True American way of life.  She has difficulty sitting and standing for short periods of time and has to constantly reposition herself to withstand sitting and standing so she can have less pain issues and more range of motion.  She had to work her drive-thru window job just few weeks after this injury happened since the doctors she was appointed to did not want her to be off work.  Her injuries worsened, since she had to work with fractured ribs, shallow breathing, broke fibula, sprained neck, bruises, bloody gashed knee, non moving stiff hips, broken toe, bumped forehead, multiple spine issues, sciatic nerve pain from waist to toes on both legs, her knees were out of place in 3 different places, her ankles out of place in 5 different places, her hips out of place in 3 different places.  The weight of the headset was too heavy for her and she could not even sit down a second without huge pain and strain and had to keep moving to alternate positions to lessen the pain.Seems the police, the county, the crime vicitims division of that county ought to have spoke up for her in her defense from that criminal battering her with damages.  A simple sorry is not acceptable for payment to her.  Seems someone ought to take a closer look at this tragedy and give this matter the attention it deserves and pay this very fine lady what is owed to her and accomodate her with future medical essentials and assist her to find gainful employment with an employer who can give her hope for her financial future, as she has to provide for herself.She is a rather tough lady and she has a high level of ambition.  Seems she tuffed out this tragedy with her strong ambition towards life and she is a Christian.

										To potential Village Communities employee/tenant:
If your thinking about taking on a job with Village communities in Columbus, Ohio please wait until you hear my story. I started working for Village Communities in Oct 2005 but in Sept 2006 I was laid off by them or as they called it corporate downsizing. Within 30 days of my termination as an office receptionist I moved out of my small 1 bedroom apartment that I lease from them. So after being let go I moved out for two reasons. First, It was weird living in a  apartment complex where I had worked with so many of my ex -colleages. Secondly, I was unable to afford my rent. Since they let me go just a few days before the rent was due with a severance of only a couple of weeks of pay I had to move back home to parents house to make ends meet. 
Fast forward five years to where we are now: They are still trying to collect $3367.30 for breaking a lease for my apartment after they fired me. They even have had their in house Bill Collector from Ardent Proprty Management T.C. call and harass me to pay them the money and sending letters threating litigation.
 I just want everyone to know that this company sucks and so do their properties, but most importantly you dont want to work for them. Trust me I know I was the office receptionist who took all the complaint calls. Sadly,  I feel that I am not the only employee that has gotten terminated,fired, downsized, or let go by village community and then gone after for remaining balance on their lease. Like I said I was a receptionist so I fielded alot of angry phone calls to include ex-employees calling in about owing thousands of dollars to Village Communities cause they lost there jobs there and now where being forced to move out. 
Well I hope this helps to make you decision clearer for you.									",  Attorneys General

There's water leaks and water intrusion when it rains.  They had people removing some molds and were throwing the moldy materials from what had to be 6 or 7 apartments in the dumpster.  So now everyone got a good dose every time they threw stuff away.   Other tenants were promised a whole wall would be removed for mold but that never happened, so who knows how much is still there.
People have lost personal belongings due to mold and water damage, pipes leak and yet one of my friends that also moved out has never gotten a phone call back about the items he lost.   The most toxic molds you can imagine are in fact at this property.  Before moving there were citations from Environmental health.  So that should tell you something.   Another friend I had there had water pouring into his tub from the upstairs bath drain.   That went on for years he said.   It's a nice neighborhood with mostly great people and in a good location but I wouldn't let anyone I care about live there.

 The following letter was sent to Utah authorities by my business directors
 
January 14, 2008
 
RE:  Joseph Paul Ottis and Globee Products
FROM: From a Globee Board Member
 
To whom it may concern,
Let me explain some of the background and facts as I understand them that you may or may not already know.
A serious incident occurred in Utah when Robert Frank and the Rip Off Report interfered with one of Pauls relationships.  A project partner with Paul got wind of the Rip Off Report blogs that were posted by Robert Frank and withdrew money from Ottiss bank account using a counter check without authorization.  She believed the content in Robert Franks blogs and she broke the law withdrawing $67,000.00 out of Ottiss business account.  
David Drake, a lawyer in Salt Lake City, Utah gave notice to Dian Lind that actions for embezzlement and prosecution both civil and criminal were being filed.   Ms. Lind served solely as an emergency signer and had no authorization to access the account on her own.  Pauls Nebraska lawyer a Mormon persuaded Paul to stop this action because Dian Lind was also a Mormon.   Paul conceded and the case was dropped.  Two years later Dian Lind came after Paul to collect on an outstanding note that Paul had refused to pay due to prior losses caused by Ms. Lind.  She pursued Paul on a civil complaint with the State of Utah to get her note paid.  Pauls lawyer addressed the complaint and accused Utah of abusing its authority.  The lawyer demanded the withdrawal of the claim and that Utah pay damages to Paul including attorney fees. 
After the counter claim was filed, The State of Utah secretly escalated the case and blindside Mr. Ottis with criminal charges not notifying his lawyer and sending a Fugitive Task Force to arrest him.  This gross violation of rights was an egregious and unprecedented act by the Utah prosecutors.  The Assistant Attorney General, Mr. Neal Gunerson is an example of government gone wrong.  It was discovered that Mr. Gunerson had a file of abuse of authority and false prosecution and that he had been demoted by his department for such acts.   He had also been found guilty of such acts in a Utah court.   Another example of Mr. Gunersons foul play can be found in the Newsletter of the Utah Division of Securities, and official publication of the State of Utah, dated October 2007 which reads:
July 26, 2007. Criminal charges were filed by the Attorney General against Joseph Paul Ottis for taking $180,000 from a senior citizen, claiming the money would be used to develop a childrens television program focusing on preserving the earth and finding missing children. Ottis claimed he was negotiating with Disney and Nickelodeon for the television program. Ottis is charged with securities fraud and exploitation of an elder adult. The victim did recover $66,278, but is still owed over $110,000.
I find this inflammatory, erroneous and an example of trying a person before they are given a chance to disprove allegations.  Unfortunately, Mr. Ottis is not the only one that is in essence being legally extorted in Utah.  There are many others victims of the States own system of extortion.  Mr. Ottis was threatened with 40 years in prison if he took Utah to trial and lost his case.  Having already experienced Utahs corruption, he feared for his welfare and he settled and paid the note in full.  One week later prosecutor Wayne Klein dubbed Utahs Top Copthat had filed against Mr. Ottis resigned under threats of being terminated and prosecuted for abuse of authority.  Mr. Ottis served as a witness against Utah providing documents to (R) Jim Bird in a formal investigation conducted by the Utah House of Representatives.  The New York Times published a story on January 6, 2009 reporting Utah being ranked as Americas 15th most corrupt government. 
Pauls lawyers, one of them being a former Senator, were convinced that the charges were preposterous, inflated and that Ms. Lind had in fact, perjured herself in a vendetta against Mr. Ottis.  The fact that the civil charges initially proposed were dropped may indicate that the Division of Securities in Utah was aware that they had made a mistake.  I believe the bank acted with collusion against Mr. Ottis if not embezzlement on Ms. Linds part.  In addition Utah used fabricated content posted by Robert Frank on Rip Off Report as evidence in the case.  
The very fact that prominent people including a former Senator and a retired FBI Special Agent in charge over 750 FBI agents in Los Angeles worked for Ottis on this case supporting him seems to contradict the veracity of Ms. Linds statements and Utahs actions.  One would think that Utahs prosecutors would have the ability to discover someones background and character.  I have never known Mr. Ottis to lie about his business or misrepresent himself or his projects.   In fact I know it be true on more than one occasion when people were investing in his works, he told them not to put any of amount money into his projects that they couldnt throw out of the window of a car, because all business is a risk. 
I feel the truth was grossly twisted and misrepresented by the State of Utah, and in particular, by Ms. Diane Lind, who I highly suspect perjured herself and not the least of which provided incomplete, incorrect, and false statements against Mr. Ottis.
I further feel that the state of Utah and Ms. Lind and possibly Zion First National Bank (Salt Lake City) and its representatives severally be held liable in a class action suit for our damages suffered, caused by their actions.
I have written this letter to document my concern that Mr. Ottis has been wronged by a psychotic blogger and railroaded.   Dozens of investors like myself, small and big along with Mr. Ottis have lost significant finances and opportunities in what it has taken nearly ten years to build.   Mr. Ottiss works speak highly of his capabilities, his dedication to his work and his accomplishments.   I believe if it were not for the indignant people that have attack him that his works would have been successfully sold and all of his investors would have realized great returns long ago.  We remain ready to one day confront Robert Frank and prosecute him and bring other parties to court including the State of Utah.

Concerned Board Members of Mr. Ottis business. ",  Attorneys General

But most sales managers TRAIN their suvordinates how to achieve the goals properly. Not at PES. The sales manager is entirely incompetent. Non-communicative. Mean-spirited. Hires and fires on a whim. Has an ""inner-crcle"" of three female, die-hard alcoholic employees who feed him hearsay and drama. (After they ""befriend"" coworkers to glean personal details.) Which he loves. He micromanages to a stifling extreme. Once an employee outside his circle churns tp enough potential business, he fires them and hands the boiling hot leads to his Evil Trinity members. Who rip each other apart on a regular basis -- like pitbulls on crack. The workplace is a dirty battlefield at PES. Sales leads stolen. Clients misinformed. Anything to land a deal.The CEO/CFO/Whateverhecallshimselfthisweek advised me that he encourages female emps to offer ""favors"" or at least phone sex to potential cllient prospects.Not a big shock. He propositions his underlings frequently.Added to these issues, PES never issues performance reviews, pays poorly and changes the comp package constantly, Refuses ro offer plans for improvement to syruggling staffers and has such a lousy reputation in Spokane that I took them off of my resume. What do I want out of this? I want PES to fire or reassign their sales manager. He is a laughingstock. I want PES to hire ONLY for retention. I want PES to fire their Evil Trinity. I want PES to be fair in iy's practices. The cirizens of Spokane are good people. Hard workers. We need our jobs. Knowing that my above wishes will not be granted, I at least want job candidates to know the truth.									",  Attorneys General

										PNC HAS CHANGED THE TERMS OF MY FIXED RATE AUTO LOAN AND THEN LIED ABOUT IT.  THEY HAVE LIED SO MANY TIMES SAYING THEY DID NOT RECIEVE A PAYMENT WHEN MY BANK SAYS THEY CASHED THE CHECK...THEN THREATENING ME TO GIVE THEM ADDITONAL PAYMENTS OR THEY WILL REPOSSESS THE CAR.  IT IS CONSTANT.  
THE WHOLE POINT OF GETTING A FIXED LOAN RATE IS THAT IT IS FIXED!  PNC CHANGED MY MONTHLY LOAN AMOUNT AND THE PAYMENT DUE DATE. AND THEN SENT NEW PAYMENT COUPONS THAT STATE IT IS NOT LATE UNTIL AFTER THE 15TH OF EACH MONTH, BUT THEY CHARGE A LATE FEE AFTER THE 5TH AND REPORT IS AS LATE TO CREDIT BUREAUS, AND OF COURSE, ADD ON THEIR LATE FEE ON THE 5TH.  MY LOAN WAS FIXED, AND DUE ON THE 15TH OF THE MONTH, NOW I GET CHARGED A LATE FEE IF NOT PAID BY THE 5TH. 
I CALLED TO ASK THEM, WHY DO I NEED NEW COUPONS IF YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED THE LOAN AND THEY WOULD NOT GIVE ME A STRAIGHT ANSWER.  THEN THEY TACKED ON A $20/MO FEE CLAIMING I DID NOT HAVE CAR INSURANCE SO THEY ATTACHED A FEE TO PROVIDE CAR INSURANCE ON THE LOAN (MY CAR HAS NEVER HAD LAPSED COVERAGE AND I SENT THEM THE DECLARATIONS PAGE SEVERAL TIMES TO PROVE IT).  THEN THEY SAID I COULD CALL THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT TO GET THE EXTRA MONEY CHARGED EACH MONTH BACK, AND THAT DEPARTMENT TOLD ME THEY HAD NEVER ONCE CHARGED MY LOAN OR ACCOUNT FOR ANY INSURANCE.  
SO.....NOT ONLY DID THEY CHANGE MY FIXED LOAN, FIXED RATE AND TERMS OF MY LOAN, THEY TACKED ON A $20 FEE ON TOP OF MY REGULAR CAR PAYMENT THAT NO ONE WILL TELL ME WHAT IS FOR OR GIVES ME A RUN AROUND TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT CLAIMING ANOTHER PNC DEPT. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADDED FEES.  ROUND AND ROUND SHE GOES. NO ONE CAN TELL ME WHY I HAVE TO PAY AN EXTRA FEE AND EVERY TIME I CALL I GET A DIFFERENT REP THAT LIES ABOUT IT SOME MORE.  WHEN I MADE A REGULAR CAR PAYMENT AND DIDN'T PAY THE MYSTERY $20 ADDED FEE ON A LATE CAR PAYMENT, THEY SAID I WAS $20 SHORT THAT MONTH AND USED IT TO REPOSESS MY CAR.    
WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS THIS.  PNC PAID A REPO CO. $345 TO REPOSSES MY CAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN REPOSESSED - SO THEY COULD CHARGE ME $2000 TO GET IT BACK (WHEN LESS THEN $400 WAS OWED) - ALL GREED AND BAD, CROOKED PRACTICES!  PNC SUCKS.  I WILL DO WHATEVER I HAVE TO TO REFINANCE MY CAR. I WILL NEVER BANK OR DO ANY BUSINESS WITH PNC EVER AGAIN.  PNC EMPLOYEES CROOKS AND LIARS.

It is my hopes that the news media will pick this story up and expose this American success story and how the founder and builder of the company Clay Blehm was robbed by the other two partners and Quiksilver! and bring justice to this 78 year old sweet man.Clay is living in poverty while the young men that he made RICH and FAMOUS are living a great life.  Belowis the story that will stand truebefore any court in America! Clayhas all of the documents !!! Following a full year of Lies, Deceitful and Misleading recommendations and secret negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service by Attorney Clancy Wilson and his hired Attorney/CPA Thomas A. Reid, all of which was designed to intentionally engineer the transfer of Two and One Half Million of Taxes, Penalties and Interest, already claimed by the IRS from their Client DC Shoes, instead to Clayton D. Blehm, also their Client. Reid and Wilson entered into a formal agreement with the IRS to Accomplish their dastardly deed and Destroy the Seventy Year Old Senior Founder of DC Shoes, life and planned retirement after Ten Long Years of Directing DC Shoes from an idea of a couple of uneducated and inexperienced Skate Boarders to an extremely profitable Company doing 100 Million Dollars in annual sales and netting a sale price of just under 160 Million Dollars after only nine years of operations.  Irrefutable documentary evidence of an agreement with the IRS to settle the DC tax matters of 1998, 1999, and 2000 under IRS Section 3509 on July 15, 2003 and a further confirmation of said agreement signed and dated by Clancy Wilson on August 14, 2003. These negotiations and agreement were concealed from Clayton Blehm despite Blehm's repeated inquiries of Clancy Wilson and other representatives of DC Shoes.  On August 20, 2003, Blehm and the DC Shoes Parties signed a settlement agreement whereby DC Shoes promised to pay the 2.5 Million Dollars of Taxes, Penalties and Interest which they all knew they would never pay because they had negotiated themselves out of responsibility to pay the IRS Claims over a month before the Settlement Agreement was signed.  The Settlement Agreement was thus a fraudulent inducement for Clayton Blehm to sell his one-third interest in DC Shoes for only 4.5 Million Dollars plus other considerations which were represented to Equal Nineteen Million Dollars by Brian Wright the Corporate Attorney of DC Shoes.A few months later, Quicksilver agreed to buy 100% of DC Shoes for almost $160,000,000.00 which was split between Kenneth Block and Damon Way, the owners of the other Two Thirds ownership of DC Shoes.Blehm was cheated out of his 1/3 interest of $53,333,334.00.  Quiksilver was aware of the organized conspiracy to cheat Blehm, and joined in readily to finalize the deed. Quiksilver paid Blehm the 4.5 million Dollars due him on May 1, 2004 and closed the escrowwith Damon Way and Kenneth Block for just under 160 Million Dollars on the very same day. Commitments by Quiksilver in their sale agreement with Ken and Damon, which Blehm was required to approve included various inducements to Blehm such as a Six Million Dollar holdback to pay Blehm's Employment Taxes and repeated passages reminding the reader of the DC Obligation to pay the Blehm Taxes.  All of the proof documenting the above conspiracy was known to all of the parties named as defendants. The bound books of exhibits received from Larry Campitielloprove his access and possession of the 3509 Agreement with the IRS which preceded the August 20, 2003 Settlement Agreement between Blehm and the DC parties. James Peterson directed the negotiations regarding the Blehm/DC Settlement Agreement as DC's attorney and after the Agreement was signed, entered into an escrow agreement to hold Blehm's DC stock, pending completion of the terms of the settlement agreement.  As DC's attorney, he knew of the 3509 IRS Settlement, and of the subsequent assessment of the taxes, penalties and interest actually required to be paid by DC Shoes which was levied against DC Shoes on April 5, 2004, in the paltry amount of $250,000.00. This levy was awaited with interest by the DC Shoes parties and Quiksilver who had made receipt of the levy a prerequisite of closing the escrow.  Also of note to assure that Blehm did not discover the dirty deeds being perpetrated against him by the DC parties and their attorneys, the DC/Blehm August 20, 2003 escrow agreement with Higgs Fletcher & Mack, was amended after the Quiksilver purchase agreement was signed, whereby the original requirement for Blehm to authorize the release of his DC stock was dispensed with.  Thus, James Peterson, the DC Attorney and Blehm's Escrow agent was free to transmit Blehm's stock to Quiksilver, while he fully knew that DC would never pay the Blehm employment taxes required in the August 20, 2003 Settlement Agreement between DC and Blehm/FDC. His obvious conflict of interest should be enough to relieve him of his license to practice law. Blehm's attempts to get an escrow closing statement out of him have proved futile. He apparently fears that something done at the close of escrow may serve to incriminate him.  One positive result to Blehm's credit resulted from the Stipulation required in the August 20, 2003 Settlement Agreement, whereby Larry Campitiello and James Peterson, no doubt unintentionally, provided Blehm with this opportunity to re-open this sad state of greed and dishonesty, despite Larry Campitiello's loss of Blehm's right to appeal by allowing the time to expire to file a notice of intention to appeal.  Larry was constantly reminded of that deadline by Clayton Blehm and ignored the expiration of the time limit. Amazingly, the Stipulation filed by Peterson and Campitiello, immediately following the signing of the August 20, 2003 Settlement Agreement, provided for a preliminary dismissal of the Complaint  Clays Blehms Loss of participation in the Quiksilver Sale by the underhanded acts of Ken Block, Damon Way and Quicksilver was $53,333,334.00.

This levy was awaited with interest by the DC Shoes parties and Quiksilver who had made receipt of the levy a prerequisite of closing the escrow.  Also of note to assure that Blehm did not discover the dirty deeds being perpetrated against him by the DC parties and their attorneys, the DC/Blehm August 20, 2003 escrow agreement with Higgs Fletcher & Mack, was amended after the Quiksilver purchase agreement was signed, whereby the original requirement for Blehm to authorize the release of his DC stock was dispensed with.  Thus, James Peterson, the DC Attorney and Blehm's Escrow agent was free to transmit Blehm's stock to Quiksilver, while he fully knew that DC would never pay the Blehm employment taxes required in the August 20, 2003 Settlement Agreement between DC and Blehm/FDC. His obvious conflict of interest should be enough to relieve him of his license to practice law. Blehm's attempts to get an escrow closing statement out of him have proved futile. He apparently fears that something done at the close of escrow may serve to incriminate him.  One positive result to Blehm's credit resulted from the Stipulation required in the August 20, 2003 Settlement Agreement, whereby Larry Campitiello and James Peterson, no doubt unintentionally, provided Blehm with this opportunity to re-open this sad state of greed and dishonesty, despite Larry Campitiello's loss of Blehm's right to appeal by allowing the time to expire to file a notice of intention to appeal.  Larry was constantly reminded of that deadline by Clayton Blehm and ignored the expiration of the time limit. Amazingly, the Stipulation filed by Peterson and Campitiello, immediately following the signing of the August 20, 2003 Settlement Agreement, provided for a preliminary dismissal of the Complaint  Clays Blehms Loss of participation in the Quiksilver Sale by the underhanded acts of Ken Block, Damon Way and Quicksilver was $53,333,334.00.

Clayhas all of the documents !!!   Following a full year of Lies, Deceitful and Misleading recommendations and secret negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service by Attorney Clancy Wilson and his hired Attorney/CPA Thomas A. Reid, all of which was designed to intentionally engineer the transfer of Two and One Half Million  of Taxes, Penalties and Interest, already claimed by the IRS from their Client DC Shoes, instead to Clayton D. Blehm, also their Client.   Reid and Wilson entered into a formal agreement with the IRS to Accomplish their dastardly deed and Destroy the Seventy Year Old Senior Founder of DC Shoes, life and planned retirement after Ten Long Years of Directing DC Shoes from an idea of a couple of uneducated and inexperienced Skate Boarders to an extremely profitable Company doing 100 Million Dollars in annual sales and netting a sale price of just under 160 Million Dollars after only nine years of operations.    Irrefutable documentary evidence of an agreement with the IRS to settle the DC tax matters of 1998, 1999, and 2000 under IRS Section 3509 on July 15, 2003 and a further confirmation of said agreement signed and dated by Clancy Wilson on August 14, 2003. These negotiations and agreement were concealed from Clayton Blehm despite Blehm's repeated inquiries of Clancy Wilson and other representatives of DC Shoes.    On August 20, 2003, Blehm and the DC Shoes Parties signed a settlement agreement whereby DC Shoes promised to pay the 2.5 Million Dollars of Taxes, Penalties and Interest which they all knew they would never pay because they had negotiated themselves out of responsibility to pay the IRS Claims over a month before the Settlement Agreement was signed.    The Settlement Agreement was thus a fraudulent inducement for Clayton Blehm to sell his one-third interest in DC Shoes for only 4.5 Million Dollars plus other considerations which were represented to Equal Nineteen Million Dollars by Brian Wright the Corporate Attorney of DC Shoes.    A few months later, Quicksilver agreed to buy 100% of DC Shoes for almost $160,000,000.00 which was split between Kenneth Block and Damon Way, the owners of the other Two Thirds ownership of DC Shoes.Blehm was cheated out of his 1/3 interest of $53,333,334.00.    Quiksilver was aware of the organized conspiracy to cheat Blehm, and joined in readily to finalize the deed. Quiksilver paid Blehm the 4.5 million Dollars due him on May 1, 2004 and closed the escrowwith Damon Way and Kenneth Block for just under 160 Million Dollars on the very same day. Commitments by Quiksilver in their sale agreement with Ken and Damon, which Blehm was required to approve included various inducements to Blehm such as a Six Million Dollar holdback to pay Blehm's Employment Taxes and repeated passages reminding the reader of the DC Obligation to pay the Blehm Taxes.    All of the proof documenting the above conspiracy was known to all of the parties named as defendants.

Wow! post saint lucie, Florida","  I  just thought i would take a minute to let everyone know about my experience with this law firm that call themselves Steinger Iscoe & Green. On May 22nd 2008 I was involved in aaccident shortly after I went out and retain Steinger Iscoe & Greene for legal reprsentation. In the beginning I was assign to Attorney Jeffery Rollins.Almost two years later from that date my case had been set to go to trial about three times. About couple of weeks before my trial date I  met with Senior attorney Sean Greene, Micheal Fiener as Co- counsel.After being pressured to settle my case several times and theaten that if I didn't settle Steinger Iscoe and Greene would with draw. I began to not trust this company.On May 19th i recieve a call from Attorney Sean Greene, MIcheal Feiner, and Jeffery Rollins asking me what time I was coming into their PSL offie to meet with them. I than informed all three attorneys on the conference call that I would not be coming to met with them unless I could record the conversation. Sean Greene Speaking as a SENIOR ATTORNEY ON BEHALF OF sig SAID FINE! that's not a problem.So My husband , two year old daughter and I went into the PSL office shortly after to discuss the case.I refuse to settle once again and I advice the law firm at that time that I would be filing a Florida Bar complaint because the way their stories change and their unethinical habits I wasn't comfortable with. A week later I recieve a notice in the mail were Jeffery Rollins filed for Distructive Discharge. The court date came and the judge advise this attorney to either represent or withdraw from the case. Three days later I reieve a notice for withdrawl with cause. On that day in court the withdrawl motion was heard Jeffery Rolllins told advise the court that the evidence I submitted to the judge was illegal without his knowledge , therefore Jeffery Rollins stated that he had contacted the PSL Police department in Ref to criminal Investigation for illegal recorded conversation. Now I found this to statement be so convient.This evidence didn't become illeagal into I submitted it to the judge to prove that SIG hadr efuse me my day in court.Ok so than I was contacted and asked to come down to the PSL police department to give a statement ,which I did about two weeks later I was arrested at 4:00am in the morning in front of my four kids and husband and charged Unlawful comminications with a device. Remind you this is A felony charge if Iam convicted. Now it's my belief that SIG attorneys Sean Greene, Jeffery Rollins and Micheal Feiner had me arrested hoping I would walk away for my Florida Bar Compalint and this civial case. It's funny how they use this blond lady in the commericial saying.""You won't pay a dime.Unless we win your case."" two weeks after SIG dropped my case.A lien was file against my case.What a contradiction. I have had my share of  it all. I am Married, a mother of four, college educated,all of the above if they did this to me imagine what they'll do to you.Choose Your legal representation wisely.

The problem is that when the insurance company settled the lies his office was telling and the money they still owe me and the unprofessionalism of this attorney leaves a lot to be desired. The lawyer was to get 33 1/3% and the balance was mine.  I got a call from his office stating that I could come and pick up the check, I went and opened the envelope and all of these medical bills totaling $6690.00 plus $95.72 for medical records were deducted from the check.  There was no prior mention of this fee or that I would be cheated in the retainer. There was even a charge of $1007.00 from the emergency room (that my insurance had paid already in the amount of $130.00) but the $1007.00 was deducted from my portion of the check.  I ahve a copy of the payment to the emergency room from my insurance and I sent a copy to his office. The check stated bodily injury and I spoke with the insurance company and they pay the doctors.  I do not know what type of an attorney cheats his own clients but, this one does.  He owes me $3596.69 and I want it.  I am the injured party here.

										UPS admitted fault. They ran a stop sign and almost killed me.

Playing games and getting video of me doing what I said I COULD DO 6 months prior testimony. Games in court and trying to introduce evidence they did not disclose. Underhanded tactics by tomas getchell at troub heisler law firm in portland maine and even shadier practices by UPS and liberty mutual to try and not pay. They pay 18 million a year in parking tickets in NYC alone.... do you know why? because they feel they are large enough that the laws dont apply to them and it is a cost of doing business and making a profit. If you have to park illegally or run a stop sign, they say it is ok. Just as long as we are profitable. I beleive the state of maine court system is flaued when the atty representing UPS stipulates to the fact they did it and said we did hurt him and then the rouge jury falls asleep during testimony for me and gives a 0 verdict. Then we appeal and the judge says, no thats fine. It makes total sense that the defendent says we owe him something and we did it.... and the jury says I get 0. Medical alone was almost 100k.

 Road dawgs ,"  Road dawgs  317 COURTNEY CIRCLE 
BRANDON, Mississippi United States of America ", , ,"Road dawgs CIA,FBI,INS,DEA i AM NOT DEAD BRANDON, Mississippi"," We used to live in Mississippi. We moved a couple of months ago. There was a crime,  Or It was really botched. Its a long story that started in 2007 in the Robinhood community. I hope you can understand my story It is  long and I am not good on sentences and fragments. It all started in august 2008. I went back and got my insurance license . The school instructor gave me the wrong book a massachutes book with the wrong name they also changed the date to 911 the instructor said he would tell me about it later., his friend that was sitting in the class room said you must be pretty important for them to do this. I then had a store fire on thanksgiving day.      We used to own a convience store. I made commits in that store not knowing a man they call Santa clause was wired and worked for the sheffirs department.  I know this because we became good friends and he said they were cutting the wires from being tapped.  Well one day a guy came in the store and started bragging about a 100 bodies by a lake. He was shown as a child  I am not sure if it was the kkk or a detective fishing for information. I called the FBI and blocked my number because I am not a rat. Which I found later in my dictionary that it was underlined rat, who doesnt know how to spell rat.      I used to be an insurance agent. One day I got a call from another Missy I used to work with. She wanted me to come over because the big guy from insurance was coming over her house. I was unhappy already in my marriage because my husbands family was jealous of our good fortune and they tried everything in the book to get money from us or break us up.     During the visit Missy asked me questions and I noticed she had a recorder because she pushed a button to turn it off. She knew their  was a lot of crime in the area we lived in and I told her stuff. Their was also A klan and meth gang that got busted. They were moving in the area we lived in. they got busted that was the first time I saw a tag that said CIA. Any way during this time we were going to buy restore a resort in the community. I noticed the investigation going on for that. You should have seen it.  We backed out of the resort because it just wasnt safe I had a guy say out of the blue buzzards were going to keep picking at me until I was dead, It was the way he said it The  banks quit lending money at that time or so they told us. I should have knew  then that our phone was tapped. A lady names Judy tried to tell me about crime in RankinCounty but, our phone connection was bad we kept trying to call one another back.     I made a comment in 2008 that when we quit selling our novelty items we could no longer pay the phone bill at the store and missy and dennis went oh shit and ran in the next room. They also went oh shit after I said someone had to have said something to my husband because he did a 180 about his family. I knew they were recording our conversation because the recorder was right in front of me I just didnt think anything about it.     Right before we sold the store  We became friends with new neighbors. Ill tell you about them next.    They were in interracial couple. I became friends with the girl right away. She new about a doctor I turned in Brandon, when I did insurance from 2003 to 2006. She, Eva  made a few comments like all her friends trying to pull her down and about the resort being a toxic shock. and how most people are at a certain level, but not me. She gained my trust to the full extent. She even jumped in my face to see my reaction on trust.  Investigators due that for some reason. .The guy name was Prisco which became my husbands friend. We then found out after the fire how she used to strip and find jobs and he would stalk and find out everything there is to know about business owners then rob them blind and people wouldt get there money back.  He said he did 2 years in prison for that, the girl got away with it. After we sold the store I paid my car off. And my husband and I got into a fight. All tell you about that later.     I decided to open a Thrift store. It was in Nov. of 2008. I was opened about a month when I had a store fire. It opened up a can of warms from the past that we had. I did not have insurance yet because I was high balled and I thought I could get through the Christmas holiday. This is where it gets sticky. The door was broke locked. The owner had just fixed it half way because the lock smith had to order a new part. The next day on thanksgiving I had a fire. The building was not up to code. The owner of the building followed me around the store and said remember what you said about being haunted, (I was getting a lot of dead people stuff in the stuff. It was a consignment shop.)  I also just caught 3 kids stealing and I made a report on that  3 days before the fire. Anyway I went into shock. I felt I was in danger. I went back and tried to remember what people were saying right before the fire.. My husband made a comment about a double agent and said oh good they made it. That was odd. Because I got my insurance  license  twice. There was a guy I have a clear picture of him. He said dont obsess with this. I didnt know what he meant I just kept talking, I was busy. There was also 2 women that came in and said the store stunk like rotten eggs. I did hear beeps in the store once before the fire and once after the fire like it was being recorded. It then took 5 days to clean out the store. They then sent me home with all the ashes my 20,000 investment wasn/t worth anything. I feeling guilty because I didnt have insurance.  The owner of the building Gerome Taylor started to rebuild the building. he had insurance.    When my husband and I approached him about all my money I put down. I wanted some off my money back I was paid up in advance. He didnt want to give me my money back. So he offered 6 months free rent if I want to come back and reopen. I took it because I was concerned about the 47 consignors I had there stuff. I didnt realize it was his faulty building at the time I was in shock and feeling bad. He took advantage of me to. He is a crook. 2 and a half months later when I opened back up he started sending goons in. comments were made like theres the girl who burnt down the store, another was in a threatening manner your lucky to start back. It wasnt my fault at all I was the victim and they turned it around on me. I started feeling sorry for myself and it affected the way I ran the store in the coming months.     One night I heard people in my car, The door was dinging they were trying to muffle the sound. I also heard someone cough so I cough backed. I didnt tell my husband because I was already upset with him. And I trusted the new neighbors. I was talking about the sensors going out in it, The next day prisco thats one of the new neighbors, made a comment about his fuses in his car. I then found eva  jacket in the backseat of my car a couple of days later. They played with the electronics in our home. The phone was tapped, computer, static  electricity ,surround sound, broad casting , repeated back private conversations back from 2007.  they would even flash my bathroom lights on and off. I dont understand, I was slapped in the face every time I turned around when. I heard they have voice recording, you could tell most of the time the clicks on the phone, what they said!     This is where it gets spooky.  When I went home and did some soul searching. I was looking up at the sky I was tricked and I knew I was tricked because the same thing happened before when that gang got busted. 5 months before. I had a satellite  blind me in the eye.   Eva (my neighbor) made a comment about that to.  How she went into a tunnel, it just didnt make since she was talking about someone putting a mickeys into her drink to. She even stated she was hear for realhablitation This girl eva  taylor and prisco lee had something to do with this. It was the comments that they would make. I had a computer virus and didnt realize it until they described it.. Bioterrosim, They said they had one to. Prisco Lee as soon as he found out about that INS picked him up and shipped him to panama. Which I dont believe for one minute. It was his face expression that gave it away. Eva said she caught a big fish and she had to let it go. When they pushed me so hard to my Christian believes she said this is the mother ship. Then later said they caught the duck.    After Prisco got deported Eva started acting like a cop. She would flip open her phone and say did you get that, Said I was A virgin to crime and I was going with them, said she wasnt sure about my husband.   I was finally fed up with everything. My husband was leaving me so when I closed the store, eva was mad because of the botched situation. She then slept with my husband. I know it was all a set up. They didnt make sense she made other comments that were private between my husband and me she was spying with help. My husband and I were both victims. There was  star wars, planes, ufos,  and stars, crime, drugs, CIA, FBI, COPS, lightening, and numbers ,plus the broadcasting on the radio I was thrown into shock with a little short term memory. Their was beeps that came through the wall. They even zapped my ear with an electronic voice. So much weird stuff happened. Their was also wierd license plates like spy etc I was looking people up that was looking us up on line. My computer was tapped the things I saw. What happened/  every where I went people had a tear in there eyes and they would make comments like they knew our personal business. A conversation from aug 2008 was reapeated back to me, after I had the fire. Then someone said be careful what I say everything is being recorded. My husband called me crazy so I quit talking to him. There is a 1964 privacy act, My civil rights have been violated and I was also disciminated against because I am a women.   It has been a year and a half. I have tried to find justice on this situation. I know we were robbed and people were by standers. They new or were hired to rob us blind. This whole thing went way beyond when my husband couldnt take anymore. I believe they robbed us, played us apart, and changed our lives. All I want back is my money. And prisco said after he would rob them they would never get there money back. I feel like my civil rights were violated and I was discriminated against. Every time I complained I was slapped in the face. The things I saw I should not have seen them and we shouldnt have been tricked. All people had to do was ask what happened they never did,  I got beat up by people I loved all the way around.  I have not found one person to help me get my money back or tell me what happened when I know they know. Because of the electronic ease dropping.    My husband and I  are back together now. I still feel like he knew some stuff and just didnt tell me.  I we knew the truth and put people that harmed us in jail.  I couldnt find an attorney because I didnt have the money.

What would you do if you know you were coned , what would you do if every thing you said was being recorded, what would you do if you losted all your money because of con artist.   ",  Attorneys General

[continued below]....
									
										..... They keep restructuring their companies; bankrupting subsidiary ones to avoid payment to agents and others.  I am assuming their is some serious tax fraud going on, because he is only claiming to have taken 600 dollars per my employment agreement with the company from my transaction.  Also an agent that I spoke to, said she was owed 6,000 dollars,  was never paid the money and then the company sent her a 1099 for taxes on money she never received! Statements from the title company, ""Security Title,"" show that he has cashed my 24,900 check on May 6th. The company that debited my account upon joining was Century 21 Premier, but I thought I was a Ist USA agent.  I have called both my broker and the owner everyday since May 5th, and have had NO response, nor have I been paid.  I personally went into 1st USA on May 14th and confronted the broker, Ray, and the owner, Brayn.  They assured me that they would pay me the commission the upcoming Monday.  Monday I called first thing in the morning and Bryan disclosed to me he did not have my money and that he could give me a 2,000 dollar cashier's check.  He also divulged that they had spent the money on their own needs, rent, utilities and paying other agents.  I laughed and said ""Bryan what have you gotten yourself into?"".  He responded, ""This is how we do it here."" Nothing in my employment agreement with this company has any clauses about payment in this fashion.  I am a second generation realtor myself and have had 5 years of experience, my father is a retired broker with 35 years in the business.  The company, ""1st USA Realty"", lures agents in with low monthly dues and then steals their commission checks to make ends meet.  I have called over 25 agents so far and they ALL report not getting money, some have settled out of court, others are taking payments.  There are so many loop holes in this system.  They filed bankruptcy on Friday the 21st.  Bryan text me to talk to his lawyer and gave me the case number.  I have contacted several lawyers of which I can not afford, in order to put a lean on their houses or vehicles, start a class action, or stop this Fraud!  This family is putting many others in a place of hardship in order to keep living their lifestyles.  I called a real estate lawyer that could not represent me because there was a conflict of interest.  He has represented the shady broker in the past.  He was very nice and sympathetic of my situation.  He told me they take commission checks betting the agent will feel defeated and walk away from the situation.  I was in shock.I'm in the military and need this money to finish my last year of college at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.  I'm working on a pilot career, but need this money to finish my goals.  I just came off of orders in March of this year, I was gone for six months prior.  He basically stole all of my money for school.

 Walt Disney World Co. ,"  Walt Disney World Co.  500 S. Buena Vista Street 
Burbank, California United States of America ", , ,"Walt Disney World Co.  Facts and numbers to support what may be the the potential for permanet injury from a Disney product  Burbank, California","   Your State has conducted many previous consumer protection lawsuits that do not have the potential to affect as many adults or children as this issue, and after all the information and evidence I have made available to these officials, including information proving their jurisdiction extends to these certain products, they still will not take action until they receive enough official complaints from their own citizens, and for this reason I am contacting every person who may care about children.   Any person can file a complaint over coming to the understanding of a potential safety issue, and there is no requirement that you to have ever used these certain type products or have been injured personally by them. For persons who have used these certain products, only a few more questions need to be answered.   Facts and numbers to support what may be the potential for permanent injury of damage to gum tissue, resulting in one of the most intense forms of pain people are forced to endure of exposed nerves in teeth.   The companys who distribute these products have included pressure sensors to other similar power toothbrushes to protect this soft tissue.   This safety issue becomes clear after understanding the median speed (7,600 motions per minute) and operating action (spinning-rotating) of these certain types of power toothbrushes without pressure sensors.   When used on the top teeth  of this operating action will be spinning/pushing back and away where the soft gum tissue tapers down to a very thin layer to meet the teeth, with  of these motions spinning/pushing back and away at the thin layer of gum tissue on the bottom set of teeth   If these spinning-rotating toothbrushes are used 2 times daily for a total of 4 minutes it will be the equivalent of using your hand and arm, with a manual toothbrush, a total of 30,400 motions per day. 4 (minutes) x 7,600 (motions per minute) = 30,400   30 (days use) x 30,400 (motions per day) = 912,000    Over 6 months (180 days use) x 30,400 (motions per day) = FIVE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND motions spinning/pushing back and away where the  soft gun tissue tapers down to a very thin layer to meet the teeth.    Dental professionals have verified that it only takes a small amount of this thin soft layer of gum tissue to be spun/pushed back to expose nerves, and once this damage is done it is permanent with no feasible way to correct or reverse it.    I do not know how many motions per minute the average child is capable of using a non motorized toothbrush in 4 minutes usage per day, but I do not ever recall being taught to brush my teeth in an upward motion on the top set or a downward motion on the bottom set of teeth either by my parents or in school, and this is what is happening when you have no control over this certain type of spinning/rotating operating action. Other types of power toothbrushes operate in vibrating/pulsating motions that would not spin/push back this thin layer of gum tissue.       Examples of power toothbrushes used mostly by adults and teenagers- Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Oscillating-Rotating Technology Built-In Pressure Sensor 8,800 Oscillations per Minute.   Examples of power toothbrushes mostly used by children - Crest Kids SpinBrush - Product Details:  Power Toothbrush Uses Spinning head, multi-level bristles. All SpinBrush for Kid brushes come with smaller brush heads for smaller mouths. Each unique design combines stationary bristles with high-speed oscillating bristles Research shows that children tend to brush longer by 38.3%, when using the SpinBrush relative to manual toothbrushes and they come in fun shapes for kids, like Disney Princess and Spider-Man to name a few.  (No pressure sensor)    The Federal departments of the USCPSC, FDA and FTC have been given information and evidence without taking any action. These issues can be resolved by a jury of citizens from your State who will be able to determine the deceptive business practices of these businesses of concealing they realize this damage may happen to the soft gum tissue by  having designed pressure sensors in other similar types of power toothbrushes to protect the soft gum tissue.   I have included all the information needed, that you may use to fill out and file this complaint below. You can copy and paste this in the Comment or Question message space, or use your own or comments     This online complaint can be found at http://ag.ca.gov/  click on PROTECTING CONSUMERS link click Consumer info/Complaints to the COMPLAINT FORM page then click  Consumer Complaint Against Business/Company for online form.   Comment / Complaint Form   Consumer Complaint Against a Business/ Company    Business information (Complaint Against) :   Company name: Walt Disney   Company Address: 500 S. Buena Vista Street   Company City: Burbank   Company State: CA    Company Zip Code 91521-6719   Company Phone Number N/A     Comment or Question  Message:    (You may copy and paste this in the space below, and add any additional comments)      After becoming aware of the high speed and certain operating action of spinning/rotating types of power toothbrushes I understand the potential, with extended use, of how these spinning/rotating nylon bristles may spin/push back and away where the soft gun tissue tapers down to a very thin layer to meet the teeth when contacting this soft gum tissue during the process of brushing teeth. This complaint is only directed to the certain types of power toothbrushes that operate in a spinning/rotating manner and do not have the additional features of pressure sensors.   As the Disney company, along with the federal departments of the USCPSC, FDA, and FTC has been given evidence and information regarding these certain type of products potential for injury and have not taken any action, I am requesting the State of California file a Consumer Protection suit so a jury of citizens will be able to determine any deceptive business practices or potential for injury from extended use of these certain types of power toothbrushes.     Evidence that fully merits a consumer protection lawsuit over deceptive business practices is the fact that these companies install safety devices in other similar power toothbrushes such as pressure sensors to protect the soft gum tissue, proving they are aware of the potential for damage to the gum tissue.   Further evidence is no additional warnings are included on the packaging of models that do not have pressure sensors to protect the soft gum tissue, stating that extended contact of the spinning/rotating nylon bristles, where the soft gum tissue tapers down to a very thin layer to meet the teeth, could result in damaging this tissue. If this warning was included it would inform people of this products potential for damage and result in far less profits for these companies, as fewer parents would purchase these certain type tooth brushes for their children to use.   I recommend that the State hire an outside law firm to conduct this suit on contingency, as was done in the State of Alaskas Consumer Protection Lawsuit against Eli Lilly and the prescription drug Zyprexa, so it will involve few state resources, and cost the taxpayers nothing to resolve these issues.

										..... Property value dropping but him in his wife with coldwell banker(memorialdrive) all involved in strawbuying. Appraiser on the run. A Houston Grand Jury handed down indictments on eight individuals for a series of mortgage fraud scams in the Houston, Texas area, involving close to 300 properties valued at approximately $40 million.Most of the fraudulent transactions involved finding a straw buyer with a high credit score, and persuading that person to purchase one or more properties. The perpetrators would obtain a phony appraisal that was significantly inflated.  Because of the buyers favorable credit score, their loan would be approved with minimal scrutiny by the lending institution. Once the sale went through, the scam artist would pocket the difference between the selling price and the inflated loan amount by charging consulting fees, remodeling fees, or other service charges that would be disbursed at the closing by the escrow officer. The unsuspecting buyer would then be stuck with a mortgage that was much higher than the true value of the property. In many cases the buyer was promised that the property would be leased and the mortgage payments would be made, only to find that the property was left unoccupied and the buyer?s credit damaged by nonpayment.rod kelley wife liz kelley are involved in strawbuying in houston.

And a jar of ""Sturgeon caviar"" was, in fact, Mississippi paddlefish.Some honey makers dilute their honey with sugar beets or corn syrup, their competitors say, but still market it as 100 percent pure at a premium price.And last year, a Fairfax man was convicted of selling 10 million pounds of cheap, frozen catfish fillets from Vietnam as much more expensive grouper, red snapper and flounder. The fish was bought by national chain retailers, wholesalers and food service companies, and ended up on dinner plates across the country.""Food fraud"" has been documented in fruit juice, olive oil, spices, vinegar, wine, spirits and maple syrup, and appears to pose a significant problem in the seafood industry. Victims range from the shopper at the local supermarket to multimillion companies, including E&J Gallo and Heinz USA.Such deception has been happening since Roman times, but it is getting new attention as more products are imported and a tight economy heightens competition. And the U.S. food industry says federal regulators are not doing enough to combat it.""It's growing very rapidly, and there's more of it than you might think,"" said James Morehouse, a senior partner at A.T. Kearney Inc., which is studying the issue for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents the food and beverage industry..John Spink, an expert on food and packaging fraud at Michigan State University, estimates that 5 to 7 percent of the U.S. food supply is affected but acknowledges the number could be greater. ""We know what we seized at the border, but we have no idea what we didn't seize,"" he said.The job of ensuring that food is accurately labeled largely rests with the Food and Drug Administration. But it has been overwhelmed in trying to prevent food contamination, and fraud has remained on a back burner. The recent development of high-tech tools -- including DNA testing -- has made it easier to detect fraud that might have gone unnoticed a decade ago. DNA can be extracted from cells of fish and meat and from other foods, such as rice and even coffee. Technicians then identify the species by comparing the DNA to a database of samples.Another tool, isotope ratio analysis, can determine subtle differences between food -- whether a fish was farmed or wild, for example, or whether caviar came from Finland or a U.S. stream.The techniques have become so accessible that two New York City high school students, working with scientists at the Rockefeller University and the American Museum of Natural History last year, discovered after analyzing DNA in 11 of 66 foods -- including the sheep's milk cheese and caviar -- bought randomly at markets in Manhattan were mislabeled.""We put so much emphasis on food and purity of ingredients and where they come from,"" said Mark Stoeckle, a physician and DNA expert at Rockefeller University who advised the students. ""But then there are things selling that are not what they say on the label. There's an important issue here in terms of economics and consumer safety.""..Business JobsComputer JobsConstruction JobsEducation JobsEngineering JobsHealthcare JobsLegal JobsManagement JobsMedia JobsNon-Profit JobsSales JobsScience JobsFind Your Dream Job Now!GoJobs by SimplyHiredFEATURED ADVERTISER LINKSLawsuit: Cochlear Implants, Toyota, Yaz Gallbladder,Fracking, HydroxycutErin Brockovich, Mesothelioma, Asbestos & Vets, Lung Cancer, BoilersRoll over your old 401(k)s to Fidelity Investments.Get peace of mind now with Equifax ID Patrol.Russia Now: In-Depth Coverage of Russia News, Business, and More.Double Your Vanguard Profits with the Best Funds to Own NowNEWS | POLITICS | OPINIONS | BUSINESS |LOCAL | SPORTS | ARTS & LIVING | GOING OUT GUIDEJOBS | CARS | REAL ESTATE | RENTALS | CLASSIFIEDS
