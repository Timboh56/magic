New Twitter Follower Strategy

Inputs:
	- root handles to target followers/followings
	- desired locations by lat long coordinates
	- desired radius of location coordinates
	- desired keywords (optional)

Identify root nodes
	- handles with followers within interest
1. Follow following of root nodes
	- Identify high quality followers

2. Follow followers of root nodes
	- Identify high quality followers

High Quality Followers
	- followers are ranked by
		- Proximity to desired location (+0 to +3 points)
		- presence of keyword (+5 points)
		- follower count (+0 to +3 points)
		- last tweet date (+0 to +3 points)
	Handle
		FIELDS
			- screen_name
			- following_back?
			- follower_count
			- following_count
			- location
				-> geocode to lat lng, compare with desired locations + radius
					 to determine location score
			- last tweet date ?
	
Assumption: The higher the score, the more valuable their followers
	- handle's followers likelier to convert with higher score
	- can we test this? Machine learning
		- high score => conversion rate?
			- identify ideal score of each score parameter (proximity, presence, follower count, last tweet date)
		- Recurse, feed algorithm the ideal parameters to look for

Full Algorithm
	inputs (handle, proximity, keywords, follower_count, last_tweet_date)
		for each input
			generate score of handle based off inputs
			increment input score to Handle's total score
	GIVE HANDLE 1 DAY TO FOLLOW BACK
		- check status of follow_back
		- feed to machine learning algorithm

	In Summary..
		Weights: 
			handle_score = preemptive_score(proximity, keywords, follower_count, last_tweet_date) + result_score(follow_back?) (+5 if yes, -5 no) 

	Definitions
		Preemptive score: Score given to a handle before handle given time to follow back.
			- consists of proximity, keywords, follower count and last tweet date.
		
		Result score: Score dependent on whether the handle followed subject back
			- Strong indicator of efficacy of input preemptive score paramters.

	Goal is to identify parameters that lead to highest conversion rate, and use parameters to determine who to follow.

	USE K CLUSTER MEANS TO IDENTIFY MEANS OF HANDLE PARAMS
